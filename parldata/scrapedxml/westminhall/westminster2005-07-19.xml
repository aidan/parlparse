<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.365.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" speakername="Frank Field" colnum="365"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h01.htm#50719h01_spnew0">
	<p pid=".365.3/1">May I first say how pleased I am that we are having this debate today? I shall give a history of the reasons for it. I wrote to Mr. Speaker to ask for a debate on dying, as did my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase>&mdash;I shall happily call her my hon. Friend today; no doubt we shall both say in our own way why we wanted the debate. It is significant, however, that the title of the debate that appeared on the Order Paper was &quot;End-of-life Care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/2">One of the main points that I shall make is that dying has largely been taken away from us and from society, and has been privatised and hidden away. That is a huge loss for us. In the past, most of us would have lived in families in which we experienced other family members dying, and we would have learnt from that dying. In helping those individuals, we would have learnt some of the great truths about living. If there is one idea that I want to advance, it is that we should view life as a great play&mdash;but that we have now got ourselves into a habit of mind whereby most of us leave the theatre before the last act. That being so, it is very difficult for most of us to make sense of why we are here, and what our purpose is.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/3">As I said, the request was for a debate on dying&mdash;a subject that I hope we shall easily be able to include under the title &quot;End-of-life Care&quot;. The request was made because my hon. Friend and I want there to be greater public recognition that dying is one of the most crucial parts of our lives. That simple fact needs to be recognised and given the place in our lives that it warrants. I hope that the debate, with hon. Members of very different views and backgrounds contributing, will challenge the view that dying is a private event that most people negotiate alone. It will be a debate that questions why most people die alone. I suggest that it is out of embarrassment and more that most of us shy away from this simple but crucial event in all our lives.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/4">The Minister will be relieved to know that I am not asking for any major Government initiatives on this subject. It is not that sort of debate, and it is not that sort of issue. There is, of course, a role for Government. That official role is to help us to see the extent to which our full humanity is often and mysteriously completed in the process of dying.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/5">Why have this debate at this time? For me, the first and perhaps most important reason is that my own mother died a few weeks ago. I was struck by how unprepared I was for that event, but also by how well prepared she was. Looking back on it, I am appalled at how much she needed to teach those of us around her about the process that was going on, and what she wanted from the process of dying.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/6">The debate was also initiated because of the work of a constituent of my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden&mdash;James Woodward, the priest warden of the Foundation of Lady Katherine Leveson. Part of the debate is about not only the celebration of dying itself, but the fact that there can be a centre of such excellence, which is trying to help us to address this key question. James Woodward recently published a book entitled &quot;Befriending Death&quot;. In other words, although it is the natural response of many of us, we should not be frightened of death but should regard the process as a friend, and a crucial part of our lives.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/7">It is appropriate that we are having this debate now, because in the last week we have heard of the death of Dame Cicely Saunders, who did so much to transform the care of people who are dying and to deal with, and wherever possible eradicate or minimise, their pain. She thought, as her foundation continues to teach, that there is also a spiritual side to our nature that needs to be recognised in the process of dying. The spiritual side does not have to be attached to any religion. People can be highly spiritual and have no formal religion&mdash;and as we know, there are also those who are highly religious yet still manage to disguise any spiritual side of their nature, whether they are living their lives fully or in the process of dying.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/8">James Woodward's book is, in its own unique way, a response to a best-selling Consumers Association pamphlet published 40 years ago, &quot;What to do when someone dies&quot;. Forty years later, the book asks an even more pertinent question: what do we do before someone dies? In posing that question, I do not suggest that we do not need to be prepared when somebody dies, but I am trying to get back into the public debate the fact that the process of dying is the last great act of the individual play that each of us has to enact in this world. While I draw a great deal on James Woodward's work, I also draw on the work of Dr. Anne Richards, a member of the Archbishop's Council team who has written profoundly on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/9">Let me suggest five reasons why some of us find dying such an uncomfortable issue to deal with. The first, and most obvious, is that we live in what has been called a death-denying society. Most of us gear our lives to the future: we plan what we are going to do at the end of our Session&mdash;where we will go, what holidays we will take, what is happening in our constituencies and what we will do with our families. The crucial point about dying is that we have to give up thinking about the future, and take on a different frame of mind. The first reason why dying is such a difficult topic for us is that it strikes at the basis of the society that we enjoy being part of but which, because it is so death-denying, is a significantly impoverishing society.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/10">The second reason is that the process of dying is immensely important, and each of us needs to learn how we are going to do it. For most of our lives, we do not question how our bodies live. We take that for granted until we come to the final stage, at which we somehow deny that our bodies have a right to do their dying in their own way. The second challenge, therefore, relates to the process of how we die and how we surrender to our bodies, to allow them to continue doing the work for which they were created.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/11">The third challenge to our death-denying culture is that our society is very bound up with the body beautiful. Practically every advertisement for the things that people think we need to lead happy lives would lead one to think that everyone in our society was aged between 15 and 25, and possessed remarkable beauty. The body-beautiful culture is reinforced by the status that we have surrendered to celebrities, or built up around them, in our everyday lives. The debate is about the fact that it is all too easy to overlook the way in which we indwell in our bodies, and that our bodies have a right to die in the way that they wish, rather than in the way that other people might find convenient.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/12">The fourth challenge that a debate on dying poses to our common culture is that it is a full frontal attack on the view that we are not proper people unless we are in control of everything in our lives, including the people who make our lives worth while. Each of us has to face the crucial fact&mdash;indeed, some of us are facing it now&mdash;that our bodies grow old and change, often in ways that we cannot control. Again, however, there is individual and collective denial of the whole process of living and indwelling in our individual bodies. Our bodies therefore behave in a way that offends our modern view of how we and the society around us should operate.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/13">The fifth challenge is to our abhorrence of the possibility that our frail bodies, which our modern culture somehow despises, should become the final arbiters of the relationship that we have had, and will have, with what is known as the process of our own lives.</p>
	<p pid=".365.3/14">The debate is about those fundamental challenges. I hope that others will talk about the palliative care that we rightly offer to people who are dying, because we too might live out our last moments on this earth in such circumstances. I do not want to minimise the importance of that issue in any way, but I am trying to draw the debate slightly wider. Given your background, Mr. Marshall, you will have recognised from the beginning that this debate challenges the growing voice in favour of euthanasia. The euthanasia lobby is now much more slick at presenting its arguments, but the debate is a challenge to members of that lobby, because from their angle, the idea is that we should be able to control the final parts of our lives and decide when they will be completed. I question whether we should have that view of control, and, indeed, whether we should have a right to have such control.</p>

	<p pid=".370.0/1">I begin by paying tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>, whose commitment in the House to the needs of the elderly has been unparalleled, in my experience. It was my right hon. Friend's idea to hold this debate, and when he first approached me about securing it I felt honoured to be asked. As far as I know, it is unprecedented for a Conservative Front Bencher and a Labour Back Bencher to secure a debate jointly. The nature of the subject warrants a cross-party approach, and I hope that that will help to improve the quality of today's debate.</p>
	<p pid=".370.0/2">My right hon. Friend approached me specifically because, as he said, the Foundation of Lady Katherine Leveson for the study of ageing, spirituality and social policy is at a place called at Temple Balsall in my constituency. If hon. Members ever have the time, when travelling north from London and passing through the very middle of England, they should visit that remarkable foundation. It was built by the Knights Templar in the 12th century, and makes a significant contribution to the care of the elderly. Interestingly, it is also integrated with a primary school, so at times the elderly are brought together with the very young to share their experiences. That in itself is remarkable.</p>
	<p pid=".370.0/3">As my right hon. Friend said, the centre is run by the Rev. James Woodward. It was his experience as a chaplain at the Queen Elizabeth medical centre in Birmingham that first galvanised him into writing, and then into directing a centre for the study of ageing and death and how we cope with it. I do not know whether he coined the phrase a &quot;death-denying society&quot;, but that is a fact of modern life.</p>
	<p pid=".370.0/4">As a mother, I am very aware that because infant mortality has declined, there is less awareness of death among children. It therefore comes as a rude shock to young mothers when things do go wrong in pregnancy and childbirth, as they sometimes do. Such things are not talked about in our society. These days, people do not tend to wear black after losing a member of their family. In times gone by, such habits were a way of helping society come to terms with the reality of death. These days we hide it away, which makes it much harder for those who are dying and for their loved ones.</p>
	<p pid=".370.0/5">I add my recommendation to that of my right hon. Friend for the book &quot;Befriending Death&quot;, which I have read cover to cover. It is a useful book if one has friends or family in that position, and it is not a heavy read at all. Some hon. Members might have felt nervous about attending this debate, which could be seen as being on the heavy side, but in a way death is a celebration of life. That is the important point about trying to bring the positives out of it, which is a strong feature of the book.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.371.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" speakername="Caroline Spelman" colnum="371"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h01.htm#50719h01_spnew10">
	<p pid=".371.1/1">I assure you that we are not advertising the book, Mr. Marshall&mdash;but in general we do not talk about dying because it is not something that people like to discuss, which makes it very difficult when death comes to a person, or to a member of their family, and there is a need to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/2">The debate was applied for last week, but today is a most timely moment to hold it, because it has now also become a tribute to the work of Dame Cicely Saunders, the founder of the modern hospice movement, who passed away last week. Her story is very interesting: she trained as a nurse, became an almoner and then a medical secretary, then went on to become a doctor, before opening a hospice. That remarkable application to learning all the requisite skills for the care of others is to be commended.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/3">Dame Cicely set out to cater for cancer patients in particular, after the Marie Curie Foundation identified a gap in NHS provision for their needs, as long ago as 1952. She advocated an approach to pain relief demonstrating that intermittent reactive sedation was far less effective than achieving a steady state in which the dying patient could still maintain consciousness and enjoy some quality of life. That was revolutionary at the time, but is now well accepted.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/4">It is interesting that for herself, Dame Cicely Saunders preferred the idea of a death that had some forewarning, giving her time to reflect on life and put practical and spiritual affairs in order. For someone who saw many people depart this life it was an interesting conclusion to draw, and it is in that respect that her life has been taken up and pursued by the Leveson centre in my constituency, which is constantly considering how palliative care can be improved and the quality of life in our last days made better.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/5">I expect that all those present have some direct personal experience of losing a loved one. We are lucky if in the natural order of things our first experience is to lose someone who has led a full life&mdash;perhaps a grandparent who has reached the proverbial fourscore years and 10. But for others the experience may come much earlier and unexpectedly in the tragic loss of young life, which leaves us smarting at the perceived injustice. Sadly, because of what happened on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July</phrase> many families are experiencing great pain now, and will do so in the weeks and months to come. When I went to sign the book of condolence in Embankment gardens and saw the flowers I was struck by how many young women had lost their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/6">When someone close passes away, one starts on a journey of grief, which feels strange the first time round, with shock and numbness followed by anger and great sadness, finally giving way to acceptance in most cases. However, for some people that journey never progresses to the healthy outcome of acceptance. We need to do more about helping grieving relatives to understand that process. Odd though it may sound, a successful grieving process is a rite of passage, and when it comes around again, as it usually does, we can recognise the stages in ourselves&mdash;but the lack of preparedness the first time is hard for everyone.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/7">Both my parents passed away some time ago in hospital, and that made me acutely aware of the difference that health personnel can make. It was a shock to discover on my mother's notes the dreaded words, &quot;Not for resuscitation&quot;, without any discussion having taken place with a member of the family. It might have been the right course of action, but it was the wrong way to help those who are affected. If one has never seen someone dying, it is a shock. It was only hearing about my sister's nursing experience by telephone afterwards that made any sense of it all to me.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/8">With my father things were different. I was there at the end, supported by a nurse who explained what was happening and who kindly confirmed when the moment had come, because it can be hard to know. In both cases, however, the hospital setting provided only the barest scrap of dignity, and the drawn curtains were no shield against the routine noises of life on the ward. That led me to feel that we could surely do better. Death is such a monumental experience for most relatives that the environment in which it happens has a considerable effect.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/9">Some 64 per cent. of hospital patients express a wish to go home to die, but only 25 per cent. achieve that. Once people are in the system, the health service seems reluctant to let them go. Many people fear going into hospital precisely because they worry that they might never get home again. A particular ward in my local hospital suffers from the connotation that it is a place from which people may not emerge again. We need a better solution to such problems.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/10">The hospice movement is still stretched, and is dependent on the good will of voluntary donors. Of the &pound;450 million spent annually on hospice and specialist care services in England, the NHS contributes only 35 per cent., while the value of the work undertaken by volunteers in hospices is estimated at &pound;100 million. We must bear in mind the fact that the dedicated work of the hospice movement covers a multitude of jobs. While 30,000 people die in hospices each year, there are 41,000 new admissions and 110,000 new patients, who are seen by palliative care home care nurses. The care that they provide gives the patient options at a limiting time of life.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/11">In their manifesto, the Government promised to double funding for palliative care in England, yet we do not have published figures for what they spend on it now, so it is difficult to know how much extra funding will be available. I am sure that the Minister will be able to pick that point up when she responds.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/12">We do know, however, that current NHS expenditure includes contributions to adult hospices, adult community palliative care services, children's palliative care services and general palliative care services. None the less, the Health Committee report noted that there are still gross deficiencies in palliative care provision in the UK. The National Audit Office reports that half of all hospital patients experience moderate to severe pain, with only a quarter of them feeling that hospital staff did all they could to relieve it.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/13">Care can vary even from ward to ward within a hospital. There are inequalities in provision around the country. The need and demand for provision is not uniform, so a one-size-fits-all approach to palliative care will not work. For example, northern cancer networks need 60 per cent. more service provision than Thames Valley. Out-of-hours provision, too, is distinctly patchy.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/14">Questions marks over the security of funding mean that there are difficulties with the availability of palliative care. Funding for palliative care in cancer networks is ring-fenced until 2006&ndash;07, but the ring-fencing will then be removed, and there is a danger that the funds will be used to meet primary care trusts' financial deficits. Careful thought needs to be given to that possibility.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/15">There is an excellent hospice called Warren Pearl in my constituency, run by the Marie Curie Foundation, but it is located in Solihull. For constituents who live on the Chelmsley Wood estate, which is well to the north of Solihull, getting to the hospice involves a difficult journey by public transport. Culturally, Solihull is not the town towards which they are orientated. There is, therefore, still a difficulty with localised provision of palliative care.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/16">That highlights some of the severe inequalities experienced across England, particularly found from one PCT to another. When I last visited St. Mary's hospice in Birmingham&mdash;it is, of course, much larger because it serves a much larger city&mdash;I was disturbed to find that we do not have a pain consultant in the whole west midlands region, although it has the same population as Denmark. That is simply because Birmingham is not a designated centre of excellence for pain consultants.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/17">That may partly explain the long delays that my constituents experience in waiting for a referral to a pain consultant. A recent answer to a parliamentary question states that almost 1,000 patients have not yet been seen after 13 to 17 weeks of waiting for a referral to a pain consultant. More than four months is a long time for a cancer patient to wait for such essential help. Furthermore, the Association for Palliative Medicine is concerned that only a quarter of the number of consultants needed to fill the places are enrolled in the four-year training.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/18">From that, I conclude that as a nation we do not do death very well. That could be one reason why there is such a rise in interest in euthanasia and living wills. I urge the Government to consider the issues that my right hon. Friend and I have raised about the need to engage with the quality of death, which is a problem in our country. Chronic conditions and pain relief tend not to be the subject of Government performance targets, with the result that they slip down the agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/19">It is not easy to live in this death-denying society. People find death difficult to talk about, and are not sure what to say to the bereaved. The Government could do more to help both those whose lives are ending and those who must live on with the memory.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.374.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" speakername="Peter Bottomley" colnum="374"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h01.htm#50719h01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".374.0/1">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> both on the idea of having this debate and on introducing it together with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase>. I hope that he is right to say that the debate will go wider than just the issues of euthanasia and death on request.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/2">As it happens, last night I was at a dinner where the person introducing the speaker collapsed and fell flat on the ground. He did not die; the electricity for his pacemaker had stopped working, and afterwards he got back on his chair and carried on with the rest of the evening. However, it was an amazing example of what could be seen as a sudden small death&mdash;although he has now come back to life&mdash;and it is the second time that I have seen that happen. It is an aspect of death or near death that makes us realise how our bodies work, and sometimes do not work.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/3">Normally when discussing such issues, people are talking about the elderly and those who have some understanding that their life is coming to an end, but it is not always like that. One of the most useful things that I have heard was from a mother&mdash;I forget whether her child was three or 13 years old&mdash;who said when the child died, &quot;I have to look on it as a life completed.&quot; Death is as natural as life, and when bodily death comes it is a life completed. It sometimes happens in circumstances that are mucky, unpleasant and awful&mdash;but then birth can be like that as well. We need to recognise that death is as natural as birth, and to be able to talk about that.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/4">My wife&mdash;my noble Friend&mdash;opened the first exhibition for the funeral service. She a patron of, or has some honorary title in, Cruse Bereavement Care, and she came away from the exhibition in Birmingham saying that we should all pay more attention to our deaths and funerals than to marriage. Not all of us will marry, but we will all die. All of us can die only once, while some of us marry more than once&mdash;I have not done so yet, but who knows what is in the future?</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/5">My wife has started talking about how people can prepare. For example, instead of waiting until someone dies, why do they not prepare a piece of plywood covered in pictures of life that can be easily screwed on to the side of a coffin? That would be a way of being open about death. My father-in-law always used to have his coffin stools ready, although in fact he died in Greece&mdash;by mistake, as it were&mdash;so they could not be used. What I am trying to say is that people can put in as much effort and time and, in a way, have as much fun in preparing for the events that go with death as they do in preparing for a wedding party. My wife also says that 100 years ago, people were very good at death but not very good at sex, and asks why, as it is now all hanging out, we do not tuck it back in again, zip it up and bring death back into the conversation in a more open way.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/6">My mother thought that it would be sad to miss the party after her funeral, whenever that came. She had no understanding that she might be close to death, but she saved up her old-age pension for a time to give the most marvellous party, and invited all the people whom she hoped would be there for the funeral. In fact, her experience was that after the benefit of a misdiagnosis, she died within three days of finding out that she was terminally ill. She had time to bring her children together, and while she was unconscious a senior member of my family&mdash;I hope that he will not mind my saying so&mdash;said, &quot;Virginia, you had better get out your dairy, because you are going to have to arrange the funeral.&quot; I hope that that sounds hearted rather than hard-hearted.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/7">In 1978 I went to San Salvador as part of a human rights delegation. As I remember it now, our aim was to try to delay the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero. I asked him how he felt about the likelihood that he was going to be assassinated. He said, &quot;Well, it has happened to some of my priests. Death comes, and I am going to get on with doing what I want to do before it comes.&quot; Tragically, and predictably, he was killed 18 months later, while celebrating mass in a hospital chapel. I went as part of the British representation to his funeral, representing the British Council of Churches, and at his funeral 14 more people died. They were crushed rather than shot, but when one sees 14 people laid out dead on a cathedral floor, who were alive an hour before, one begins to become rather more accepting of death. One does not accept the reason or the cause, but one accepts that death is a natural thing.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/8">The problem nowadays is that many people do not see a dead body until they are about 60, when one of their parents dies. I am not suggesting that people should just go and find the nearest dead person, but there is something to be said for children finding it perfectly natural to see a dead body in a casket. They will become less frightened of what is like to see someone who is dead. When I am dead, people who see me will see someone who is natural but lifeless. That is one of the points that my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead was trying to get across in saying that we should open the subject up.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/9">I do not want to spend much time on what I call the &quot;death on request&quot; debate, because that will continue. However, when people start arguing for that choice, I always remind them of the story that my right hon. Friend told us about Barbara Wootton. When I first heard it in the Chamber of the House of Commons, I thought to myself, &quot;That's something I shan't forget.&quot; Although people can draw various lessons from it, that story is one that we should bear in mind: decisions are not decisions until they are carried out. Advanced suggestions should not necessarily be taken as the last word in people's minds.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/10">I understand that in the Netherlands they started by saying, &quot;Let's allow an accelerated, deliberate death in rare cases,&quot; but I think that in the Netherlands now, more people are put to death&mdash;or rather, as I do not want to be pejorative about it, I should say meet their deaths&mdash;at their request, than commit suicide.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/11">It is not the rare hard cases that are in question; the practice is becoming close to what people call tidying up, or, I suspect, creating a pressure to say, &quot;I'm in the way; put me down&quot;&mdash;or rather, as I do not want to speak of people as if they were animals rather than human beings, &quot;End my life.&quot; That is why I shall not vote for death-on-request provisions. I am not an expert on when the ability to end one's own life shifts enough to become the ability to put someone else's life to an end, but if I am asked whether I believe that death on request should be made lawful, I answer no.</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/12">I would like to add one more point about palliative care, which I made to the Healthcare Commission at its meeting yesterday. The Government need to work out the level of funding that they expect to provide to the hospice movement, assuming that there is not some gross overprovision somewhere. No one wants great cathedrals of hospice care that are not properly used, but as for hospice care at home, day care and residential hospice care, it is time for the Government to move forward to the time when they can come to an agreement with the hospice movement about the level of funding that it can expect. Again, it is my wife&mdash;and noble Friend&mdash;who has taken an interest in such matters. The movement should be told, &quot;We value the voluntary contributions of time and dedication and we value the support and money that are given, but a basic level of state funding for hospices will be given in the three categories of hospice care at home, day care and residential hospice care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".374.0/13">There is a duty to make hospice care possible at the end of life, and to provide that kind of comfort&mdash;and, for that matter, to relieve the acute services. People might otherwise be in hospital, where they should not be if they are not going to be cured. When it is not possible to cure, it is possible to care, and people can be helped to cope.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.379.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="379"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h01.htm#50719h01_spnew15">
	<p pid=".379.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> on securing the debate, but I should say that when I prepared for it last night, I was not quite sure what it was going to be about. Would it be about palliative care? Would the thrust of the argument be about physician-assisted dying? The debate has been about more than that, which makes it difficult to answer&mdash;and it feels completely inappropriate to respond to it as the representative of a party, because every Member in this place will have a view on the subject. Some of my remarks will inevitably be personal, but I shall try to divorce them from what might or might not be the view of my party on any of these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/2">I have been presented with five challenges, and the thrust of the debate seems to be that control is a bad thing. Perhaps that was not intended, but that was certainly how the argument came across to me. I must pose the question: what is wrong with control? The logical extension of the argument against control is that we should not have control over the progress of an illness. Why should death be different? That is a wider debate, which society should have, but I must ask the question.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/3">I shall say a few words about palliative care before I get into the more philosophical aspects of the debate, because that subject has not be covered much today. It is most people's stated wish to die at home, in familiar surroundings with their family, but that presents a huge challenge to health and social care services&mdash;a point that was highlighted in the Health Committee report. I shall return to that subject in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/4">Hospices are often a preferred place to go, if people are lucky enough to have one in the area&mdash;access is often difficult&mdash;because they deal with death very well. The debate is often about palliative care and drugs so that someone does not suffer, but to repeat a point that was made earlier, we often do not deal very well with the emotional aspects of dying that affect the person and their family. That, however, is the hospices' strength.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/5">It is worth noting that hospices contribute about &pound;300 million to health care in England each year, and, as has already been mentioned, volunteers do work worth about &pound;100 million. There is, however, a huge gap in provision. Some 95 per cent. of people in hospices have cancer, but 300,000 people die annually of other diseases, and their end of life is probably not handled in such a considered manner. Not so much work is done to manage their deaths, and attention needs to be paid to that problem. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence, as it was then, examined palliative care, but made the mistake of concentrating almost exclusively on cancer. That was a missed opportunity. We must widen our focus.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/6">In their recent manifesto, the Government pledged to double their spending on palliative care, so it would be useful to know how much money is currently spent, how it is allocated, how much extra money will be available in the next few years, and how that will be phased in. It would also be useful to know whether the Government will ensure that hospices can recover some of their costs from primary care trusts if someone ends their days outside their area.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/7">We have not yet talked about the carers, to whom I pay tribute. We should acknowledge that the debate is not only about respite care. What hospices do so well is to deal with the emotional needs of the carers. That is neglected in other sectors, not through malice but because of other pressures and priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/8">The hon. Member for Meriden described death as an unknown. I agree. It is almost the last taboo&mdash;something we never talk about. She said that people did not wear black, and that various other changes had been made. Sadly, as I grow older I seem to attend more and more funerals, but I have noticed recently that they have increasingly become a celebration of life rather than an expression of misery and gloom. I have recently been to some positive and heart-warming funerals, which were more like rites of passage. It is a positive move if that attitude returns in the last days of life.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/9">We have limited experience of death. That is why we are strongly affected by the experiences that we have. However, the people whom we come across in their dying days can have different attitudes. I recall the contrast between two old gentlemen, one of whom was depressed and asking, &quot;When am I going to die?&quot;. The other one was positively looking forward to death. He had a faith, and was asking, &quot;When am I going to see Jesus?&quot;. He could not wait to get out of here. The difference that that attitude made to the people around was remarkable. There is a lot to be said for taking steps to prepare people with the idea that death might not be entirely negative.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/10">It is a sad fact that although nearly three quarters of people would prefer to go home to die than to die in hospital, only 25 per cent. achieve that. However, the situation also depends on the hospital. For instance, a small community hospital can deal with the problem well. Sadly, there are often moves to close such beds, in an attempt to encourage care at home, but unless that care is good, we could lose something fundamental. If the death takes place in a busy district general hospital, however, although attempts are made to provide a personal input, that is often difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/11">I suppose that what affected me most personally was the death of my father. All my assumptions about the end of life were completely turned around. My father was the person whom I mentioned earlier who wanted to die. In the end, death came quickly&mdash;more quickly than expected&mdash;and the family could not get there. I often think that it would have been nice if we could have been involved, because my father desperately wanted to end his days that way. However, I also question whether I would have wanted that. Again, this comes down to what the individual wants, in conjunction with what the family wants, but the individual wish must come first.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/12">I want briefly to mention assisted dying. Since 1977, Oregon has had the Death With Dignity Act, which allows a doctor to write a prescription for medication for a competent, terminally ill adult to self-administer, with the purpose of ending their life. There are strict safeguards. What I found fascinating&mdash;this relates to the story about Barbara Wootton&mdash;were the figures. Some 17 per cent. of terminally ill patients discussed hastening their death using the Act with their families, and 2 per cent. made a formal request to their doctors for assistance, but only 0.14 per cent. took the full step of using the prescription.</p>
	<p pid=".379.0/13">We must consider such options. It is our responsibility to have a wider and fuller debate in the House, and reflect on whether they could be considered. There appears to be no evidence that the law in Oregon has been misused. We talk about choice in other areas of life; perhaps we also need to talk about choice in death.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.381.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" speakername="Simon Burns" colnum="381"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h01.htm#50719h01_spnew16">
	<p pid=".381.0/1">I begin by offering my condolences to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase>. I also thank him for securing the debate and giving us the opportunity to discuss a deeply personal and emotional issue that also has a practical side&mdash;the care that should and must be provided for those in the last days, months and years of their lives.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/2">I must confess that I found the right hon. Gentleman's speech deeply moving and extremely thought-provoking. I am not qualified emotionally or from practical experience to enter that debate or to discuss some of the deep issues that he raised. I do not have the experience, through good fortune and probably because like many other people I have failed, or refused, to confront the issue. That is why I will read very carefully what the right hon. Gentleman said when <i>Hansard </i>is published tomorrow. It made me think and wonder a great deal about an issue that we must all confront and consider, rather than brush under the carpet.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/3">In many ways, caring for the dying is similar to caring for the elderly: we should ensure that the most appropriate and individual care is provided and that help is provided for family members and/or carers. Many people's immediate reaction is to reflect on the tremendous work of the hospice movement and to see the hospice as the bedrock of support for members of their families who may be suffering from terminal illness. Most of us, I suspect, are fortunate enough to have hospices in or near our constituencies that provide that help for adults.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/4">It goes without saying that hospices do a fantastic job, supported by the whole community through fundraising and other assistance. This Government, and previous Governments, have introduced a level of funding that covers a significant proportion of the day-to-day running costs. However, two issues connected with adult hospices need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/5">Supporting the hospice movement is tremendously hard work, which is done with great devotion by many members of the public who raise funds week in, week out. Now the costs of hospice care are escalating dramatically, and that is becoming even harder work. The Government have reflected that fact and increased funding&mdash;but I would like to see funding increase from 34 to 35 per cent. of day-to-day costs to a flat rate of 40 per cent. I certainly would not want any Government to pay more than 50 per cent. of hospice costs, and neither would the hospice movement; it feels that that would threaten its independence. However, we still need to provide extra money.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/6">On the subject of assisting the hospice movement and making its life easier, I appeal to the Minister about the practical problem caused by the fact that many hospices are covered by a number of primary care trusts rather than one. With the devolution of funding to local level, PCTs play more of a role in assessing their contribution to the hospice movement. If as with my hospice, nine PCTs are involved, it is time-consuming and frustrating to have to deal individually with each of them. If anything could be done on a practical level to make them into a united single unit for dealing with hospices and resolving matters of funding, that would be a tremendous boost.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/7">It is not only adult hospices that provide that valuable service; sadly, young children die too. There has been a dramatic growth in children's hospices, yet their funding from the state is on average just under 5 per cent. of their costs, which puts even greater pressure on individuals to raise funds.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/8">As hon. Members have said, and as was highlighted in the report of the Health Committee, of which I was a member, there is no uniform consistency in the quality of palliative care. More has to be done to bring that up to a universal high standard. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence should look into and further encourage the development of standards in that area of both health and social care. I fully support the roll-out of the gold standard framework for palliative care, but I should like it to move on at a quicker pace if that is feasible and sensible. I also strongly support greater interaction between the NHS, social services and the voluntary and charitable sector to provide a seamless service.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/9">I should like to draw to hon. Members' attention a pilot scheme known as the Lincolnshire project, which is being run for a three-year period by Marie Curie Cancer Care as part of its delivering choice programme. All the statistics show that the vast majority of people, given the choice, would prefer to die at home, but as we have heard, only about 25 per cent. achieve that. More has to be done to provide schemes with full back-up services to help support family and carers in giving people the dignity to die in the familiar secure surroundings of their own homes if that is their wish.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/10">Although it is only part of the way through its three-years, the Marie Curie pilot scheme has concentrated on the best possible palliative care, equality of access for all, appropriate support, and a choice of care and assistance. The results so far show that it is an encouraging, positive and successful project, which has been able to ensure that, judging by the national figures elsewhere, the needs and the wishes of individuals have been met far more than happens outside the project.</p>
	<p pid=".381.0/11">We have a lot to learn from that project. We must learn those lessons and confront our own individual demons on this deeply sensitive and personal subject. We must also break down the barriers of the dread and the fear of confronting the issue, thereby becoming more open and more able to work together to ensure that palliative care, and the care of all those who are involved in the vital back-up and support for those who are dying, reaches the highest standards that we would expect for our constituents' families and everyone else in our society.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.383.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="383"  time="010:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h01.htm#50719h01_spmin0">
	<p pid=".383.0/1">I, too, thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1410" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field)</phrase> for giving us the opportunity to debate this profoundly important issue. I also offer him my condolences on the death of his mother. This has been an interesting and thoughtful debate. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase> said, it has been a mixture of the personal and the practical.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/2">My right hon. Friend began the debate by saying that most people negotiate dying alone, and that that has been the traditional approach. He and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> referred to the work of James Woodward and to the idea that ours is a death-denying culture. I do not know whether this is the experience of other right hon. and hon. Members, but that made me think that as Members of Parliament, we write letters of condolence quite often&mdash;perhaps more than most people&mdash;and when I write to someone about the death of their mother, father or husband, my pen always pauses after the words, &quot;I'm so sorry to hear . . . &quot;. The problem is whether to say that someone has &quot;died&quot; or has &quot;passed away&quot;, or that the person to whom we are writing has &quot;lost&quot; a relative. Part of what my right hon. Friend was saying is that we have an ability to find different words. I do not whether that is to do with British embarrassment, but there is something that makes it difficult for us to express ourselves when confronting death, because we are conscious of the other person's reaction.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/3">We have talked about the roles of the state, the individual and the community, including friends and family. The debate also touches on the many developments that have taken place in the medical profession. Those developments mean that we can, I hope, provide better care nowadays for people who are dying, but they also raise the issues touched on by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" name="Joan Ruddock">the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock)</phrase>. Those issues were raised during consideration of the Mental Capacity Bill, and will obviously be raised during consideration of Lord Joffe's Bill. They often touch on deep debates, and lead to deep debates in Parliament. Obviously, the Government are, as ever, listening to those debates.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/4">I am glad that this debate has given us the opportunity to pay tribute to Dame Cicely Saunders, whose work has made us a world leader in palliative care. All hon. Members&mdash;particularly the hon. Members for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley) and for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)&mdash;talked about how we can extend palliative care. This is not an appropriate debate in which to exchange figures for Government spending on palliative care, but there has been increased investment, including in the care provided by hospices. I am sure that many right hon. and hon. Members will say that it is not yet enough&mdash;but our manifesto commitment to increase spending on palliative care gives us an opportunity to consider some of the issues that have been raised. I have had responsibility for this matter since the general election; until now, the provision of palliative care has concentrated on cancer services, and I feel strongly about that.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/5">We now have an opportunity to look further at the issue. The hon. Member for Meriden mentioned the work of the Marie Curie Foundation and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase> talked about the work going on in Lincolnshire. We have also been looking at the work of the British Heart Foundation.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/6">We need to bring things together and consider what it has been possible to achieve&mdash;in the Lincolnshire project, for example, in which the Marie Curie nurses have been co-ordinators of the available care. It has been possible to keep people out of hospital, and, as right hon. and hon. Members said, people increasingly prefer not to die in hospital; they want to die at home with their loved ones. Another example is the Liverpool care pathway, in which it has been possible to identify the support needed in what are likely to be the last two days of someone's life. If we can build on the initiatives that are in place and give support to their carers, people will be able to go home, and die in the place of their choice.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/7">As for out-of-hospital services, there is a big opportunity in primary care consultation. That is when we should consider our commitment to increase palliative care services, and take note of the feedback from such consultation on people's choices and find out how to spread best practice in the available services. I assure my right hon. Friend the Member for Birkenhead that we are considering how to ensure that the gold standard framework is consistent throughout the country. We are also considering how PCT commissioning is done, because sometimes it would be better for one PCT in a group to take the lead.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/8">We are also examining the different aspects of palliative care, which the hon. Member for Meriden mentioned. The approach if someone has heart disease or heart failure is slightly different from that taken if the patient has Alzheimer's disease, for example. We should ask what exactly we expect from palliative care services so that we can extend the range, rather than seeming to concentrate only on cancer.</p>
	<p pid=".383.0/9">I congratulate my right hon. Friend on raising this extremely important issue. The debate has been fascinating and some vital matters have been raised for the future. I hope I have been able to reassure hon. Members that we are giving the matter our attention, especially at the moment. We will be making proposals shortly.</p>

	<p pid=".392.0/1">The debate and the demands for a review of the Abortion Act were stimulated&mdash;we cannot get away from this&mdash;by the sensational ultrasound pictures presented by Professor Stuart Campbell. I saw Martin Kemp's film &quot;Science in culture: Womb with a view?&quot; to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and heard Professor Campbell, who is eminent in the field, rethink his position on the number of weeks in the abortion limit. Since those pictures were printed by the national press, I have spoken to many colleagues in the House of Commons, who seem to be reviewing their personal positions on the limit. I believe that they would support a proper evidence-based review. That is the aim of the debate. Indeed, the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said as much, and Lord Steele has indicated that he believes that changes are required.</p>
	<p pid=".392.0/2">For me, the issue is not just about the length of the abortion limit, but about the number of abortions and access to abortion at earlier stages. The pro-life charity, Life, recognises that abortion in the UK is legislated for within the framework of time limits, and it supports a reduction in the upper time limit to save unborn lives. The philosophical flaw in the framework is that it implies that bigger is better&mdash;that an unborn child of 24 weeks and one day is worthy of the protection of the law, whereas an unborn child of 23 weeks and six days is not. Where is the logic in that approach? That issue must be considered.</p>
	<p pid=".392.0/3">Our primary focus should be to reduce the overall number of abortions. In 2003, there were almost 190,000 abortions. That is 600 every working day. Surely, there must some agreement in this place that too many abortions are being performed in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".392.0/4">What is society's response? Marie Stopes International has been mentioned this morning, as has the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, both of which advocate the liberalisation of abortion law. This weekend it was reported that Marie Stopes International would like to name and shame doctors who have a conscientious objection to abortion. Such organisations fail to appreciate that the Abortion Act 1967 does not provide for abortion on demand. A doctor who is faced by a woman seeking abortion is perfectly entitled to determine that, in his or her professional opinion, the conditions set out in the Act have not been met. If Marie Stopes International and BPAS get their way, there is no doubt that the abortion rate will continue to increase.</p>
	<p pid=".392.0/5">I would like the Government to consider offering more financial support to organisations such as Life that offer crisis pregnancy counselling. Life has a team of professional counsellors and skilled listeners who provide non-directional pre and post-abortion counselling.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.401.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" speakername="John Baron" colnum="401"  time="012:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h02.htm#50719h02_spnew33">
	<p pid=".401.1/1">Thank you, Sir John. I apologise.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/2">We should respect other countries' views on abortion. Last October, it was reported that the British Pregnancy Advisory Service was facilitating terminations after 24 weeks by referring women to a clinic in Spain that was willing to perform such terminations. However, Spain does not permit abortions after 22 weeks unless the health of the mother is in grave danger. A report into the activities of the BPAS by the chief medical officer has been concluded but has yet to be published. Will the Minister say when that report will be published? It is important that the laws of this and other countries are respected, especially as the BPAS receives NHS funds of about &pound;12 million a year to carry out abortions.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/3">The time limit has raised several issues. Last summer, the debate about the upper limit on abortion was sparked by the vivid images of a foetus at 18 weeks' gestation. The images displayed a foetus seemingly exhibiting uniquely human, child-like characteristics, the effect of which was to sharpen our minds on the debate surrounding the moral status of that foetus.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/4">Our abortion laws have to date steered clear of moral issues, as the hon. Gentleman said. Instead, the upper time limit for non-emergency abortions has been based on the simple and probably most objective test: the point at which the foetus becomes viable. The precedent for that was the Infant Life Preservation Act 1929, which made it an offence to destroy the life of a child capable of being born alive. When the 1967 Act was passed, the limit for non-emergency abortions was assumed to be 28 weeks, because that was the point at which a foetus became viable. In 1990, for the first time, legislation set a time limit at 24 weeks, reflecting medical advances since 1967. There have been developments in the use of mechanical ventilation which should be studied very carefully. It is likely that a foetus can be viable at 22 weeks or even earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/5">I refer the Chamber to data published on the website of the <i>British Medical Journal</i> as part of the Trent health region study, which shows that between 1998 and 2001, 7 per cent. of all European births at 22 weeks in the Trent health region survived through to discharge from hospital. A few years later, that proportion may be even higher. If the time at which a foetus becomes viable has indeed fallen, we must consider reducing the limit in the 1990 Act, which amended the 1967 Act. However, the medical and scientific evidence must be properly examined and hon. Members are not in a position to take such decisions because we are not in full possession of the facts. That is why I support the hon. Gentleman and call on the Government to respond to the Science and Technology Committee's report on human reproductive technologies and the law, published in March. The report called on both Houses to set up a Joint Committee to consider the scientific, medical and social changes in relation to abortion that have taken place since 1967, with a view to presenting options for new legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/6">I hope the debate that follows will be much fuller and broader than we have had in the past on this issue, for two reasons: first, because it is obvious that there is a broad range of views. We, as hon. Members, have a free vote on the issue; I make it clear that the views I express are my own and do not necessarily reflect the views of the official Opposition. Secondly, there should be a broader debate because so far it has been too restricted, concentrating on time limits as guided by the concept of viability.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/7">I, for one, have trouble with the idea that the state has a right to interfere in such difficult decisions, especially during the early weeks and months of a pregnancy when, for example, the woman has been raped. We must question the right of the state in such circumstances. However, the state should do more to help women to go their full term. We must not underestimate how difficult such a decision is for many women, who suffer the heartache of making the decision, and who often feel alone when they are making it. There are many groups that support women in those circumstances, and we, as a Chamber, want to acknowledge that and congratulate them on the excellent work that they do. However, the state could, for example, put more resources into the adoption services, so that if a woman was toying with the idea of abortion because she felt that she did not want the child after birth, at least there would be a further option, that of adoption, which could avoid abortion itself. We must, as a Parliament, question whether the state is doing enough to support women who are making those difficult decisions, often at times when they feel alone.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/8">I look forward to a broad and full debate when the time comes&mdash;perhaps broader than we have had in the past. However, before that debate takes place&mdash;I am conscious that time is pushing on, and I want to give the Minister time to answer the various questions that have been asked&mdash;I should like to end by reiterating some of the questions that I have raised regarding the existing law. I shall focus on existing law, because I believe that it needs to be examined carefully.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/9">The Minister needs to answer the questions about serious handicap that I have asked. For example, has she given any thought to publishing guidance under the 1967 Act to provide health practitioners with an exact definition of what &quot;serious handicap&quot; means? In that vein, I should like briefly to flag up one issue that is of interest to me. First, the Minister will be aware that something like 9,000 women travel to the UK to have abortions, many from Northern Ireland. Will the Government now consider extending the scope of the 1967 Act to Northern Ireland?</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/10">Secondly, there is a suspicion that the will of Parliament is not being abided by, and that category (c) is perhaps a loophole through which abortions on demand are progressed. That must be addressed. We must recognise that fact, and decide whether we should allow abortion on demand, perhaps in the first trimester, or whether category (c) needs to be tightened up. That is an issue where the will of Parliament is not being abided by.</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/11">Thirdly, the Government must face up to their responsibility and address the issues raised by the cases surrounding the BPAS at a time when we are all calling for a greater examination of the medical advances and the evidence that should be made available. It is wrong when the Government delay the publication of relevant evidence in the case of the BPAS. When will the Government now set a date on which to publish the BPAS study?</p>
	<p pid=".401.1/12">Finally, the Government must recognise&mdash;I hope to hear encouraging noises from the Minister&mdash;that medical advances have been made. I supported the hon. Gentleman in his call for a full debate on this difficult and sensitive issue, and I believe that the Government should set up a Joint Committee to consider it. I look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid=".405.1/1">I was trying to explain the context in which a decision was taken to accept amendments to the Bill that was discussed in 1990. That decision was taken because there was consensus across the medical community that the 28-week time limit was too high, but as I have tried to explain, there is not the same consensus now. We keep all these issues under review and we are, of course, open to contributions from not only Committees and Members of the House, but organisations outside the House, which keep us in touch with the latest science and medical developments.</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/2">When the issue of abortion beyond 24 weeks was discussed in 1990, it was decided that abortion should be available without time limit in some circumstances. The decision is a difficult one. About 100 abortions take place each year at gestations beyond 24 weeks, most of which are done on the grounds</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/3" class="indent">&quot;that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/4">Parliament did not define serious handicap in the Act; indeed, it chose to leave that to the expert judgement of the two doctors involved, who are required to form their own opinion about the seriousness of the handicap that the child would suffer if born, taking into account the facts and circumstances of each individual case. That approach was based on an understanding of the difficulties that arise in such circumstances and of the fact that each woman's pregnancy presents a unique situation to the doctors who have to give her the choice of a termination and set out the grounds.</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/5">The guidelines issued by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists include guidance to be taken into account when addressing that issue where the grounds in the Act are met. The document &quot;Termination of Pregnancy for Foetal Abnormality&quot; states that if an abnormality has been detected and two medical practitioners are of the opinion that that there are grounds for a termination, the woman should be advised that she has that option. The Royal College guidelines are a helpful aid to professionals who have to make a decision in accordance with the law.</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/6">I turn now to judicial review and Rev. Joanna Jepson's case. Further to the Crown Prosecution Service decision earlier this year not to prosecute the doctors involved in the case, Rev. Joanna Jepson has decided not to pursue her application for judicial review.</p>
	<p pid=".405.1/7">Several hon. Members raised the issue of improving access to abortion. The requirement for two doctors to agree an abortion was a safety mechanism to ensure that the law was taken seriously. If proposals are introduced to amend current abortion legislation, that will be a matter for Parliament. It is accepted that the current measures are a safeguard. I understand the hon. Member for Billericay when he asks whether that creates unnecessary delays, but I am unsure whether he is suggesting that we should have a policy of abortion on demand or whether he is raising the issue as a debating point.</p>

	<p pid=".407.1/1">I will not give way; I have only four minutes left.</p>
	<p pid=".407.1/2">Quite rightly, concerns were raised about the safety of people who have a termination and whether they are given full information about the possible consequences. It should certainly be discussed with a women by those from whom she is seeking advice about services.</p>
	<p pid=".407.1/3">Abortion, both medical and surgical, is a very safe procedure and complications are uncommon. Deaths following abortion are extremely rare, with about one death a year out of about 180,000 abortions. It is a Government requirement that all maternal deaths should be subject to confidential inquiry and all health professionals have a duty to provide the information required. Maternal deaths in the UK for all women are at a rate of 53 per million maternities, compared with about five per million abortions. Pregnancies are not risk free, and it is important to see the risk involved in abortion in the context of other complications that arise out of pregnancy. I hope that provides those listening to or reading the debate with the context for issues of health and abortion.</p>
	<p pid=".407.1/4">Any woman considering an abortion must have all the facts, including accurate information about possible complications, so that she can make an informed choice. Some studies suggest that rates of psychiatric illness or self-harm are higher among women who have had an abortion compared to women who give birth or non-pregnant women of similar age. It must be borne in mind that these findings do not imply a causal association and may reflect some continuation of pre-existing conditions, which may or may not have contributed to the pregnancy in the first place.</p>
	<p pid=".407.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton is absolutely right. The woman concerned should be given support and counselling.</p>

	<p pid=".408.4/1">I have had 15 minutes out of the full time, so I will carry on.</p>
	<p pid=".408.4/2">When it comes to conscientious objection, the Abortion Act provides that, except where treatment is necessary to save the life of or prevent grave permanent injury to the pregnant woman,</p>
	<p pid=".408.4/3" class="indent">&quot;no person shall be under any duty, whether by contract or by any statutory or other legal requirement, to participate in any treatment authorised by this Act to which he has a conscientious objection&quot;.</p>

We have seen progress on the teenage pregnancy strategy. If we consider the dates between 1998 and 2003, under-18 conceptions have fallen by 9.8 percent and under-16 rates by 9.9 per cent. In some areas, those figures are higher. In some areas, those figures are higher.

It is not about more sex education; it is about making sure that we have the right sex and relationship education.</p>

	<p pid=".409.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me this short Adjournment debate. I welcome the Minister. This is my first opportunity to say a few words to her.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/2">I want to raise an important issue that affects my constituency. I refer to what was&mdash;until this year&mdash;the annual Saltburn motor cycle hill climb. I want to say a few words about the history of the event and then focus on the difficulties that exist. The event was a contest of speed and time for vintage and classic motor cycles and attracted up to 85 solo bikes and motor cycle combinations every year. The race was the inheritor of a 100-year proud motor racing tradition in the small seaside resort of Saltburn, which is located in the east Cleveland part of my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/3">One hundred years ago&mdash;almost exactly to the month&mdash;the first Saltburn motor race took place on the fine town beach. It was sponsored by a local garage owner, and attracted crowds of thousands from the nearby Teesside towns. Saltburn sands&mdash;along with the Pendine sands in south Wales&mdash;were reckoned by the great racing drivers of the day to be the best surface for displays of speed in the entire UK. This history of motor racing developed under the wing of the Yorkshire Automobile Club from 1906 onwards.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/4">In the inter-war years, some of the greatest names in British motor sport raced on Saltburn sands. The Guinness family and the Younger family&mdash;both brewing dynasties&mdash;had young sons who loved fast cars and the thrill of speed. They were joined at Saltburn by the famous competition drivers of the day, such as Malcolm Campbell and Parry Thomas. It was at this time that the first motor cycle races took place. Indeed, it is said that T. E. Lawrence&mdash;otherwise known as Lawrence of Arabia&mdash;who was a keen motor cyclist, once took part in a local event.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/5">Following the end of the second world war, and the development of purpose-built racing circuits like Silverstone and Brands Hatch, racing on the sands ceased, but motor cycle hill scrambles from Saltburn up into to the hills continued. These events were sponsored throughout the '50s by the then Saltburn urban district council and with the backing of local landowners such as Lord Zetland and his family. The hill climb remained a proud tradition and was recreated in 1993. In that year, the Middlesbrough and District motor club approached the local authorities to see whether it could relaunch an annual vintage and classic motor cycle hill climb. It was planned to hold it at the same time as the town's Victorian week, a celebration of the resort's Victorian heritage as a planned seaside town.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/6">The type of bikes entered sound like a roll call of the lost British motor cycle industry. Their names ran from the ABC motor cycle to the Zenith motor cycle, along with more familiar names such as AJS, Sunbeam, Rudge, Quadrant, BSA, the mighty Norton Dominator and the Brough Superior&mdash;the biggest and possibly the noisiest motor cycles built in the UK. Well-known names in motor cycling such as Geoff Duke also took part in some of the events.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/7">The hill climb took place along the length of Saltburn bank and Saltburn lane. That is a steep route climbing at an almost one-in-seven gradient from Saltburn's beach up to the Victorian gardens of Rushpool hotel, a former home of the Bell family who were major ironmasters on Teesside. The road was chosen because of the hill and because it is a very minor public highway. It is an unclassified country lane, and the local council tells me that the latest traffic counts show fewer than 1,500 movements on the road in any one 24-hour period. Consequently, the required road closure orders were easy to implement.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/8">The local police, the local authorities and the local community gave solid backing to the new hill race series as it was seen as important to the town's tourist economy. Over the years, the race grew in popularity, and it is estimated that there were between 4,000 and 5,000 spectators at both the start and finish of the hill climb. That meant that the town virtually doubled in size on hill climb days, and those were people spending cash in a town that badly needed trade and tourist investment.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/9">The hill climb became the Middlesbrough and District motor club's one big annual event and quickly became fixed in the Teesside sporting and tourist calendar until, I am afraid, earlier this year. That was when it was found out that due to the existence of a little known piece of legislation&mdash;much of it enacted via statutory instruments&mdash;the race was illegal and, in fact, had been illegal from the first day that it was run. That was as much of a shock to the Cleveland police and the Redcar and Cleveland borough council as to the hill climb organisers.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/10">Sincere apologies, red faces and deep unhappiness were the order of the day from both the police and the council. The event is licensed under the rigorous safety requirements imposed by the Auto-Cycle Union and fully supported by Saltburn's parish council. The event is also a way of advertising both the motor cycle training offered by the council and the work of police's motor cycle section.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/11">That is when the motor club approached me. Mr. Crust, the secretary of the Middlesbrough and District motor club, wrote to me and has been in regular touch with my office. He also came to see me in my surgery in Guisborough and expressed deep concern and disappointment about what had happened. He felt that it was a great injustice to the Middlesbrough and District motor club and the fraternity who have enjoyed the event. He felt that what was basically just a harmless day out for classic bikers and the motor cycling fraternity was seen, in law at least, as potentially harmful to the life and limb of everyone in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/12">The root of the legislative jungle lies in the Motor Vehicles (Competitions and Trials) Regulations 1969. That was amended by section 16A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, which, in turn, was further amended by section 12(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1988. That means that, in effect, no trials of speed or timing on a public highway would be allowed in England and Wales, even if the highway was especially closed by the highways authority. That was further codified and clarified by an obscure statutory instrument, No. 2233 of 1993, which confirmed the position and laid down a small number of exempted events organised by national bodies such as the RAC Motor Sports Association.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/13">Frankly, a big legislative hammer is being used to crack open a small nut. Although I will grant that the hill climb is a competition of speed and timing, it is not a Formula 1 grand prix. Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello are not fighting Jenson Button and Juan Pablo Montoya for a place on a winning podium in Saltburn. Instead, we are talking about a rather sedate race of very old bikes, lovingly restored and maintained by bike enthusiasts from across the north of England.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/14">In the history of the event there has never been any accident or any injury, and no pedestrian has ever been put in danger. The council and the police managed the event in accordance with best practice in terms of crowd control and road closure. The Middlesbrough and District motor club ran it by the book&mdash;the book being a guide from the Auto-Cycle Union covering the arrangements for such events. As it is, the 2005 race, which would have, in a manner of speaking, been the great centenary event for Saltburn, will now not happen. The organisers examined whether there were ways to avoid the impact of the legislation. There seemed only two ways. Either the race would have had to become some kind of tame formal procession or it would have had to be promoted as a separate event through a private Bill sponsored by the club and the local authority. The first alternative was impossible and unwelcome to the club, which, after all wants to trial its bikes against each other. The second was fantastically expensive, full of legal complexity and beyond the ability of a small motor cycle club to process.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/15">I am asking for positive action from the Minister to help the club, and possibly to help other clubs faced with a similar problem. It is not beyond the wit of Government and our expert legal draftsmen in the Department for Transport to re-examine the regulations, to see whether they can be fine-tuned so that small events of this kind can carry on, while very fast and dangerous road races are still prevented from taking place. I sincerely hope that the Minister will also talk to the Minister for Sport and Tourism, who I feel will have the same views as me on this matter.</p>
	<p pid=".409.1/16">The Middlesbrough and District motor club hopes that there might be a ministerial and civil service review of the regulations. Such a review could mean that the event could start again next year. If the Minister were willing to meet them, I would be happy to bring members of that club along so that she could hear what they have to say. We might find a way to deal with the problem and find a direction that would help the club as well as meet the legal obligations. I hope that we can have some sort of joined-up government, which is important, and that the plight of the Middlesbrough and District motor club and those who participate in it can be tackled. If the Minister could give a positive reply, I am sure that she would be welcome in Middlesbrough and in Saltburn, which is a beautiful part of my constituency. She could meet the people in the Middlesbrough and District motor club, and hopefully, they would invite her to take part as a pillion or sidecar passenger in the 2006 hill climb.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.411.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="411"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h03.htm#50719h03_spmin0">
	<p pid=".411.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> on securing this debate and on making his case so cogently and persuasively. He feels strongly and his knowledge and concern have shone through in this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/2">My comments will be divided between the general legislative framework and the specific event raised. As my hon. Friend implied, a number of motor events are permitted on public highways, such as navigational rallies and treasure hunts, but all those competing must abide by road traffic law at all times, including the speed limits, to ensure that public safety is paramount. Although he accurately set out the concern for safety in the event raised, we should remember that the speed limit must be maintained at all times and that past history is not always a guarantee of future performance, to coin a phrase.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/3">Motoring events that could cause danger and are most likely to cause nuisance to the public, such as races or trials of speed, are always illegal on public highways. They are confined to private roads, although local authorities can specially authorise such events on footpaths and bridleways. It is also possible, as my hon. Friend conceded, for specific on-road events to be authorised by a special Act of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/4">The legislation specifying when motor events are permitted is in sections 12 and 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Section 12 prohibits any race or trial of speed between motor vehicles from taking place on public highways and replaced similar provisions in section 14 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, which replaced section 7 of the Road Traffic Act 1960, which in turn replaced section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1930. Section 13 of the 1988 Act allows other forms of competition or trial between motor vehicles to take place on public highways, provided that they are authorised in accordance with the relevant regulations, which are the Motor Vehicles (Competition and Trials) Regulations 1969. Section 13 of the 1988 Act replaced section 15 of the Road Traffic Act 1972, which replaced section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1962, under which the 1969 regulations were made.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/5">Events are authorised subject to various conditions, which are set out in the 1969 regulations, which ensure the safety of participants, spectators and other highway users. The regulations have been amended four times since they were made. They were last amended in 1993, to update the fees charged for authorising events, to amend the permitted average speed limits to which such events are subject, and to amend the list of specified events that may be authorised more than six months in advance.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/6">Apart from the longer time allowed for authorisation, the events specified in the 1969 and 1993 regulations are subject to the same conditions as all other on-highway motor events. That is because they are large events, which take more time to organise. Such conditions include an average speed limit across the whole of the event on public highways that is not likely to involve any participant either exceeding any speed limit or travelling at a speed that may be dangerous on any part of the road. Also, the average speed for the event must not be more than 30 mph or 60 mph where the route is on a motorway. Those limits are reduced to 25 mph and 50 mph where the vehicles involved are goods vehicles, large passenger vehicles or cars towing caravans. The 1993 amendment increased the average motorway speed from 50 mph to 60 mph for most vehicles and added cars towing caravans to the group of larger vehicles subject to lower limits.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/7">The authorising body for on-road motor events specified in the 1969 regulations is the Royal Automobile Club. The authorisation process is administered on its behalf by the Royal Automobile Club Motor Sports Association, which is now a separate body. The 1969 regulations do not impose any restriction on the type of motor vehicles that can be involved in on-road motor events. There is nothing prohibiting motorcycles from being involved in events that can be authorised in line with the regulations. However, any vehicle used on public highways, whether or not as part of the events, must be roadworthy and comply with current construction, use and vehicle lighting regulations. The maximum number of vehicles permitted to be involved in an event is 180, or 120 for night events.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/8">Section 16A of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, which was inserted by the Road Traffic Regulation (Special Events) Act 1994, gives local authorities the power to prohibit or restrict vehicles from using certain highways in order to facilitate the holding of motor events. Section 16A does not prohibit or restrict the use of any vehicles involved in a motor event, but it is used to prohibit the use on certain highways of other vehicles not involved in the event in order to allow such an event to take place safely.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/9">Local authorities can only use these powers where certain conditions are met. The event must comply with section 13 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, including any necessary authorisation under the 1969 regulations. An order cannot be made in respect of a race or trial of speed that is prohibited by section 12 of that Act. The authority must also be satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable for the event to be held other than on a highway. However, even if the event is authorised in accordance with section 13 of the 1988 Act and the 1969 regulations, there is no obligation on the local authority to facilitate the event by restricting other traffic under section 16A of the 1984 Act. It may do so, but does not have to. That is the broad legislative framework within which we are required to work.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/10">My hon. Friend has explained his concerns arising from a particular case, the Saltburn hill climb, organised by the Middlesbrough and District motor club. It is a speed trial where each participant is timed throughout the length of the event and there is competition between participants for the lowest time taken to complete it. Speed trials of this kind can take place only off public highways and are subject to the legislation covering off-road motor sport events. As my hon. Friend has mentioned, it is also possible for them to be permitted by a specific Act of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/11">This event is prohibited from taking place on public highways by section 12 of the 1988 Act because it takes the form of a trial of speed. The local authority therefore cannot prohibit other traffic from using the highways to facilitate the event under section 16A of the 1984 Act. Subsection (4)(a) of section 16A specifies that local authorities cannot use those powers for events that are prohibited under section 12 of the 1988 Act because they are trials of speed.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/12">The prohibition is specified in section 12 of the 1988 Act, not in the secondary legislation, and it would require primary legislation to change it. It is a long-standing prohibition, dating back to at least 1930, and we do not propose to introduce such legislation. If we allowed racing and speed trials on the public highway, we would be concerned about the effect on the safety of the general public and on traffic congestion on other roads that remained open. I also believe that decisions to hold such races should remain a matter for Parliament to consider in each case.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/13">The purpose of section 12 is to ensure the safety of the general public and is designed to provide a balance between the rights of those taking part in events and the rights of the public at large. Even if an event were held on a closed road, there is no way to completely quarantine it from pedestrians using pavements or footpaths that may cross that section of the highway. That is why races and speed trials, which involve motor vehicles competing to go faster than other participants, are not allowed on public highways.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/14">It may be that such an event could go ahead in future in a modified form, provided it complies with sections 12 and 13 of the 1988 Act and the conditions specified in the 1969 regulations. Alternatively&mdash;I understand my hon. Friend's concerns on this&mdash;it would be possible for the promoters of the event to seek a private Act of Parliament. My hon. Friend has asked for a meeting, and my door is always open to those making a good case, but I shall not raise expectations of the possibility of a change to the provisions that I have just outlined. He may, if he wishes, explain the results of the debate to the club, and if it was to put forward a number of changes to the event and seek guidance from the Department on whether it was in compliance, it might be possible for us to have further dialogue.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/15">We are currently considering amendments to the 1969 regulations, and the equivalent regulations for off-road motor events. We intend to launch a public consultation on our proposals later this year. That may also inform the club. The main purpose of the amendments is to amend the provisions for the fees charged for authorisations and to specify the Royal Automobile Club Motor Sports Association, rather than the Royal Automobile Club, as the approved authorising body for on-highway events. That process will provide an opportunity to make comments on other aspects of the regulations. I will ensure that my hon. Friend receives a copy of the consultation document when it is published.</p>
	<p pid=".411.0/16">Given the circumstances that I have outlined, the club may want to discuss the possibility of a revised event. Although my comments may not have provided the comfort for which my hon. Friend was looking, I hope that they at least explained the Government's thinking on the subject and why we cannot make concessions for events of that exact nature. However, I offer the possibility that in a different guise&mdash;in a different form&mdash;that event, which, as my hon. Friend outlined so well, is clearly important to the local community and to the tourism economy, may be able to continue.</p>

	<p pid=".416.1/1">I am grateful for that brief pause, Sir John. I am pleased to have secured this debate on mental health services in south-west London and to have the opportunity to draw the attention of the House to my concerns and those of several of my hon. Friends who represent south-west London constituencies about the development of services for people with mental health problems. I am also grateful to have this opportunity to ask several questions of the Minister responsible for these matters.</p>
	<p pid=".416.1/2">I question the way in which the South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS trust has gone about dealing with a series of service and financial difficulties in the past few years. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>, who cannot be in the Chamber today, shares my concerns, as do my hon. Friends the Members for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer) and for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey).</p>
	<p pid=".416.1/3">The trust has let down both patients and staff. It has kept them in the dark and has lost their confidence as a result. In February 2004&mdash;that is 17 months ago&mdash;it was announced that the trust was to receive &pound;30 million in a bail-out to help to cover its massive maintenance backlog. According to research that I carried out at the time, I discovered that the trust, which covers my constituency and five London boroughs, would still require another &pound;43 million worth of repairs to bring it up to standard.</p>
	<p pid=".416.1/4">The costs simply to meet basic health and safety regulations stood at more than &pound;500,000, while the cost for repairs to meet fire-safety compliance was almost &pound;1 million. Those figures were known, and every taxpayer in the country has contributed to bailing out the trust from a long period of failure to invest in its building stock.</p>
	<p pid=".416.1/5">The maintenance backlog is only the tip of the iceberg. Earlier this year, the trust announced that it faced a deficit of &pound;8.4 million. It also announced that it had agreed a change and recovery plan, which I sometimes believe is a euphemism for cuts, to bring expenditure within budget in the coming year.</p>
	<p pid=".416.1/6">The trust is currently consulting informally on its change and recovery plan, some of which has far-reaching implications. It has identified cuts to some services and changes to others in an attempt to balance its books. It would have us believe that the cuts are all part of its plans to modernise services and provide more locally-based care-in-the-community settings, but at the end of the day there is no hiding the fact that cuts are being made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.417.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="417"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h04.htm#50719h04_spnew4">
	<p pid=".417.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. My purpose in raising these issues is not just to campaign in favour of bricks and mortar, but also to campaign on behalf of those who need these services, regardless of whether they are provided at an institution or in a person's own home. I will return to the role of assertive outreach and similar teams soon.</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/2">There are small bands of dedicated staff&mdash;in the community and in hospital settings&mdash;that are battling on, but they are doing so in a climate of distrust and fear. I have received letters from some of them. Many are too afraid of losing their job to allow me to read out their names, but they are demoralised and they feel downtrodden by their excessive case loads. Members of staff of the acute services are particularly critical of poor health and safety measures. That was proved by the tragic incidents that took place at Springfield hospital, and for which the trust was officially criticised and fined.</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/3">Staff are also aware of the many well-paid managerial posts that have been created in the past few years. They are advertised in the specialist press, and some of them pay in excess of &pound;70,000 a year. They cannot reconcile that with the cuts that are being proposed. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham has made that point in the House on several occasions in recent months.</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/4">Change is always a difficult process to manage, but the South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS Trust provides us with a textbook example of how not to manage change. There is lack of direction from the higher tiers of management, and an inability to understand the importance and timing of consultation with staff, the public and, perhaps, elected Members in this House and in local authorities.</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/5">That is exemplified by the closure in April of the Chiltern day hospital in Sutton. It almost seems that that was done on a whim; it was certainly done in a rush. One of the arguments put forward was, &quot;Well, it does not matter too much, because we can manage the fact that there are only eight in-patients who will be directly affected by the closure.&quot; However, that is still a cut, and a cut to a service that is not easily provided elsewhere. Those eight patients, along with anyone else who may need the service in the future, have been farmed out to other, already stretched, facilities in the local area. There was no consultation about the closure; staff, patients and families were presented with a fait accompli, and the excuse that was given for not being able to consult was that there was so-called election purdah. That is downright disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/6">The Department of Health guidance on the general election was published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April</phrase>. It states:</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/7" class="indent">&quot;As at all other times, NHS staff should not be asked to engage in activities which could give rise to criticism that public resources are being used for party political purposes. In particular, you will want to ensure that there are no grounds for complaint against your organisation that it has behaved partially towards candidates or parties represented in the election during this period.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/8">That is normal and good practice outside of election time as well.</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/9">The guidance continues:</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It would be advisable not to start a consultation now the election has been called unless it can be demonstrated that it would seriously impede NHS business to delay it a few weeks until the election period is complete.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".417.1/11">There is nothing in the guidance about not being allowed to consult. It is simply stated that consultations should be delayed until after the election if that is possible. Why did the trust decide that it had to close down the day hospital so quickly? It was not falling down. There were no immediate health and safety issues. Why was not time allowed for proper consultation with patients, families, staff and the public? Why was this decision taken at the same time that the general election took place? It was not as if anyone with a passing interest in politics did not know when the election was likely to be called. It should not be beyond the wit of senior NHS managers to make a planning assumption about the date of a general election.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.419.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="419"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h04.htm#50719h04_spnew8">
	<p pid=".419.1/1">I am grateful for that further example of how the trust conducts itself, the attitude that it takes and the value that it attaches to consultation. The trust will have to justify its decision on the Chiltern wing of Sutton hospital. Will the Minister confirm that the guidance issued by the Department just before the general election does not place a veto on consultation and that it does not prevent substantial variations being carried out during an election period? I am told that the local strategic health authority authorised the closure decision without consultation, and I ask the Minister to investigate whether proper advice was sought and whether the guidance was properly followed.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/2">The national director for mental health published a report last December on the progress made since the national services framework for mental health was introduced in 1999. The report highlighted the lack of investment in mental health services throughout the NHS, saying that to a certain extent it was a result of the priority that primary care trusts give to mental health compared with other national targets such as access and waiting times. That is particularly so in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/3">The local primary care trust has a commissioning budget for my constituency and the adjacent constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> of &pound;20 million, yet the newly appointed director for the PCT in Sutton has a budget of only &pound;14.8 million for services to be provided locally. Why is 25 per cent. of the total figure being used to pay for out-of-borough services? It has not been explained, which is unsatisfactory, yet one person in three is likely to need some level of care from mental health services in their lifetime. That means that less than &pound;500 is available to be spent on each person each year.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/4">There is a chronic lack of funding for mental health services, and the mental health trust is to blame for failing to engage with the PCT and for failing to win the case for more resources. If we bear in mind that as many as 30,000 people may need some level of service in my constituency and my neighbouring constituency in the borough of Sutton, the resources are staggeringly low. I shall rehearse some figures to underline the fact.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/5">There are 84 adult in-patient beds in the one specialised acute hospital ward in Sutton. There are only four adult community mental health teams to cope with a current caseload of 1,600 clients and 15 or 16 new referrals a week. There is one assertive outreach team with 150 clients, one crisis and home treatment team with 90 clients, and two resource centres with 180 clients. That just scratches the surface. People who receive a service rely on staff who are overstretched and buildings that do not meet the minimum standards.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/6">The change and recovery plan drawn up by the trust is meant to deal with the emergency; but why should it have come to this? Why should it take a financial crisis to get the trust to acknowledge the need to start tackling the serious deficiencies in the service? The proposals are in line with current national thinking, and in many ways I support them. More services will be provided locally in the community, and there will be less reliance on hospital-based services. GPs with special interests and graduate workers will provide a broad range of services. That will be backed up by a network of social care specialists, counselling services and talking therapies, and there will be a stronger role for the voluntary sector, with self help and support groups.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/7">It remains unclear, however, where that new army of specialised GPs, social workers and therapists will be found. Even less clear is where the funds will be found to train and employ them. What about the voluntary sector? Will it receive more funding to increase its capacity? Is anyone talking to the voluntary sector about the services that it provides now, and the role that it will be expected to play in future? The community mental health teams will be reduced from four to three, yet we need more of that sort of service, not less. How does that fit in with a transfer of care from inpatient to community-focused services?</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/8">The change plan states that there is a need to access a range of other services that form part of health promotion and ill-health avoidance, including advice on debt management, benefit availability and housing. Yet the plan is to close down the Springfield advice and law centre, which provides such advice to many hundreds of people, and which had over 200 new cases in 2004 alone. Does that really fit in with the promotion of well-being and the prevention of ill health? If people are not given the help that they need to manage their finances, keep their jobs or find new ones, pay for their housing and maintain their independence, the impact on their mental health will surely be considerable.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/9">Providing care in the community and locally based services is far from a cheap option. It needs to be carefully thought through, properly costed and effectively managed. It requires expert training for general practitioners, social workers, therapists and the voluntary sector. It needs a thorough consultation strategy, so that the public, whether they are users of such services or not, understand the strengths of the new proposals and the advantages that they will offer, and have the chance to engage seriously with the development of the ideas at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/10">Care in the community and locally based services need to be properly financed, and need time and patience. The many hundreds of members of staff in my constituency who are dedicated to providing first-class mental health services deserve that, as do my constituents, although they are not getting it as a consequence of the process that we have embarked on, which has left them out in the cold. They should not be left in the cold; managers of our mental health services should engage with them fully, and they should be given the chance to shape those services for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".419.1/11">I hope that the Minister can respond positively and will take a much closer look at the issues that I have raised. I hope that he can make a careful examination of the role, calibre and quality of the management that has gotten the trust into the position that it is in today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.421.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="421"  time="013:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h04.htm#50719h04_spmin0">
	<p pid=".421.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate on mental health services in south-west London. I am aware that he takes a keen interest in health issues, both generally and in relation to his constituency; I have signed 30 parliamentary answers in response to his questions this Parliament. I listened closely this morning and appreciate the comments that he has made.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/2">Before I come to a couple of the local issues that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and particularly the engagement process, I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if briefly paint a picture of mental health policy and say what the Government are doing to improve mental health services nationally. It is important to highlight that, last year, around 1 million people were unable to work due to mental health problems. Such problems are now the number one reason for claiming incapacity benefit and cost the British economy billions of pounds. Improving mental health services is therefore key in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, as well as nationally, if we are to reduce the number of people who cannot work because of stress.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/3">I assure the hon. Gentleman that mental health is a key priority for the Government. That is demonstrated by the record investment that we have made. In the past five years, since the publication of the national service framework, we have invested over &pound;1 billion more in mental health services. The provision of mental health services in the community is being strengthened. Mental health services have taken great strides to improve access to effective treatment and care; that is evinced by the fact that the suicide rate is at its lowest recorded figure. Current data suggest that we are on track to achieve our public service agreement target by 2010. Significant progress has also been made in reducing in-patient deaths, and in reducing the suicide rate for young men, which was particularly high.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/4">That investment is also getting through to the front line, in the shape of a much-needed boost to the mental health work force. For example, more than 1,500 community gateway workers are working to improve the speed of access to specialised services. In England, some 343 teams are working on crisis resolution, 261 on assertive outreach and 109 on early intervention. Some 17,500 people are now being seen by assertive outreach teams each year.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/5">Getting these specialist teams in place is an important step forward. Their work on the ground, in the community, means that more people will be supported and treated in their own homes rather than admitted to in-patient wards, as in the past. We are in the middle of a substantial reform of mental health services. The new Mental Health Bill is a key part of the plan to improve life for people with mental health problems and to make treatment more focused on their needs. The Bill is the biggest reform of mental health legislation since the 1950s.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/6">It is important to say that mental health is no longer the Cinderella service of the national health service. In the five years since the national service framework was published, almost 30 per cent. extra has been invested in mental health. Today the mental health work force are stronger than ever.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/7">I turn to some of the local service issues raised by the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam. I understand from officials that secondary and specialist mental health care is provided to a population of just more than a million people across five of the six boroughs in south-west London by the South West London and St. George's Mental Health NHS Trust. The trust also provides several national services and employs about 3,000 staff. About 150 clinical teams work from service locations at 50 sites across the five boroughs, and there are some 800 in-patient beds, although 80 per cent. of the work is provided within community mental health teams.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/8">The trust is pursuing an ambitious programme of improvement across all service areas. It is working with PCTs and local health partners. My hon. Friend the Member for Tooting mentioned a different view of how services will be provided in the future, and the trust is now in the business of delivering that.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/9">I was glad to hear that many of the benefits of the Government's policy nationally can now be seen in and around the hon. Gentleman's constituency. For example, three assertive outreach teams provide community care for people with serious and enduring mental health problems seven days a week. Secondly, three crisis and home improvement teams provide a 24-hour crisis telephone line for people with mental health problems and their relatives; that helped something like 500 people in 2004&ndash;05.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/10">Thirdly, there are early intervention services to provide comprehensive health and social care for younger people in their first episode of serious mental health problems; that service covers the boroughs of Wandsworth, Merton and Sutton. In 2004&ndash;05, about 112 people received early-intervention help and the team has been very successful in promoting social inclusion. On top of that, the trust has recently successfully bid for more than &pound;450,000 of funding from the Department to develop user-led services to provide support for people with personality disorders.</p>
	<p pid=".421.0/11">Much of what the hon. Gentleman said could be traced back to a couple of issues. One was engagement, to which I shall turn in a moment, and the other was resources. I know that he will welcome the fact that between 1999 and 2000 and 2003 and 2004 there was an increase in resources of &pound;46 million, an increase in the order of 43 per cent. That has made and will continue to make a substantial difference to people in his constituency.</p>

	<p pid=".422.1/2">I shall give examples of three more services that provide improvements on the ground. First, the &pound;7 million Phoenix unit project at Springfield Hospital, Tooting&mdash;in my hon. Friend's constituency&mdash;is due to open later this year. It is the first part of a major estate-modernisation programme being undertaken by the trust. It will be an 18-bed unit and replace services currently housed in a Victorian building that is more than 160 years old.</p>
	<p pid=".422.1/3">Secondly, Springboard is a relaunched and expanded service that opened in March 2005 in new premises at Tolworth hospital. It gives clients across five boroughs access to&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".423.3/1">I shall certainly look at the guidance given around elections, because I know that many hon. Members are concerned about that.</p>
	<p pid=".423.3/2">I shall address the point about the financial recovery plan. I am pleased to note that, with the help of partners, the trust achieved financial balance in the past financial year. I understand that, in 2004&ndash;05, the board reviewed the underlying financial deficit, cost pressures and financial risks, and that the need for a programme to generate savings of &pound;8.5 million was identified. Action has been taken to address that. The trust board has approved a financial savings plan structured around seven work streams; income, work force productivity, service reconfiguration, overheads and procurement, reduction of surplus estate, management restructuring and risk management.</p>

	<p pid=".429.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> on securing this debate on carers and primary health care. I also thank her for her congratulations on my appointment. As she will probably know, I have not replied to many Adjournment debates yet, but I can say in all honesty that of all the contributions to which I have replied, hers has been by far the best. She has already distinguished herself in this Parliament as a first-class representative of her constituency and a voice on matters of national concern. She introduced herself very modestly, but she is already one of the leading authorities on this issue in the House. That is why her remarks were so welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/2">I shall preface my remarks with a few words about the Government's national approach to this issue. The 2001 census showed that there are 5.2 million carers in England and Wales. That is one in 10 of the population and not far short of the population of London. Of those 5.2 million people, 68 per cent. provide care for up to 19 hours a week. That is 3.5 million people, which is more than the population of Wales. About 11 per cent. provide care for between 20 and 49 hours a week, which is about three to seven hours a day every day, and an incredible 21 per cent.&mdash;one in five or just over 1 million carers&mdash;provide care for 50 or more hours a week, which is more than the working time directive maximum of 48 hours. More than 225,000 people providing 50 or more hours of unpaid care per week state that they are not in good health themselves. As my hon. Friend said, if anyone is providing care at that level, it can and does have an impact on their health. More than half of the people providing that care are themselves over the age of 55.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/3">The 2001 census tells us that, at the other end of the age spectrum, there are around 150,000 young carers&mdash;that is 17 years old or younger&mdash;in England and Wales. Some 13,000 of those care for a disabled person, usually a parent, brother or sister, for between 20 and 49 hours a week. Almost 11,000 care for more than 50 hours a week, which is more than double the time that they spend in the classroom. As my hon. Friend described far more eloquently than I could, caring can have serious negative consequences for the education and social lives of those young people, as well as their emotional and physical health.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/4">The Government are committed to supporting carers. We were the first Administration to recognise the vital contribution that they make to society, which we made clear in publishing our carers strategy in 1999. We have also demonstrated our commitment to carers by supporting two private Member's Bills that have resulted in more rights for carers. First, the Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 involves a new right for carers to an assessment of their own needs and circumstances. It also gives local councils mandatory duties to support carers by providing services to carers directly and in the provision of short breaks and by providing direct payments for carers' services.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/5">The second Act, the Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004, came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase>. It makes three main changes to the existing law on carers services. Section 1 places a duty on councils to inform carers, in certain circumstances, of their right to an assessment of their needs; section 2 says that when assessing a carer's needs, councils must take into account whether the carer works or wishes to work and/or undertakes or wishes to undertake education, training or leisure activities; and section 3 facilitates co-operation between authorities in relation to the provision of services that are relevant to carers.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/6">We have acknowledged the research that tells us that carers need a break from caring to help them carry on in the longer term. To support that, we introduced the carers grant in 1999 to support councils in providing breaks and services for carers in England. The grant has increased each year and has provided an extra &pound;450 million over the past six years, and in 2005&ndash;06 it is worth &pound;185m. I am glad to say that, in the last local government finance settlement, we confirmed our commitment to continue the carers grant until the end of the 2007&ndash;08 financial year.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/7">We recognise that a great deal more is still to be done, and I have set out three themes to guide my work this year. First, we need to give everybody a flying start in the world. For carers, that means that we need to find ways to support young carers and parent carers of disabled children more effectively. Secondly, we need to deliver independent living. That means that we need to be able to offer carers more choice about how and when they care. Third, I am determined that we deliver dignity for life. That means that we must stop treating carers as amateurs: they are partners with the social services work force even though they are unpaid. They are also involved in the close family or personal relationships that underpin the caring relationship and, as with any relationship, deserve respect, privacy and freedom from unnecessary intrusion.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/8">Up to now, carer influence on the development of health services has largely been about including them in the decision-making process when determining the services for the person for whom they are caring. However, we need to seek their views on the help that they need in their caring role. Their views should be just as important as the views of patients and staff in helping us to draw up the blueprint for everyday support for people using local health and care services outside hospital. It is vital that councils can engage at a planning level with their partners in health and social care, because that means that at a strategic level social services will have a lever to influence the priorities of their partners in health and other council departments.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/9">My hon. Friend mentioned the good practice in Salford. I was delighted to hear her report of it. It is exactly the sort of thing that we should encourage. This emphasis on cross authority co-operation was reinforced by the supporting carers theme in round 6 of the beacon council scheme, ensuring that the best councils have the opportunity to share their ideas and showing just how innovative services for carers can be through working across boundaries. We had already recognised that the quality of assessment and services for carers in the NHS are variable. We have taken steps to develop standards and indicators to ensure that the primary care needs of carers are recognised. Where it has been possible, we have promoted the idea of local primary care support for carers.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/10">But we cannot stop there. More needs to be done to support carers who are invaluable but often undervalued. That is why we are exploring other ways in which primary care needs of carers can be improved, focusing specifically on the carer as well as the person being cared for. We have started that job. My hon. Friend mentioned that as part of the general medical services contract we have developed the quality and outcomes framework, which is a voluntary system of financial incentives. It is about rewarding contractors for good practice through participation in an annual quality improvement cycle.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/11">The original version of the QOF guidance and evidence base, which was published with the contract agreement in 2003, has been revised by the NHS Confederation and the British Medical Association. In addition, since the 2004 Act came into force, a number of core and developmental standards relating to carers have been published through the new performance framework for the NHS and social care. A couple of standards are particularly important and worth spelling out.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/12">Core standard 22 states that health care organisations promote, protect and demonstrably improve the health of the community served, and narrow health inequalities by co-operating with each other and with local authorities and other organisations and making appropriate and effective contribution to local partnership arrangements including local strategic partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".429.0/13">Several other standards are pertinent to support for carers. Core standard 13 says that health care organisations must have systems in place to ensure that staff treat patients, their relatives and carers with dignity and respect. Core standard 14 states that health care organisations should have systems in place to ensure that patients, their relatives and carers have suitable information about, and clear access to, procedures to register formal complaints and feedback on the quality of services, are not discriminated against when complaints are made, and are assured that organisations act appropriately on any concerns and, where appropriate, make changes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-07-19.432.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="432"  time="013:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050719/halltext/50719h05.htm#50719h05_spnew2">
	<p pid=".432.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. Having started the job, we must finish it. There is one opportunity to do that on which I might elicit her support. Having announced at the end of June that we will set out a vision for family health services fit for the 21st century, we are now going into a period of consultation, which will help us to draw up that White Paper. Our desire is to ensure that health care outside hospitals is delivered to high standards and in a way that people want. That must take into account the needs of carers. My hon. Friend's point about the need for a national definition is one that can be usefully considered as part of that consultation. It is especially true for people with long-term conditions who are being cared for in the community, where carers often play important roles.</p>
	<p pid=".432.1/2">We have made it clear that we want as many people as possible to contribute to that discussion because our aim is to listen to and learn from the public and people who comes across such issues in their daily lives. To undertake that consultation, we are setting up an extensive public engagement programme, which will start in the autumn. It will include national, regional and local events. I will write to the team in the Department that is working on the project to ensure that the points that my hon. Friend made are taken into account when that consultation process is being designed, rather than when it is underway.</p>
	<p pid=".432.1/3">I turn quickly to a couple of the other points that my hon. Friend made. She made a point about the systems being used in GP surgeries to track the number of carers. That was considered. We decided that it was hard to specify one direction because of the diversity in systems and practices in GP practices. Most importantly, we are moving from processes to outcomes&mdash;a focus on all patients. That must include carers. As my hon. Friend said, they have better outcomes.</p>
	<p pid=".432.1/4">I also take my hon. Friend's point about how only three points out of 1,050 in the GMS contracts relate to carers. I stress that carers are individuals in their own right, so other parts of the contract will apply to them in addition to the carer-specific issues. Although the quality and outcomes framework cannot be altered locally, it is worth stressing that PCTs can commission extra services from any or all of the GP practices if they choose. Those services are called locally enhanced services. They are negotiated locally and funded from the PCT's main allocation. They are outside national negotiations and agreements, and the only proscription is that they are additional services. That is possibly another area for us to explore.</p>
	<p pid=".432.1/5">My hon. Friend also made the point about setting a date for a campaign to raise awareness among GPs about carers needs. Although I cannot commit to that specifically, I shall write to the Department of Health team working on the White Paper consultation. I may also write to the carers organisations with which I work in my portfolio to alert them to the debate and to flag up the point that, as the White Paper consultation gets under way, they may need to think about these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".432.1/6">My hon. Friend mentioned a useful point about expert patients. I have met some of them, and their stories are extraordinarily powerful. We must consider how such programmes can be introduced more widely.</p>
	<p pid=".432.1/7">I should underline the importance of the White Paper consultation. It is vital that the consultation is broad, and that experts such as my hon. Friend have the chance to input into it. I am reminded of the time when the mother of a very disabled man in his 20s spoke at an event that I was speaking at in Birmingham. She pointed out that carers consultation events often start at 10 am, finish at 4 pm, and have no facility for the cared-for person to attend, no paid expenses, no close parking and no messaging service. That will not be helpful if we are genuinely to take into account the views of carers. I am determined that we shall not make that mistake with the White Paper consultation.</p>
