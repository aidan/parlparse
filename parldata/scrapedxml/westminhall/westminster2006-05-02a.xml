<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.373.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1912" speakername="Bob Blizzard" colnum="373"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h01.htm#60502h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.373.3/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the profile of Latin America in the House. There is growing interest in Latin America among Members of both Houses, as evidenced by the attendance that we have had at some meetings of the all-party Latin America group and by the increasing number of groups being formed for individual countries in Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/2">It is timely to focus on the strategy of the Department for International Development, because my understanding is that this year, 2006&ndash;07, DFID will review its regional assistance programme. It has certainly promised to do that. Initially, however, I shall talk about why Latin America is important and why DFID and the Government in general should be interested in it. It is sometimes said that Latin America is not a traditional area of influence for the UK. We have relatively little in the way of former colonies or territorial interests in the region, and some of the old pre-war links&mdash;we used to build quite a lot of infrastructure there&mdash;are not what they were. However, it would be a major mistake to marginalise our interest in Latin America, and I shall give five reasons for saying that.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/3">The primary reason for DFID being involved in Latin America is that 57 million people there still live on less than $1 a day, and 132 million people live on less than $2 a day, amounting to 26 per cent. of the population. The aim of DFID's strategy is to contribute to the achievement of the millennium development goals. However, even the best current projections for 2015 are that Latin America will fail not only on the poverty measures that I have just mentioned, but on maternal mortality, infant mortality and HIV/AIDS outside Brazil. All too often, it is the indigenous and black people of Latin America for whom those targets are least likely to be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/4">With the exception of Nicaragua, the countries of Latin America are classified as middle-income countries, albeit Bolivia and Honduras just creep into that category. However, the point about the countries in that part of the world is that they are extremely unequal. Half the world's 20 most unequal countries are in Latin America. That has an effect on crime: half the world's 10 most violent cities are in Latin America. We may be dealing with middle-income countries, but there are still huge numbers of poor people in them. As I said, 57 million people&mdash;a lot by any standard&mdash;are in absolute poverty. We will not achieve the millennium development goals worldwide if we do not deal with the situation in Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/5">Mr. Oscar Schiappa-Pietra is executive director of Peru's agency for international development aid co-operation. I had the privilege of meeting Mr. Schiappa-Pietra in Lima when I led an Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation in February. He wrote something very relevant about middle-income countries in a foreword to DFID's publication &quot;Alliances Against Poverty: DFID's Experience in Peru 2000&ndash;2005&quot;. Of the middle-income country classification he says:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/6" class="indent">&quot;This is a label that greatly over-simplifies the complex socio-economic and political realities of countries like Peru . . . middle-income countries are often getting the worst out of globalization, because they are being left aside from much needed ODA&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/7">official development assistance&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/8" class="indent">&quot;resources while still unable to compete in either the knowledge or the low-wage economy . . . the shift in classification from poor country to middle-income country misses an understanding of the transitional stage of internal adjustments such as those aimed at generating a more equitable allocation of resources and wealth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/9">DFID has particular knowledge and expertise to be able to address that problem. With such a vital role to play, DFID has to be active in Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/10">The second reason why we should be interested in Latin America is that we can make a difference in helping that region to make progress. When I return from visits to Latin America, I am always optimistic about the region. Indeed, I am much more optimistic than I am when I return from some of the visits to Africa, where the situation in some countries is quite difficult. We are right to be involved in Africa, but one sometimes returns quite pessimistic about the prospects there.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/11">In Latin America, the institutions are often better and stronger. Yes, there is corruption, but it is not as bad as in Africa. There are not wars and conflict on the same scale as in Africa. There is armed conflict in Colombia, but we are not talking about Darfurs, DRCs and so on in Latin America. Nor is there the scourge of international terrorism in Latin America. Above all, what makes me optimistic about the region is the great advances that there have been in achieving democracy. We are seeing many elections this year in Latin America, and in country after country we are seeing orderly, free and fair elections. That is not the case in every country, but it is in most of them. Recently in Bolivia, there was a very orderly and fair election; no one is challenging the result. The first round of elections in Peru was very close. People had to wait a week or two for the result, but the situation is being managed. That is very encouraging when one considers that it was not that long ago that many of those countries were being ruled by the military.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/12">The third reason for regarding Latin America as important is that it has huge growth potential. Indeed, many of the countries have been experiencing substantial growth in recent years as a result of high commodity prices, although sadly that is not being translated sufficiently into poverty reduction. We as a country should not miss the opportunity to be involved there through trade and inward investment for mutual benefit, especially as the region contains countries with worldwide political influence. We ignore those countries at our peril. The most obvious example is Brazil, but there is also Mexico. Chile is important, too: it is a remarkable success story of economic progress and stability. If we do not take the opportunities in south America, China will. In fact, China is already moving in there in quite a big way. It is therefore important that we are in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/13">The fourth reason is that many of the countries in south America want a strong relationship with the European Union to balance their political and trade relations with the USA. Given our Government's attitude towards trying to end EU protectionism, common agricultural policy reform and the type of deal that we are trying to secure from the Doha World Trade Organisation round, we are probably Latin America's best EU partner, if only more people would realise that. Many people and politicians in Latin America do not realise it.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/14">I was fortunate enough to attend a conference of parliamentarians from all over Latin America last November in Buenos Aires, and I told the conference of our Government's efforts during the presidency of the European Union to try to tackle the immorality of the fact that in Europe we spend $2 a day per cow when 130-odd million people in Latin America live on less than $2 a day. After I had spoken, an Argentine politician passed me a note. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/15" class="indent">&quot;Your words are very good news for us. The media in Argentina haven't given information about this position. (We didn't know the English proposal about subsidies.) Thanks for this. Good information is one of the biggest needs we have. Sorry for my English.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/16">I have to say that that lady's English was a lot better than my Spanish. I found those words quite encouraging, coming from an Argentine parliamentarian.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/17">That leads me to a further point: how we as a country are all too often seen by the people and the politicians in Latin America. We are sometimes, sadly, seen only as America's partner in Iraq. As we know, people in south America do not particularly like President Bush and did not agree with the invasion. We therefore have a job to do to enable people in Latin America to see us as we really are, leading the world, as we did through the G8, on debt relief, increased aid, getting a fair trade agreement at the WTO, tackling the millennium development goals and devising the international finance facility. That is the position that we need to establish clearly in people's minds in Latin America, but we can do so only by being involved. Our one advantage is that, despite everything else, we are still respected for the quality of what we do, as we are throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/18">The fifth reason we should take Latin America very seriously concerns drugs. I shall say more about this later, but we should remember that the world's three biggest coca producers are all in south America: Columbia, Peru and Bolivia.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/19">I now turn to DFID's regional assistance programme. There has been a major change in the way DFID operates in Latin America. It has moved away from bilateral country-focused assistance programmes to more strategic involvement, working with the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank. That change, along with the closure of offices in Peru and Honduras and the closure of our embassy in Paraguay, has led to a charge that the Government are withdrawing from Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/20">It is sad and disappointing when programmes close. I read what was achieved in Peru concerning citizenship and governance in &quot;Alliances Against Poverty&quot;, and it is sad to see that coming to an end. When I was fortunate enough to lead an IPU delegation to Brazil in 2003, we saw first-hand some of the work going on through DFID in the north-east of that country to help poor and excluded people to gain confidence to pursue their rights in a responsible way. When we made a more recent visit to Peru in February, the Prime Minister of Peru, Mr. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, told us straight, &quot;It is not aid we need. We do not need aid; we have got a lot of money now from the commodities that we are selling. What we need is knowledge, expertise and technical support.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/21">The more I have examined DFID's new strategy and the more I have learned about Latin America, the more I think that the new approach could be even more effective, if it works. DFID's knowledge and expertise in exerting influence on the way in which the World Bank and the IDB work in Latin America has great potential to focus efforts more successfully on poverty reduction, which is a job that needs doing. That process relies on DFID's great strength in the world; wherever I have been, I see DFID punching above its weight, using its high-quality reputation. I met staff who were working out of the Andean office in La Paz, and I pay tribute to the work that they are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/22">There are two huge challenges involved in the new strategy. The first is the challenge of being able to influence international financial institutions&mdash;the IFIs&mdash;such as the World Bank and the IDB. It will be a challenge to get them to use their money in a sufficiently transparent way, to use it more thoughtfully and to aim it more effectively at poverty reduction. This is a matter of widespread concern. The Minister and other hon. Members will know of the international parliamentarians' petition for democratic oversight of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Across the world, 55 Parliaments have been involved with the petition; I do not have the latest figures, but when I last looked, there were well over 1,000 signatures. I am delighted that 365 of those came from Parliaments in this country. That is a major challenge, but it needs to be taken on.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/23">The second challenge is to overcome the growing disaffection and mistrust of the IFIs that so many people and politicians in Latin America share. Politicians, civil society groups, trade unionists in Latin America and international non-governmental organisations have documented many examples of misconceived schemes, often agreed between the IFIs and discredited former leaders with little or no transparency or accountability and no involvement of parliamentarians or community representatives, or with loan or trade conditions that destroyed local livelihoods and, in some cases, wrought macro-economic damage. As a result, the Washington consensus reforms of the 1990s are widely seen as a failure in Latin America because of their lack of impact in reducing poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/24">In that part of the world, there is now a deep suspicion of globalisation, privatisation and labour market reform, but from a wider historical perspective, one can see that the region needs to find acceptable ways of becoming less protectionist and expanding trade because of some of its past failings. Politicians from all over the region now regularly condemn neo-liberalism, which is chiming with electorates. We have seen that in the results of various elections, most recently in Bolivia and currently in Peru, where such messages are well received by people and reflected in the way in which they vote. I have to say, however, that some commentators have been very simplistic in painting all the leaders on the left as being the same and representing some sweeping direction. There is a world of difference between Chile, Bolivia, Brazil and Venezuela.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/25">It is worth remembering what Ricardo Lagos, a centre-left moderate by Latin American standards who was until recently the President of Chile, said when he came here for the conference on progressive governance in 2003, in a speech entitled &quot;A View from the South&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/26" class="indent">&quot;We've completed all the tasks assigned to us by the so-called 'Washington Consensus' . . . Nevertheless, the fact that Chile has completed these tasks does not necessarily mean that the Washington consensus is correct . . . In Chile, we were able to stick to the Washington consensus because in addition to it we did other things, and this is what really made the difference . . . if you are going to have growth, you need public policies that ensure that growth will be enjoyed by the many. If not, then you are on the wrong track. In the long-term, if you are not creating a cohesive society you will be defeated. This is what I think has happened in most American countries.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/27">Those are very wise words.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/28">However, the UK has the credentials to help to overcome the deep suspicion of IFI policies that exists throughout Latin America, which clearly influences the attitudes of some Governments. My first reason for saying that is our policy on conditionality&mdash;particularly trade conditionality. That was best expressed by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in his &quot;Wall of Shame&quot; speech of last October. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/29" class="indent">&quot;We have seen all too often before how the World Bank/IMF 'one size fits all' shock therapy prescription has produced macroeconomic instability, rising unemployment and profound inequality. Societies and economies have been left dislocated . . . we must not force liberalisation on developing countries . . . we must leave it for them to decide the 'what, when and how' of their market openings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/30">Those words will be very well received in many Latin American countries. My second reason is our policy on aid conditionality, clearly set out in DFID's policy paper of March 2005, which places an emphasis on genuine, bottom-up poverty reduction strategy papers, not the imposition of conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/31">Another thing that will encourage people is our stated policy of trying to reform the World Bank and the IMF. DFID produced its first report in 2004 on its dealings with the World Bank, and committed itself to using a seat on the board to gain reform. The Treasury has taken a similar stance regarding the IMF. I have mentioned our stance within the EU of wanting better access to markets for poorer countries, including those in Latin America, which I also believe would be well received.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/32">Above all, however, I emphasise the stand we have taken in the world in taking the heavily indebted poor countries initiative forward, from which Bolivia, Nicaragua and Honduras have benefited, our historic stand in the G8, which resulted in the Gleneagles agreement, and the efforts of the Chancellor in the devising and promotion of the international finance facility to help to achieve millennium goals. The really good news is that Brazil signed up to that, in relation to HIV/AIDS, during President Lula's recent state visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/33">Having said how our involvement in Latin America could help to overcome some of those suspicions, I would like to ask my hon. Friend the Minister some questions about where we have got to in relation to some of the issues I raised. What progress have we made with the World Bank on decentralisation of programmes and on increasing stakeholder participation in the design of the poverty reduction strategy papers? Have we got anywhere in achieving parliamentary oversight and modification of those programmes? Have we managed to gain any ground in achieving stronger representation on the World Bank board for the poor recipient countries? People have asked for a parliamentary role in the selection of its executive director and other equivalents throughout the world. Have we got anywhere with that? There have been calls for external auditing of World Bank operations and recorded votes at board meetings. Have we got anywhere on any or all of that?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/34">How do we influence the IDB when we do not have the same representation on the board as we do on the World Bank? It seems that the IDB, on which Latin American countries have strong representation, has the right goals; but, again, they are not being sufficiently translated into poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/35">What is the overall process for monitoring the strategy of the regional assistance programme? Is DFID planning to publish annual reports? How do we know if the strategy is succeeding? How does the European Union programme for Latin America fit into that? The EU spends about $375 million a year, so how does it fit in, and how are we trying to invest that EU spend?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/36">I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to do all that he can in the Department to encourage regional integration in Latin America, particularly in terms of transport and energy infrastructure. It is really lacking. Out there, one notices the absence of such transnational infrastructure. There is much suspicion between countries about going down that route. There is outright opposition in some quarters, which see it as some kind of neo-liberal plot.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/37">I hope that there is a lesson to be learned from the European Union. EU integration has actually benefited the poorer countries most. Countries such as Portugal and Spain used to be poorer than Argentina and Brazil. Now they have come up in the world, and I suspect that the EU has played a big part. It is a strong argument to put to people in Latin America, and I hope that DFID can do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/38">There are some very good UK non-governmental organisations working in the region. I recently visited a project run by the Action for Brazil's Children Trust in Recife in north-east Brazil. I saw an excellent, high quality and sustainable scheme, which works with a local partner. The ABC Trust runs five schemes and supports 13 others in Brazil. In Peru, we learned about the work of the Vine Trust, a Scottish based charity that has provided several millions of pounds in cash and volunteer medics and doctors who have gone out there. The trust has a medical boat called the Amazon Hope, based at Iquitos in Peru. It travels throughout the Amazon, bringing valuable medical care to thousands of people who would otherwise have nothing. When we were in Peru in February, a second boat, which had had a &pound;1 million refit, was on its way from this country to join it.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/39">Such initiatives are wonderful, and I wonder what DFID is doing to support that sort of work. It makes a real difference and it helps to build the good relations that we need. The regional assistance programme says that DFID will provide increased funding for international NGOs. Will my hon. Friend the Minister provide any details about how we support such organisations?</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/40">The issues surrounding drugs in Latin America, as in other parts of the world, can undermine all that DFID tries to do. For example, coca and the cocaine system in Latin America impact not only on the economies of those countries, but on their environments and social cohesion. They can bring death and violence throughout the world. The authorities in Peru told us clearly that coca production is on the increase again in Peru. President Morales, who was recently elected in Bolivia, says that he wants his coca growers&mdash;he was a coca grower leader&mdash;to be able to grow more coca not less. Policies such as crop eradication, which have been tried, are now politically unacceptable to most politicians in Latin America because of the economic hardship that they have brought to coca growers who then rise up and, as we have seen, can sometimes overthrow Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.3/41">Crop substitution has been tried and does not work either, because the economics of it are not right. Farmers can get more from growing coca than they can from other crops. Our best bet is intelligence-led intervention in drug trafficking. We as a Government have overseas drug liaison officers in several Latin American countries. They are under the direction of the Serious Organised Crime Agency. However, when we were in Peru in February, we were astounded to learn that the two drug liaison officers based in Lima were being redeployed in April to Colombia.</p>

	<p pid="a.385.0/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to contribute to the debate on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. I also join others in thanking <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1912" name="Bob Blizzard">the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard)</phrase> on securing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/2">In the United Kingdom, poverty reduction and development issues tend to focus on Africa and parts of Asia, and sadly Latin America can get left out of the picture, but as we have been reminded today, it is home to many of the poorest people on the planet.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/3">The Department for International Development stated in March this year, in reply to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/4" class="indent">&quot;According to 2004 national poverty line data collected by the United Nations, 42.9 per cent.&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/5">approaching half&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/6" class="indent">&quot;of the population of Latin America live in poverty and 18.6 per cent. live in extreme poverty. The levels of extreme poverty are higher among indigenous and afro-descendant people.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-03-15.2247"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 March 2006; Vol. 443, c. 2247W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/7">I therefore share the concern of others that DFID's strategy in respect of deciding where to use its resources understates the needs and importance of Latin America, and I ask it to review that strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/8">I am talking not about significant increases in monetary aid but essentially about the opportunity to share UK experience and knowledge, and especially the lessons that have been learned from the ways in which the EU accession countries have managed to develop, and from development and poverty reduction problems in Africa. The transfer of that experience, knowledge and expertise is key. Although I, along with others, understand and appreciate that a multilateral strategy is often ideal, if what we need to achieve cannot be accomplished through the mechanisms of the World Bank and the International Development Association it would be sad to have abandoned more direct bilateral approaches and the relationships that the UK has built up with the countries that are now attempting to deal with the poverty in their midst.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/9">There seem to be two general factors that discourage DFID from being more engaged in Latin America. One of them may be a matter of perception, but it is a high-risk geopolitical strategy in any case. Under the Monroe doctrine, the United States places Latin America within its sphere of influence and encourages European countries to play a lesser role. That may not particularly motivate the UK, but its lack of activity&mdash;the withdrawal of offices, the turn to an overwhelmingly multilateral approach&mdash;could easily be interpreted as acquiescence to the idea that Latin America is outside our sphere of influence, and that we have ceded to the US. May I suggest that, particularly in these times, that is a pretty dangerous approach?</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/10">Latin America is a rising continent in its own right. Brazil has already been identified by Goldman Sachs and other investment banks as one of four countries that are particularly important for the future world economy. Whether or not one agrees with Chavez, Venezuela has oil resources that provide it with international clout. The Mercosur trading block covers a population of 250 million people and produces more than $1 trillion dollars a year in goods and services. These are large, major players who do not wish to be seen as an adjunct to north America and the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/11">It is evident from any reading of statements and speeches across the continent that there is widespread suspicion of the USA and its intentions. President Bush's recent attempt to take forward a free trade area of the Americas looks like an uphill struggle, in part because the US is seen as having been responsible for past neo-liberal reforms that were unsuccessful, and as having an agenda that is primarily focused on the interests of the United States rather than poverty reduction in Latin America. Most Latin American Governments, by contrast, claim that they are seeking development strategies that combine the benefits of economic markets and social welfare. As such, they are following a model that is in many ways much closer to the European model&mdash;to the UK model, even&mdash;than to that of the USA. That argues for a much more direct kind of engagement and a recognition that there can be a very fruitful exchange between the European continent and Latin America, because, out of history, Latin America seems to be developing a similar approach to Europe's to many fundamental problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/12">Numerous articles have been written in recent weeks about Latin America's swerve to the left. Although rifts and friction exist between many Latin American countries over specific issues, and the colour and texture of Governments are extremely varied, there is now a broad consensus that the reforms of the 1990s&mdash;captured by the term &quot;neo-liberalism&quot;&mdash;failed to deliver the promised wealth, and at best left the continent stagnant. Many people accept that reform was necessary, and that opening up to trade was necessary&mdash;indeed, urgently so&mdash;but the 1990s experience was so undermined by corruption, cronyism and a lack of willingness to tackle the problem of the vast numbers of people at the bottom of the social heap in dire poverty, that new answers are now being sought. Again, I believe that the UK should be playing a bigger role in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/13">The second reason for DFID's limited engagement results from the fact that most Latin American countries have a middle-income standing in development terms, but stark inequalities mean that many of the poorest people are effectively glossed over by that description. These are countries where great wealth and great poverty exist side by side. The challenge for most of Latin America is to find strategies for development that reach down to the destitute poor. Even in Brazil&mdash;one of the wealthiest countries in the region&mdash;the rural landless and the urban roofless are scarcely being touched by development programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/14">Latin American countries&mdash;I accept that I am generalising&mdash;are trying to combine social welfare to tackle poverty with fiscal responsibility, typically in the form of tighter budgets, competitive currencies and trade surpluses. However, these countries remain heavily dependent on commodities and are short on the infrastructure and private investment that could underpin economic diversification. Surely, this is an area in which the UK could be more of a facilitator. The experiences of eastern Europe and India, in which the UK has been widely engaged, offer role models in respect of commercial legal frameworks and governance, which are key to encouraging private investment. I understand that DFID has had some engagement with initiatives such as microcredit and community banking schemes, but I am sure that it could work more effectively with international financial institutions&mdash;IFIs&mdash;such as the Inter-American Development Bank to facilitate a much wider expansion of such projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/15">The environment and climate change are bound up with this as well. In January 2006, the Brazilian Government released figures showing that deforestation of the Amazon rain forest was almost the worst on record, with more than 10,000 square miles having been cleared by ranchers, loggers and farmers. The problem affects all of us, but it cannot be tackled without strategies for the sustainable management of rain forests and sustainable development that will provide a decent living for the local population.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/16">I have seen good projects in the United States, particularly in the ancient forests of the Pacific north-west. The Pacific branch of ShoreBank and groups such as Ecotrust have worked with local people to develop effective sustainable alternatives. Surely DFID could do more to promote such schemes for the Amazon, including working with the European Union to provide markets for sustainable forest products.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/17">My view on drugs is somewhat different from that of the hon. Member for Waveney. If farmers are to move away from coca as an export crop for the drugs trade, there must be a long-term sustainable alternative. Our various programmes have never seriously taken on that challenge and used existing role models and examples to provide a long-term opportunity for people, whether in Latin America or places such as Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/18">At present, Latin America is enjoying a benign economic period. As others have said, demand for commodities, whether Brazil's iron ore, Peru's copper or Argentina's beef, has been fuelled by growth in India and China. The US continues to fuel Latin America's economy by providing employment for significant numbers of migrant workers, both legal and illegal. Remittances to Latin America increased last year by 17 per cent., to $54 billion. Foreign banks are taking a positive and benign attitude towards Latin America, largely because they are hunting for yield. They are courting major country players and have been willing to convert dollar denominated debt into local currency denominated debt at reasonable prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/19">My fear is that the optimism fuelled by these benign conditions is being squandered. For example, Brazil used the good times to reduce its long-term external debt from 40 per cent. of gross domestic product in 2002 to an expected 13.5 per cent. in 2006, but only a tiny fraction of real public spending increases&mdash;9 per cent. last year&mdash;was invested back in infrastructure such as roads, bridges and railways, which are the basis of future diversification.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/20">Even a minor global economic downturn would devastate the economies of Latin America, and if economic diversification and strategies to tackle poverty and inequality cannot be put in place while economic times are good, the chances of doing so will be nil when less good times arrive.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/21">Following up on the theme of urgency, the countries of Latin America need success in the Doha trade round. Brazil, like Russia, India and China, is probably sufficiently powerful and successful that it can cut its own deal with the major trading blocs, regardless of whether Doha is a success, but the remaining countries of Latin America fall into that dangerous middle ground: not poor enough to qualify for the open access permitted to the least developed, but not strong enough to be able to carve out a way alone. The failure to meet the <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-30">30 April</phrase> deadline on the broad parameters for tariff and subsidy reductions in the Doha round raises a fear that the opportunity will be lost. Again, if a development trade round cannot be achieved when the global economic environment is generally positive, as it is today, there can be little hope of achieving it at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/22">In January, in response to a question from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase>, DFID provided a detailed breakdown of bilateral funding to south and central America. Of course there are exceptions, but it is clear from those numbers that overall funding has been extremely volatile since 1997. It is hard not to conclude that programmes are constantly stopping and starting&mdash;the direction keeps changing&mdash;but we know that consistency and predictability matter in aid and development.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.0/23">Let me conclude with a plea to DFID. The countries of Latin America are in a period when, economically, much is going their way. Perhaps that will last for some time, but the reality is that the slightest economic downturn will generally cause problems and make life more difficult. The inequalities of society in most of those countries mean that people live in dire, impoverished conditions. It will be interesting to see how DFID intends to seize the moment, while the opportunity is good, permanently and sustainably to support improvements. I ask that Latin America not slip from the Department's priorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.389.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1912" name="Bob Blizzard">the hon. Member for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate and by putting on the record my view that his chairmanship of the all-party group on Latin America has resulted in the group's renaissance and has moved Latin America up the agenda in both the Department for International Development and the Foreign Office. I welcome that. He will know that I am particularly interested in Latin America, and I was pleased that this Minister and the relevant Minister in the Foreign Office came to a meeting in this House to discuss with interested Members the area's importance and the strategies that will be put in place in the forthcoming period.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/2">The hon. Gentleman did a well-informed and eloquent samba, if I can use that word, through Latin American issues. He eloquently described the importance of United Kingdom-Latin America links, the failure of many Latin American countries to meet some of the millennium development goals, particularly in respect of indigenous populations, which is a theme that I shall return to later, and the huge growth potential of Latin America, particularly Brazil, as a trading partner of Britain and the European Union. He also discussed how Brazil can become an influential regional player. I know that the Government support Brazil's position as a full-time member of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/3">The hon. Gentleman mentioned aid conditionality. I have never had an answer from the Minister or anybody else about the difference between aid conditionality and aid criteria. Perhaps the Minister would take this opportunity to answer that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> has a particular interest in Latin America, and that came over in his speech. He is well informed about the area and, obviously, has visited it over an extensive period. I do not agree with all his analyses, particularly of what is happening in Cuba and in Venezuela. He rightly highlighted the many human rights infringements that have taken place and continue to take place in Latin America, but I was slightly surprised that he praised the Cuban regime which, as he well knows, has an appalling human rights record.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/5">The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right to highlight the high levels of crime that exist across Latin America and the lack of governmental infrastructure at national and local levels in many of those countries. DFID certainly could play a significant role in building civil society and capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> gave an informed contribution, although her view of economic policies in Latin America in the 1990s was rather simplistic. There has been economic growth&mdash;indeed, Latin American growth was highest in 2004, at 5.5 per cent. It is not a story of everything going backwards. People have been pulled out of poverty, although the rate of population increase has been greater than the rate at which economic liberalisation has allowed people to come out of poverty, and the definite lack of wealth cascading down to the indigenous and black populations has resulted in the rise of Chavez, Morales and potentially others, which desperately needs to be addressed. Latin America cannot turn its back on the international trading community; there will be significant problems if it chooses to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/7">The hon. Lady was absolutely right to mention environmental degradation, particularly deforestation in Brazil but not only in Brazil, and the importance of and necessity for sustainable development and management of agriculture.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/8">I do not wish to repeat statistics that other hon. Members have given but just say that it is absolutely clear that a significant proportion of the population in Latin America, central America and the Caribbean live in abject poverty. It is unacceptable that 132 million out of a total population of 520 million people live on less than $2 per day, and we need to do more about it. I will come to what I think needs to be done a little later.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/9">It is the inequality that is so distressing in Latin America. The hon. Member for Islington, North, was absolutely right: one can fly into almost any Latin American capital and see glossy tower blocks and housing, and representatives of the international banking community and international organisations. However, in not only rural areas, but the outskirts of those cities, one can see terrible slums&mdash;or ranchos, as they are called in many countries in South America&mdash;terrible poverty and the crime that inevitably comes out of it. That crime needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/10">However, there is some good news, as the hon. Member for Waveney highlighted. There is growing solidity of the democratic process in south America, although there are some problems. I certainly would not argue that Chavez was a total democrat, but I do not want to get sidetracked by that issue. There is still far too much corruption and there is weak governmental accountability; that needs to be addressed with the assistance of donor countries, by DFID and the international community, and through multilateral institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/11">We Conservative Members welcome the funding that DFID commits to Latin America. There is the &pound;300 million committed through multilateral contributions to the Inter-American Development Bank, the European Union, the UN, the World Bank and non-governmental organisations; the &pound;41 million committed through the Latin American bilateral programme; and the &pound;23 million committed through other bilateral funds, such as the civil society challenge fund and the global conflict prevention pool. However, when that is compared with DFID's contributions to Africa and Iraq, we see that Latin America is a very small beneficiary of aid money. Just 1 per cent. of direct budgetary support, and 3 per cent. of bilateral aid, goes to Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/12">I would argue that Latin America has been overlooked, partially because it is viewed as a middle-income country, as other hon. Members have said, and partially because of the success of lobbying groups for Africa&mdash;that is, of the Commission for Africa and of the G8 at Gleneagles. Also, as the hon. Member for Islington, North, said, the UK's relationship with Latin and central America has been damaged by the closure of embassies, DFID offices and trade offices. We have just closed two trade offices in Brazil. I am sure that the Minister or someone at the Department of Trade and Industry has a good explanation for that, but it seems extraordinary, given how powerful a trading partner Brazil will be in future, and particularly given China's significant and growing influence in Latin America.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/13">I have two or three specific issues to raise. The first is debt. Obviously, we Conservative Members welcome the heavily indebted poor countries initiative and its success in Bolivia, Guyana, Honduras and Nicaragua, but many other countries in Latin America have significant burdens of heavy debt; Peru, Ecuador, Argentina and Brazil are four examples of countries classified as severely indebted by the World Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/14">Heavy debt keeps poor people poor and, in the worst cases, pushes millions of people into poverty. Debt inhibits growth and wealth redistribution by reducing the amount of money available to Governments to invest in social services and welfare. Brazil is perhaps the best example: 40 million people there live on less than $2 a day. Brazil spends three times as much servicing debt as it does on public health care. That is not sustainable, nor should it be internationally acceptable. There are many other such examples. I would welcome comment from the Minister on what the international community will do to address debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/15">We could talk for some time about the political situation in Venezuela, and about that country's influence in the surrounding regions&mdash;not just in Latin America, but as a result of its selling cheap oil to the Caribbean, and its potential for influence at the UN and elsewhere. My question to the Minister on that topic is: where has the strategy for security sector reform&mdash;particularly of the police and judicial systems&mdash;mentioned in DFID's Latin America strategy paper got to in combating the problems caused by drugs and drug barons in Latin America, and in curbing armed groups? The hon. Member for Waveney was right to say that the same degree of conflict resolution required elsewhere is not necessary in Latin America, but there are still armed groups&mdash;particularly in Colombia and parts of Mexico&mdash;whose influence, both political and military, needs to be reduced; we must make sure that their power is channelled through, and focused on, the ballot box.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/16">My second question to the Minister is about poverty reduction strategy papers. Clearly, as DFID is taking a regionalised, rather than country-specific, view it will be much more difficult for countries to participate, particularly those that are in the process of drawing up their poverty reduction strategy papers. How does the regionalisation strategy and policy fit with working with Governments to make sure that their poverty reduction strategy papers are appropriate to their country, and not to regions? There are great differences between countries in Latin and central America. We have to make sure that poverty reduction strategy papers are relevant, that Governments buy into them, and that they are not donor-driven, as has happened elsewhere, as the Minister will be aware.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.0/17">Like the hon. Member for Richmond Park, I did not agree with the hon. Member for Waveney on his rather defeatist attitude to the drug problem. There is an argument for allowing the Bolivians and others to produce coca for their own traditional purposes. I was in Yemen recently, where people chew khat in much the same way that people chew coca in Bolivia. Longer-term, we have to find a strategy&mdash;an alternative crop or alternative livelihoods&mdash;to ensure that the volume of production is not sufficient to allow an enormous amount for export, as that creates problems in north America and Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.396.2/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will help the debate if he can indicate whether Michael Brown was on the electoral register on the date on which he gave a donation to the Liberal Democrats and whether Mr. Brown's company, 5th Avenue Partners, was conducting business in the United Kingdom on that date, which was <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February 2005</phrase>? If the hon. Gentleman can do so, perhaps he can, on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, enlighten the Chamber about the business that 5th Avenue Partners was undertaking in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.396.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman intervened marginally before I was about to say that the issue has consumed all three political parties. To put it bluntly, I shall not defend the Liberal Democrats any more than I intend to defend the Conservative party or the Labour party. I am not in a position to give the detailed answers for which he asked; that is a matter for Electoral Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.3/2">The episode has done the Liberal Democrats no good at all. The donations that the Conservative party has received have done them no good politically, with the embarrassments ranging from the circumstances in which a previous Conservative leader put peers into the House of Lords to the fact that, in order to maintain anonymity for some of its donors, the party had rapidly to repay &pound;5 million rather than publish the details, let alone the scandals that have engulfed the Labour party. All the political parties have been damaged by the process. I have consistently said in this place that they will continue to be damaged so long as political parties are increasingly reliant on major donors for their funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.396.5/1">It would be slightly odd if I defended the Liberal Democrats, given that I have consistently argued that political parties should not receive such major donations. The only defence that I would give is that, so long as we have a political system in which some parties receive major donations from multi-millionaires, all the parties will inevitably seek such donations in order to compete. Otherwise, parties will have to fight elections with many fewer resources than other parties and therefore they will have their arms tied behind their backs. Even as we stand, the Conservative and Labour parties spent some &pound;17 million each in the last general election, let alone in the run-up to it. The Liberal Democrats, with one major donation, were able to spend about one quarter of that. There is an arms race and any arms race will lead to people competing for funds from donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.5/2">I do not know what the Labour or Conservative party's track record is of refusing donations that are felt inappropriate. The Liberal Democrats turned down &pound;1 million in 1997, which was the only major donation that we were offered, because we did not feel it appropriate. The donation would not have been illegal, nor was there any requirement to turn it down&mdash;at that stage, we would not even have been required to publish the fact that we had received such a donation. We turned down the offer because we felt that it would not have been right to accept it from Mohamed Al Fayed. That is a matter of public record.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.5/3">If the question is asked, &quot;Do you believe that it is a good thing for us to accept Michael Brown's donation?&quot;, my answer is no. If the question is asked, &quot;Do you believe from what you now know of what happened&quot;&mdash;and that is no more than <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1906" name="John Spellar">the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar)</phrase> knows&mdash;&quot;that it would have been better to refuse it?&quot;, my answer is yes. However, the same can be said of the donations to both the other political parties. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> will speak officially on behalf of the Liberal Democrats in a minute, so hon. Members might want to direct questions to him. So long as all the political parties rely on such sources of funding, we shall continue to see such problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.5/4">If I wanted to, I could spend 20 minutes to half an hour talking the Chamber through details of the Labour and Conservative parties' record on such donations, but that would not be helpful. We all know the scale of the problem. It is also noticeable that hon. Members from both sides of the House, many with direct experience of such work at the highest level in their party, say that the present situation is unacceptable and cannot continue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.400.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="400"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h02.htm#60502h02_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.400.1/1">I believe that, in a functioning democracy, we should build on the support that we can win from individuals. That obviously needs cash, but it can be done through small donations and small contributions. It should not be in the power of an individual to bias political outcomes because they happen to be able to write a very large cheque.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/2">There are two issues. The first is the power of the individual, on a maverick decision, to make a donation here or there that will affect political outcomes. That could make the difference between winning or losing an election such as the 1992 general election. It is perfectly apparent that had the Referendum party fought in 1992 rather than 1997, we would have had a different general election outcome entirely. It is also about an individual's willingness to support an extreme force. I doubt that the BNP would win any parliamentary seats if it gained &pound;20 million&mdash;I certainly hope not&mdash;but it could affect the outcome by pulling votes from another political party or by massively increasing the risk of racial tension, racial violence, rioting and so on in the areas where those resources were used to campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/3">The second issue is about the diminution of the respect for, and standing of, political parties and the political process when honours are bought and sold. Honours have always been bought and sold. Few hereditary peers in the House of Lords were there for anything other than a favour at one time or another. The great majority of the appointed peers are there because of the political contribution they have made to one party or another, in one way or another. They may have actively pursued a career of support for their party&mdash;they are unlikely to be there for being an active maverick&mdash;or have made a major donation. That is the reality. If the House of Lords is elected in the future, as I hope it will be, those favours will still be transferred in other ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/4">I will give an example of somebody who has refused any kind of peerage or gong. Stuart Wheeler has made it clear that he has attached his donations to not getting a title. Nevertheless, we know that he sought to influence the political stance of the party and who was its leader. There is no doubt that somebody who has a large chequebook is more likely to exercise that influence than an ordinary member who raises funds for the party by boiling up jam and selling it at the local jumble sale. We all know that takes place even though it should not happen in theory.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/5">We have seen that happen even from a Government who came in determined to clean things up. We have seen them fall into exactly the same traps as their predecessors. It is rather a surprise to us all to have this debate in the context of what has emerged from the last general election, because we all probably felt that things had been better cleaned up after 1997. There was a degree of consensus on that and a feeling that transparency would at least change things. We now know that the process has been more transparent, but that the public do not like what they see. When the political parties discovered that the public did not like what they saw, they tried to cover it up again by finding routes around the rules. Let us clear it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/6">There is a third, fundamental reason why we should look to change. At the moment, we have the worst of all worlds. We have all the scandal and parties determined to try to find &pound;2 million, &pound;3 million or &pound;5 million donations but, at the same time, we see a creeping increase in state funding. The public are putting in money, but they are not getting anything in return in terms of a cleaner political system. They are just adding to the arms race, a little like mortgage interest relief added to house price increases. As long as more houses are not being built, all such relief does is add to the price and it does not help anyone buy anything, but the state merely subsidises yet more increases in land value.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/7">In this case, state funding has not stopped the political race for funding but added to the level of expenditure by all political parties. It has done so in a way that rewards the status quo. The money is tied to the existing political establishment on the basis of past political performance. In fact, all three parties do quite well out of it, and all will have views on how the other parties do. I know that the Liberal Democrats feel that we are a little hard done by. The Tories have made representations in the past to say that the official Opposition should get more money than other Opposition parties, including the Welsh and Scottish nationalists. Everyone has a view on that, but the truth is that such funding rewards the status quo. Those who have the seats&mdash;those who previously received the votes&mdash;receive funding through Short money and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/8">I genuinely welcome the fact that the Conservative party has changed its position, because it sometimes used to indulge in the most bizarre hypocrisy. I read an article by a former deputy chairman of the Conservative party a few years ago in which he opposed the principle of state funding, yet in the same year the Conservative party received the majority of its funding from the state when compared with donations&mdash;some &pound;4 million in direct funding support from the state and the &pound;3.5 million that the party raised in donations.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/9">We are seeing a growth in donations, but the public are getting nothing in return. We need to watch what happens over the coming months, because I am extremely concerned that we will see another rather cosy deal for the establishment&mdash;including the Liberal Democrats&mdash;in which the status quo is further rewarded in return for, at last, the cut in the donations and expenditure that has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/10">For me, the debate is not about what has happened with the three main parties. I am not saying that one party is better than the others&mdash;they are not. Some parties have bigger opportunities than others, and Governments will always be under the spotlight for giving favours because they in a position to do the most favours. Parties such as mine will always be under the spotlight for hypocrisy because we hardly ever receive donations; we seem to be whiter than white until we do, but we are no more able to turn down donations than the others. The same goes for Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/11">We are all in the same mess, and we need to find a solution. To replace the funding raised by the political parties would probably cost 40p per elector each year. That is what it would cost to clean up the act. The crucial thing is that we should not be given yet more Short money, yet more policy development money or yet more money to reward the established parties. It is crucial in a functioning democracy that politics should be changed by the power of the people.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/12">Support for the parties ebbs and flows; sometimes it goes towards the Conservatives, sometimes towards Labour and sometimes towards others. The political system is in a process of genuine change, and none of us knows what politics or the party structure might look like in 10, 20 or 30 years. It is vital that the parties should follow the public mood rather than dominating it, because the funding of established parties is based on that establishment. I have consistently argued that funding should be tied to the public support of members and supporters who make small-scale donations&mdash;match funding at the local level. That is important not only because of the establishment of the political parties, but also because of the fall in electoral turnout and political activity, of which all hon. Members are aware.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/13">For some years, parties have been responding to that by almost ceasing to campaign in their safest constituencies and concentrating their resources, particularly their manpower, on the marginal seats. At the last election, the Conservative party probably used information technology and direct mail more effectively than any other party. Party activists were replaced with expenditure on phone calls, direct mail and so on; the activists were not really needed. It is therefore hardly surprising that the activist base for all political parties is now about 10 per cent. of what it was in the 1950s. Indeed, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has more members than all the political parties put together.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/14">We can see that happening in party headquarters. I shall give as an example the figures cited in a previous debate. I am sure that the more recent figures will not be very different&mdash;and they are true for all parties. In 1991, the Conservative party had 147 central staff and 59 in the regions. By 2002, there were 172 central staff but only 18 in the regions. The reason is that political campaigns are fought less through the activist base or through local members; instead, central office is raising cheques for &pound;5 million here and &pound;3 million there, and loans for God knows how much behind the scenes&mdash;and spending that centrally to replicate what might otherwise have happened in the constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/15">If we tied state funding to declared party members and supporters, it would make some fundamental changes. First, we would refocus political parties on generating local activity, membership and support in order to raise the money. We could then focus on building up membership and support in the safe seats as well as in the marginals. It is in the safe seats that we can build up the funding support. That will not only start building up the membership as a whole, but it would start to address the fact that political parties neglect whole chunks of the country on the grounds that &quot;We will never win there&quot; or &quot;We are always going to win there.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/16">Secondly, it would ensure a dynamic system that reflected the ebb and flow of support. If the Labour party was as unpopular as it might prove to be on Thursday, it would find it harder to attract members, supporters and donations. Political parties that offered an alternative would find it easier. If the Green party started to build up its membership, it would be able to bring in more support for its campaigns, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/17">Support for the British National party would be based not on the fact that it polled 800,000 votes in the European elections, but on whether it could get people to register publicly that they were members of the party and that they made donations to it. If the BNP were able to get tens of thousands of people to register, it would probably be as entitled as any other party in a democracy to receive funding, but we all know that that is extremely unlikely. The fact is that people do not wish to register their support, and much of the support that the BNP receives is not directly for the party but is an anti-vote against other parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/18">Tying support to individuals in that way would answer the big questions. It would ensure that we did not reward the status quo, which is fundamental in a democracy, and it would clean up the act. It would not be perfect. State support for parties would be difficult to enforce, and people would always be trying to get round the rules at the margin, but the tougher the rules&mdash;the more clear-cut it is that parties could not accept major donations&mdash;the more likely the system is to be successful. It is a little like anything to do with the law; there will always be those to who seek to break the law, but if the laws are not put in place, it will be a free-for-all.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.1/19">At the moment, we have an inglorious free-for-all, which is undermining democratic principles, and taxpayers are spending more and more on political parties and getting nothing in return. We need to clean up the act. If we do not change the system, the bad news that we have seen over recent weeks in the Labour party and to some extent with the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats will be repeated more often, and political membership, party support and activity and electoral turnout will decline. We have the opportunity to change that, and I hope that the House takes it.</p>

	<p pid="a.407.1/1">I am relieved to hear that, but if the hon. Gentleman talks to Members of Parliament, he will find that they see it as a question of which side of the argument is more powerful.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.1/2">I am more worried about the downside of further disengagement and disenchantment with the political process through the sort of stories we have heard in the past few weeks than I am by the downside of the unpopularity of funding our democratic process with taxpayers' money. We should find offsetting economies, as my hon. Friend has done in his paper. Some may be found in how we run the Palace of Westminster. We should link such support to promote broad-based political parties. My party is a decentralised party; I am sure that that is the way in which we should proceed. We should reduce substantially what can be spent on national campaigns.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.1/3">What we need from this debate is not a Government statement on their policies&mdash;that would be a wild dream. We want a framework and a time scale for taking decisions. It is a scandal that 18 months after the Electoral Commission reported, the Government have not replied. What options are the Government interested in and which, if any, have they ruled out? When will the next step be taken and how will be Parliament be involved? An area where decisions are taken in secret has got a lot of people into trouble. I hope that we can have some transparency this afternoon.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.409.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1847" speakername="John Maples" colnum="409"  time="011:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h02.htm#60502h02_spnew21">
	<p pid="a.409.0/1">I agree almost entirely with the analysis put forward by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>. We could spend this hour and a half scoring party points off each other, but it would be a terrible waste of time. We all have this problem, and if we have to raise money to pay for party politics, it is much easier for a party treasurer's to raise it in large donations. That leads to an unsavoury series of events, whereby Ministers have to turn up at dinners and people think that they have access. It gives at least the appearance of corruption, even if there is none in reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/2">Party politics needs funding, however, and where I part company from the hon. Gentleman and, I think, everybody else who has spoken is over the concept of compulsory taxpayer funding. I do not see why people who are uninterested in politics or do not care for a particular party should have to pay through their tax system for its activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/3">How does one square that circle? We could go on the way we are, but if we raise funds voluntarily, they will come from big donations. Or, is there an alternative to compulsory taxpayer funding? I think the answer is yes. There is a similar system in the United States. People could in their tax returns or in their tax coding agree entirely voluntarily to give a sum of money to a match fund administered by the Electoral Commission. I shall come on to how it would be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/4">In the United States, one can tick a box on one's tax return and give about $5 to a presidential election fund. Presidential candidates who use it are subject to certain conditions about transparency and the maximum donations that they can accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/5">The scheme would be voluntary for political parties, because there is a freedom of speech issue. Much as I resent what James Goldsmith did in the 1997 election, I am not sure that someone should be stopped from doing it, because it is one way in which people from outside the political elite can break into it. To participate in match funding, a party would have to agree that it would not accept any donations over a certain size. In my view, that would be &pound;10,000. I think that &pound;50,000 is far too much. It may not seem a lot to us or a party treasurer, but to most of our constituents, &pound;50,000 is a huge pile of money. I am not sure that they would consider its donation any less corrupt than &pound;100,000 or &pound;200,000. My limit would be &pound;10,000, but if people wanted it to be &pound;15,000 or &pound;5,000, I would not argue.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/6">If the party agreed not to take any donations in excess of &pound;10,000, it would be eligible for the pot of match funding. For all donations it raised under the limit, it would be entitled to one-for-one match funding out of the pot. Few people will give &pound;10,000, but in our constituencies there will be plenty of people who give &pound;10, &pound;20 or whatever. The aggregate of those donations should be matched pound for pound out of the match funding pot.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/7">That proposal is different from taxpayer funding or tax relief on membership subscriptions or donations. Tax relief is compulsory taxpayer funding; it comes out of the other taxpayers' taxes, because less comes from the people making political donations. Both systems represent compulsory taxpayer funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/8">Let us say that the figure that one could check on one's tax return or coding and give voluntarily was &pound;2.50. There are 27 million income tax payers in the United Kingdom. If 30 per cent. of them agreed to give &pound;2.50 each, the pot of match funding would amount to about &pound;20 million a year. I realise that the arithmetic may be slightly more complicated, but over an electoral cycle that is about what the three main political parties spend every year. It costs the Labour party and the Conservatives about &pound;12 million a year to run their central organisations, and they spend another &pound;20 million in an election year on top of that. The Liberal Democrat figures are less&mdash;about &pound;5 million a year over the electoral cycle.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/9">If 30 per cent. of taxpayers were prepared to pay an additional &pound;2.50 on their taxes into a match fund, &pound;20 million would be available to pay half the total party political bills for running the parties' central organisations and general election campaigns. It would throw back on to the party the need to raise their share&mdash;in our case, &pound;10 million a year&mdash;of that in small donations, of which most would be much less than &pound;10,000. It would be a good thing, because it would make us go back to our grass roots. It is an alternative to the compulsory taxpayer funding that I sense all parties are drifting towards. Raiding the taxpayers' pot is too comfortable a solution and too easy. My party should be the last to do that, because we are in favour of lower taxes and less public funding and more voluntarism. Indeed, on this matter, we are probably joined by the other two parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.0/10">My solution is worth exploring. Everyone benefits. First, there would be no more large political party donations, which are the cause of the problem. Secondly, there would be no compulsory taxpayer funding, which would be widely resented if not by the taxpayers, at least by the press, who would give us a terrible time about it. Thirdly, it would give a big incentive for us to raise small donations. As a member of the public, it would mean a great deal for me to remove the big donors from politics. Then perhaps peerages could go back to people of genuine distinction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.411.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="411"  time="011:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h02.htm#60502h02_spnew22">
	<p pid="a.411.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this timely debate and highlighting a huge problem in the body politic. I shall focus on the relationship between party funding and political engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/2">We cannot separate the issue of party funding from party spending. The amounts spent at general elections seem a complete anathema to most people in the street. Much has been said about the restrictions on television and radio advertising, which are a very good thing in our society. However, the media world has changed over the past few years. In the past decade, there has been a huge increase in outdoor advertising such as billboards, ambient media and print advertising. It may be worth revisiting the restrictions on advertising in order to cover some of those other categories. Otherwise, as has been mentioned, we shall not engage people more in politics, but encourage an arms race in which one party spends &pound;5 million on billboard advertising so the other party feels that it has to buy &pound;5 million of advertising on billboards, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/3">I have yet to meet a voter who is convinced by a billboard to vote in a particular way. When I speak to people, I often find that personal engagement is most effective. That was what I found when I was a marketing manager. Face-to-face marketing is the most impactful. It is not necessarily the most expensive method either, but if one is going to get volunteers to knock on doors, it is incredibly resource intensive.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/4">I am sure that other Members in the Chamber have had the same experience as I have of knocking on a door and speaking to a voter who says, &quot;Do you know, you're the first politician that's ever come and knocked on my door?&quot; Although we are delighted to have knocked on their door, equally we feel bad for the thousands of other householders in that constituency to whom we will not be able to speak. Even in my constituency, which was a target seat for the Liberal Democrats, we did not knock on every door. I would be surprised if there were many constituencies where parties are able to do that. That is a result of the decline in political membership and participation that has already been mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/5">Given that situation, I am attracted by ways in which we could use party funding to put right what is wrong with our political system and to start to engage people better in democracy. The Power report makes a good recommendation, No. 20, which proposes a voter voucher scheme, whereby when casting a vote, one can tick a box to donate &pound;3 each year to the party of one's choice. Interestingly enough, that may not be the party for which one votes. With our rather warped first-past-the-post political system, people in many constituencies will choose to give their vote to a party that has a good chance of winning, though they may have an affiliation with a different party. This would give them the choice to vote for the result that they want but in the meantime to support the development of a party that they may think is not yet ready to govern or to win the election.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/6">Such a system would give an incentive to parties to engage at the local level. It is a great shame that that has been lost from the current system of party funding. The other advantage of such a system is that it would provide voters with a choice. Some people have suggested that there may not be public support for state party funding, but this would at least give people the choice of ticking the box or leaving it blank, with the money going back to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.0/7">This is an interesting issue, and the suggestion is worth considering. The match funding ideas that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1847" name="John Maples">the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples)</phrase> suggested are worth looking at, and I hope that the Minister will address them, as it is vital that we deal with the issue properly to encourage more participation and to have a healthy political system.</p>

	<p pid="a.412.0/1">I am happy to take part in this debate. Unlike my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>, I am not a frequent participant in debates of this sort. When he gave me a little file the other day and said, &quot;Now that you have taken on the job of speaking for us on constitutional affairs, you may find this of interest,&quot; I had not realised how many speeches he had made. I am persuaded by the approach that he has pursued throughout, which has produced a good-tempered and sensible debate on what is, clearly, a controversial issue. We could all be on the back foot and in difficulties, but instead we all have a common interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/2">I also discovered that there are some fairly regular contributors to these debates: <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> have consistently criticised the present system and made arguments for change, as have <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> and others. Many people have argued that, first, we must have significant change; secondly, it must come soon; thirdly, we must reduce the influence of big donors; fourthly, we must engage in local political activity; and fifthly, if we get it right, we could refresh our democracy, which is also perceived as being in crisis. I shall say things that support that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/3">This issue has been languishing on a back burner. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said, the Electoral Commission produced a good report. It went to the Government and sat there. Nothing happened&mdash;we have all been waiting. It is one of the ironies of politics that it was the husband of a relevant Minister&mdash;the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs,&mdash;who opened the box. I pay tribute to Mr. Jack Dromey, a resident of Southwark, who got the debate going again. He never was a quiet man. He made what will probably be remembered as his most significant contribution, and he was right to do so. I do not say that in a partisan sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/4">Let me deal with other things that are still up in the air. We are now in the middle of a series of inquiries. My party and the other parties&mdash;Plaid Cymru, the Scottish National party, the Conservatives and Labour&mdash;will give their views to the two Select Committee inquiries that have been launched. Lord Falconer gave his first evidence the other day to the Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is chaired by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>, and the Public Administration Committee will consider the issue as well. Everybody will give evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/5">Sir Hayden Phillips has been brought back into the picture to consider the matter again. The Minister and I debated the honours system in this very Chamber the other day. We discovered that there had been radical and good Select Committee reports on reforming the honours system, and then Sir Hayden Phillips was asked to come up with some proposals. The Government have been much more willing to accept his proposals, which were less radical than those of the Public Administration Committee. I hope that they will not now be timid about responding. Obviously, we will not get final answers until later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/6">For the record, it is only fair that I explain my party's position. I shall keep within my 10 minutes. We have not debated the matter or formulated policy since 2000, and much water has passed under the bridge since then. At that time, we endorsed the view that UK parties should receive a modest injection of state aid. I note in passing that a great deal of money is already available. My hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell made that point well, and we all agree about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/7">We said that state funding should be broadly related to votes gained in the previous general election and the number of seats to be fought, as is the practice in many other European states. For regional parties&mdash;I interpret this to mean parties in Wales and Scotland&mdash;it would be based on performance in the relevant area. We believe that funding should go hand in hand with curbs on total national spending by parties on election campaigns, and that the limit for a general election should be &pound;10 million. Finally, payment of state funds to political parties must be made conditional on publication of full accounts, particularly the source of all donations over &pound;1,000. My party and the Conservative party said nothing about the issue in our manifestos for the last general election. The Labour party made some general statements, but the debate was not formally taken on.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/8">What are the issues now? I shall identify them and give views expressed in recent days on behalf of my party by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase>, who is the new leader of my party, by me and by other colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/9">First, we must separate party political donations from seats in Parliament. We made that point in the debate in this Chamber the other day. It is clear that that link and the perception of it must end. Clearly, it is damaging the health of the body politic. My view is that we ought therefore to have no further nominations to the House of Lords until the issue has completely been sorted out; that is, until we receive the Phillips report, see what it recommends, and agree on how we should proceed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.418.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1682" speakername="Bridget Prentice" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs"  colnum="418"  time="012:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h02.htm#60502h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.418.0/1">I shall try to rattle through things so as to respond to as many contributions as possible. Should I not manage to respond to points, I shall write to all hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/2">I endorse the comment made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> that this has been a good-tempered and sensible debate. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing it. Good tempered and sensible as it is, it struck me yet again that there are almost as many opinions on the subject as there are Members of Parliament and, possibly, as there are Members of the other place and people in the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/3">Nevertheless, one or two themes came through with some consistency. One was the idea of some kind of cap on national funding and an increase in state funding, albeit there are a variety of views about how that could be achieved. In addition, we would all welcome enthusiasm for more activity locally and an engagement with local communities and local members. Such activity has not been as lively as it might have been in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/4">I also want to outline some of the things that have taken place and, in so doing, perhaps respond to the point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> about the Electoral Commission report. The Government welcomed that report. Although I shall not be able to give him the full answer, any more than my right hon. and learned Friend the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs was able to in November, perhaps I can move things on a little.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/5">We have been in detailed internal discussions with the Electoral Commission, because it recognised within those discussions that further work needed to be done. Some of that has now been subsumed in the Hayden Phillips review. That will not make the right hon. Gentleman too happy. The Electoral Commission will be working with Sir Hayden Phillips closely so that his review, which will come out at the end of the year, will be able to be progressed fairly quickly. In a sense, because we did not respond in the way that the right hon. Gentleman wanted within the past 18 months, things have now been overtaken by events. Whether that is a good thing is for him to reflect on. It will now be part of that review.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> mentioned the Labour party's views. I am not here today to speak on behalf of the Labour party because it would not be appropriate for me to do so. I can endorse what my noble Friend Lord Falconer said at the Constitutional Affairs Committee the other week. It is our understanding that the Labour party will publish its response by the end of the month. We all look forward to seeing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/7">A comment was made about blind trusts administered by the Electoral Commission. The Committee on Standards in Public Life said some time ago that the problem is that their dominant feature is that the beneficiaries do not know who has contributed. That is obviously what blind trusts are about. However, it felt that that made them inappropriate because it moves away from the policy of transparency and openness that several hon. Members have tried to encourage.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> made a thoughtful contribution. He mentioned the Electoral Commission not having the involvement of politicians for a period of 10 years. The Committee on Standards in Public Life is reviewing the commission's work and that is an aspect of its work that will be examined closely. In defence of the commission, it has a group of great and good ex-Members of the House that advises it from time to time. We need to wait to hear what the Committee on Standards in Public Life has to say about whether that will be made into a formal process.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/9">I want to make it clear that thriving political parties are an essential part of not just a functioning democracy but a vibrant one. I think we would all endorse that, although no one has said it so far. We should not be afraid to stand up and say that. Several factors affect the legitimacy of the party system. We must make it clear that political parties are an important part of our form of democracy and we need them if we are to have vibrancy in our democratic system.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/10">The increasing reliance on big donors poses two risks: the appearance of the capture of a political party by that donor and the appearance of the irrelevance of individual members. The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell made that a central part of his contribution. We have moved quite far already, although much more needs to be done. We have put in place a transparent regime for the reporting of donations and have created the independent Electoral Commission. As I announced to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-20">20 March</phrase>, we are now bringing forward amendments to the Electoral Administration Bill to introduce a regime to apply to loans, which will be similar to the donations system in respect of transparency and permissibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/11">We are all responsible for the current situation. Speaking in the Grand Committee on that Bill, Lord Goodhart said:</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/12" class="indent">&quot;In retrospect, we in the Committee on Standards in Public Life were, I fear, somewhat naive in not realising that loans, even if nominally at a commercial rate of interest, could be used to evade the rules of disclosure&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March 2006</phrase>; Vol. 680, c. GC 216.]</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/13">We all accept the position as we now find it.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/14">I hope that we can use this debate as an opportunity to raise the questions that we need to ask Sir Hayden Phillips. There are difficult issues. We, as politicians and representatives of our parties, must continue to engage in them. I hope that we will use this debate as part of the contribution to his review. I look forward to further debates of this nature so that I, too, can hear the different views of Members about how we best move forward to sustain a vibrant and participatory democracy in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.421.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" speakername="Linda Gilroy" colnum="421"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h03.htm#60502h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.421.1/1">Over the past two years, through a series of debates&mdash;about our university, our burgeoning health and marine science industries, our transport challenges and the urban renaissance in my constituency&mdash;I have been able to draw to the House's attention the progress of the city of Plymouth. My Conservative predecessor left a legacy of Plymouth having the poorest ward in England. We now have an urban vision developed by leading architect David Mackay, a planning framework to implement his vision, and the award of the Royal Town Planning Institute silver jubilee cup to the city council team that is bringing it on-stream&mdash;it beat the team that is bringing the Olympic village on-stream. We will soon be unveiling the economic strategy to match our ambitious aspirations for the built environment. Progress is evident all around us in Plymouth in the form of cranes on almost every horizon. Plymouth is a city on the move. Strong partnership work across the public, private and community sectors underpins its new-found confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/2">It was therefore unsurprising that when Ofcom announced that applications were invited for a licence to operate a new commercial radio station in Plymouth, there was a lot of interest from people in the area. That interest came from people with substantial roots in the community, and with proven track records of running businesses, particularly in the radio and media industry. David Rodgers, David Fitzgerald, Ian Calvert, Richard Bath, Louise Churchill, Elaine Elliott, Alan Qualtrough, Graham Gilbert, Angela Ripon and Hugh Scully, to name but a few, came forward in respect of four bids with local roots. As well as investing their own time and money over two years and undertaking four trial broadcasts, they took into account the views of more than 4,000 people living in Plymouth, dozens of Plymouth businesses and hundreds of listeners.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/3">Unsurprisingly in the context of a city on the move, all that research pointed in the same general direction: a wish for there to be a radio station that is much more Plymouth-focused than any of the current stations, and for it to complement and reinforce the pride and confidence people have in the city. Therefore, there was consternation, disbelief, astonishment and downright anger when the bid went to an outsider, Diamond FM. Its proposals simply do not stack up in accordance with the climate of opinion in Plymouth as most people understand it.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/4">In a straw poll of immediate reaction to the decision, the chamber of commerce notes responses such as &quot;an absolute farce&quot;, &quot;unbelievable&quot;, &quot;bizarre&quot; and</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/5" class="indent">&quot;a cynical decision with enormous consequences&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/6">Other responses included</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the most arrogant abuse of power by an unelected body&quot; ,</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/8">&quot;contempt&quot;, and</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the beginning of the end of British owned local radio&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/10">For where else will British local business people collect together to invest in the region of &pound;100,000&mdash;which is how much it takes to put a local bid together properly&mdash;if a foreign-owned bank can waltz in and do what amounts to little more than desk research over the space of a month to make a successful bid?</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/11">As the Minister and Ofcom have pointed out in replies to letters written by me and other furious people, there are four criteria to which Ofcom is required to have regard in awarding licences. They are set out in section 105 of the Broadcasting Act 1990. Let us consider each of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/12">The first criterion is financial sustainability over the 12 years of the licence. It is extremely unlikely that the viability of any of the bids could have been questioned, given the substantial media shareholders who backed them. In questioning 20 advertisers, Diamond was unable to find a single one who would commit to advertising on the new radio station&mdash;hardly a ringing endorsement of its sustainability. So why did Ofcom award the licence to an applicant with financial projections which the regulator regarded as &quot;ambitious&quot;? Surely that can only mean that there is a strong probability that over time the quality of the programme service on offer will be downgraded so that the company stays profitable. From what people tell me about the way Macquarie Bank Ltd. operates, it is hardly likely to sustain a loss leader.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/13">Criterion (b) is how far the proposals cater for the tastes and interests of people living in the area which the licence covers, or any particular tastes and interests where that is the basis of the proposal. Ofcom refers to Diamond's proposal as likely to be &quot;relatively popular&quot;&mdash;which, again, is hardly a ringing endorsement. The bid is rock-based, and experience elsewhere in the UK is that rock is a notoriously difficult format with which to achieve acceptable audience levels. It also has a strong male bias, and I note that the Radio Licensing Committee considering the licence comprised of one woman among its seven members. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/14">The research of the other four applicants produced overwhelming evidence that pointed in the same direction. Why was it ignored? Why, at a time when Plymouth has such bold ambitions, was Diamond allowed to make a virtue out of not consulting people who are leading the renaissance? On page 52 of its application, Diamond states:</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/15" class="indent">&quot;we have spent no time procuring letters of support from business, civic and community leaders&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/16">Apart from Diamond's very thin local research and its making no reference to the key elements of the city's progress that I have mentioned, it wrongly quotes the name of the local paper and refers to &quot;the Plymouth Sound&quot;, which no one who is local would ever do. Surely it could have involved at least one local person who would have spotted that. Indeed, we have yet to come across any evidence that before being granted the licence it visited the city at all, except through employing market researchers. No trial service was conducted to see whether Plymothians liked what it was offering.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/17">Criterion (c) is the extent to which any proposed service would broaden the range of programmes available by way of local services, and cater for tastes and interests different from those already catered for. Diamond's application estimates that a locally provided rock-based station would cater for a taste not currently provided for. I will comment further on that claim in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/18">Ofcom refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Diamond's comprehensive local news proposals&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/20">At three minutes long per bulletin, they are certainly an improvement on those of the existing radio stations, which offer minimal local focus. Weekday news bulletins from 6.30 am to 6 pm are short&mdash;usually two minutes long&mdash;and are biased towards national and international stories. Provision of local information is minimal. However, Diamond's proposal is hardly in line with the aspirations which the more broadly based research of the other applicants demonstrated. What Plymouth really wants is much more local focus than that offered by the existing operators&mdash;97FM Plymouth Sound, Classic Gold Digital and Pirate FM.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/21">Criterion (d) is the extent to which there is evidence of demand or support for the provision of the proposed service from people living in the area. Rock-based formats always prove challenging in the UK. After nine years, Xfm still achieves only a 1.5 per cent. audience share in London. Virgin AM nationally achieves only 1.6 per cent. and in London, where it is on FM, it achieves only a 3 per cent. share. Kerrang! in the west midlands has a 3 per cent. share.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/22">Audience research suggested that those who wanted such a format also wanted minimal speech interruption of the music. Streaming and iPods increasingly make that possible, and will make achieving audience share with rock even more difficult. Rock music is readily available from at least three other services: Virgin AM, Planet Rock and Xfm on digital&mdash;the future of radio, perhaps. However, Diamond expects to achieve a 7.5 per cent. audience share in its first year, rising to 10.7 per cent. in year three.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/23">The four Diamond applications were clones of each other, the common format being classic rock. Was Diamond ever going to bother about local support or be responsive to local need? How can a genuine verdict be expected before the evidence has been examined? The sample of Plymouth opinion taken by Diamond was derisory. Its licence application states that it spoke to 452 people, and 128 stated a preference for a classic rock station&mdash;a minority of a tiny sample. So Ofcom has decided that a city with a population of between 200,000 and 300,000 people will, for at least 12 years, be landed with a radio station based on the preferences of 128 of its citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/24">What my constituents say is lacking in Plymouth is a quality local news and information service&mdash;a radio station for Plymouth. Can Ofcom really say that its award of the licence satisfies the need for comprehensive local news, let alone for a fully fledged station with broad local content? Diamond has tried to recognise that by talking up that aspect of its bid in a way that allows Ofcom to tick the box, but Diamond's provision will represent only marginally more than current providers, and in a way that is wholly unlikely to meet the aspirations revealed by other applicants' research. What a lamentable waste of precious airspace at this crucial juncture in Plymouth's future.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/25">All in all, Diamond seems to have a very tenuous claim to meet any of the four criteria. The statement Ofcom issued some weeks after the award of the licence outlining its reasoning stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/26" class="indent">&quot;given the characteristics of the area, it felt unable to indicate whether any one of the four statutory licensing criteria . . . would be likely to be regarded as of particular significance. However, it was stated that, in respect of criterion (d)&mdash;the extent to which there is evidence of local demand or support for a proposed service, Ofcom would be likely to attach greater weight to robust and meaningful evidence of demand as demonstrated by findings from research undertaken in the licence area and, if appropriate, detailed analysis of the existing market, than to evidence of local support as demonstrated by letters from potential listeners and/or advertisers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/27">Why? Had it already made up its mind that it needed to create the conditions for a formulaic, cloned approach, such as Diamond's? Diamond's bid bears a close resemblance to unsuccessful Macquarie-backed bids by Radio UK Holdings Ltd. in Swansea, the north-east and Southend. It seems clear that Ofcom was tilting the playing field to allow Macquarie bank to take its place as one of the foreign-owned UK radio operators permitted by the Communications Act 2003. What on earth else could account for its being awarded the Plymouth licence when its application was so lacking in quality? Plymothians deserve better than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/28">Diamond has no directors or senior managers with any knowledge of Plymouth that we are aware of. Tim Schoonmaker is listed as non-executive chairman. He is an American who certainly has great experience in UK radio from working with Emap, but he has recently joined Credit Suisse bank. Despite public reassurances that he will remain in post, it seems unlikely that he can do so for long, as he will be working for one of Macquarie's competitors. We now understand that Shaun Gregory, former managing director of Emap, is to become chief executive of UK Radio Holdings Ltd. We still have no idea who will manage the Plymouth radio station.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/29">By way of contrast, three other applicants&mdash;Drake FM, Plymouth Live and Radio Plymouth&mdash;are local groups, and there is abundant evidence of their seeking opinions, trialling programme services and gaining support for their plans. All three easily demonstrate the financial resources necessary to sustain a 12-year local radio licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/30">The Minister has responsibility for creative industries as well as broadcasting. I hope that he will take particular note of the recent letter that I received from Mark Hawkins on behalf of Plymouth Media Partnership, a cluster of just under 600 people involved in media and new media in the city that is set to become one of the five or six key clusters at the heart of the economic strategy that I mentioned earlier. He wrote to me as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/31" class="indent">&quot;We would like to make you aware of the astonishment and anger within the Plymouth media community at the recently announced decision by Ofcom to award a new local radio licence for the City to a company owned by an Australian Bank . . . The shock at this decision has not only been felt in Plymouth but also further afield. As one senior media executive told me 'It is a real slap in the face for an industry that has been identified as having huge potential for economic growth in the region. It is a disgrace that one of the locally owned bids did not succeed and enable the indigenous industry to grow' . . . Of equal concern is the complete disregard for the views of the people of Plymouth&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/32">Pointing out that the Diamond application showed a minority of respondents expressing an interest in the format, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/33" class="indent">&quot;The substantial combined research of the other groups indicated an entirely different need.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/34">That comes from a body that is in touch with the pulse of Plymouth in a way that no other group can claim to be with quite the same credibility. The Minister has responsibility for industries that are especially important in our region. We need to have confidence in his ability to consider what is happening in Plymouth in a joined-up way.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/35">Perversely, Ofcom's decision can only result in a sub-optimal outcome for extending choice, providing diversity for local audiences and encouraging our indigenous small and medium-sized enterprises in the media sector. That cannot be right. If the Minister believes that my arguments do not add up to enough reason to take a closer look at what is going on under the current legislation and guidance, I invite him to tell me how and when we can revisit the criteria that led to such a perverse outcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/36">Local radio should mean what it says on the tin, and I can certainly say that hell hath no fury like Plymothians who feel that they are being conned. Ofcom could scarcely have picked a less appropriate community on which to inflict a decision to grant a foreign, top-down media interest a licence for a local radio station. No city has a greater sense of new localism. If Macquarie sees the writing on the wall saying that its top-down bid is not welcome in Plymouth, perhaps the Minister can insist that it tells us sooner rather than later, and lets us have the licence back so that we can have a genuine local contest. Can he tell us whether the period that Macquarie has been allowed for developing the bid can be foreshortened? Why is it being allowed two years at this critical time in our city's history? The other bids would have been up and running much earlier. If the Minister can answer none of the above, perhaps he will consider asking Ofcom to look into whether, given the exceptional circumstances that I have described, there could be a further licence for Plymouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/37">I am sure that the anger and frustration that I am channelling into Westminster from Plymouth is palpable, and it is probably only fair to signal to the Minister that we will look for further ways to raise the issues that I have outlined&mdash;after we have considered his response, of course.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.425.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1836" speakername="James Purnell" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport"  colnum="425"  time="012:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h03.htm#60502h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.425.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Lady Winterton. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> on securing the debate. She has made an extremely powerful case, and I am sure that what she says was listened to with interest, both here and outside this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/2">This is an important issue for Plymouth, and I know that there are real concerns about the subject locally. My hon. Friend has been tireless in raising it, and in campaigning, not just on that issue but on the general importance of the economic regeneration of Plymouth. She has been discussing the issue before us with Ministers ever since the decision first came to light, as has my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton is a constant advocate of the economic regeneration of Plymouth. She is absolutely right to showcase the importance of the creative industries to that regeneration. In fact, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December</phrase> she brought a delegation from Plymouth to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to discuss the future of local television. We discussed how local television could act as a learning slope for students who want to get into the media, as well as the importance of the role that local media can play in acting as a catalyst for the development of the creative industries in Plymouth and in the south-west generally. The delegation's central point was that the media and the creative industries will be at the heart of the economic future.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/4">I have been lucky enough to visit the south-west regularly since becoming Minister with responsibility for creative industries, and I know that my hon. Friend's view about the importance of those industries is widely shared across the region, but in particular by Juliet Williams, the chair of the South West of England Development Agency. She has been centrally involved in my Department's creative economy programme. That regional development agency is actively looking to support the emerging creative industries in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/5">Of course, the media are not just of economic importance; they are also culturally and democratically significant. They help to shape our local and regional identities, and it is in the media that we have debates about the future of our cities, towns and regions. That is the second reason why the issue of a licence has been of such interest in Plymouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/6">In the brief time available to me I should like to explain how the decision was taken, reassure my hon. Friend about some of the local content issues&mdash;if I can&mdash;and perhaps explain what more can be done if she is not satisfied. The first and overwhelming point to recognise is that licensing is a matter for Ofcom, which takes its decisions independently of Government. That is quite proper; that is the view shared by all parties in the House of Commons. It is not for me to justify or defend Ofcom's decisions. That is a matter for Ofcom, and it is quite able to do that itself. However, it is worth thinking through what the consequences would be if politicians were able to double-guess Ofcom's decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/7">It is right that decisions be taken by experts, based on the evidence, because otherwise politicians would clearly have a conflict of interest in choosing radio stations that could cover politicians' activities. To understand that, one need only do a thought experiment about a licence being won by a group chaired by a member of a political party, or someone who had been involved with a political party. If the Government of the day decided to double-guess the decision taken by Ofcom, it would lead to widespread public concern. That is why the decisions are taken by Ofcom. Before Ofcom, they were taken by the Radio Authority. It is right that those decisions be independent, and Ofcom should be able to take them without feeling that Ministers are standing behind it, ready to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/8">Radio spectrum is scarce, so only a limited number of services can be made available in any one area. As my hon. Friend said, the Communications Act 2003 gives Ofcom a general duty to ensure the availability of a wide range of radio services throughout the UK. When taken as a whole, those services should be of a high quality and calculated to appeal to a variety of tastes and interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/9">The Broadcasting Act 1990 requires Ofcom to take into account several factors in awarding a radio licence, and my hon. Friend went through them. They include the applicant's ability to maintain the service, the extent to which the service caters for the tastes and interests of people living in the area and broadens the range of programmes available, and the evidence of demand or support for the proposed service. Those criteria are designed to ensure a fair and transparent evaluation mechanism for applicants. They also ensure a choice of high-quality radio services for listeners throughout the period of the licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/10">My hon. Friend was clearly concerned about localness. The Communications Act recognised the importance of the local content and character of commercial radio services. Consequently, it gave Ofcom a new duty to secure, where appropriate, that services should include programmes containing local material and that a suitable proportion of programmes should be locally made. The Act defines local material as material that is of particular interest to persons or communities living or working in an area.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/11">The localness regime does not and was not intended to dictate that licence owners should be locally based. In practice, however, Ofcom requires that stations be located in the licensed area and that the service produces at least some locally made programming. Ofcom has said that it is not appropriate to prescribe in advance a specific amount of local or locally made programming for the purposes of licensing. Rather, it is for applicants to consider what is appropriate and to construct their applications accordingly. Once proposals on local context have been made, however, they become a mandatory part of the service. A local content guarantee is therefore built into the licences.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/12">Ofcom set out in detail how those criteria were applied to the Plymouth licence award, and my hon. Friend commented on them in detail. I shall not comment on the merits of Ofcom's decision, although the regulator noted that the winning bid contained more hourly local news than bids from other applicants. Anybody listening to the debate will be clear, however, that my hon. Friend disagrees with Ofcom's decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/13">My hon. Friend asked specifically about the two-year period in which the service is to be up and running. I understand that that is a maximum and that the service will be up and running within nine months.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/14">My hon. Friend's comments also concentrated on local ownership and local representation. The foreign ownership of broadcasting services is not a new concept in the UK, and it has been possible for non-UK residents to own radio licences since the Broadcasting Act 1990. The Act allowed anyone from any member of the European economic area to own a broadcast licence, and anyone from beyond the EEA to hold cable and satellite licences. The Communications Act 2003 went one step further by removing foreign ownership restrictions on all broadcasting licences. There is nothing in legislation, therefore, to prevent a foreign company from owning a licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/15">In the case of Plymouth, Ofcom stated that the applicant would be the fifth local commercial broadcaster in the area and that the ownership of the licence by a wholly owned subsidiary of Macquarie bank would place Diamond in a strong position</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/16" class="indent">&quot;to establish a secure financial base&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/17">and mean that it would</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/18" class="indent">&quot;have access to significant resources&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/19">That is the case that Ofcom made, although, as I said, my hon. Friend has doubts about it. I am sure, however, that she will continue to raise the issue with Ofcom.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/20">To say the least, my hon. Friend has made a powerful case in explaining why Ofcom's decision has not been warmly greeted by all sections of the Plymouth community, but I hope that she will understand why I cannot pretend to be able to overturn that decision. As I said, there is no facility for ministerial double-guessing of Ofcom's decision, but my hon. Friend clearly believes that there are further issues to consider. She will therefore need to discuss those with Ofcom and, indeed, she is already doing so. I hope that she will also look at the local content guarantee and that she will be reassured that there are facilities and processes to enable us to consider any worries that might emerge about local content as the service develops.</p>
	<p pid="a.425.0/21">My hon. Friend mentioned her concern that those local content guarantees might be diluted if the service were not financially viable. She might be interested to know, however, that anyone who believes that a licence holder is failing to comply with the terms of their licence or format can complain to Ofcom. In some cases, that could lead to fines or even the loss of the licence. Moreover, Ofcom itself will conduct regular sampling of stations to ensure that they comply with their formats.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.430.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="430"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h04.htm#60502h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.430.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate at what is an opportune moment, with the latest report from the Public Accounts Committee hot off the press and the latest figures for overpayments due for publication in the coming weeks. Now is an ideal time to reflect on the current state of the tax credit system and the scale of the problem. I am also delighted to see the Paymaster General in her place. She has met me and other hon. Members to discuss the issue, and I appreciate the seriousness both with which she takes the suggestions that are put to her and with which her office has done its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/2">Hardly a week goes by without a constituent turning up at my advice surgery having experienced problems with tax credits. Later I shall highlight just three such cases, but there are many more in my constituency and the rest of the city. Each case has caused financial hardship for the individual or family concerned, many of whom live on a tight budget and who have given the Tax Credit Office the correct information and on time.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/3">Central to my remarks is my view that if a constituent has supplied all the information requested on time and informed the Tax Credit Office of any changes of circumstance, it is reasonable for them to assume that the calculation by the department would be correct. The cases that I intend to highlight are examples of where all information had been given and yet the Tax Credit Office still insisted on repayment. That injustice must not be allowed to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/4">I am sure that many hon. Members agreed with last week's report of the Public Accounts Committee, which condemned as deplorable the fact that thousands of already hard-pressed families will have to pay back money because of Revenue mistakes. We are talking about almost &pound;1.9 million in overpayments and &pound;700,000 in underpayments, out of &pound;5.7 million in awards. That is an enormous problem rate, especially when it comes to clawing back overpayments and paying out underpayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/5">The situation in Edinburgh broadly reflects the national picture. The latest figures show that almost 30,000 people across Edinburgh are in receipt of tax credits. The figures for 2003&ndash;04 show that almost 32 per cent. of tax credit awards in Edinburgh were overpaid. That left 9,800 families in the city being forced to repay an average of &pound;1,020 each. It is no secret that a similar level of overpayments for 2004&ndash;05 is widely anticipated. It is for that reason that today's debate is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/6">I would not suggest that the tax credit system has not made an important contribution, either in providing work incentives or in reducing poverty, but this debate is about the thousands of people across Edinburgh, some in real poverty, whose situation is being made much worse by a systemic failure that the Government must address. The adopted system of annual assessment was inevitably going to lead to some overpayment and underpayment of tax credits, but it is now clear that the Government grossly underestimated the scale on which the problem would occur. I am sure that hon. Members are familiar with the figures, but it is worth reminding ourselves of the sheer size of the error.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/7">In 2003&ndash;04, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs paid out around &pound;15.8 billion in child and working tax credits to 5 million families, and paid out a similar amount in the following year. In each year, around &pound;2.2 billion was overpaid to about 1.9 million families. That was more than double the amount expected when the system was initially set up. Government oversight on such a scale has contributed to the current inability of the system to cope with the magnitude of the problem that we now face.</p>
	<p pid="a.430.1/8">Without doubt, part of the problem can be traced to the complexity of the system. Often it seems so obscure that it can baffle even the experts. Far too often no explanation is given for an overpayment and the chances of getting through to someone on the helpline has, for many, seemed nigh-on impossible. Figures show that there have been millions of unanswered calls to Government helplines. That must be addressed.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.431.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02b.431.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.431.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="431"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h04.htm#60502h04_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.431.1/1">I am certainly glad to acknowledge that. I am delighted when access to a helpline is improved, not only for hon. Members but for our constituents. I take the point that the Paymaster General makes and welcome all improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/2">While the complexity of the system is undoubtedly leading to a high incidence of error, there is also a danger that vulnerable claimants, such as elderly pensioners, could be put off from taking up benefits by what they perceive as a wall of complicated forms and impenetrable jargon. Newspaper headlines revealing massive benefit clawbacks are hardly the best encouragement for those thinking of applying. I look forward to hearing the Paymaster General's comments on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/3">I should like to qualify my remarks. I do not suggest that the Government are responsible for every overpayment or underpayment in the system. I entirely agree that, if an individual fails to inform Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs of changes in circumstance or has made an attempt to hide or embellish information, it is only right that the Government should reclaim any amount overpaid. However, in too many instances mistakes have been caused by official error. It is in that context that the Government have acted entirely improperly and in which I look forward to hearing the Paymaster General's views.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/4">If constituents of mine have been open and honest in their dealings with the Tax Credit Office and yet internal mistakes have led to an overpayment, it is unacceptable to demand large amounts of money back from people who reasonably assumed that the Government would get their sums right. It is nothing short of outrageous that decent, honest, hard-working people are forced into financial hardship as a direct result of incompetence in the system. Such people are not premiership footballers who can have a few weeks' wages deducted with no adverse affects. Many tax credit recipients budget from week to week and cannot afford to have their payments halted or to pay back large sums of money that have already been spent. I appreciate that the Government have made some progress in that regard, making provisions, I understand, to write off debts worth around &pound;1 billion for those who would suffer extreme hardship as a result. Nevertheless, they have an obligation to do more. I should like them to take a leaf out of the Australian book by admitting to their mistakes, wiping the slate clean and writing off all overpayment debts resulting from official error.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/5">The effect of the Government's policy is that a constituent of mine who has been overpayed through no fault of their own and entirely through the incompetence of the Revenue will have that money reclaimed by the Government. That constituent will then have to try to stop the reclaim. One example is Mrs. Pauline Duff, who contacted me a while ago. She and her new partner moved house from one part of my constituency to the South Gyle area. The Tax Credit Office reassessed the claim and the new amount was half of what it was before. The new assessment was sent to Mrs. Duff at her new address and included her new partner's full details.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/6">In 2005, the Tax Credit Office advised that an overpayment had been made because Mrs. Duff had failed to give details of her change in circumstances. The office claimed that she had failed to inform it of her new address and of the fact that she was living with her partner. However, the letter was sent to her new address and contained all the details of her partner, so that explanation did not stand up to scrutiny. A small payment of &pound;85 in compensation has been made to Mrs. Duff for errors and delays on the part of the Tax Credit Office, but it is insisting on reclaiming from her overpayments of &pound;4,517, which she cannot afford. That is entirely wrong and unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/7">The second example is of Mr. Terence Dwyer, who became unemployed in 2003. Later that year he was successful in getting a part-time job, and then moved to a full-time job. His partner, who was then a housewife, started work as a home help for Edinburgh city council, where she remains today. They informed the Tax Credit Office of her rate of pay, number of hours and relevant details, as well as of his rate of pay, working hours and relevant details. The Tax Credit Office later advised that owing to a computer glitch it had assessed the claim on the wrong figures of joint income, despite Mr. Dwyer giving all the correct information. The glitch meant an overpayment to Mr. Dwyer of &pound;1,423. He has asked the Tax Credit Office for a breakdown of the calculations, but none was forthcoming. The office has stated in no uncertain terms that it will require all the money back. It is that fundamental unreasonableness at the heart of the system that is causing so many problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/8">A third case is that of Mrs. Mowat, a widow with four children. In July 2004, the Tax Credit Office advised her that her award was &pound;2,249. She had previously written to advise it that her second youngest child had just left school. In late 2004, she received a second notice to say that for the same period the amount that she was entitled to would be reduced to &pound;1,585. She made numerous telephone calls to the Tax Credit Office and was finally promised that the system would be rectified to show the correct date of the child's leaving school. She received an award notice in 2005, which said that she had been underpaid tax credits. In November 2005, she received the form &quot;Request to reconsider recovery of tax credits&quot;, which she filled out and returned in December 2005. No reply has yet been received.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/9">Those are three cases of people providing the details and being absolutely honest, submitting all their changes of circumstances on time. The Government form TC846 states clearly that if the Revenue has</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/10" class="indent">&quot;paid too much tax credit as a result of a mistake we have made and it was reasonable for you to believe we were paying you the correct amount, we will not ask you to pay back the amount overpaid.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/11">The use of the term &quot;reasonable&quot; is the crux of the problem. When constituents such as Mrs. Duff and Mr. Dwyer bring a case to me, they do not think that it is reasonable that they should be expected to be able to work out something on a form that they barely understood. I do not believe that the responsibility to check and correct the Revenue's mistakes should rest with my constituents. A constituent such as Mrs. Mowat, who is claiming child tax credit, should be devoting her time to helping her children with homework, not checking and correcting the mistakes of Revenue officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/12">In his last Budget, the Chancellor&mdash;who introduced the tax credit schemes&mdash;raised the threshold for changes in income that could be disregarded when provisional payments were reassessed from &pound;2,500 to &pound;25,000 in order to improve the situation. I understand that the increase has been made to cut the number of claimants whose entitlements will change when they are annually recalculated. Although the Government believe that the changes could reduce the level of overpayments by as much as a third, nevertheless they do not deal with the unfairness at the heart of the system that I have just documented. What is needed is a fundamental rethink of the benefits system and a move towards a fairer system of fixed awards and clearer award notices.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/13">I have been slightly amused by the way in which the Chancellor has managed to distance himself from recent difficulties in his party, watching troubles unfold from afar in Africa, but he will find it altogether more difficult to avoid the continuing chaos in the tax credit system. Lest we forget his words at the launch of the system, I repeat that he promised that it would help those on the lowest incomes. For a system designed to improve the lot of the worst off, it has been far from an unqualified success. Rarely has tough love been so tough. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> has said, the Chancellor should not be allowed to escape responsibility for the social and economic costs of the flawed policy. I am sure that the Paymaster General is aware of some of the comments my hon. Friend has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/14">Although teething problems are inevitable for any new system, the people of Edinburgh are entitled to expect more in the way of improvements to the system. In the words of the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, we find ourselves with a system that has become</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/15" class="indent">&quot;increasingly arcane, unwieldy and baffling both to benefit staff and customers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/16">I concede that steps have been taken to improve aspects of the problem, such as removing anomalies from housing benefit, but as the Committee put it the improvements have been &quot;rather piecemeal developments&quot; and the lack of objective ways of measuring complexity in the system means that it is difficult to see whether they have had any major effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/17">With a Government obsessed by means-testing and targets, it is clear that too many people are being failed by the system. When the Government talk about helping those on the lowest incomes, it is worth remembering that the gap between rich and poor has widened since 1997, with the percentage of the tax burden on the poorest still heavier than that on the best off. If the tax credit system was supposed to reverse that shameful record, it has a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.1/18">Many of my constituents are rightly impatient. They are suffering under the present system and are asking for what the Government have promised in statements. They will accept nothing less.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.434.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" speakeroffice="The Paymaster General"  colnum="434"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h04.htm#60502h04_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.434.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> on securing the debate today at short notice. He raises some important issues. I will deal first with the matters of policy, and say why I could not disagree more with the hon. Gentleman's assessment, and pick up on some of the points about his being inundated. I am not sure where the casework is, if it is not with me. I will then deal with the three cases that he raised, those of Mrs. Duff, Mr. Dwyer and Mrs. Mowat.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/2">First, I remind the hon. Gentleman that the debate, as he rightly says, is in connection with families in Edinburgh who receive tax credits that, with child benefit, deliver financial support to the vast majority of families with children in the UK. They play a vital role in tackling child poverty and helping make work pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/3">The hon. Gentleman repeated today, as his party often does, that the gap between rich and poor is becoming greater. That is because they choose to ignore the impact of tax credits. It is convenient to miss out information that does not fit the argument that one would want to advance.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/4">Tax credits provide more than &pound;15 billion support to nearly 20 million people. They play a major role in moving people into work and aid mobility of labour, helping men and women to move up the employment ladder, thus achieving one of the Government's aims of greater employment flexibility. That has happened in Edinburgh as it has in many towns and cities across the country. The policies, combined with economic stability, have helped to increase the number of people in work by 2.3 million. Like the US earned income tax credit, tax credits help people off benefits and into work. When people move into work the flexible tax credit system corresponds to their changes in circumstance. More and more research is coming out that demonstrates that the flexible system of tax credits is infinitely better than a fixed system that is unfair, limited and unjust in that it does not fulfil any of those objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/5">Let us consider the question of fairness, which the hon. Gentleman touched on. As I have said, the real test of fairness is that tax credits tackle family poverty. They have done that, lifting 700,000 children out of relative poverty since 1997 and more than 1.5 million out of absolute poverty, many in his constituency and mine. Tax credits are designed to be inclusive and not to stigmatise people. The hon. Gentleman may remember that the system for those out of work was entirely different from that which applied for those in work; people carried a stigma and had terrible problems in moving from unemployment into paid employment. That has been removed through the tax credits system. It is a progressive universalism; the credits help every family, but some families receive considerably more help, which is important if we are to tackle poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/6">Tax credits introduced a fundamental change to the welfare state. It is an income-related system; in effect, it is a negative tax. However, the hon. Gentleman and his party never take that point on board, nor do they include it in their calculations. The system supports 6 million families and 10 million children, with 360,000 families being helped with child care costs who were never helped under the old system. That compares favourably with the fact that only 800,000 families received family credit. Put another way, more than 19 million people benefit from tax credits. That is seven times the number who received family credit, or nearly one in three of all people.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/7">The hon. Gentleman said that the system puts people off. Let us consider the take-up figures. I do not dispute that there were computer problems in the early months of 2003&ndash;04, the scheme's first year; the problems were huge, but I have repeatedly been frank to the House about them. Despite those problems, however, tax credits were at a record level, with take-up at 80 per cent. in the first year of operation. That vastly outstripped family credit, which barely reached the upper 60s in its last year of operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/8">For low income families, the group mentioned by the hon. Gentleman as being unfairly treated, the take-up rate was about 90 per cent., which is higher than any previous income-related system of support for families with children. The figures demonstrate that take-up is not being undermined by the same problems that we saw in the first year. The reverse is true; take-up is rising steadily. That does not show a system in crisis, as the hon. Gentleman asserts; nor is it in chaos.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/9">It is a system to which people are committed and of which they have an understanding, and they know how it benefits them. How did all those people apply if the system was so difficult? The truth is that the questions are straightforward: How many children are there? How much do they earn? Do their partners earn? There are other related questions on child care, and they are asked where they live and whether they will notify us of any change in circumstance. It would be difficult to make it more straightforward and responsive.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/10">We are discussing a typical constituency&mdash;the hon. Gentleman's or mine. We are discussing a family with two children on half the average earnings; in today's climate, they would be receiving &pound;4,200 a year more as a result of the tax credits. Indeed, the very poorest can now receive up to &pound;107 a week, compared with &pound;20 in 1997. It is breathtaking that the hon. Gentleman should assert that those families are worse off and that they do not get what they should from the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.434.0/11">Evidence continues to show that money is going to those families. The evidence is not the Department's, but an independent assessment of the system, and it shows that the money is benefiting the children. As the poorest have seen their incomes rise, they have increased their expenditure on children's clothes and on fruit and vegetables faster than average family spending. That is crucially important; it goes to the heart of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.438.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="438"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h05.htm#60502h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.438.1/1">Raising the issue of the teaching of social behaviour in primary schools is simply the most important thing that I can do as a Back-Bench MP for the future of my constituency. In November, I became chair of the local strategic partnership in Nottingham, which we have revived and relaunched as One Nottingham. Its mission is to tackle deprivation and inequality not by running after symptoms, but by prevention and early intervention. One Nottingham has three emblematic policies: to create a city strategy to bring people on incapacity benefit back into work; to co-ordinate activity on the 50 most difficult families in Nottingham; and, most importantly, to teach social behaviour to every primary school child in our city. We continue to develop that work and offer neighbourhood renewal funding in co-ordination with our partners, especially the local education authority, and with full support from Ministers responsible for schools, for which I am most grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/2">Why teach social behaviour in primary schools? Our white, working-class, outer-city former council estates are beset by the symptoms of educational failure, including petty criminality, antisocial behaviour, teenage pregnancy, low aspirations and low academic attainment. Eleven per cent. of kids going to secondary school cannot read the first lesson. We send fewer kids to university than any other constituency in the UK. All those symptoms can be tracked back to the inability to learn effectively because of poor social, emotional and communication skills. The teaching of social behaviour is designed to give youngsters at primary school the essential skills that we all take for granted, but in my constituency are not always taught by parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/3">Ofsted inspection after Ofsted inspection reports that, despite high standards of teaching, leadership and environment in local primary schools, youngsters do not attain acceptable standards. The reports go on to state that many of those children arrive at school unable to complete a sentence and to recognise a letter or a number. In those circumstances, it is essential that the children are given the social toolkit to be able to learn, rather than being squeezed into a middle-England academic model, which dooms them at the age of five to a lifetime of failure. The Government are now helping us to address the causes of the problems, rather than the symptoms, which is most welcome. To drive ever harder on the consequences&mdash;be they child abuse or young people not obtaining five A to C grade GCSEs&mdash;without addressing the causes is no longer a sustainable or long-term strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/4">What is social behaviour? Essentially, learning social behaviour involves learning the skills necessary to progress at school and the ability to resolve arguments without violence, to empathise with classmates and to develop self-respect and mutual respect. It includes responsibility for and ownership of behaviour. Children need to understand that their actions have consequences for themselves and others. They need to learn techniques for solving day-to-day problems, particularly alternative courses of action to deal with provocative situations.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/5">Social behaviour means children valuing themselves and their achievements. Poor self-esteem is at the root of many conflict situations. If children have a belief in their own worth and potential, they are much more likely to value and respect others. Teaching social behaviour means growing the ability to understand, share and express feelings appropriately. Children with competent communication skills, who are effective listeners and who can co-operate and express feelings appropriately, are better equipped to manage in the classroom.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/6">A social behaviour curriculum includes responsibility for and empathy towards others. It includes helping children to put themselves in another person's position, to see themselves as part of a group, to learn from others, to be receptive to others and their perceptions and to be tolerant of others' views. Social behaviour means being able to co-operate. I am talking about children being helped to acquire the skills that will help them to work with others not only at school but in their working life. It means being able to make and evaluate decisions&mdash;to reflect on decisions and their outcomes&mdash;and to analyse situations effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/7">Those attributes of emotional intelligence, which middle-class kids take for granted, are often absent in Nottingham, despite the excellent early years and children's centre work. Social behaviour is not a cuddly add-on to the so-called proper teaching of academic subjects; it is the pre-requisite for that teaching and attainment. One head teacher told me this weekend that of a sample group of children who behaved badly in his school, only 4 per cent. attained age-appropriate academic standards when tested.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/8">However, this issue is not only about education. With the respect agenda, we are beginning to understand that if the tackling of antisocial behaviour is to be effective, it must be complemented by the earliest possible promotion of social behaviour. Likewise, the objectives of our health and our skills partners in Nottingham&mdash;for example, on improving life expectancy and widening vocational training&mdash;will be met only by rounded, socially able young people who can break out of the inter-generational cycle that we are suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/9">I do not necessarily say that social behaviour has to be taught everywhere, but in areas such as mine&mdash;in areas that need and want this&mdash;we need to do for social behaviour what we have done so successfully for literacy and numeracy. I ask central and local government to reflect on what we can learn from that success. Standards in literacy and numeracy have been raised in&mdash;I have scribbled down eight key ways, but I am sure there are more.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/10">First, standards in literacy and numeracy have been given a special place at the heart of the compulsory national curriculum. Targets for improvement have been set and rigorously monitored at national, local and school level. Secondly, head teachers have been trained in effective leadership and management of literacy and numeracy in their schools. Thirdly, schools have been held to account, through Ofsted inspections, for the quality of the literacy and numeracy teaching that they provide. Fourthly, local authorities have received high levels of funding to appoint literacy and numeracy consultants to provide training and support to schools. Fifthly, lead people in schools&mdash;literacy and numeracy co-ordinators&mdash;have been appointed. Sixthly, massive investments have been made in information and communications technology resources&mdash;for example, materials for use with interactive whiteboards&mdash;to teach literacy and numeracy. Seventhly, huge efforts have been made to involve parents, even those who are harder to reach, in supporting the teaching of numeracy and literacy in schools. Eighthly, schools are receiving large amounts of Government funding to provide additional one-to-one and group support for children who need extra help to catch up with their peers.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/11">There must be investment in social education in the local education authority areas that need it that is comparable to the investment that we have made, wisely, in the teaching of mathematics and literacy. That investment must be made in supporting children who need help to catch up in social and emotional skills, in ICT, in school-based co-ordinators who are enabled to develop their own in-depth expertise through professional studies in social and emotional learning, and in intensive, funded support for the learning and skills council in order to enable schools to involve parents. I am referring to family social and emotional aspects of learning programmes to parallel the successful family literacy and numeracy programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/12">Some people worry that academic achievement will be squeezed out if school time is needed to teach social behaviour. The opposite is true. Once we equip young people to learn, the academic achievement in what are currently educational deserts will blossom beyond imagination. We need to stop swatting the mosquitoes and start draining the swamp. Since the last debate on this subject, which was three years ago, I have been reinforced in my belief in the value of social behaviour teaching. Everyone&mdash;Ministers, practitioners and local head teachers&mdash;is starting to realise that that early investment is essential if we are not to waste all these young people's lives and to incur the massive lifetime financial costs of failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/13">I recently visited Sweden, which has had the stability necessary to develop the preventive policies required. The standard practice there is for one year's paternity and maternity leave to be followed by the child going into a nursery at the age of one so that their social skills are developed, enabling them to make the best of the academic curriculum, which does not begin to be taught until the age of seven. In Finland, which has the highest academic attainment in Europe, a similar concept of developing a rounded, properly socialised young person is central to its levels of achievement. The lesson is that personal development precedes and facilitates academic achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/14">In Nottingham, we have already started down the road of teaching social behaviour in every primary school. One third of primary schools in Nottingham took part in the social and emotional aspects of learning&mdash;SEAL&mdash;pilot, which ended in August 2005, and which we are now rolling out nationally. Already the LEA has agreed that it</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/15" class="indent">&quot;will roll out the social behaviour programme and make it available to all primary schools in future. We will use all our education improvement networks and key staff such as education psychologists and education welfare officers to promote the good work when they visit schools and to offer training and support to the schools. We will evaluate our work to see what has gone well and build on that with new initiatives.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/16">We are looking to go further. In my capacity as chair of One Nottingham, I am seeking to agree with our partners, including Department for Education and Skills officials, regional advisers and the local education authority, a series of further measures in a Nottingham pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/17">The Minister's colleague, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools, has already written to me stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/18" class="indent">&quot;we support your working in partnership with the LEA to approach perhaps 20 primary headteachers in Nottingham with a view to carrying out a pilot around the teaching of social behaviour which&mdash;if successful&mdash;could be rolled out across the city&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/19">The letter continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/20" class="indent">&quot;in addition to teaching this holistically across the curriculum schools would approach this through a discreet hour, possibly on a daily basis, to give it a comparable impact to the successful teaching of literacy and numeracy. This raises issues of curriculum space, teacher training, and curriculum content which partnerships need to resolve However, neighbourhood renewal funding, which you have offered from One Nottingham, will enable staff training and curriculum development to take place swiftly&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/21">Discussions to make progress in that direction will continue, especially with the local education authority, and notably with Edwina Grant and Councillor Graham Chapman, the director and chair of the children and young people's department.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/22">Ministers, the Department, Ofsted and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority have already done much to make it plain that such an approach by the LEA and heads will be supported. However, 20 years of indoctrination into a target-driven top-down culture cannot be undone overnight, whatever flexibilities are said to exist in the current system. Excellent people locally, such as those in the LEA and school heads, need to be clearly and constantly reassured that if they do what they know to be right in local circumstances they will not be penalised on inspection.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/23">I emphasise again that this is not a soft option, but the solution to Nottingham's educational problems. Achievement in this area and the measurement of social behaviour attainment has to be at least as tough as it is in the case of literacy and numeracy, with clear and effective benchmarks demanded and consistent year-on-year improvement sustained.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/24">We might also want to think about the messages given by current inconsistencies relating to what we expect schools to deliver in the curriculum. Personal, social and health education is not compulsory in the primary years. Citizenship is compulsory in secondary, but it is afforded little status and is in need of a radical review to bring in the explicit teaching of social and emotional skills. Might it not be time to look again at the curriculum to ensure that it is designed&mdash;like the literacy and numeracy curriculums&mdash;on the basis of a framework of social and emotional competencies, with a clear progression from zero to 19 to which all our children and young people are entitled?</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/25">Once we have established the teaching of social behaviour in primary schools in Nottingham it will be important to do something similar in secondary schools. The social and emotional skills covered there need to build on those developed in primary education and include relationship, family and parenting skills, pre-empting high teenage pregnancy rates and the 58 per cent. of Nottingham births that take place out of wedlock. That will allow us to complete the virtuous circle of effective intervention, not just at primary and pre-school levels, but at the pre-pregnancy stage by ensuring teenagers have a better understanding of how to raise a family, sustain viable relationships and help their children attain prior to school.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/26">It is impossible to overestimate the positive impact that that will have, and not just on crude academic attainment, but on health, crime, skills, quality of life and personal relationships. Enabled youngsters will learn, attain and achieve, and pass on these gifts to their own children, thus busting out of the cycle of inter-generational failure. Not having the will to do it will trap families, and communities such as mine, into repeated failure, underachievement and waste with the accompanying symptoms of bad behaviour in school, antisocial activity on our streets, criminality, joblessness and drug abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/27">The partnership with One Nottingham, the LEA, Government, head teachers and others is addressing the need to teach social behaviour in our primary schools. We can pay lip service to it, or get on and do it. The choice rests with us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-02a.442.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and Skills"  colnum="442"  time="013:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060502/halltext/60502h05.htm#60502h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.442.0/1">May I begin by saying how much of a pleasure it is to respond to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>? His remarks reflected the close and passionate interest he takes in the future well-being of children and families in his constituency. It is clear that he is closely engaged with some of the most difficult issues in his constituency. I congratulate him on his advocacy on behalf of his constituency this afternoon and I recognise that this issue has not just appeared on his horizon; he has been talking about it for some time. He has had a chance, therefore, to develop his opinions and ideas on the subject in a significant way during the past few years. I know that he has been tackling Ministers at various levels of the Government about this matter through every method known to the Back-Bench parliamentarian, and I congratulate him on his persistence.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/2">I found it interesting to listen to my hon. Friend's list of things to do for One Nottingham, and I wish it every success in its three specific quests. If he manages all of that, I might come to him for advice on how to run a Whitehall Department. There is no doubt that focusing on important issues and tackling them with great gusto is one way of making organisations and partnerships work, and I wish him every success.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/3">My hon. Friend is right to say that social behaviour teaching has a vital role to play in helping to equip children to behave well and to learn, enabling them to take full advantage of the opportunities available to them at school and helping them to realise their potential. If school is for anything, it is to help children realise their potential. The work also contributes directly to the &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; outcomes for children, which is why my Department is so interested in the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/4">My hon. Friend is right to say that, far from some trendy or peripheral subject that might be thrown in if there is an extra bit of time in the day, such teaching relates to the hard-edged skills that our children need to thrive and that promote good social behaviour, such as anger management, conflict resolution and resilience. If children do not develop those social, emotional and behavioural skills, the real risk is that they will be more likely to disengage from learning, which can, as he described, lead to a downward spiral of poor behaviour and under-achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/5">Most parents, of course, go a long way towards teaching their children such skills, but it is undeniable that some children inevitably receive less support than others, and their development cannot be left to suffer as a result. All children, no matter how well their parents teach them, can benefit from the reinforcement of social behaviour learning in school. Teaching social behaviour needs to be central to children's education. The Government are committed to promoting social behaviour in primary schools. Investing early helps children develop the skills at a young age, and to continue to develop them as they move through primary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/6">A key plank of the Department's national behaviour and attendance strategy is the social and emotional aspects of learning programme, to which my hon. Friend has referred, which I shall call SEAL. It is an annoying acronym, but it is quicker to say. The programme was made available to all primary schools in June last year. The five key social and emotional aspects of learning on which it focuses are self-awareness, managing feelings, motivation, empathy and social skills. They are the underpinning qualities and skills that help promote positive behaviour and effective learning. In fact, they underlie almost every aspect of our lives, enabling children to get on with others and become responsible citizens. We are committed to ensuring that the programme is properly taught.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/7">The SEAL programme provides an explicit, structured, whole-curriculum framework and resource for teaching social, emotional and behavioural skills to all pupils. It also provides for the progressive teaching of age-appropriate skills development from the foundation stage to year 6, and I welcome my hon. Friend's support for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/8">To be fully effective, heads and other school staff must feel some real commitment to the work. It follows that the programme is better if it is voluntary, and individual schools should be able to determine the best way of taking the work forward. They are best placed to assess the needs of their pupils and school, and how to make best use of the SEAL resource. Most schools undertake related work, and SEAL builds on the good work that is already present. Teachers report that it can be readily adapted to fit existing work and the unique character of a school.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/9">We do not expect work on SEAL to be confined to a particular time in the school day, although there is no reason why a school should not include a dedicated SEAL period in its programme if it wishes. However, SEAL needs to infuse the whole school and the curriculum. There are ideas and materials for promoting skills across the curriculum through existing work, so schools do not need to devote significant amounts of extra time to SEAL work; it can be threaded through the school day.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/10">As my hon. Friend said, SEAL also makes a helpful contribution to the delivery of aspects of PSHE and citizenship. Evidence from primary schools shows that the non-statutory framework provides a good basis to deliver effective programmes of citizenship and PSHE. I recognise that there are arguments for including PSHE in the compulsory part of the curriculum, but there is no evidence that it does not work when delivered properly and voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/11">I am pleased to say that the evaluation of the SEAL pilot programme carried out by London university's Institute of Education was positive. SEAL had a major impact on the development of children's social, emotional and behavioural skills, as my hon. Friend argued in his speech it would. Teachers reported that it created a calmer environment in the classroom, contributing to improvements in learning and attainment. Again, my hon. Friend suggested that such teaching would do so. In key stage 2 national test scores, schools implementing SEAL and other aspects of the primary behaviour and attendance pilot made consistent improvements across all subjects from 2003 to 2005. They were above the national average for maintained primary schools. There is some evidence in the evaluation that the programme can make the sort of impact that my hon. Friend suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/12">The Department's standards fund is providing just over &pound;7 million to help schools and local authorities implement SEAL in the current school year. The aim is for about one third of primary schools to be implementing some or all aspects of SEAL by July. The programme is on target, and interest in schools is high and positive. My hon. Friend will be interested to know that a similar sum has been allocated for next year to continue the SEAL roll-out. A key principle is to support schools to develop experience and expertise in this area of learning, and to encourage them to share it with others to promote the national roll-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/13">In that regard I was interested to hear what my hon. Friend said about Nottingham, his constituency and council. I am pleased to hear about the commitment in Nottingham to teach social behaviour in primary schools, as is my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools. My hon. Friend quoted from a letter that she has written to him on the subject. She takes a particular interest in the subject, and she is absent today only because of other duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/14">I am also pleased to hear about the strategic approach that my hon. Friend is promoting and that the local authority and local partners are taking. I understand that Nottingham has been involved with the development of SEAL for some time, originally volunteering to join the pilot, which always shows good spirit. It is well placed to implement the programme throughout the local authority. I am pleased about the enthusiasm for it in Nottingham, and I am pleased to hear that many schools are adopting it and others plan to do so in the next school year.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/15">My hon. Friend in his various capacities has had discussions with Nottingham about testing out approaches to strengthening the impact of SEAL locally. From his remarks, he clearly believes that that is the way forward in his area. I understood what he said about the particularly great need in his part of the world to teach social behaviour. I understand that Nottingham city council is to develop leading primary schools so that they become specialist centres of excellence for programme implementation and coaching. There will be a high skills capacity among staff using the SEAL resource, and they will then help support the development of school staff and other children's services professionals in the area. It is a commendable and positive way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/16">Schools already have sufficient freedoms in place to devote more time to SEAL if they wish. However, using the power to innovate would provide reassurance and certainty for heads. The Department is ready to advise about that. We will watch closely what Nottingham does, looking with interest at the pilot that my hon. Friend and other local partners, including the local authority, develop in order to take SEAL forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.442.0/17">I agree with my hon. Friend that we should not confine our attention to primary schools.</p>
