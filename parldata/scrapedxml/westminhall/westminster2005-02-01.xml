	<p pid=".179.3/1">It is a great pleasure to have another opportunity to talk about agriculture in the south-west. This is the second such debate that I have introduced in Westminster Hall and it is a great disappointment that we do not often debate what is still a key industry. I am delighted to see the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/690" name="Nick Ainger">the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger)</phrase>, here to respond to the debate in his capacity as a Government Whip, but I am disappointed that his ministerial colleagues could not find a space in their no doubt busy engagement list to discuss an issue that, for many people in my part of the world, is hugely important. Although I accept that they have engagements elsewhere, many people will interpret their absence as symptomatic of the Government's indifference, and to some extent that of Parliament, to agricultural issues nowadays.</p>
	<p pid=".179.3/2">There was a time when we had a Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Agriculture questions and regular debates on the subject&mdash;sometimes too regular during the foot and mouth disease crisis and, previous to that, the BSE epidemic. It is incredible that agriculture has virtually been airbrushed out of the political agenda. When we have had the opportunity to tackle Ministers, the attitude that is so often evinced is one of apparent complacency in the face of what I regard as a crisis in the industry.</p>
	<p pid=".179.3/3">Let me stress first the importance of farming to the west country. It is often said that farming no longer employs that many people directly and that it is no longer a major economic factor in the region, or indeed any region in the country, so why should we bother about it? We must remember that 80 per cent. of the landscape in the south-west is under agricultural production. Without that production, we would not have the landscape that people visit and which swells the coffers of the tourism industry in the west country.</p>
	<p pid=".179.3/4">Let us remember the scale of agriculture in the south-west: our production is three times that of Wales and equal to that of Scotland. Agricultural issues seem to receive much closer attention in the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Parliament than in this Parliament, where one has to struggle to have one's voice heard. In answer to a question on the general public's biggest worry about the landscape of the south-west, which people were asked last year in a Campaign to Protect Rural England survey, 38 per cent. of respondents said the loss of working farms. This is a serious issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.179.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="179"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew1">
	<p pid=".179.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is speaking cogently on a subject that he is very knowledgeable about. Will he bear it in mind that the loss of agricultural businesses also means a loss of valuable employment in the south-west, especially in remote rural areas, where it is often difficult to find alternative jobs?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.180.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="180"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew2">
	<p pid=".180.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. In some ways, his constituency is not dissimilar to mine and it has high dependence on such jobs. The assumption that somehow everything will turn out all right and that new opportunities will appear through a magical process of diversification is wrong. The further demise of the agriculture industry will bring serious structural problems in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid=".180.0/2">Recently published figures show that income from farming has been reduced by 5.4 per cent., which Lord Whitty described as disappointing. Disappointing is not the word that I would use in that context. He then tried to put a gloss on that loss by saying that diversification is increasing. Let us be clear about diversification: we all support it and want new opportunities in the rural economy, but diversification per se is no substitute for productive agriculture. We still need the core business. We can diversify as much as we like, but if the core business falls through the floor, we will no longer have working farms.</p>
	<p pid=".180.0/3">Within diversification programmes, a lot of farmers in my area are actively examining alternative uses of their land for production in novel areas, yet the Government's response has been feeble at best in terms of, for example, encouraging crops for energy, introducing plant to treat grain for ethanol production or using miscanthus for combined heat and power schemes. Even in terms of productive diversification, we have a serious problem of attitude.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.180.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="180"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew3">
	<p pid=".180.1/1">Ministers and others blithely recommend that farmers pursue a policy of diversification instead of continuing in their traditional manner. Does my hon. Friend agree that in the Government's south-west zone, which includes a large number of tourism areas, over the past generation, if not before, farmers have been at the forefront of diversification, particularly with farm holidays and many visitor facilities on farms? Ministers need to go out and see the initiative that farmers have been showing for decades.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.180.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" speakername="David Heath" colnum="180"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew4">
	<p pid=".180.2/1">My hon. Friend is right. I do not wish to point the finger at the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire, because I know the sort of constituency he represents, but there is an urban mentality that does not see beyond the city limits in terms of what is happening and what could be encouraged. My fundamental point is that all the diversification in the world will not help if we lose the core business and do not have farms on which people can stay and enjoy their summer holidays. That is crucial to our understanding of the situation.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/2">I intend to concentrate on dairy farming, because it is a key element of agriculture in my constituency. Other hon. Members whose constituencies are more given over to arable crops or to rearing sheep on upland areas may have differing views. My constituency is essentially a lowland constituency with some of the best dairy farms in the country. I have always argued&mdash;no one has yet satisfactorily argued against me&mdash;that there are more dairy cows in my constituency than anywhere else in this country, given that it is geographically large with a high concentration of dairy farms. Sadly, that number is reducing almost daily, which is why it was so important to secure this debate.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/3">Before I move on to dairy farming, I shall make a few general points. There is a great deal of concern about the transitional arrangements for the revised common agricultural policy. I understand all the arguments and why the emerging programme looks like it does&mdash;to some extent it is a compromise proposal. What I cannot accept is the shambles in the Rural Payments Agency that will result in delays in payments for farmers. It is not good enough that sufficiently robust arrangements were not put in place early enough. That will have drastic effects on some farm businesses. If farmers cannot rely on their cash flow and have to renegotiate arrangements with their banks, that will be sufficient to cause huge financial difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/4">I would like the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire, if he can, to give a clear commitment that interim payments will be made when there are delays and there is a prospective difficulty for farmers. It has not yet been made clear whether that is the proposal, but I strongly recommend it to him.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/5">The hon. Gentleman might have anticipated me raising the position of traditional cider orchards, which are a key element, although not a major factor, in my constituency. He will know that I have raised the issue consistently during the past year; I had an Adjournment debate on the subject. I have to say that I am extremely pleased at the progress that the Government appear to be making. The scientific report that sought a satisfactory definition of traditional orchards was well argued and came to the right conclusions. I cannot honestly see the difference between traditional and commercial orchards in the context of the environmental payments scheme, because all orchards make an extremely benign use of land, which should be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/6">I was particularly worried about losing a key part of the Somerset landscape&mdash;our traditional cider orchards. As I have said, the Department has done good work on the matter and said that it was going to Brussels to try to secure acceptance, but I have never had a definitive answer on whether that acceptance has been forthcoming from the Commission, and therefore on whether the saga of orchard definitions for the purpose of bringing orchards within the single farm payments scheme has come to an end. Will the hon. Gentleman put my mind at rest? If he can do so, I shall be delighted, as I will have won a small but significant battle on behalf of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/7">I move on to the issue of regulatory burden, which is key for many farmers. They are looking ahead at what inspection will result from the ghastly, enormously complex regime of cross-compliance. A simple argument has been put forward: farmers ought to know what the inspectors will inspect. In other words, the guidelines when published should be clear and understandable to everyone involved. I would go further and say that a single inspection regime and co-operation between the various regulatory bodies, whenever possible, would be extraordinarily helpful, as the man from the Ministry would not be tramping over farms regularly and unexpectedly, but the inspection regimes would have coherence of some sort.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/8">The issue of agricultural waste regulations is looming. I do not think that we yet have any concept of the likely consequence of what is proposed for many farmers. I accept that the regulations come from Europe and that the Government are consulting on how they will be implemented, but I say to the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire that if the impact is anything like we fear, it will put a colossal cost on to farm businesses&mdash;even more so if farmers are to be responsible for the cost of disposing of material that is fly-tipped on farms.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/9">Fly-tipping is a big issue in many rural areas and it is estimated that anything up to 600,000 tonnes of extraneous material is tipped on farms. If farmers are to be responsible for getting rid of that through high-cost methods, it will be a very significant burden on them.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/10">Over the years, I have continually raised the one-sided nature of regulation. The inspectors, the Ministry and the payments agency decide what is right and wrong; the farmer pays the penalty and is in the process often made to feel like a criminal for what is essentially administrative error. Yet there is no arbitration on whether a mistake has been made in good faith or whether the regulators, rather than the farmer, are wrong. I have long argued that there should be an agricultural ombudsman. We still need such a process&mdash;perhaps more so under the new arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/11">My last point, which relates to dairying but has more general implications, is the problem of animal disease. Effectively combating animal disease could be a significant cost to the Exchequer, but also a significant issue in animal welfare. The compensation proposals are fine in some ways. There ought to be recognition of the differential value of different animals. For example, a cow is not a cow by definition, as there are many different breeds and different values according to circumstance. If we want the compensation scheme, and if we want the disease control measures to be effective, we must recognise the intrinsic value of the beast in question.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/12">It is impossible not to mention bovine tuberculosis in a debate of this kind, but, to be frank, I do not know where we go from here. I have long argued that we need the scientific background, which the Krebs trials were supposed to produce, but we do not have it. However, we have the Irish study, a mushrooming problem of bovine tuberculosis and prima facie evidence of links with the badger population.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/13">I do not want the eradication of the badger species&mdash;nobody does, or I hope nobody does. Equally, I want robust disease precautions to be applied to protect our domestic animal population. Laissez-faire, which is the attitude of the Department, is not sustainable even in the short term, let alone the longer term.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/14">We all want an effective vaccination programme, which will prevent the spread of the disease from the badger population, but that seems to be like nuclear fusion power&mdash;something that is always 10, 15 or 20 years ahead and which we never quite reach. That is unfortunate. I can only urge that we redouble our efforts to find something effective. I do not believe that the answer is beyond the wit of the scientific community, if provided with sufficient resources and encouragement.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/15">Let me move on to the key issue, which is that of dairying. We know from the Milk Development Council report and every other bit of evidence that we are losing a massive number of dairy farms across the country. Indications are that the number is 40 every week, and we have lost a third of them since 2000. We know that dairy farming, which has always been extremely hard work in respect of keeping holdings going, is now hard work for very little reward. The estimate is that the average dairy farmer receives less than &pound;3 an hour for a 70-hour week, which would be illegal were that person to be an employee.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/16">In the south-west, an estimated 1,000 dairy farms have disappeared over three years. The estimate is that we will lose a further 30 per cent. of those remaining over the next two years. That is a colossal reduction in the number of dairy holdings.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/17">The noises from the Government and those associated with the Government appear to be based on platitudes. At Environment questions recently, the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality was very keen to say that milk production is level and that there has not been a marked reduction. That is true&mdash;the market is seeing to that for the time being. He was keen to point out that there are big differences in profitability between different dairy farm businesses. That is true, and has always been true. Some have been able to invest since the BSE and foot and mouth crises and some have not. Those who have not find themselves less profitable than those who have.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/18">Others have pointed out that land prices in the south-west are level or rising and that that indicates that we have a prosperous farming industry. I think the reverse is true, because the people who are buying the land are not the farmers but, in most cases, big business or those who want a bit of landscape for their ponies and are using City money to buy it.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/19">The concept that small farms are of necessity less efficient is transparently not the case. Many small dairy farms are just as efficient as big farms. The issue is not whether they are more efficient, as Lord Haskins would have us believe. He seems strongly to recommend large holdings, which perhaps fit into his style of business better than the traditional family farm. The issue is that small farms cannot afford to suffer losses in the same way.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/20">Some people are dealing with small farms that are making a loss and that require them to go out at all times and in all weathers to make an inadequate wage for themselves and their family. They are sitting on an asset that has huge capital value and eventually they succumb, whatever their personal feelings, to the view that this is not sustainable for them and their family. The result is that we are losing small and medium-sized farms and family farm businesses. Amalgamations are happening, and big agribusiness is taking up the slack and taking up the dairy farms.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/21">That might be okay&mdash;I would argue that it is not&mdash;but there is an argument that it makes for a profitable and sustainable dairy sector, except for one thing. If farm-gate prices are inadequate to provide a return on the investment, there is no commitment from the big businesses to the sector as there is from the family farmer who has kept dairy cattle on the holding for many years. There is no commitment to stay with the undertaking&mdash;agribusiness will follow the bottom line.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/22">Unless we do something about the profitability of the dairy sector, we will be in an intensely vulnerable situation where milk production will not stay level, but will fall through the floor because business will take its investment elsewhere. We are in dire danger of losing our dairy farming industry.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/23">This is very serious issue. On the farm-gate price for milk, we know that farmers get a 40 per cent. share and that they got 60 per cent. 10 years ago. That is an unreasonable drop in profit share and it has been made up by an increase in the share of the big supermarkets. We know that is the case and that it has an effect on primary producers and on the processors.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/24">There is a contraction of the domestic dairy processing industry. The processors are not the wicked elements in the chain and they are contracting in exactly the same way. The Diary Crest Yoplait plant in Yeovil recently closed down, which is a straw in the wind for what could be a major collapse on the dairy processing side.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/25">If we are not careful, the remaining 4,000 or so dairy farms in this country will disappear. Effectively, we will be exporting our industry to our European competitors. I cannot for the life of me see the sense in that or why it is sensible not to produce milk on the finest dairy lands in Europe&mdash;in the west country&mdash;and to import it.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/26">The key is the transparency of the supply chain in the dairy industry, the position of the supermarkets and the inadequacy of the supermarket code of conduct to do anything to moderate the attitude or performance of the big supermarkets. The market is distorted: between them, the large retailers form a classic oligopoly and they do not act in the interests of the whole supply chain. They may act in the temporary interests of the consumer, but I argue that, in the long term, it is very much to the detriment of the consumer to lose British milk, cheese and other dairy products.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/27">Unless we have a system that strengthens the supermarket code of conduct and allows binding intervention, there will be no genuine market in milk. That is not to argue against free enterprise and the operation of the market; it is to argue for the operation of a fair market, rather than one that is distorted by the supermarket oligopoly.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/28">It is extraordinary that the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, supported by the Government, argue against the vertical integration that was so crucial in this country. Wherever else we look in the world where there is a thriving dairy industry working within the constraints of a free market, we see effective vertical integration without the constraint that I have described. It is perverse that Tesco has a bigger hold on the market than Milk Marque ever did. I cannot understand how that was allowed to come about.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/29">My plea to the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire is familiar, as, like others, I have pursued the issue doggedly over the past few years: until we get the farm-gate price of milk up to a sustainable level, there will be no fair market for milk. Without a fair market, there will be no effective future for dairy farming. If there is no future for dairy farming, we shall lose the industry and it will move towards extinction.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/30">I take no pleasure in saying that and I do not believe that I am being unnecessarily pessimistic or, as the Minister for Rural Affairs and Local Environmental Quality accused me of being a week or so ago, hyperbolic. I simply believe that we must do something now to save an industry that is a crucial part of the economy of my part of the world and of the whole United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".180.2/31">I want the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire to advise Ministers, as they are so busy in Exeter or elsewhere, that we need effective intervention now. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs must stand up to colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry and make them see what damage is being done to the industry. We need an effective supermarket code of conduct that is not just a pious intention, but a reality that is enforced to provide a transparent and fair supply chain for milk. Only by providing that will we give farmers the security they need to plan their businesses and to ensure both the safety of their undertakings and a future for them and their families. To me, that is still important. It is also important in the context of the west country and Somerset, and I urge Ministers to take action.</p>

	<p pid=".185.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to catch your eye. I start by declaring my entry in the Register of Members' Interests as a farmer and chartered surveyor. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> on securing the debate. Agriculture is an extremely important sector in the south-west economy, and he is right to say that we want it to flourish as far as possible. Many of our constituents and those of other hon. Members in the Chamber depend, directly or indirectly, on a profitable agricultural sector. I welcome the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/690" name="Nick Ainger">the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger)</phrase>, who will respond to the debate on behalf of the Government. I am sure that it cannot be long before he is elevated to a speaking, rather than a silent, job. I am delighted to see him here this morning.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/2">The speech of the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome ranged widely, and rightly so. In the short time available to me, I want to deal with a few issues affecting agriculture. As he says, the latest Government statistics show that agricultural profitability has dropped by 5.4 per cent. It is almost as though that came as a surprise to the Government; I could have told them almost for a certainty that there would be a drop in profitability.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/3">There is an awful lot of gloom and doom about in the industry at the moment, as everyone knows. I was talking to a constituent of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1150" name="James Paice">my hon. Friend the Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase> yesterday&mdash;a major agricultural adviser whom my hon. Friend will know well. In his 30 years of advising farmers, he has never known there to be such dismal prospects for the future. He told me of one very large East Anglian business that had made a profit for the past 20 years. Last year, for the first time, it made a loss. That is the trend in agriculture. Some of the responsibility for that malaise has to be laid at the Government's door. I do not want to make this into a political debate, but there are certain things that the Government can do.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/4">First, the Government could try to help those sectors with great balance-of-payments deficits. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome has gone into the dairy industry in great depth, and we basically know the causes of the problem in that industry. It seems strange that although the Government talk about wanting to establish strong co-operatives to market agricultural products properly, one of their first acts was to dismantle vertical integration in Milk Marque.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/5">One of the problems in the dairy industry is that we export the cheap dairy products&mdash;liquid milk and milk powder&mdash;and import the expensive value-added products, such as cheese and yoghurt. That is crazy; we ought to be doing exactly the opposite. We are not only contributing to the balance-of-payments deficit, which is almost at a record in this country, but are, as the hon. Gentleman said, exporting jobs to our continental neighbours. That seems utterly crazy. We could well do with the jobs here. We in the south-west, along with those in the north-west, have some of the best temperate climates and soils for producing dairy products in the whole world. It seems absolutely crazy to set that land aside and do nothing with it when it could be producing perfectly profitable dairy products.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/6">The hon. Gentleman did not like me mentioning Waitrose the last time I did so, but it has some very good contracts with dairy farmers, and I praise it for that. It has direct contracts with farmers and can offer them a slightly higher price. It knows precisely where its milk is sourced, so if there is any problem, it can rapidly identify the farmer and rectify the problem quickly. However, if the milk comes from goodness knows where, it is much more difficult to isolate the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/7">I would like to talk about one or two specific problems that my farmers have raised with me. One of the most important is tuberculosis. I see that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> is present and I do not know whether he will catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but he and I have a major problem with TB. I took a delegation to see the former Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food eight years ago when this Government were first elected&mdash;of course, that was before the foot and mouth disease crisis&mdash;and he said that TB was the single most important animal health issue that we had to face. I regret to say that, in those seven years, it seems that very little has been done&mdash;in fact, worse than very little.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/8">I do not particularly blame the Government for this but, throughout the foot and mouth crisis, all staff dealing with tuberculosis were taken away, so the eye was completely taken off the ball in relation to TB. I have to tell the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire&mdash;who is in loco parentis, as it were, the Minister today&mdash;that the problem is getting worse, whether we like it or not. The disease is getting into the deer and hare populations, and that is extremely serious. Whereas badgers have a normal roving pattern of about 5 to 10 miles, deer rove for up to 30 to 40 miles, so the risk of spreading the disease is far greater.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/9">We need to put much more emphasis on trying to find a satisfactory vaccine and trying to improve diagnostics so that we can differentiate between a vaccinated animal and one that has caught TB in the wild. There would be great benefit to all of us if the Government would put more emphasis on, and resources into trying to solve, that problem; they would not only improve the profitability of those farmers in my area who face that problem, but would reduce the huge compensation bill that they have to pay as a result of the disease.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/10">I have a problem with registration under the so-called Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. It is particularly unfair. I had a case in Wotton-under-Edge, where two sites were registered. The farmer appealed on those two sites, and suddenly found that a third site had been posted on the internet. It may also have been posted at the local council, but he did not know about it until after the date of appeal, so he could not appeal. That seems unfair. I have taken the matter up with the planning inspectorate and the Countryside Agency, but have had very unsatisfactory treatment. The Minister looks puzzled. After the debate, I will let him have the details and should be grateful if he were to look into that matter.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/11">There is also concern about dogs in relation to the countryside and rights of way. Like the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I have a lot of stock in my constituency area&mdash;sheep, dairy cattle and beef cattle&mdash;and there is concern about dogs. There is also concern about gates being left open so that cattle stray on to roads and cause problems. Those issues should be carefully examined.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/12">I also want to talk about the paperwork. We raised that matter at great length in the last debate on agriculture in the Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January 2005</phrase>. I would like the Minister to inculcate a new way of doing business in his Department. It should impose the least amount of paperwork on farmers concurrent with preventing fraud. The whole ethos in the Department should be to produce the least amount of paper and to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/13">I have enormous sympathy with my poor farmers at the moment, who, at a time when they are trying to sow their spring crops, are having to deal with hugely complicated paperwork related to the single payments. As was mentioned in the previous debate, it is almost impossible for ordinary farmers to administer the paperwork themselves; they may have to get outside advisers, which is expensive. Even if they can administer the paperwork themselves, the time taken in administration is a cost. We should inculcate a new ethos in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: keep the paperwork simple and keep it to the minimum commensurate with dealing with fraud.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/14">I also want to deal with the whole business of the ban on hunting with hounds from <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-19">19 February</phrase>, and the issue of cattle disposal. In certain areas of the country, that will be a real problem. We want to encourage farmers to take part in the national cattle disposal scheme, and I am sure that the Government will do more in that respect. However, there will be problems in individual areas, and I should like to know what the Government intend to do about them. We do not want a system in which farmers feel so pressurised that they simply go out and bury the stock or, worse still, leave it lying about somewhere, because that would be a real haven for disease.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/15">I am grateful to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to speak in this debate. I am concerned that the pressure on certain sectors&mdash;the dairy sector and the arable sector in the Cotswolds&mdash;could mean that more people will put land down to grass that will be grazed extensively by sheep and beef cattle. I am then concerned that pressure will also occur in those sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/16">The Government need to take a long, hard look at agriculture. It is no good just saying, &quot;Well, the farmers will have to look after themselves, and if they lose jobs, they lose jobs, and if they are not profitable, they are not profitable.&quot; Such an attitude is not acceptable. We want jobs to be maintained in rural areas, and we want agriculture to be profitable, because the glue that holds the rural area together depends on the profitability of agriculture. If agriculture is not profitable, the whole rural area suffers from a great depression and malaise.</p>
	<p pid=".185.0/17">We look to the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire to give us some positive hope this morning and to tell us how he thinks things might improve. My goodness, the industry desperately needs positive good cheer from him today.</p>

	<p pid=".188.0/1">I, like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my near neighbour the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, welcome the debate, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> on securing it. I apologise for missing the first couple of minutes of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/690" name="Nick Ainger">the debate. Like my hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger)</phrase>, I am on a Standing Committee considering a Bill, which causes some problems with double-booking.</p>
	<p pid=".188.0/2">I concur with what the hon. Members for Somerton and Frome and for Cotswold said. My starting point is that we have the figures for the total income from farming, and this year they are down. There was some optimism last year because the figures rose, which was promising, although they did not rise dramatically. The fact that they are down this year is affecting profitability. That brings starkly into play the amount of money that the state puts into agriculture every year, because without that &pound;3 billion or more the industry would be in a worse than parlous state. However, I want to dwell not on that but on what the debate has been about. In the south-west, it is understandably about dairying, and it is also about diversification&mdash;the two d's.</p>
	<p pid=".188.0/3">I make no apology for starting with the problem of how farmers are paid. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, of which I am proud to be a member, has in the past examined the Rural Payments Agency, and I think it is fair to say that we have, in our various guises, given it quite a hard time. Sadly, if a Soviet-style system for making payments to people is created, it is no wonder that it is bureaucratic and subject to all the problems that we know about which result in failure. As we enter this brave new world, I would like us to search for greater finesse and for a system that actually rewards, rather than relying on a highly bureaucratic system of payments.</p>

	<p pid=".188.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, and I am sorry to intervene on his speech, but I want to say something that I meant to mention in my speech. Does he agree that there will be a problem in moving from the old integrated administration and control scheme to the new single farm payment system? The IACS&mdash;integrated administration and control scheme&mdash;payments were mostly paid before Christmas, but the new payments will be made several months after Christmas. Does he also agree that if those payments are not made on time, there will be an opportunity cost, even if the farmer does not have an overdraft, which most farmers do? If the Government do not pay by the statutory date, they should add interest for late payments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.189.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" speakername="David Drew" colnum="189"  time="10:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew8">
	<p pid=".189.0/1">I hope that we would always pay as promptly and as fairly as possible, but I am just making the point that this is an incredibly complicated system, and we have made it more so.</p>
	<p pid=".189.0/2">Let us understand why. During the build-up to the changes, I was lobbied by three groups of farmers. I was initially lobbied by those who wanted to break away entirely from the production-based system, because they had farmed without subsidy throughout their history and they felt that if we were moving towards environmental payments it was appropriate that they were able to access that system. I also met those farmers, largely in the arable sector, who welcomed the area-based payments, because they saw it as a more straightforward method of payment and hoped that it would earn them additional rewards. Of course, I also met dairy farmers in the south-west who fought hard to maintain the historic payment system. The fact that all three groups were members of the National Farmers Union meant that the organisation was wearing many hats, which made things difficult.</p>
	<p pid=".189.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1150" name="James Paice">The hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase> picked up on my description of the system as a spatchcock. That is an appropriate definition. This is not an ideal system. We do not want a system in which, inevitably, there are some real losers&mdash;essentially in dairying&mdash;until other ways in which farmers can build up income have been looked at, and it would be utterly unfair if we immediately went over to a system of area-based payments.</p>
	<p pid=".189.0/4">There is also, dare I say it, an interesting British experiment going on. There are different methods of payment in different areas of the colonial parts of Britain. That may give us an opportunity to measure the effectiveness of the different systems, but I hope that we will eventually agree that it is right to pay farmers for what we want them to do, rather than to pay them a production subsidy to build up excess supplies, which is utterly unacceptable nowadays.</p>
	<p pid=".189.0/5">That takes me directly to dairying, an unhappy area which the Select Committee looked into&mdash;in fact, I chaired the Sub-Committee. Of all the sectors it is the one losing out most, something that obviously started a long time ago, rather than starting or ending with the current Government. That trend is due to the system of linking to currency fluctuations through the intervention milk price equivalent, which is fine when the currency moves in the right direction, but results in heavy penalties when it moves in the wrong direction. Anything that can lessen that impact is vital, as we will see when the new system of payments comes in. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>, who has been valiant in his attempts to achieve greater fairness in the sector, I support the idea of a statutory code. We, like him, want to see that fully evaluated&mdash;and, I dare say, we want more research on it&mdash;because if the threats that keep being made to the supermarkets are to have any meaning at all, we must be able to assess the benefits of having such a code.</p>
	<p pid=".189.0/6">In our last report, we found out that when the 3p was offered, as a result of farmers' protests, it did find its way into their pockets, yet there is still the missing 18p. In a sense it is not missing, because we know that it is shared between the supermarkets and the processors, although, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said, the processors are under enormous pressure at the moment. As I have said many times before, the Severnside plant is at the bottom of my garden, and I know some of the pressures that it has to endure. The only answer, besides trying to get the system right, is to secure greater co-operation. Contrary to what my near neighbour the hon. Member for Cotswold said, Milk Marque was not destroyed by the Government; it was kicked to death over a long period. The level of confrontation surrounding Milk Marque&mdash;and the price levels that were fixed&mdash;meant that it was set up to fail. It should have been set up to encourage greater collaboration, and I should like to see that co-operation throughout the sector.</p>
	<p pid=".189.0/7">I would not mind if there was another OFT inquiry into the matter. It would highlight many of the problems, although such inquiries often do not find the solutions. The problem is that the OFT, if it reported, would, I suspect, consider calling for even greater rationalisation at the producer end. Like other Members, I do not want that.</p>

	<p pid=".190.0/1">Normally, I agree with most of what the hon. Gentleman says about agriculture, but I disagree with his remarks about Milk Marque. Will he answer a simple question? Is the dairy industry more or less profitable since the break-up of Milk Marque?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.190.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" speakername="David Drew" colnum="190"  time="10:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew10">
	<p pid=".190.1/1">I know who is profitable&mdash;the supermarkets. They would argue that that is because they do their work well. Processor profits may go up and down, but the fact is that producers have done very badly, inevitably because of the way that confrontation rules the sector. Confrontation has served no-one but those at the end of the process. It is about time the sector recognised the need for greater co-operation, not just through vertical integration, which may allow us to compete internationally, but more particularly among farmers. We must encourage them to co-operate.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/2">The simple fact, which has been alluded to on numerous occasions, is that if the normal supply and demand mechanism operated we would expect the supply to decrease as the price fell. That does not happen because there is always someone coming in, trying to pick up surplus cows and milk them more efficiently. I dare say that the way that milk, certainly liquid milk, now moves around means that we do not face a shortage. The point is that we have to recognise that the normal market does not apply to milk, and we have to look at ways of bolstering the supply by supporting farmers in other ways.</p>

	<p pid=".190.2/1">The hon. Gentleman said that there was a crying need for co-operation both between primary producers and between producers and processors. Every year I go to the south-west dairy industry dinner at the Bath and West showground in my constituency and there is talk of little else but how to encourage co-operation. None of that will work unless the big supermarkets' stranglehold on the bottom line is broken. Co-operation on its own is not enough.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.191.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" speakername="David Drew" colnum="191"  time="10:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew12">
	<p pid=".191.0/1">It may not be enough, but it is a good start. The Select Committee report highlights the lack of co-operation as the biggest weakness in the sector. There are no magic wands. It is down to people trying to get on with one another. It is not just about farmers co-operating; it is about processors learning to co-operate with each other and to give up their cut-throat policies. They must face up to the supermarkets and ensure that we, as parliamentarians, and the Government put pressure on them. That is no easy thing, but it has to happen. That is another reason for my supporting a statutory code.</p>
	<p pid=".191.0/2">Bovine TB is an enormous problem, and I agree with the hon. Member for Cotswold that there are no easy solutions. <i>The</i> <i>Veterinary Record</i> this week carries the results of an interesting survey. I do not know whether it was carried out because of the Irish results. Although those were apparently conclusive the Irish have announced that it is impossible to contemplate the level of culling that would be needed to deal with the problem of the wildlife reservoir. Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman says, the facts about other wildlife reservoirs have been known for a long time. Whether the problem is down to politics or lack of resources, it is only since we have begun to look more carefully at where bovine TB occurs that we know rather more. That obviously arouses fears and makes policies that much more difficult to develop.</p>
	<p pid=".191.0/3">In the survey farmers were asked what policies they would suggest to the Government. Surprisingly, their top three were a cattle vaccine, continuing the current testing and cull policy, and, in only third place, a proactive cull of badgers. Even more surprising was the fact that the idea of localised action was seen as completely unacceptable. If farmers themselves are asking for that, it is incumbent on the Government to respond and to invest resources in the search for a vaccine. It is not easy; we know that the current work on the BCG vaccine has been fraught with problems, but we have to find one. We should all be united in that search.</p>
	<p pid=".191.0/4">On diversification, I get a slightly different picture in my constituency where there are many holdings through the County Farms Estate. I met some new tenants just before Christmas. The quality of people who still want to come into farming is gratifying. They know what they are coming into and realise that they will encounter problems. Again, the numbers for dairying are down. It is difficult to invest in an updated milk parlour. However, people are coming into the industry to some of the ways in farm and to do a range of things. Sadly, they are not always helped by the way others in the countryside try to prevent diversification. All hon. Members will know what I am talking about here. If we are serious about farmers earning income in other ways we have to encourage them to diversify.</p>
	<p pid=".191.0/5">Some time ago in Gloucestershire we set up a group called the Rural Issues Task Force. That was mainly on the back of foot and mouth money, although the organisation slightly pre-empted that. We were able to see first hand the invaluable work of the farm business advisory service, which advises farmers on the best way forward, including, sometimes, passing on the hard message that they are in the wrong vocation. That is difficult, but it sometimes needs to be said. However, the service tries to help other farmers to move forward.</p>
	<p pid=".191.0/6">I congratulate the RITF on its work under Henry Robinson, its chairman, who is well known to the hon. Member for Cotswold, and Robin Grist, its secretary. We would like to keep it going. If another Government came in and made alterations to the Small Business Service, of which the farm business advisory service is part, that would threaten it. The most important point is that we are keen to consider methods of diversifying, including growing non-food crops and making more effective use of environmental payments. That can be done only by collaborative work, as well as work at the level of the individual farmer.</p>
	<p pid=".191.0/7">I shall leave it at that. I could say some things about the fallen stock scheme, which has been a little slow to get off the ground, but in recent times has shown good signs of making progress. There are many problems, and there is a great deal of work to do. I look forward to hearing my hon. Friend the Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire talk about those matters. We have to pull together to ensure that the countryside functions properly.</p>

	<p pid=".192.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. May I begin, as have o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">thers, by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, not only on securing the debate, but on highlighting the seriousness of the problems facing farmers, particularly dairy farmers&mdash;in fact, farmers across a number of other sectors as well&mdash;in the Government's south-west zone? A recent Milk Development Council report highlighted the fact that 1,000 dairy farmers had gone out of business in the region in the past three years and it is anticipated that a further 30 per cent. will go out of business in the next two. Those devastating figures demonstrate the seriousness of the circumstances that farming faces.</p>
	<p pid=".192.2/2">My hon. Friend highlighted the role of supermarkets and the impact on farm-gate prices as well as the challenge of the introduction of the single farm payment system, which is already creating tremendous challenges in the Rural Payments Agency and DEFRA. He also referred to the break-up of Milk Marque, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, whose analysis was spot on. The Government were prepared to intervene to break up Milk Marque. If it required improvement in its internal practices, that could have been addressed rather than breaking up the organisation, particularly when it was no longer felt by the Competition Commission to be monopolistic.</p>

	<p pid=".192.3/1">May I make this observation to the hon. Gentleman, who is entirely on the right point? We have weakened and broken up Milk Marque, but co-operatives on the continent, particularly in Holland, are growing bigger and stronger, so we are competing on an unequal playing field.</p>

	<p pid=".193.0/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman.

	<p pid=".193.2/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. There are many international examples that can, I hope, be taken off the peg and applied more effectively and speedily to help to provide agriculture in this country with greater strength in the marketplace.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/2">All political parties seem to be struggling with the knotty issue of bovine TB, as hon. Members on both sides of the House have mentioned it in the debate. It has been a challenge for many years, and it was perhaps made worse following foot and mouth disease, largely as a result of restocking policies at the time and the need to ensure that pre and post-movement tests were put in place. Perhaps they should have been in place, because problems were created in parts of the country that previously had not had such difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/3">The political parties will have to face up to some difficult political decisions in due course. The fourth report from the independent scientific group will be out in the next week or so&mdash;it should have been published by now&mdash;and we are anxious to see it because it will give us further information about the progress of the trials. The Irish study, which I hope the ISG report will comment on, shows that there could be a solution, or a partial solution, to the problem of rampaging bovine TB if any Government were prepared to consider a policy of widespread extermination of the badger. As far as I am aware, however, no party is proposing that. Reactive culling clearly does not work, and although that is disputed in some circles, it is one helpful outcome from the work done by Professor John Bourne and others. There is much still to be debated on the issue and many dairy farmers in the south-west, as well as elsewhere, will watch developments very closely.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> rightly referred to complications created by the introduction of the single farm payment system, the purpose of which was to create a more straightforward system that ironed out the complexities of the scheme in place until December last year. That leads me to the first of my two substantive points: the competence of DEFRA and farmers' lack of confidence in its ability to cope with the challenges ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/5">The Department failed to introduce an amendment to the Animal By-Products Order 1999 in time to be able to implement a fallen-stock collection scheme in May 2003. The order was introduced in July and there was a further debate on the subject in September 2003, when we were promised such a scheme in January 2004. After many questions and debates, it was eventually established a year later. What confidence does that give farmers that DEFRA, first, gives them priority and, secondly, has the competence to act?</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/6">Another product of last year's debates on the fallout from the foot and mouth inquiry was the emergence of the report by Jim Dring, which was devastating on the role of MAFF and DEFRA and their competence to cope with what was going on in Northumberland. It highlighted some serious questions that the Department has failed to answer.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/7">The single farm payment scheme is most significant change in agriculture in more than a generation. There was a decent amount of lead time before it was introduced in January, but information is still percolating out. Booklets were distributed late, farmers were informed late and there is a lot of confusion out there. From talking to farmers, I know that they are worried about the future because they are uncertain.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/8">The Department has made it clear that it is not really competent to make payments in December this year, but the Rural Payments Agency is likely make payments towards the end of the payment window, which will end in June 2006. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/690" name="Nick Ainger">the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger)</phrase> will address the need to ensure that farmers are properly compensated if the agency does not pay in the early part of the payment window, particularly farmers who are struggling on the margins.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/9">The Department must be prepared to intervene in the market, just as it did with Milk Marque, to protect farmers from the overwhelming strength of supermarkets. If the competition authorities have acknowledged that convenience stores are a discrete market, surely supermarkets are a discrete market too. For example, Tesco holds about 40 per cent. of the market. Why are the Government not prepared to intervene?</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/10">Of course, it is an entirely rational decision of supermarkets to use their muscle in the market. No one complains about that, and one understands that if they do not do it, their competitors will and they will lose their place in the market. However, is what is happening through the food supply chain a proper use or an abuse of power through that chain? The Government need to address those questions.</p>
	<p pid=".193.2/11">The real Secretary of State for Agriculture, Lord Haskins, predicted only this week in the <i>Farmers Guardian</i> that the average size of dairy farms in the south-west will have to be 250 milking cows. Unless we are to go down that route, if that is Government policy, we shall end up with ranches across the countryside. That will not help either rural communities or the future of our farmed landscapes. It is time the Department got a grip.</p>

	<p pid=".195.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> on securing the debate. I shall not repeat his comments on the absence of a Minister, but I sympathise with the position in which the Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/690" name="Nick Ainger">the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire (Mr. Ainger)</phrase>, finds himself. He has already been given some material, but clearly he will be circumscribed in what he can say in reply to the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/2">It is also important to make the point that despite the cataclysmic changes to agriculture in the last few years and the advent of the single farm payment system, we have not had a debate in Government time on agriculture either in this Chamber or in the main Chamber for at least two years. I have established that with a little research, although the period is probably a lot longer. That underlines the Government's attitude to farming and the countryside.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/3">Underlying all the concerns and the situation in the south-west, as well as the dramatic reduction in the number of dairy farmers, is the question of what we want, and what the Government expect, from our farmers in the next couple of decades or so, now that the single farm payment system is in place. Are the Government relaxed about having a situation such as that to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> just referred&mdash;a massive number of dairy farmers going out of business and a few others getting bigger, including the impact that that will have on rural communities&mdash;or do they want an effort to maintain the rural community structures that have served our countryside for so long?</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/4">If one considers the bald statistics of dairying, there seems to be little doubt that milk production has hardly declined at all, and there is no doubt that many dairy producers around the country are expanding production. That is a logical business decision based on how they see and cost their own enterprises. However, that somehow obscures the point that the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome was making, which is that when there is a dramatic diminution in the number of small and smaller farms, there is a fundamental impact on the fabric of the community. They have been the mainstay of our rural communities&mdash;particularly relating to dairying in the south-west&mdash;for many generations and the country has not really asked itself whether it wants to allow this deterioration to continue.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/5">A number of hon. Members have rightly been raised the issue of the single farm payment. I, too, take the view that the delays announced by the Rural Payments Agency are a direct consequence of the complexity of the scheme that the Government have introduced, coupled with the inevitable bureaucracy and the difficulty that this Government have in introducing any computer-based system, as we have seen. However, they have not fully understood the delay's impact on farmers.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/6">Farmers were already facing an unusually extended period between their last integrated administration and control scheme&mdash;or IACS&mdash;payment, most of which was made in November 2004, and the single farm payment, which could be made in December 2005, leading to a wait that might be slightly longer than 12 months. However, that payment is now be to made in February 2006, although we all think it will be made in April, May or even June 2006. We are looking at anything up to an 18-month gap whose cash-flow implications are serious.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/7">As a side issue, the tax implications are also serious, because farmers could end up with one year in which they have no receipts from the Government and another with two lots. The Government have not yet made any pronouncement on that, either. I have already called on them to make an interim payment of perhaps 30 to 40 per cent. of their single farm payment and I maintain that view. At that level, the payment would be well inside any margin for error and it could help farmers through that period.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/8">The issue of bovine TP is central to the south-west and a few other parts of the country. I do not take such a sanguine approach as the Government, or even as the hon. Member for St. Ives, because there are big question marks over the integrity of the trials that are taking place. The case against reactive culling has not been properly made. With culling rates of 30 or 40 per cent., which is all that was being achieved in a number of the areas, there is not much validity to any conclusion. Let us compare that situation with the Irish trials, in which virtually 100 per cent. elimination of badgers was achieved and the validity of the conclusions is right.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/9">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we cannot have a policy involving the long-term elimination of badgers from large sections of the British countryside. I want a healthy cattle population to live alongside healthy wildlife; it is in the interests of cattle producers and of everybody concerned with wildlife that that be so. The Government are almost paralysed in respect of doing anything about badgers, yet they refuse to accept the evidence that there is a reservoir of TB that needs to be eliminated. We need a way to take out badgers in infected areas&mdash;I mean not just cattle infection, but badger infection&mdash;and somehow ensure that those are repopulated only with uninfected badgers. That is similar to what used to be described as the clean ring strategy, and we need to move much more quickly towards it.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/10">The holy grail is a live test for badgers, which could be caught, tested for TB and, if they did not have it, let go. We are not there yet, but that is more likely to become reality than the vaccines, which, as we have all been told, have always been 10 years away. We are still no closer.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/11">I endorse what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> rightly said about co-operation. It is odd that we are facing the merging of Arla and Camina, two of the biggest dairy co-operatives in Europe. Arla, the Danish co-op, has 80 per cent. of Danish milk supplies and a huge chunk of English milk supplies too, being the sole supplier of liquid milk to Asda supermarkets. In England, Arla operates as a commercial company. We cannot generate a co-operative operation on anything like that scale. Arla on its own&mdash;certainly Arla combined with Camina&mdash;will be a dominant force throughout Europe. That is an important issue.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/12">I want to touch on the hill farm allowance scheme, which has not been raised. It terminates at the end of 2006 and applies to bits of the south-west and to many parts of the country. The Government have made no pronouncements on what will happen after the end of the HFA scheme. The sum involved is not large, but, given the perilous state of farming's economics, particularly in those disadvantaged areas, even it is important. We should expect a statement from the Government on their intentions.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/13">The fallen stock scheme is clearly causing a number of problems. The Government should look much more carefully at extending the concept of exemptions. They should also look urgently at ways of licensing biodigestion systems as an alternative to the fallen stock scheme. That can take place on farm or in some local, centrally located sealed biodigestion system.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/14">The situation in the south-west, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome described, is extremely serious. Farmers look to the Government, as they have for the last 57 years, for some guidance as to the future, but, sadly, they do not seem to be getting it. We have an excellent opportunity, however, due to the fact that someone who is, I hope, a would-be Minister, the hon. Member for West Carmarthen and South Pembrokeshire, is replying to the debate. With similar problems in his constituency, he perhaps has more understanding of these issues than any Minister in the Department.</p>
	<p pid=".195.0/15">Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can take the messages that have been sent out during the debate back to the Government. There is genuine concern out there in the farming community and in the wider countryside. Those communities look to the Government for an answer of some sort&mdash;not necessarily solutions, but guidance on how answers can be achieved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.197.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/690" speakername="Nick Ainger" speakeroffice="Lord Commissioner of Her Majesty's Treasury"  colnum="197"  time="10:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h01.htm#50201h01_spnew25">
	<p pid=".197.0/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/950" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> on securing an important and interesting debate. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1150" name="James Paice">the hon. Member for South-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Paice)</phrase> said, due to the constituency that I represent, I am well versed with the message and the information. Although I do not want to get into a competition with the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome, I might have almost as many dairy cattle in my constituency as he has in his. South-west Dyfed, as the area used to be called, or south-west Wales is one of the major dairy areas of Europe. I do not think that I can cover every issue raised in debate. I will concentrate on the dairy sector and TB while trying to respond to a few points made in the hon. Gentleman's opening speech.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/2">I hope that the hon. Gentleman has not already had this further information on progress made in relation to traditional orchards. DEFRA, in consultation with English Nature, has developed the criteria, which are being submitted to the European Commission. Those criteria clearly define traditional orchards of particular environmental value, so that they will be eligible for the single farm payment. I hope that that gives him some reassurance.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/3">Turning to the dairy industry and its problems and to the issues involving the power of the supermarkets, the Government are well aware of producer concerns about the power of supermarkets and that the market is unfairly balanced. As Members will probably recall, the supermarket sector was subject to a major investigation by the Competition Commission in 1999&ndash;2000 and was investigated again in 2003 when bids were being made for Safeway. The commission report of October 2002 concluded that the industry was broadly competitive. However, it recommended the establishment of a code of practice that would put relations between the major supermarkets and their suppliers on a clearer and more predictable basis.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/4">The code of practice was set up and then reviewed by the Office of Fair Trading in 2003. The OFT report on that review found a widespread belief among suppliers that the code was not working, but no hard evidence to support that. Given the reluctance of suppliers to provide specific evidence of alleged breaches of the code, the OFT commissioned a focus compliance audit of the four supermarkets bound by the code to establish hard facts as a basis for any further action. The OFT hopes to publish the auditor's report in the next few weeks. Neither I nor the Department can pre-empt those findings, but I hope that firm evidence will come forward and action can then be taken.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/5">On the dairy sector and the farm-gate price, as the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome identified, the south-west is a, if not the, major supplier of raw milk to the British market. The reasons for the current UK farm-gate price of milk are complex, as hon. Members have already mentioned, with different variations and combinations applying at different times. Factors such as exchange rates, the price on the world community markets, domestic supply and demand, the low value of the product mix, the low level of product innovation and the structure of the UK dairy industry and co-operatives have all led to the current situation. The average price for milk deliveries in November 2004 was 19.6p per litre.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/6">Members have understandably asked what the Government are doing and can do. It should be made clear that price negotiations between producers and processors or between processors and the supermarkets are private commercial matters in which the Government cannot get involved while current competition rules apply. However, because most problems with the farm-gate price are matters for the industry to address, the Government have taken action, in line with our strategy for sustainable farming and food, to facilitate industry action and get people working together. That is why we have established the dairy supply chain forum, under the chairmanship of my noble Friend Lord Whitty, to consider, among other things, how the sector can improve efficiency through collaborative action.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/7">The forum was created to increase the efficiency and promote the sustainable development of the dairy supply chain. It is working to identify the challenges facing the industry and to provide effective and innovative approaches to those problems. The forum has had a positive effect in bringing together all sectors of the dairy supply chain, and we hope that trust and openness will increase. We hope also that that will change the culture of the supply chain, which, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> pointed out, has been one of confrontation since the abolition of the milk marketing boards.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/8">A number of robust discussions have taken place and I hope that developments will occur, particularly in relation to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/806" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the comments made by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>. It is clear that the British industry is producing too much of a low-value product and importing too much of a high-value product. I hope also that the developments that emerge from the dairy supply chain forum will work. There has been more and more internal vertical integration of co-operatives. I understand that, as a result of the acquisition of processing capacity, Milk Link is processing some 70 per cent. of the milk produced in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/9">There is movement, and the industry is responding to the need for vertical integration. Although I understand the comments made about Milk Marque, it was broken up because there was clear evidence that the pricing arrangements were not compatible with a fair market. The developments on greater vertical integration have meant that a number of co-operatives are involved in processing. That, I hope, will encourage innovation and the development of new, higher-value products that will improve the situation for the producers.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/10">All Members who spoke mentioned the TB problem, which is clearly major and which the Government take extremely seriously. We are absolutely determined to tackle it by working in partnership with farmers, vets and those with wildlife interests. We all have an important role to play. The Government have not been standing still on bovine TB. Following consultation last year, the Department announced a range of new measures to improve surveillance and reduce the risk of disease spreading to new areas. Those measures include changes to the frequency of testing and the imposition of movement restrictions immediately a test becomes overdue.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/11">The Department has been working closely with stakeholders on the development of a new TB strategy for publication early this year. We have set up a stakeholder group to develop a detailed proposal for implementing the pre-movement testing of cattle, which addresses a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/907" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>. Members said that the solution is obviously a vaccine. We are carrying out a great deal of research on bovine TB, vaccine development, badger culling trials, the transmission of disease within and between species, and improved diagnosis. That covers the points made about the spread of TB among deer as well.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/12">The Government are prepared to consider badger culling, but only if the scientific evidence available supports that proposal as a cost-effective and sustainable solution. The data from the four-area trial in Ireland will form part of the evidence used to assess potential policy options under the new bovine TB strategy. Work has already begun on the requirements for a field trial for a badger vaccine, while further work is still required on vaccine delivery, monitoring the effective immunisation of badgers and the effect of exposure to non-target species.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/13">The tone of the debate has been that there is a serious crisis within agriculture in the south-west. The Department's policy is still to develop the strategy for sustainable farming and food, which is a comprehensive and long-term plan for the development of the industry. It is designed to support the farming industry through this period of change and leave it well equipped to succeed into the future.</p>
	<p pid=".197.0/14">One of the key underlying features of the Government's approach is a readiness to help farmers to make the change. Funding for the strategy of &pound;500 million, which was announced in 2002, has been allocated and some &pound;200 million will be spent on the strategy in 2005&ndash;06. We have a clear vision for the future of agriculture and a strong strategy for achieving that vision. We have ensured that all those with a stake in sustainable agriculture are part of the strategy, as a partnership is the only way to deliver what we want for and from farming. At the same time, we continue to address immediate challenges such as TB with robust, evidence-based policies.</p>

	Water Bills (South-West)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.201.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="201"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h02.htm#50201h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".201.1/1">I am pleased to have an opportunity to raise the subject of the rapidly increasing water bills that are hitting the south-west; indeed, bills going out to South West Water customers in the next week or two will have risen by 17 or 18 per cent. and that is on top of what are already the highest water bills in the UK.</p>
	<p pid=".201.1/2">This issue is not new. I have raised it in many Adjournment debates over the years following the privatisation of the water industry by the Conservative party, which soon got us into the issue of unaffordable water bills. Indeed, the increases, going back to the late 1980s and early 1990s, largely finished off much of the Conservative party in the south-west. It was probably the biggest single issue that contributed to the loss of Conservative seats, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid=".201.1/3">The privatisation involved two major errors, which the Conservative Secretary of State for the Environment eventually admitted in the House of Commons and, I understand, in arguing in Cabinet that something needed to be done to create a fairer water-charging system. By the end of the Conservatives' period in office, he had lobbied on and introduced to the Cabinet proposals to invest money in cutting water bills, but was turned down by his Cabinet colleagues.</p>
	<p pid=".201.1/4">What we saw instead was a delay in the programme of environmental clean-up, which meant that the increase in bills was delayed for a short period. However, the clean-up costs could not be delayed for ever, and they are at the root of the proposed increases. The Conservatives created the problem and then, rather than offering a solution, merely delayed the costs of the necessary environmental work for a few years. In some ways, I have sympathy for the Minister, because he inherits the legacy of past mistakes as much as he faces a problem that he has to address for the future.</p>

	<p pid=".201.2/1">My hon. Friend is making a very good case. The privatisation was so botched that in his constituency, as in mine, many people are fed up with paying through the nose for high water bills, especially given that, when the clean-up comes, they get only primary or secondary treatment. They believe that they should get the best, but they are simply not getting that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.201.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="201"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h02.htm#50201h02_spnew2">
	<p pid=".201.3/1">My hon. Friend is right. I am sure that his electorate voted for him because of the many excellent qualities that he would bring to the House, but I am sure that they were also voting against his Conservative opponent partly because of this issue, of which we remain extremely aware.</p>
	<p pid=".201.3/2">As I said, the Conservatives made two fundamental errors when they privatised the water industry. First, because of the discounts, big profits were made by the water companies and the initial investors in privatisation. A small sum was set aside as the so-called green dowry to tackle environmental clean-up, but the Conservatives massively underestimated what that would cost. Incidentally, at the time the rules were set, the Conservatives boasted that they had led Europe into setting tougher environmental rules than other European countries had wanted. It was the era when the Conservatives suddenly caught the environmental bug; they boasted that the new rules had been set and estimated the cost of implementing them to be &pound;1.5 billion. The actual cost was &pound;6 billion&mdash;four times the amount. The green dowry was inadequate, and water bills shot through the roof. The south-west suffered most because only 3 per cent. of the population lives in the South West Water area, but one third of the beach clean-up took place in that area. It is no surprise that water bills in the south-west are now the highest in the country.</p>

	<p pid=".202.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on introducing the debate and securing the attendance of a Minister, which I failed to do earlier. Does he agree that one of the perverse factors is that, although the south-west has the longest coastline to clear up, it has the highest proportion of pensioners, so those least able to pay face the highest bills in the country?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.202.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="202"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h02.htm#50201h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".202.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. Having set out the reason for the bills being so high, it is worth my noting that the south-west is the poorest part of the country&mdash; Cornwall more so than the rest. People are on low incomes, so the impact of high bills as a proportion of their income is much greater. In an area where few people are employed by large companies that could establish good pension schemes for employees, many elderly people are on fixed, low incomes and basic state pensions. There are much higher levels of self-employment and small-scale employment than elsewhere in the country. The poverty issue is real. Other Ministers are dealing with that through the objective 1 programme and other work that is being undertaken, but I shall illustrate the scale of the problem that we face with water bills. South West Water bills for unmeasured supplies now average about &pound;420 a year, double the average annual bill in London, which is roughly &pound;204.</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/2">When I pressed Ofwat and the director general of water services on the issue, they outlined the increases that we will now face in the present round. The figures tend to be calculated in real terms without taking into account inflation. Given the estimate based on the Government's inflation targets, the cost of an unmeasured supply is due to reach &pound;675 a year by 2009. Average salaries in Cornwall are 20 per cent. below the national average, and many people, not only pensioners, are on incomes of between &pound;10,000 and &pound;15,000 a year, yet they will be hit by a water bill of nearly &pound;700. There is still significant unemployment and deprivation, yet there is no help with high water bills for people on low incomes.</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/3">People in London pay just over &pound;200 a year, which is &pound;4 a week&mdash;not a significant sum relative to other costs. That reflects the situation throughout most of the country and, thus, the provision that is made in the benefit system nationally. However, my constituents will be asked to pay three times that amount. A &pound;700 bill is a significant cost for pensioners and others on low incomes. Confirmation of the scale of the increase has caused huge concern. When increases were relatively low, such worry died away to some extent, even though we paid the highest bills. There was a feeling of unfairness, but people learned to cope with the bills. However, the thought of further high increases has now put the issue back up the agenda. Such concerns caused a wipe-out for the Conservatives in the past. They could have the same impact on the Labour Government if they are not seen to be taking action to help people with the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/4">For some people, water meters can provide a measure of relief because the average metered bill will be lower. However, by definition, those who choose the meter system tend to be low users. Families with several children are unlikely to opt for a meter because they may face increased charges. The problem with the shift to metering by people who will benefit from it is that, each time someone cuts their bill by shifting to a meter, the bill is increased for those who are on unmetered supply. Which group of people is most guaranteed to benefit from a metered supply? Those with second homes who do not occupy them for most of the year. They have moved over to meters in droves. That means that people who are fortunate enough to own a second home in the county now pay among the lowest bills, whereas those who live with family and are struggling to meet the costs of that now face the highest bills. That disparity will get worse. The projections of an increase to nearly &pound;700 in the typical unmetered supply does not take account of that trend, so the increase could be higher still.</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/5">That is a significant issue, which the Minister may wish to look at. What can we do to ensure that the owners of second homes make a fair contribution to the costs of an environmental clean-up of which they are probably the greatest beneficiaries? After all, why do people buy second homes in Cornwall or Devon? To enjoy the beaches. Why are the water bills so high? To pay for cleaning up the beaches. However, second home owners are paying the lowest bills. That does not add up.</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/6">That problem will never be satisfactorily addressed so long as the water bills for 3 per cent. of the population are based on the costs of cleaning up 30 per cent. of the beaches and the natural environment around the country. WaterVoice South West has been very active on that issue, and I agree with it that we need to consider whether there should be such a variation between regions. I tried to persuade Conservative Ministers about that in the past, and I am now trying to persuade a Labour Minister. It might make more sense to have a mechanism for distributing the uneven environmental cost more fairly across the country. After all, many people from other areas enjoy the benefits of the expenditure when they visit our part of the country, but they do not contribute to it.</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/7">WaterVoice South West picks up on a crucial issue, which I want to put to the Minister. It investigates the meaning and consequences of the Ofwat director general's statutory duty to</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/8" class="indent">&quot;ensure that no undue preference is shown and that there is no undue discrimination against any class of customer or potential customer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".202.1/9">That has traditionally been interpreted as referring to the old and the young, or to those living in rented accommodation and those in permanent accommodation. However, there is a question about whether it is reasonable to have discrimination such that people in one part of the country pay &pound;200 or so for water and those in another part pay &pound;700 or so. That is undue discrimination, and it needs to be stopped, particularly as that cost is borne by the poorest part of the country. Ofwat has not specified whether that duty is national or local. It has been interpreted in the way that is easiest for Ofwat and the water companies.</p>

	<p pid=".204.0/1">The hon. Gentleman probably shares my disappointment that the cross-Government review of water affordability does not agree with pooling, which he has mentioned. It looks forward to the possibility of regulatory review, but dismisses the possibility of mergers. However, it refers to some important measures that can be taken now, without a change in legislation. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, as well as tackling and continuing to press the issues he has referred to, we should urge the Government to implement their recommendations as fast and as far as possible?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.204.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="204"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h02.htm#50201h02_spnew6">
	<p pid=".204.1/1">I agree with the hon. Lady. Frankly, it is a matter of all hands on deck. There is a great measure of cross-party agreement on this issue in our part of the world. We will have differences about some of the detail of the solutions, but there is no doubt that this is a fundamental issue. We are talking about water bills that are going up to nearly the level of council tax. Members who represent areas where water bills are a couple of hundred quid may not understand how big the impact is in the part of the country where they are already more than double that and are set to be triple the amount.</p>
	<p pid=".204.1/2">If there is not to be a mechanism for sharing the cost more fairly around the country, the Government must at the very least look hard at how bills are forced up by second home owners and by those who run off without paying, which WaterVoice South West says has substantially increased bills.</p>
	<p pid=".204.1/3">If the Government do not want to spread the cost more evenly or cap the differential in rates, perhaps it would be possible to take one of two other measures. The first solution would be to allow some incorporation into benefit payments, possibly though housing benefit, to make at least some reparation for high water bills. There is no doubt that that would cost the Government money, but it would at least mean that those on the lowest incomes who were least able to afford the bills would get some directed relief.</p>
	<p pid=".204.1/4">Alternatively, benefit levels could be adjusted by region to take some account of this particular utility cost. The costs of other utilities do not vary by region in such a way, or certainly not to a similar extent. This is a unique issue. It significantly affects people on all income bands, but it particularly affects those on the lowest incomes who are in real hardship. Frankly, so far, Labour's solutions have not been adequate. I do not think that it has really understood the scale of the problem while in government. One suggestion made was that we should experimentally educate 1,000 pensioners on how to save water; that is not really addressing the issue. Nor is recycling the existing help given to pensioners in getting water meters. A big announcement was made about that, a scheme that is already in place. It is great to have some publicity for it, and it is important to make sure that people know about it, but that is not the same as providing a real solution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".204.1/5">I am fully aware that the Minister cannot possibly come up with a set of proposals now that will address the scale of the need. I am glad that he is here, that he has had the chance to hear the concern of Members of Parliament from across the region, and that I have been allowed the chance to set out the scale of the problem, which I have found often comes as a surprise to Ministers. We persuaded at least one former Secretary of State to take the case to Cabinet. He did not win it, and the Conservatives did not take the action needed. I hope that we can persuade this Minister at least to take the case to his colleagues, recognising that it is a serious issue. I hope that this Government may be more willing to deliver than the Conservatives were. This is an urgent issue; bills are rising now, and people will get news of their first set of big increases through the door any minute. I assure the Minister that it will be a very big issue in the election that is likely to take place in just a few months.</p>

	<p pid=".205.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1274" name="Matthew Taylor">The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>, who I congratulate on obtaining this debate, has been generous on two counts: first, he acknowledged that there is no instant answer to the problem, and, secondly, he said that current Ministers have to deal with a legacy of past mistakes. I must say that this is not the only issue on which we have to deal with a legacy of past mistakes, some of which have an impact over many years and cannot be dealt with even in two Parliaments. I will not go on to expand on the opportunities that further Parliaments will offer. The hon. Gentleman has acknowledged two important points that will help us to have a constructive debate on how we deal with the issues.</p>
	<p pid=".205.0/2">The hon. Gentleman does not need to persuade a Welsh politician of the potency of the issue of water and water prices. I acknowledge that the problem is currently more acute in the south-west, but over the years it has been an extremely potent political issue in Wales.</p>
	<p pid=".205.0/3">Water bills contribute significantly to the outgoings of many householders, so any rise in bills will have an impact on customers. The Government are particularly concerned about the effect on those least able to pay. The problem is particularly serious in areas where water charges are already relatively high. That description certainly fits the south-west, where there are many low-income households. I am aware that the problem of the cost of water bills as a proportion of income is a particular worry in the area. That is why we have set up a local-scale pilot study, which will take place in the south-west, to look into issues of affordability and the impact of benefits, checks, water efficiency measures and metering. I am pleased that, although there was initially some negative reaction, WaterVoice, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, has engaged positively in the development of that work.</p>

	<p pid=".205.1/1">On that point, WaterVoice South West is very keen to meet the Minister to discuss those issues, and south-west MPs would probably like to take part in that discussion. I hope that he, or his colleagues, are willing to agree to that.</p>

	<p pid=".205.2/1">It is more appropriate for the Minister for the Environment and Agri-environment, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1122" name="Elliot Morley">my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase>, to undertake that. I shall convey the request to him. I should not be filling his diary on his behalf, but I shall pass on the request.</p>
	<p pid=".205.2/2">Let us start by looking at the realities of the present situation. Water companies must meet their costs, including those of environmental standards, as the hon. Gentleman acknowledged. Ultimately, all those costs are met by customers. Ofwat sets an upper limit on customer prices, but there is a strong and visible link between what the company spends and the customers funding that through their bills. It has been argued that that makes water companies more sensitive to the views of their customers. Strong evidence in the recent periodic review shows that companies' business plans now pay more attention to customers' priorities, and that is no bad thing. However, it is not the whole picture, and there are particular problems in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid=".205.2/3">The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/748" name="Ben Bradshaw">my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, has taken a keen interest in the issue of the rising bills in the south-west, and has met a number of MPs from the region to consider the impact that the new price limits will have. In particular, he has discussed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/915" name="Linda Gilroy">the issue with my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>, who, as hon. Members will be aware, has a particular expertise and background in consumer matters.</p>
	<p pid=".205.2/4">It is worth pointing out that in we face rising bills in 2005 because charges were cut in 2000. We are facing a rise only compared with five years of lower prices&mdash;that can be seen by the dip in the general graph&mdash;that were driven by a wish for customers to pay lower prices. However, the regulator Ofwat worked hard through the 2004 periodic review to keep the final price rises as low as possible, ensuring that customers pay no more than is essential to cover the variety of arrangements.</p>

	<p pid=".206.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I will not give way, as this is a very short debate.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/2">Nationally, prices will rise by an average of 8.5 per cent. this April, with South West Water customers paying an average bill increase of &pound;29 in 2005&ndash;06. Average household bills for water and sewerage in the region will go up by &pound;87 to &pound;444 before inflation by 2009&ndash;10. That compares with the company's proposal in its business plan for an increase of &pound;120 over the period. It is worth pointing out that South West Water customers benefited from the average cut of 10 per cent. to bills in 1999. Although prices will rise between now and this time next year, customers in the south-west will be paying less in real terms than they did in 1999, with the average bill in 2006 being 2 per cent. lower than it was in 1999.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/3">The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell raised a lot of important points on water charging and the regulatory system, and acknowledged that they are not all new ideas. The Government reviewed the water charging system in 1997&ndash;98. That resulted in the Water Industry Act 1999, which includes protection against disconnection and the free meter option. However, we have not shut down the subject for ever, and we remain open to ideas on charging methods and tariffs. I will show the hon. Gentleman's specific suggestions to those evaluating the current position. Clearly, he has here today a bevy of supporters from his party in the south-west. He put forward a number of ideas for reducing the burden on South West Water customers, but they usually involve shifting the burden on to national taxpayers or water customers in other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/4">We are not convinced that it would be right effectively to subsidise South West Water's investment, either through a national fund drawing money from all water companies, or by public subsidy from taxation to South West Water, as has been suggested. Such solutions would run counter to the present legislative and regulatory framework. I wonder whether Liberal Democrats in other parts of the country would be enthusiastic about a discussion with customers in regions other than the south-west, and with those who would feel the impact of any redistribution of the south-west's costs. If the cost of water companies' plans were met by a national environmental fund that drew its money from customers throughout the country, individual companies would have less need to listen to their customers. There would be a lack of accountability and a weakening of the driver that encourages companies to keep their costs as low as possible. As the hon. Gentleman indicated, I am describing the arrangements that we inherited. In changing them and trying to correct what is clearly a major problem we have to be careful not to destroy their benefits.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/5">All regions, companies and customers have their problems and priorities. Whereas such costs as bathing water improvements have affected the south-west most heavily, other problems, such as nitrate removal, sewer flooding and the replacement of worn-out infrastructure, are at their worst in other parts of the country, including the Anglian region and the north-west.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/6">Another suggestion is that we should change the way in which individual charges are met. I have some sympathy in principle with the view that unmeasured charges based on rateable values are outmoded. We are considering the charging system and seeing how it develops. We have a particular interest in how metering develops and its balance with unmeasured charging. I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's point that a meter benefits small families or individuals rather than large families.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/7">We acknowledge that there is an issue about water affordability. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee pointed to that issue, and last year a cross-Government steering group reviewed the way that lower income households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. A wide range of stakeholders were involved in discussions with the steering group, and the Government published its report last December. It concluded that there are measures in place to assist lower income households. Suggested ways for the Government, Ofwat and the water industry to tackle the issues include improving existing arrangements in the short term and studying the effect of the charging system in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/8">The report made six recommendations to help vulnerable groups. Following the review of affordability measures, the pilot to which I referred earlier has been established in the south-west. We want to operate it alongside the Warm Front scheme, as there are clear links between our proposals for benefit health checks and efficiency measures. We will also be able to tap into the experience that the Warm Front team have built up in reducing the heating costs of vulnerable households.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/9">The pilot study will offer targeted assistance to help 1,000 households in the south-west to access advice on saving water, to install water efficiency appliances, to check for water leakages and so on. It is also worth pointing out that assistance through the tax and benefit system has increased significantly in recent years. As a result of personal tax and benefit measures implemented since 1997, by September this year families with children will be on average &pound;1,350 a year better off in real terms and the poorest third of pensioner households will have gained &pound;1,750 a year.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/10">I fully understand that that does not reduce the impact, or the perception, of the weight of water charges. The hon. Gentleman raised important issues in opening this debate because, in general, the tax credit and benefit systems do not provide targeted support for the costs of a particular service, such as water charges. There are exceptions&mdash;he referred to housing benefit and the child care tax credit. However, rents and child care costs typically represent a far larger proportion of household expenditure than do water and sewerage charges.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/11">Like the hon. Gentleman, we are concerned about the burden of water prices, particularly on customers in the south-west. South West Water customers have to pay more for their water and sewerage services than people in other regions. That is one of the features that developed out of privatisation, which required each customer to pay for the costs incurred by their water company. The hon. Gentleman acknowledged that and he was right to do so. Identifying the problems does not mean that there are easy solutions. Again, he acknowledged that.</p>
	<p pid=".206.1/12">So far, none of the ideas put forward fully solves the problems faced by customers, but Ministers are engaged in the ongoing search for a solution. Although we have yet to find it&mdash;I must acknowledge that&mdash;we have not given up. The affordability assistance pilot study will focus our effort on help to the most vulnerable customers, which is where help is most needed. I have no doubt that many lessons will be learned from that work which we can heed when considering long-term solutions to the problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.209.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" speakername="Peter Bradley" colnum="209"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h03.htm#50201h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".209.1/1">There is no doubt that there has been a decline in confidence in politicians and in our political systems that has accelerated since the 1990s. It is not always justified but we have to take it seriously, because we cannot afford to allow the public to lose faith in our institutions of government, whether at national or local level.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/2">The Government have done a lot in recent years to try to bring government closer to the people through devolution, commitment to town and parish councils, constitutional reform and the incorporation of European legislation on human rights, and in the long-awaited and yet-to-be-completed reform of the House of Lords. But perhaps the two key principles in bringing government closer to people are the promotion of the transparency of our systems of government, through such legislation as the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and the enhanced accountability of those responsible for those systems of government.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/3">Here, we have the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, and it is right that there should be a similar body in local government. That is why I support the Local Government Act 2000, and its creation of the Standards Board for England. The board is there to raise and sustain standards and public confidence in local government. I have to say at the outset that I disagree with the Conservative party, which says that it is unnecessary and should be abolished.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/4">A great deal of mischief and nonsense has been talked about the impact of the Standards Board, particularly on parish councils. It has been alleged that there has been a wholesale exodus from that essential form of public service since the introduction of the code. My understanding is that that is simply not the case; the National Association of Local Councils tells me that of some 80,000 men and women who serve on town and parish councils, only about 80 have tendered their resignation because they are not prepared to submit to the code. The challenge is not to abolish the Standards Board; it is to make it work. We should certainly not throw the proverbial baby out with the bath-water, as I believe the Conservatives are proposing to do.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/5">In general, standards are high among local councillors, but as there are 100,000 of them there are likely to be problems with individuals, and sometimes local authorities can have corporate problems and difficulties. Most councillors welcome the Standards Board. They recognise the need for guidance and support. They need the discipline of knowing that they are held to account. Above all, the public need to know that, too.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/6">I have studied with great interest the evidence recently submitted to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister: Housing, Planning, Local Government and the Regions Committee, and saw there widespread support for the Standards Board from the Local Government Association, NALC, leading councillors and senior officers. However, I have serious concerns about the Standards Board. I accept that its performance is improving, and I welcome the fact that a review of its code is under way. I hope that this debate will contribute to that process. But elements of the code are, in my view, badly flawed and open to exploitation. Also, there are delays in its processes that are themselves the cause of serious injustices.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/7">My first concern is that, for too many, the code has become a licence&mdash;indeed, a charter&mdash;for complaint. We are all familiar with the serial complainers&mdash;the small-minded, small-town curtain-twitchers who are turning some local authorities into battlegrounds on which they can fight out their personal and political vendettas.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/8">Back on <phrase class="date" code="2000-06-08">8 June 2000</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/980" name="Beverley Hughes">my right hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverley Hughes)</phrase>, then the Minister for Local Government and Housing, said that</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/9" class="indent">&quot;we can expect that the full panoply of the process, leading to the establishment of a tribunal, would be necessary only a few times a year.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Standing Committee A, </i><phrase class="date" code="2000-06-08">8 June 2000</phrase>; c. 427.]</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/10">I think that she underestimated. Partly because of the ill-defined breadth of the offences under the code, complaints are currently running at some 300 a month. That is up on the figures for last year, which were themselves 20 per cent. higher than the figures for the previous year. One third of those complaints come from fellow councillors, and no doubt still more come from political activists in the community. It is also noticeable that there is a concentration of complaints in the run-up to elections. Last year, 309 complaints were registered in February, 330 in April, and 257 in May; however, there were 444 in March. I am aware of at least one complaint made in the run-up to an election and dismissed after polling day where the accused lost his seat to the complainant.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/11">In many cases, smaller local councils are paralysed by the length and complications of the Standards Board process. It is noticeable that 73 per cent. of complaints come from the smaller councils&mdash;district councils, town councils and parish councils. It is also clear that the Standards Board is too often brought to a standstill by the sheer weight of the complaints that it is required to investigate. Until recently, it had to attach equal weight to all complaints, even though 75 per cent. of them were not referred onwards, and even though in 87 per cent. of those that were referred it was found that there had been no breach of the code or that no action should be taken. I am therefore glad that changes were introduced in November that allow the Standards Board to refer complaints back to local authorities for investigation. I am also pleased about the commitment to review in 12 months' time whether the Standards Board should introduce deterrents to vexatious complainants. However, it is my view that excessive centralisation has led to the injustice of delay, with many cases unresolved for well over a year.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/12">So, more needs to be done to reduce the burden and cost of complaints, the mayhem that they can wreak for local authorities, and the damage to the reputations of those belatedly found to be innocent of the charges against them. Key elements of the code are flawed and misguided. We in Parliament have to take our share of the responsibility for passing such legislation without anticipating some of its implications. Paragraph 3 of the code of conduct established in the Local Authorities (Model Code of Conduct) (England) Order 2001 forbids the disclosure of information given in confidence, and in so doing suppresses the duties of oppositions and the rights of whistleblowers; they are important rights in any public authority. Paragraph 4 creates an offence described as</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/13" class="indent">&quot;bringing his office or authority into disrepute.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/14">That offence is too broad, and a licence for vexatious complaints. Paragraph 7 places on councillors an obligation to report allegations against others, and provides a spurious justification for specious complaints.</p>
	<p pid=".209.1/15">I am most worried about the disclosure of confidential information&mdash;although, oddly, it is the element of the code that has received the least attention. It is a fundamental principle that a councillor's first duty is not to the authority of which he or she is a member, but to his or her constituents. Of course councillors should observe confidentiality when it is clear that the public interest is not served by disclosure, but there is a distinction between secrecy and confidentiality. Where in good faith councillors believe that the public interest overrides the principle of confidentiality, they have a duty to disclose confidential information. If that were not the case, local authorities could simply stamp any document or correspondence &quot;confidential&quot; if they did not want it to see the light of day. That is entirely counter to the Freedom of Information Act, the provisions of which were introduced only last month. It suppresses whistleblowing, and it can be, and is, used to suppress dissent and cloak and protect wrongdoing.</p>

	<p pid=".211.1/1">How they would work under such constraints? We have enshrined in our procedures parliamentary privilege, which enables us to refer to information that in any other forum would be regarded as confidential. Unless we can have a free flow of information and debate, there is little point in our being here. I am suggesting that the same principle that applies to us should also apply in other public bodies, and particularly in local government, because as much as we like to think of ourselves as being in the cockpit of power and having tremendous standing and importance, the decisions taken by local authorities often affect the lives of our constituents more regularly and intimately than our decisions. I am happy if I have helped the hon. Gentleman in that regard.</p>
	<p pid=".211.1/2">I may not please the hon. Gentleman quite as much in what I am about to say.

	<p pid=".211.3/1">The three of us were colleagues and comrades in arms on Westminster city council in its heady days. Had we and colleagues not placed ourselves at variance with the code that has since been adopted, many of the wrongdoings at that council, with which we are all too familiar, would not have been detected and no one would have been brought to justice for them.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/2">The case of our former colleague Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg, who is currently the leader of the Labour group on Westminster city council, as he was for some time in those days, exemplifies the need to reform paragraphs 3 and 4 of the code and to address the delays in process, to which I referred. It is an extraordinary irony, and perhaps an example of the Standards Board at its most confused, that a man of such high integrity, who played so important a role in exposing the worst political corruption in living memory and brought Shirley Porter and her colleagues to justice against all odds and all expectations, should now and over the past 18 months have faced indictment before the Standards Board&mdash;not for any political or personal corruption, and not as a result of a complaint from a member of the public, but as a result of a complaint by Westminster city council under paragraphs 3(a) and 4 of the code, which deal with confidential information and bringing a council into dispute. He is arraigned for exercising his judgment and revealing wrongdoing as he and we have done on many previous occasions.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/3">I will not go into great detail about the case, but I want to outline the background to it. Councillor Dimoldenberg was concerned about the commitment of Westminster city council to press for the surcharge imposed on Shirley Porter and her former colleague, David Weeks, by first the district auditor and ultimately the Law Lords when all legal recourse had been exhausted. He had every right to be suspicious, because after all many of those in the leadership of the council today are former acolytes of Shirley Porter, and he and we are all too familiar with the culture of secrecy, obfuscation and evasion that has long characterised Westminster city council. More to the point, he had evidence of the lack of progress being made in pursuing Shirley Porter for the surcharge. His concerns were shared by the media, which played a key role in uncovering the wrongdoings at Westminster over the years. It was a &quot;Panorama&quot; programme that gave rise to the objection to the district auditor that set in train the investigative process, and it was the long and honourable tradition of opposition parties working together with the media that shone light on the darkness with which many at Westminster would have preferred their activities to be cloaked.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/4">Councillor Dimoldenberg believed that the council was dragging its feet and, back in May and June 2003, he gave evidence to the BBC to back up his claims. He gave the information not for broadcasting, but on a background briefing basis. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-30">30 June</phrase>, &quot;Today&quot; broadcast an item that revealed some of that information. In retrospect, it is clear that Councillor Dimoldenberg's actions were fully justified. I shall cite one piece of information in support of that assertion: in the eight months prior to the broadcast, Westminster city council had been spending about &pound;14,500 a month on legal fees&mdash;a large amount, although pocket money by west end lawyers' standards. In the 11 months following the broadcast, Westminster city council had increased its activity to the extent that it was paying its lawyers not &pound;14,500 a month, but &pound;120,000 a month. As a result, some 10 months later, in April 2004, it recovered &pound;12.3 million of the surcharge that was imposed on Shirley Porter. There is an argument that she got off too lightly, given that the surcharge imposed was &pound;42 million. But there was no adverse outcome to Councillor Dimoldenberg's disclosure other than the embarrassment of Westminster city council.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/5">Despite the evidence of Councillor Dimoldenberg's standing and integrity and the positive outcome of his actions, Westminster city council lodged a complaint and, worse still, the Standards Board is pursuing it. I said &quot;pursuing&quot;, but perhaps that is a misnomer because it is now 18 months since that broadcast on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-30">30 June 2003</phrase>. It took precisely 12 months for the Standards Board to produce a draft report and it will not be until next week that Councillor Dimoldenberg has his preliminary hearing, and there is no knowing how much longer the process will last.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/6">It is hard to quantify the cost to Councillor Dimoldenberg. When I make references to him, he stands for many hundreds of other local councillors who, for different reasons, find themselves in a similar position. His legal costs are already in excess of &pound;6,000, but that is nothing compared with the disruption to his life over 18 months. He has a demanding career. He is still carrying out his duties as a councillor in Westminster. He has a young family, yet he is being obliged to spend much of his time and energy defending his reputation. It is difficult for us to understand the pressure, stress and anxiety that those circumstances create. On top of that, Councillor Dimoldenberg has serious uncertainties about his future and reputation.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/7">I make no apology for going into the case of Councillor Dimoldenberg in some detail because it exemplifies the urgent need for a public interest exemption to the paragraph in the code that otherwise imposes on councillors a duty of confidentiality. Had there been a public interest exemption, there is little doubt that Councillor Dimoldenberg would not be facing a charge that is as unjust as it is serious.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/8">What is to be done about the code? In November 2004, as I said, Parliament allowed the Standards Board to refer back minor cases to local authorities for resolution. I am sure that that was the right thing to do. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January</phrase>, the Committee on Standards in Public Life published an aptly titled report, &quot;Getting the Balance Right: Implementing Standards in Public Life&quot;, on the Standards Board and other issues. It expressed similar concerns to those that I have mentioned today and made not dissimilar recommendations. It said that the Standards Board needs to be &quot;fundamentally transformed&quot;. It wants a more locally based system, more independent members on local standards committees, the removal of unnecessary restrictions on councillors representing their constituents and a clearer distinction between private and official conduct.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/9">In its evidence to the Select Committee, the Local Government Association pressed for more local screening of complaints. There is a valid argument on both sides of that issue, but I think that I disagree with the LGA's position. It is very important that there should be no doubt in the public's mind that complaints are dealt with dispassionately at national level, even if they are referred back to the council for further investigation and adjudication. It is also important to remove any question of political bias in making complaints and considering them, even if that is a greater problem in perception than in fact.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/10">We need to discourage trivial and vexatious complaints. The Standards Board has indicated that it may consider a review of the sanctions against vexatious complainants next year, and that is an important step forward. I hope that that will not be necessary and that the very threat of sanctions against such complainants will deter them. However, they must understand that the petty point scoring in which they indulge can have devastating effects on their innocent victims. They must be deterred if they can be.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/11">It is also wrong that Members or political activists can make complaints purely for party political purposes, particularly during the run-up to elections. I hope that the Standards Board can find a way to penalise those who do so simply for the purpose of media exposure and for no legitimate reason. It is also important to remove the obligation on councillors to report allegations of misconduct. That obligation prevents such allegations from being resolved locally and expeditiously, sets in train the full panoply of the Standards Board and acts as an excuse or justification for trivial and personal grievances. The investigation process needs to be further accelerated, although progress is being made. There needs to be a much clearer and narrower definition of what is meant by bringing a local authority into disrepute. Finally, we need to qualify the paragraph on confidentiality with the public interest exemption, to which I referred.</p>
	<p pid=".211.3/12">I recognise that these are relatively early days in the life of the Standards Board, and that there have been some positive changes already. The Graham Committee has already come forward with further helpful recommendations and the ODPM Committee may also do so shortly. I welcome the fact that the Standards Board is reviewing its code. However, it is crucial that in seeking to strengthen public confidence in local government we do not undermine it and, in doing so, cause grave injustices when our purpose is to prevent them.</p>

	<p pid=".215.0/1">I wholly endorse what my hon. Friend said in support of the Standards Board&mdash;as an organisation and for its principles and much of its work. Alarm bells should ring if those of us who have been at the coal face of local government corruption should now be concerned about aspects of the code of practice and the organisation that all our instincts tell us to support.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/2">In the helpful Library briefing provided for the debate was a news article from <i>The Daily Telegraph</i>, which expressed the view that the words &quot;hammer&quot; and &quot;nut&quot; spring to mind when thinking about the Standards Board. That may or may not be true. The words that spring to my mind are more likely to be &quot;shoot&quot; and &quot;foot&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/3">How can it be that the Standards Board that we needed so much at Westminster council throughout the late 1980s and 1990s is now directing its inquiries against the man who, more than anyone else&mdash;with due deference to colleagues here and other key individuals&mdash;exposed the institutional corruption: Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg. The investigations are not because of an allegation of an abuse of public funds, taking bribes, downloading porn on a council computer or not signing the register of members' interests. If those were the types of allegations, I would be the first to say&mdash;friend or no friend&mdash;that such allegations should be fully and properly investigated, because such behaviour has no place in public life. But, as my hon. Friend says, Councillor Dimoldenberg stands accused of bringing local government, his authority, into disrepute because of his whistleblowing actions pursuing Westminster council's recovery of the debt owed to council tax payers by Shirley Porter.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/4">I note that the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, in presenting the Committee's recent report, told the magazine, <i>Local Government First</i>:</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The Standards Board needs to transform itself into a strategic regulator focusing on those most serious allegations that pose a high risk to the reputation of local democracy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/6">Such changes, he went on, would</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/7" class="indent">&quot;address the frequent, minor, vexatious and politically motivated complaints that cause a backlog of national investigations, leaving many councillors with allegations hanging over their heads&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/8">He did not add what I have had confirmed in a letter from the Standards Board&mdash;that such complaints cost an average of &pound;5,000 each to investigate. Of course, as my hon. Friend said, the accused councillor may in some cases build up many thousands of pounds of personal debt in fighting the charge. It has been noted, but should be repeated, that Councillor Dimoldenberg has spent a year and a half with these allegations hanging over him.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/9">I wanted to spend a few minutes on the issue described here as being a politically motivated concern that the Standards Board is anxious to remove. However, we have a substantial inquiry that seems both highly political and yet strangely stripped of the broader context of public interest.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/10">Central to the allegation against Councillor Dimoldenberg is that he passed information to the BBC that he knew to be confidential and that could have caused harm to the interests of the council. We need to remember that this is a man who has devoted two decades of his life to a virtually unremunerated public service, championing the interests of his constituents in some of the poorest neighbourhoods in London. His record in public life is one of disinterested and effective service in opposition, with neither hope nor ambition for higher office.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/11">When first elected, neither Councillor Dimoldenberg nor anyone else could foresee that the council that he had been a member of for several years would be embroiled in the scandal that began with the sale of the cemeteries and then became the homes-for-votes story. Equally, from the late 1980s onwards, as that scandal unfolded, few people could appreciate the extent to which the so-called building stable communities policy&mdash;otherwise understood as homes for votes&mdash;reached into almost all corners of the council, implicating councillors and officers in actions that were sometimes reminiscent of a cold war thriller.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/12">Councillor Dimoldenberg and his colleagues may well have been suspected of a touch of paranoia&mdash;this was before I joined the council&mdash;when they alleged that homes for votes extended beyond merely keeping council houses empty for sale into policies that knowingly shifted homeless families into asbestos-ridden tower blocks and, ultimately, led to a campaign of dirty tricks against councillors and against tenants and community organisations perceived as hostile. Inquiry after inquiry, from the district auditor to the Barratt report, subsequently reported that, clearly, if anything, none of us was sufficiently paranoid to comprehend the scale of what was going on.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/13">That is important context, which explains why we remain sceptical of what we are told about the Porter affair and its legacy&mdash;in this case, about Westminster council's commitment to recovering the debt owed to council tax payers, not least when Westminster's current leader, so different in many respects, none the less continues to refer to the woman from whom the council he leads is supposed to be collecting debts as a personal friend and to the vast apparatus of homes for votes as a &quot;mistake&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/14">I passed an e-mail to Councillor Dimoldenberg in May 2003, from a man who told me:</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/15" class="indent">&quot;I have been investigating&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/16">members of the Porter family</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/17" class="indent">&quot;for the past year . . . I am sorry to tell you that I got a lot further than Westminster's lawyers investigating the matter . . . I offered to hand over my entire investigation and continue to develop the leads we had made. Did they want to know? No.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/18" class="indent">Dame Shirley Porter's money is alive and well and running around London. You need new impetus at Westminster council.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/19">No wonder I was not as dismissive of that e-mail as I might have been under other circumstances, and nor was Councillor Dimoldenberg. Put simply, the trust we should, and normally would, place in the local authority has been comprehensively forfeited over the past 15 years and the road back has been long, slow and hesitant.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/20">Even relatively recent events illustrate how reasonable it is that we should continue to regard with suspicion the council that Paul Dimoldenberg is accused of bringing into disrepute. For example, it continues to operate its own interpretation of the rules when it comes to standards. City solicitor Colin Wilson qualified the concept of confidentiality, when in an e-mail to council colleagues two weeks after the &quot;Today&quot; programme at the heart of the alleged confidentiality story, he said:</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/21" class="indent">&quot;I am not suggesting that you refuse him any and all confidential materials. Where Councillor Dimoldenberg is working constructively with the council, as he is on a number of issues, there may be no harm in giving him the material. On the other hand, where we are aware that he is opposing the City Council on an issue, and harm to the City Council interests could result from publication of the material he has asked for, we may need to refuse him notice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".215.0/22">The issue of confidentiality&mdash;the grounds for Councillor Dimoldenberg's referral to the Standards Board&mdash;is not the issue at stake at all. The issue at stake is simply determined by asking whose interests are being served. In other words, the situation is, &quot;I inform, you brief and he leaks&quot;.</p>

	<p pid=".217.0/1">My hon. Friend has just read out a rather disturbing stream of consciousness from that senior officer.

What is the role of opposition if it is not to oppose the council's policies with which it disagrees?</p>

	<p pid=".217.1/1">I completely agree with my hon. Friend. That goes to the heart of the debate that we need to have about changes to the code and the way in which the Standards Board operates in future.</p>
	<p pid=".217.1/2">Nor was the instance that I mentioned the only one when representatives of Westminster council acted in such a way as to, at the very least, call into question the true nature of the campaign against Councillor Dimoldenberg. After the original referral to the Standards Board, the council's chief executive offered to withdraw the complaint. However, as an insurance policy, he asked Councillor Dimoldenberg to provide him with a signed, undated letter of resignation from the council, to be used whenever he considered that Councillor Dimoldenberg had breached the code of conduct.</p>
	<p pid=".217.1/3">That prompted the local newspaper to argue:</p>
	<p pid=".217.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Effectively, a democratically elected councillor would have been serving at the whim of an unelected and, as far as the public is concerned, largely anonymous official. Such a situation would be a travesty of everything a democracy stands for. Given Councillor Dimoldenberg's reputation for integrity, it is mindboggling that anyone in authority really believed that such a seedy plan could ever succeed . . . This was a crude attempt to interfere with the democratic process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".217.1/5">So this is a Council that spawned the largest and costliest gerrymandering exercise in local government history&mdash;one which cost the taxpayer many millions of pounds and caused considerable distress and misery. Many officials and councillors were identified as being complicit. They were aware of wrongdoing but not aware of their duty to stop it. Only two individuals were finally found guilty and subject to surcharge. Many of the same councillors involved in the Porter regime remained in office and were responsible for collecting Shirley Porter's &pound;42 million surcharge. A year and half after the case was finally determined in the House of Lords, there were few signs of progress in recovering the debt.</p>
	<p pid=".217.1/6">Yet, an opposition councillor who had exposed the wrongdoing and was wholly committed to the recovery of &pound;42 million of taxpayers' money finds himself in the dock for attempting to move that recovery forward, even while senior council officers reveal their own, rather fluid interpretations of both confidentiality and accountability.</p>
	<p pid=".217.1/7">Celebrated humorist Tom Lehrer announced on the day Henry Kissinger was awarded the Nobel peace prize that he was giving up satire on the grounds that it was now redundant. While I express complete support for the principles of the Standards Board and for its staff, I am afraid that the referral of Councillor Dimoldenberg makes me feel the same way.</p>

	<p pid=".218.0/1">I rise, first, to give the Chamber a short, if temporary, break from the affairs of Westminster city council, and secondly, because I want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" name="Peter Bradley">my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley)</phrase> on this excellent but necessary example of post-legislative scrutiny&mdash;in this case, of the legislation that set up the Standards Board. Before I tell my story, it is important to state that I was a member of the Standards and Privileges Committee for six years. Only one Member of Parliament has a longer record of service on it.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/2">In May 2003, the Labour party lost control of High Peak borough council. Among the councillors who were elected then for the first time were two or three members of the Glossopdale Independent party, one of whom seems to be a fair-weather friend. Almost immediately, those councillors started using the council e-mail system to copy all members of the council and officers into copious amounts of correspondence. Much of it was unprofessional, much was personal and some was libellous and offensive. Some may even have been funny, but the joke soon wore off.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/3">One of those councillors, Leslie Wilcox&mdash;I stress that there are two councillors called Wilcox on High Peak borough council; I am talking about the one who represents Whitfield ward&mdash;consistently used the council e-mail system to belittle and undermine staff, and was rude to them over the telephone. He included large numbers of councillors and staff in his e-mails, often undermining the work of council officers in front of their juniors, instructing officers to do his bidding, expecting them to behave in an unreasonable manner and routinely accusing them of lying, plotting and secrecy and of copying his offensive and misplaced e-mails to the local press.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/4">Over the months, the chief executive of the council and the reporting officer gave Councillor Wilcox verbal warnings about his offensive behaviour and his disregard for the code of conduct. Much of his attack was aimed at officers in the planning and development departments. It is widely believed that the attacks were a contributory factor in a number of unfortunate incidents. A senior director of one department has announced that he is taking early retirement earlier than originally planned. Another officer has been promoted to a job in another local authority, but the councillor's e-mails have followed him, undermining him in the eyes of his new employers, too. Another senior officer in the same department has had a heart attack, and yet another is considering legal action against the councillor after he publicly accused her of taking bribes. The level of stress-related absence in those departments has been increasing, and councillors have asked officers to record all examples of harassment and bullying.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/5">So, after less than six months as a councillor, Leslie Wilcox was reported to the Standards Board following several encounters with senior officers who had attempted to alert him to the unacceptable nature of his behaviour and his need to stop. He was reported in late 2003. That action was supported not only by the Labour group&mdash;the largest group on the council&mdash;but by the ruling alliance of Conservative, Liberal and independent members.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/6">In early 2004, the Standards Board took some 10 statements from councillors and officers in its investigation of some seven separate complaints that had been made against Leslie Wilcox. Then, in spring last year, everything went quiet, or at least it did so from the point of view of the Standards Board. Councillor Wilcox was continuing his campaign of harassment, offensive language and the belittling and undermining of councillors and especially officers.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/7">In June, I wrote privately to the Standards Board, expressing concern about the time that it was taking to deal with the case. I discussed it not only with senior officers of the council, but with the independent chair of the standards committee of the council. My intervention was based on the fact that six months into the investigation, Councillor Wilcox's behaviour was as bad as ever, and no amount of internal warnings was curbing the abuse. I stress that I was not presenting any evidence to the Standards Board myself, or trying to influence the outcome of its deliberations; I was simply trying to get the report published, as the situation was going from bad to worse.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/8">Also in June, the Standards Board chief executive, David Prince, apologised to me in writing for the fact that the investigation had taken so long. In September, the Standards Board told the independent chair of the standards committee of the council that its report was almost complete and would be presented in four weeks' time, at which point it would have to be decided whether to send the case to the national adjudication board for England, or to deal with it at local Standards Board level.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/9">In November, the investigating officer from the Standards Board told High Peak borough council that the board appreciated the urgency of the situation&mdash;at last&mdash;and that the draft report would be ready by</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/10" class="indent">&quot;the end of December at the latest&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/11">In December, the council withdrew the e-mail facility from Councillor Wilcox and another sometime member of the Glossopdale Independent party, because the level of abuse had grown even more intolerable. Throughout that time, however, the council continued&mdash;correctly, I believe&mdash;not to refer cases involving the councillor to its own local standards committee, as it did not want that to prejudice the outcome of the Standards Board investigation.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/12">On Boxing day, I was assured that publication of the draft report was imminent. That was more than a month ago, and we still have no report more than a year after the investigation commenced. Meanwhile, Councillor Wilcox has discovered that you do not need to be on the council's e-mail system to send abusive and disruptive e-mails to every council member and officer. Councillors have thick skins; like all politicians, they have to. However, we should not allow public servants&mdash;council officers&mdash;to be subjected to such unacceptable behaviour by a councillor.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/13">What is also unacceptable is the Standards Board's response to the case. Its tardiness has allowed a bad situation to get worse. By allowing this behaviour to continue for the best part of two years, it has brought itself into disrepute in High Peak. A bully continues their behaviour even when told not to. The way to combat a bully is not to roll over in front of them and pretend that they are not there, which is what the Standards Board gives every impression of having done in this case.</p>
	<p pid=".218.0/14">As a new councillor, Councillor Leslie Wilcox does not know and has never learned what it means to be in the privileged and responsible position of representing a ward. He does not know what it is to be a democrat and to work as a partner with other councillors and officers, and he will not be told. I am not asking my hon. Friend the Minister to adjudicate in this case&mdash;the facts speak for themselves&mdash;but I want her to know that the Standards Board was initially seen by councillors and officers in High Peak as a friend of local democracy and the independent arbiter of what is acceptable behaviour. In this case, it was seen as a solution to an otherwise intractable problem. It is a necessary part of the regulation of public life, but there is a great danger that if it cannot act promptly and effectively in open-and-shut cases such as this one, it will not be seen that way in future. That is not good for democracy.</p>

	<p pid=".220.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" name="Peter Bradley">my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. Both he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/762" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> referred to our common history over many years of struggle on Westminster council. Our experiences from those days show the need for a better system of investigating complaints of misconduct. Were it not for the persistence of a relatively tight&mdash;in the sense of working together&mdash;group of Labour councillors, backed by a number of determined people working in the Labour party, combined with the persistence and professionalism of a district auditor second to none, John Magill, I doubt we would have exposed those activities. Almost 20 years later we still have not seen the end of the story in that complaints still remain to be dealt with. I find it bizarre that Dame Shirley Porter, who was awarded her damehood for services to local government, still has that award whereas John Magill goes unrecognised.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/2">After my experiences in Westminster, I was elected to this House and now have the privilege to serve as a member of the Standards and Privileges Committee. Those two factors give me an insight into different methods of dealing with particular problems. We need a system that is proportionate and exercises a degree of common sense, fairness and justice&mdash;justice delayed is justice not done. Only that way can we have a system that inspires confidence in the public and the people subject to it. Having seen the regimes of two Parliamentary Commissioners for Standards&mdash;Sir Philip Mawer and his predecessor&mdash;I have seen how the systems can change and develop for the better. In Sir Philip Mawer, we have a good public servant with a common-sense and fair approach to dealing with matters.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/3">We have an effective way of dealing with mischievous and de minimus complaints, a procedure to correct minor errors, and clear advice and warnings against tit-for-tat allegations. I was the subject of a tit-for-tat allegation in the run-up to the last election. A bogus complaint was timed specifically to screw up my election campaign, but mercifully did not because of delays to the election caused by foot and mouth disease. Therefore, I can speak at first hand in saying that, even if it is a bogus complaint that is dealt with in a matter of two or three weeks, it imposes strain. The intensity of the pressure that it puts one under, the fears for the future and the sheer amount of time that it takes to deal with such complaints are very disconcerting. It does not bear thinking about that some of our councillors are under that pressure, sometimes for years.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/4">We on the Standards and Privileges Committee deal with inquiries very quickly&mdash;in weeks, at most, unless the case is very serious, or if the person complained against does not co-operate with the inquiry. That is a better way of doing things. The fact that the work of the commissioner is subject to parliamentary scrutiny, with regular reports to us on progress, is an important check on the system.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/5">We need to be aware of the impact on public life if we do not get those systems right. How can we expect people to devote many hours of service&mdash;when I was a councillor it was effectively unpaid service; now people are paid, although not well&mdash;to their local communities, if there is the potential shadow of unfounded allegations taking so long to resolve? We need to find a degree of balance. I welcome the Standards Board's involvement.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/6">I do not want to say a great deal about the case of Councillor Paul Dimoldenberg&mdash;it has been amply described by my two hon. Friends. However, I will say this about the case. Councillor Dimoldenberg is charged with bringing Westminster council into disrepute, which assumes that it has a reputation to bring into disrepute in the first place. Looking back over those days, I think that the reputation of Westminster council is probably the worst in local government, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/7">I was elected, with Councillor Dimoldenberg, to Westminster council in 1982. I served with him as a councillor for many years, and he has been a personal friend for almost 25 years. I have never come across anyone who is so dedicated to serving his local community, without fear or favour, so determined to stand up for what he believes in, or of such great integrity as Councillor Dimoldenberg. To see him dragged before the Standards Board in that appalling and shameful way, while others go unscathed, is a real blot on our public life.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/8">Councillor Simon Milton and Councillor Robert Davis, two leading lights in the Conservative party on Westminster council, met Dame Shirley Porter for dinner in Israel in June 2001, at a time when the allegations were still being investigated and when the council was trying to get its money back. Even now, Councillor Milton refers to Dame Shirley Porter as a personal friend. I find it utterly appalling that no criticism has been made of them by anyone in authority.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/9">I also find it bizarre that, after all we now know about Westminster council, the Conservative party has still not had the decency to apologise for what occurred under Dame Shirley Porter's regime. That is despite numerous assurances from the then leader of the Conservative party and Prime Minister, John Major, and others, that an apology would be forthcoming if a case was found against her.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/10">I have moved on, and now represent a constituency in Barnet. I should like to give two examples from Barnet. The first was of an unjustified complaint made in September 2002 against the then Councillor Alan Williams, who was leader of the Labour group and former leader of the council. He was reported to the Standards Board by the chief executive, whom he had criticised in the heat of debate in a council meeting. In council meetings, as in the House, we may often get carried away and say things that we regret. On that occasion, the chief executive was perhaps over-sensitive to criticism, and reported Councillor Williams. Some months later, Councillor Williams was interviewed by a junior Standards Board officer in what I can only describe as the star chamber approach; he was given no detail of the complaint against him or the evidence that he had to counter. We have experienced that problem in the House. Under previous regimes, when complaints were brought before the Standards and Privileges Committee, people were interviewed and cross-examined without knowing the case that they had to answer. That is neither fair, nor natural justice&mdash;it is simply wrong. Councillor Williams was eventually cleared, some 10 months after the complaint was made; the complaint, which was in itself quite trivial, was dismissed.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/11">That example calls into question the relationship between officers and members. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1043" name="Tom Levitt">My hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase> referred to one aspect of that relationship. It is important that the right balance between officers and members is preserved. If officers think that they are going to have the whip hand over members, that can unfairly alter that balance. The best example of that was given by my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, when she described the appalling behaviour of the chief executive of Westminster, in demanding an unsigned resignation letter from Councillor Dimoldenberg to keep in his back pocket as some sort of lever over him for the future. If anybody should be investigated by the Standards Board, it is the chief executive who expects that from an elected member in those circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/12">The other case to which I want to refer is that of former councillor Alan Sloam. Looking at his case from the opposite point of view, he was reported&mdash;in my opinion, correctly&mdash;for very serious misconduct in August 2003 over attempts to fix parking tickets. The evidence was clear and, as far as I can see, uncontested, but it took until June 2004 for his case to be determined and for him to be disqualified. He then appealed to the High Court; the appeal was heard last week and was dismissed. The borough solicitor will not yet call a by-election to replace former councillor Sloam until the time limit for appeal to the Court of Appeal has expired. Going back to the restraints of sub judice mentioned earlier, that case is not sub judice because no appeal has yet been entered. However, from June 2004 to today, the electors of Colindale ward in my constituency have been one councillor light, and that looks as if it will continue for several more weeks. That cannot be fair to the other two councillors in that ward, who are having to carry a substantial extra work load in a large and demanding ward until a replacement can be elected. It is wrong that for nine months, a ward can be unrepresented in such circumstances. We can argue about the reasons for that, but ultimately, one of the arguments is whether the Standards Board is properly resourced in the first place to enable it to conduct inquiries promptly and effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/13">There has to be a procedure to get rid of the silly cases quickly and informally, as Sir Philip Mawer does. Many such cases are simply not reported to the House because they are so trivial: at every Committee meeting, several cases are dismissed because there is nothing in them. However, there must be a clearing of the decks to allow serious cases to be investigated promptly and properly and with a degree of professionalism. I question whether, from what I have seen of it, the Standards Board has the determination to investigate cases such as that of Lady Porter, or whether it has people of the calibre of a senior partner of Touche Ross. John Magill was backed up by the Touche Ross team, which devoted a lot of resources to investigating that case, and it is doubtful whether the Standards Board would ever have got to the bottom of the Lady Porter saga. We must operate with a degree of common sense, which is currently lacking.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/14">The other thing that must be done is to recognise that the role of the Standards Board, as with our own Standards and Privileges Committee, is not just to punish the wrongdoer but to promote good practice. We hear far too little about efforts to promote good practice in local government, to raise standards, and to explain to people what they have to do to avoid getting into a mess in the first place. In this House, we have got much better at advising people what the rules and pitfalls are, and how to avoid getting into trouble. More of that needs to be done in local government.</p>
	<p pid=".220.1/15">The Standards Board is a welcome development, but in practice, it has not operated as well as it should. We do not have a system that commands the confidence&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".224.0/1">I forget where I had got to. I think I was summing up by saying that we need a Standards Board that shows proportionality and common sense, and operates quickly and effectively, because justice delayed is justice denied.

	<p pid=".224.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" name="Peter Bradley">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley)</phrase>, one of my near neighbours in constituency terms, on securing the debate and on his excellent speech. He made good recommendations about changes that should be made to the Standards Board and, more importantly, to the code of conduct that it is working towards. We also heard excellent speeches from the hon. Members for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck), for High Peak (Tom Levitt) and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore). I shall deliberately stay well away from the issue of Westminster. I would not dare to tread on those subjects.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/2">Rather than go over some of the points that have been made, I want to raise a few additional concerns. Some are already being addressed&mdash;at least they will be if the Government accept the 10th report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life&mdash;and others have yet to be addressed. To put the problem in context, out of all the Members present I probably have the most councillors in my constituency. There are 81 parish and town councils in my constituency, and two district councils and a county council cover the area. Around 750 of my 63,000 constituents are councillors, so there is a councillor for about every 90 constituents. The Standards Board probably affects my constituents disproportionately.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/3">As a result of the setting up of the Standards Board and the way it has operated, despite some improvements, some good councillors have decided not to continue even though its investigations have since found them not guilty. That includes councillors from all parties in my patch, people like Robin Bennett, a Labour town councillor and Alison Cundall, a Liberal Democrat councillor, who were both subsequently found to have nothing to answer. For them it was pretty near the final straw and they stepped down from the council. They were not alone in doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/4">All political parties have difficulty persuading people to come forward to stand for elections, and this is an added problem. One set of elections that we can be certain will be on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase> is the council elections. We know from talking to people and asking them whether they will stand for election that the issue of the Standards Board is in the mind of potential candidates. It puts some of them off. The publicity surrounding the Standards Board is driving people away.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/5">Robin Bennett, who was an excellent town councillor in Ludlow, writes:</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I want to convey to you the sense of the appalling sequence of events locally in autumn 2002, facilitated entirely by the presence of the new Standards Code, and something of the emotional upheaval many of us felt at the time, leading to some giving up and others declining to take on council work, and others again learning to be so careful in their current behaviour as councillors that the energy that went into their previous local work has been seriously undermined and restricted. Friends do not believe the stories we have to tell, assuming that 'standards' means big stuff like not running off with the money or getting genuine advantage for yourself rather than doing your best by people and voluntary organisations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/7">That is typical of the mood of councillors in the dozen or so cases that I have heard about. They are only a small proportion of the councillors in my constituency who have been affected. Third parties can also be damaged by the publicity. The Standards Board can hold hearings in public. In one case, despite the fact that it was found that the two councillors had no case to answer, the private details of a third party were mentioned by one of the solicitors. The Standards Board could not stop the press reporting the details of a proposed financial settlement, and the party in question has no recourse.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/8">The other side of the matter is that often the councillors complained against cannot respond to the press, but the press find out all the details of the case. A letter to me states:</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The press were told about my reporting immediately. Confidential letters sent to me and the person who reported me were in the press immediately and when I protested to SBE I was told that they had no control system. However, the actual complaint letter had the name tippexed out. It is thus clear that anyone may make an allegation, with impunity, and put that accusation in the press. I am aware of the national debate about the famous, but at local level, it is a destructive situation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/10">That has been the effect. The situation paralysed Ludlow town council for a couple of years, although it no longer does so. Numerous complaints were made, mostly against councillors by other councillors; there was a tit-for-tat element. That paralysing effect on councils goes to the heart of some of the problems, and highlights the need to speed up the process and keep it more local. Some of the reforms may be moving in that direction.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/11">Another Labour town councillor from a different part of my constituency came to me for help. He had declared an interest on a planning application, but wrote letters to his fellow councillors. He was subsequently found not guilty of having breached any code of conduct. I took up his case. Part of the problem was that the legal advice that the town council works from is that of the district council officer. There can be different standards of advice from different officers. I have two district councils in my area, and their officers give two completely different interpretations as to what should be reported. An officer who is overly cautious or overly zealous&mdash;depending on one's point of view&mdash;about suggesting that things be reported can paralyse a local council.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/12">There are concerns that the quality of the investigations is sometimes lacking. Let me offer another quote:</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The officers of SBE displayed a level of ignorance about the rules and workings on government (especially about the division of duties and responsibilities in an area where there are three tier councils)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/14">Part of the problem is that the Standards Board has people who investigate on the one hand in, say, Birmingham, where there might be a ward of 24,000 electors and three councillors, and on the other hand in parish councils of 500 people represented by nine councillors, as in my part of the world. There are big differences.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/15">There is also the problem of the cost that councillors face. Let me offer a typical example, not from my constituency but from Salisbury. A councillor incurred &pound;2,250 in legal costs to clear his name, and although he won his case he cannot claim for any of those costs, unlike in the normal legal process.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/16">There are a number of other problems. My part of the country typically has single-member wards. One of the most disturbing things about the process has been the way that local councillors are prevented from speaking on a local issue, because they are deemed to have a prejudicial&mdash;not usually a financial&mdash;interest. Recommendation R28 in the tenth report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life deals with that, and I hope that the Government tackle it. If that recommendation had been in place, one of the hardest working independent district councillors in my constituency, Madge Shineton, would not have been found by the Standards Board to have wronged when she spoke at a planning meeting on behalf of her constituents who were trying to stop a pub from being closed. She was found to be in breach and was barred from the council for six months. The people who really lost out were her constituents because there was no ward councillor for six months. I should add that there are not normally elections in that ward because all the political parties think so highly of Madge Shineton that we would hardly even consider standing against her, and yet she is the only person to have been found to have been in breach. The recommendation would have cleared her.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/17">I am glad that the recommendations have been made, but they should go further. The relaxation in the recommendations of the tenth report will go some way to tackling another issue, which has been touched on&mdash;that of officers using the existence of the Standards Board and the code of conduct to pressurise councillors. It happens rarely, but it does happen. I know of cases; I do not particularly want to talk about them. A relaxation of the code and a more effective investigation system would tackle those problems.</p>
	<p pid=".224.1/18">I do hope that the Minister will agree to implement the recommendations and relax the rules.</p>

	<p pid=".226.0/1">This case probably pre-dates the introduction of the Standards Board, but the hon. Gentleman will know of, and I hope share my respect for, the former chief executive of Bridgnorth council, who was grievously wronged over an extended period by allegations made against her by elected members. The hon. Gentleman is right: just as elected members need to be protected against officers when they err from the straight and narrow, it is important that the Standards Board also protects the integrity and best interests of officers who do not always have the opportunity to defend themselves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.226.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" speakername="Matthew Green" colnum="226"  time="15:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h03.htm#50201h03_spnew16">
	<p pid=".226.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The case that he cites is well known in the area; it slightly pre-dates the Standards Board. There were some tit-for-tat allegations that beset Bridgnorth council for several years, but they were dealt with effectively because they were dealt with locally. The allegations stopped immediately when one councillor, who I will not name, retired from the council. That is an interesting answer. There would have been a much bigger problem with the Standards Board in place, because it would continually have tied up everyone's time.</p>
	<p pid=".226.1/2">I finish by saying that the best way to ensure that local government is clean is to make certain that as much information as possible reaches the public, because if members of the public do not like the way a councillor behaves, they can throw them out. Too much of the Standards Board's time is taken up investigating conduct rather than misbehaviour. If a councillor is displaying appalling conduct, and they are abusing the electorate, as is sometimes the case, the answer lies in the ballot box. However, the Government might want to consider asking the larger councils&mdash;unitary authorities and county councils&mdash;to record their meetings. Something that keeps this House on the straight and narrow is the fact that what we say is recorded and published. If we say something that goes too far, there is a fair chance that another political party will publish it in a leaflet and use it against us.

	<p pid=".227.0/1">I found that last speech very distressing, largely because I agree with just about everything that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/922" name="Matthew Green">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Matthew Green)</phrase> said. It is not good for me to find myself agreeing with Liberal Democrats. However, after years of Liberal neglect, one can now watch Brentwood council on the internet and every word is recorded.</p>
	<p pid=".227.0/2">This has been a most interesting debate, not least because it has given hon. Members, and students of constitutional history, a tutorial on the use of parliamentary privilege. Councillor Wilcox of High Peak will have something to chew over besides his cornflakes when he picks up his morning copy of <i>Hansard. </i>The man may have redeeming features, but, sadly, because of lack of parliamentary time, his Member of Parliament was not able to give us any of them.</p>

	<p pid=".227.4/2">As not enough emphasis has been placed on what it is really like in local government, I quote briefly from &quot;Getting the Balance Right&quot;, which states that</p>
	<p pid=".227.4/3" class="indent">&quot;it is possible for the Committee to conclude on the evidence it has received that despite incidences of corruption and misbehaviour, the vast majority of councillors and officers observe high standards of conduct.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".227.4/4">That is absolutely right. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" name="Peter Bradley">the hon. Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley)</phrase>&mdash;what matters in relation to standards should be the big stuff, not the trivial.</p>
	<p pid=".227.4/5">With some regret, I have to say that the Standards Board has become the problem, not the solution. It is damaging to the reputation and standing of local government and wastes taxpayers' money on frivolous and malicious complaints. It has done much to undermine confidence in councils and councillors. My party plans to abolish the Standards Board and, if time permits, I shall say what we will replace it with. There can be no doubt that the board is being used for partisan, malicious reasons. We have heard some very good examples of that, which I shall not repeat.</p>
	<p pid=".227.4/6">The <i>Local Government Chronicle </i>noted that just over 200 of 3,122 complaints made between March and April last year resulted in action being taken against councils. There remains a serious issue for the board in how it discriminates between legitimate and illegitimate public concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".227.4/7">Again, the fact came out that the process is risk free for the complainant. They can cheat, lie and fabricate and there is no comeback.</p>

	<p pid=".228.2/1">As I was saying, this is a charter for the disgruntled and the grudge bearer, against which there is no redress, unlike in the criminal and civil courts. Malicious complaints can be submitted that place a candidate or political party under a cloud of suspicion before they are cleared. We heard examples of that earlier today. We all know that mud sticks and reputations are ruined by dirty tricks. However, what makes matters worse is that the Standards Board refuses to publish the names of people or organisations that make the allegations, due to data protection legislation.</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/2">The Standards Board has a deserved reputation for dragging its feet with complaints. I shall give one example of how councillors appear to be guilty until they are proved innocent. One complaint against six Liberal Democrat councillors in Islington has taken more than two and a half years. I checked with colleagues before we resumed and that case is still going on, but it is unacceptable that it should be hanging over councillors for such a long time. As Sir Alistair Graham, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, who has been quoted already, has said:</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Justice delayed is justice denied.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/4">He says that that appears to be compounded by some abuses of the complaints system for purely political or personal motives and it is often successful abuse, given the time taken to complete the investigations. We have heard various references to that committee's findings and I endorse its view with regard to proportionality. The Standards Board spends far too much of its time considering relatively trivial things. I also agree with the recommendation on culture, which says that local investigation is withering on the vine.</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/5">The Committee on Standards in Public Life makes a third point at paragraph 3.11 that is worth quoting:</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Local government is far more constrained by rules governing conduct than any other part of the public sector we have examined. It is therefore ironic, but not at all surprising, that despite the profusion of rules, the lack of clarity about standards has grown.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/7">In a way, that body is beginning to have an impact on representative democracy. Unless we are careful, we will end up with the local delivery and management of services without a democratic element included.</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/8">The Committee on Standards in Public Life report suggests that the Standards Board should be transformed into a more strategic regulator and goes on to explain why. The good old strategic role is in many ways the outer circle of hell for many organisations that have outlived their usefulness and are heading towards the door marked &quot;Exit&quot;. Once people have achieved nothing much, they are made strategic and after a few years they are got rid of.</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/9">Much reference has been made to parish councils. It is has to be noted that nearly two fifths of parish and town councils do not attract sufficient candidates to fill their available seats, there has been a decline in the number of contested parish council elections over the past decade, there is a great problem finding candidates and the situation is worse. People might not have left en masse, but there has been an exodus of a slightly more disguised nature: people are not seeking re-election.</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/10">That is why we believe that the Standards Board should be abolished, and we shall do that in our first month in office. We shall seek to repeal the secondary legislation within the first year. District auditors will continue to play their role in investigating financial impropriety in local government and the local ombudsman will continue to investigate complaints made by the public about administrative failures. The police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the courts will take the lead in investigating and prosecuting any breaches of criminal law.</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/11">Existing civil law will cover such issues as libel and slander by councillors. We will repeal the codes of conduct for councils and replace them with light-touch advice on declaring personal and prejudicial issues. That will ensure that there is a simpler, straightforward transparency in the conduct of councillors.</p>
	<p pid=".228.2/12">What should the sanctions be? If councillors do not meet the highest standards of conduct, which the electorate expect of them, the electorate will take the opportunity to vote them out of office through the ballot box. Alternatively, the councillor may choose not to present themselves again for public office or the political parties may choose not to sponsor that candidate for election.</p>

	<p pid=".230.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. At times, I have felt as if I were part of some elaborate Friends Reunited meeting of ex-Westminster councillors. The record shows that I defended Dame Shirley in this House, believing that she had a right to the presumption of innocence until she was proved guilty. I am happy, but sad also, to don the necessary sackcloth and ashes and recognise that what she did in Westminster was unacceptable. I support the current leadership of Westminster council in its pursuit of her to get back the necessary sums of money. It is a great shame&mdash;Dame Shirley had many things going for her&mdash;but justice has been gone through and a decision reached. I do not seek in any way to bow away or back-pedal from that. I hope that my response is sufficiently robust for the hon. Gentleman.</p>

	<p pid=".230.3/2">Perhaps I should make one final point. What caught Dame Shirley was not the Standards Board, but existing, robust procedures to ensure standards. They have been replaced by a system in which members and officers can hide behind the petty regulations of the Standards Board. It is certainly my view that this odious, useless and pointless body&mdash;it has achieved virtually nothing, is toothless in its desire and has spent an awful lot of money&mdash;should be wound up without further ado. However, I look forward to the Minister's explanation of how necessary the board is until it becomes strategic.</p>

	<p pid=".230.4/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/747" name="Peter Bradley">my hon. Friend the Member for The Wrekin (Peter Bradley)</phrase> for the opportunity to discuss the work of the Standards Board for England. The board's role is to conduct important work, helping to maintain the highest standards of public conduct for local authority members. I want to address some specific points that hon. Members have made; although they will recognise that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on many of the individual cases that have been raised, I do want to respond on some of the principles that have been discussed.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/2">Clearly, promoting high standards of behaviour among councillors and elected representatives is an important objective for the Government. We know that many men and women devote their time and energy to the service of their communities. The vast majority of people elected to serve as local authority members already observe the highest standards of conduct&mdash;as indeed do the officials who support them. The strength of local democracy and the delivery of effective services depend very much on elected members' commitment and willingness to serve. We are lucky in this country to have high standards of probity, accountability and objectivity in our local political traditions.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/3">However, we cannot disguise the fact that failings do occur from time to time. There have been cases, albeit rare, where elected members have fallen short of the conduct that is expected of them. That kind of misconduct not only harms the community that members are elected to serve, but can damage the wider reputation of local government&mdash;and undermine the public's trust and confidence in the system as a whole.That is why an ethical framework is so important. In the Local Government Act 2000, a new framework was introduced to promote high standards of ethical behaviour. After a period to allow people to adjust, it is increasingly accepted by the local authority world as an integral part of public life. It aims to provide clarity about what constitutes acceptable standards of conduct; a fair and effective means of investigating allegations of misconduct; and a regime for response.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/4">In November 2001, following consultation, the Government laid before Parliament a set of model codes of conduct, drawing on a set of principles of public life and laying down the conduct expected of members. From May 2002, the provisions of the code have applied to all councillors. This means that any allegations that the code has been breached can be reported to the Standards Board for England, which can decide whether to investigate. Some changes have already been made; regulations have now enabled ethical standards officers to refer less serious cases for investigation by local monitoring officers and the determination of cases by standards committees. This enables cases to be dealt with locally where this is the most appropriate level.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/5">Hon. Members have raised a series of detailed points and concerns about the operation of the code. This is the right time to review the code. We have had the Graham report, which hon. Members referred to. We know, too, that the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is looking at the code and issues around it at present. The Standards Board will shortly go out to consultation on a review of the entire code. I will ensure that the issues raised in the debate are passed on and considered as part of that review. However, I want to address a couple of specific points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/6">First, I wish to respond to a point raised by several hon. Members&mdash;notably <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/762" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friends the Members for The Wrekin, for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)&mdash;who expressed concerns about the issue of confidentiality and the way in which it is addressed. There is an issue about the relationship between the code and the Freedom of Information Act 2000. We need to ensure that the code reflects the introduction of that Act and operates clearly in line with it. The code of conduct was set out in 2001 in advance of the implementation of the Act. It makes it clear that members must not disclose confidential information, but it does not refer to the Freedom of Information Act 2000 nor does it refer to a public interest defence.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/7">However, the Freedom of Information Act is clear about the importance of public interest and sets out what sort of information must continue to be confidential or exempt and what sort needs to be weighed against a public interest test. We must ensure that the code operates fully in line with the Freedom of Information Act. We clearly do not want to have a situation where, in theory, a councillor can be criticised under the code for releasing information that the Act says should be made public. Clearly, that would be unsatisfactory and unfair, not only for the councillor but for the public.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/8">The Standards Board has already recognised such matters and is concerned about them. Ethical standards officers are expected to consider whether the information was properly confidential, perhaps under the Data Protection Act 1998 or other legislation, or whether it had been designated confidential out of expediency. Ethical standards officers are also trained in the Freedom of Information Act. So, in effect, there is an implicit public interest test on a case-by-case basis. However, in such circumstances it is important that consideration of such issues should be fully transparent and that councillors and the public know exactly where they stand and how questions of confidentiality and of the public interest will be assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".230.4/9">The Standards Board will therefore soon be consulting, as part of its complete review of the code, on whether and how that part of the code should be amended to deal specifically with the relationship between the code and the Freedom of Information Act and the way in which the public interest should be addressed. It will be asking specifically for views on issues such as whistleblowing, including the case for a public interest defence.</p>

	<p pid=".232.0/1">I am encouraged by what my hon. Friend has said. She has given a positive response to the points that have been made. However, how does it leave those who are subject to investigation under the current code, if the code were imminently to be revised because of the anomalies?</p>

	<p pid=".232.1/1">As I said, ethical standards officers are already expected to be trained in the Freedom of Information Act and to consider whether the information is properly confidential.

	<p pid=".233.0/1">On my hon. Friend's specific point, the board's target is to meet 90 per cent. of investigations within six months. I will ask the chief executive and the chair of the Standards Board to contact him about that individual case. Obviously, I do not know the details of it, but he must know what is happening with the case and the reason for the time that it has taken.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/2">It is important that we now review the code. Equally, we should recognise the important work of the Standards Board. It would be a completely retrograde step to try to abolish the board at this time. Given the importance of high standards in public life, the Conservative party is wrong to try to abolish it, especially given the history of the issue and the importance of preventing problems such as those that have occurred in local government&mdash;in Westminster council and elsewhere&mdash;and the importance of ensuring that we have appropriate high standards throughout the country and that they can be maintained. Furthermore, we want confidence to be maintained in those standards. That is the reason for the Standards Board and the code of conduct.</p>

	<p pid=".234.1/2">I am grateful to have the opportunity to initiate this debate on Army restructuring in Wales, a subject that has elicited a large postbag of correspondence from my constituency and, I am sure, those of my colleagues who are present.

I say at the outset that, as a Labour Member, I have no quarrel whatever with him on the bigger picture of the fundamental need to restructure the Army, to make it operationally more effective and responsive to modern needs, so he need not spend much, or indeed, any of his time defending that strategy. I would rather he tried to explain why the naming of the new regiments and the antecedent battalions has created so much of an outcry in Wales, and how it can be justified in operational terms. On the more substantive issues&mdash;before I go on to the more controversial matter of names, with which he will be familiar&mdash;with regard to the new regiment, the Royal Welsh Regiment, does he not accept that, whatever happens, there is a need to retain a regimental base or headquarters in Wrexham in north Wales?</p>

	<p pid=".234.2/1">Anyone who witnessed the regiment marching through Wrexham only last year on returning from its tour of duty in Iraq will be aware of the strength of support in the town for the regiment and its base, and how that will affect the future of the regiment. I have heard again and again from officers in the regiment about the importance of those local ties.</p>

	<p pid=".234.3/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend, and I hope that the Minister will take that on board. I know that decisions on a regimental base have yet to be made but, at this stage, it is worth putting down that marker, as well as stating the need for the new Welsh regiment to have a home in Wales, whether in the south or the north.</p>
	<p pid=".234.3/2">The Secretary of State made an announcement on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase> last year about the new infantry structure, which involves the creation of large, single-cap regiments with two or more battalions. In Wales, the new regimental structure involves the creation of a large single-cap regiment with two battalions, to be known respectively as the 1st Battalion of the Royal Welsh (the Royal Welch Fusiliers) and the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Welsh (the Royal Regiment of Wales).</p>
	<p pid=".234.3/3">In itself, I would suggest&mdash;and this is borne out by discussions that I have had with serving and retired soldiers from the Royal Welch Fusiliers&mdash;that that was an unfortunate decision. The relegation of the antecedent regiment's name to a position in brackets after the name of the new regiment was in itself insensitive and something of a slight to the memory of those historic regiments. As the Minister will know, the Royal Welch Fusiliers goes back 300 years. The same argument applies to the Royal Regiment of Wales and its antecedents.</p>

	<p pid=".235.3/1">I agree entirely. To rebut any suggestion that sensitivities about the name were not ventilated at an early stage, I should say that I know that the colonel of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, one Major-General Brian Plummer, to whom I have spoken in recent days, did in fact express that view and say that the old, famous names of the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Regiment of Wales should be given precedence in the new title, so the suggestion that the issue was never ventilated is erroneous, as I understand it.</p>

	<p pid=".235.5/1">I am not privy to that information, but the divisional colonel-commandant may well have expressed a different view, a collective view representing the interests of not only the Welsh regiments, but others, too.

	<p pid=".235.6/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate, particularly given that it is highly unlikely that the Government will change their mind, although he is absolutely right that they should. I am glad to see the hon. Gentleman's colleagues behind him.</p>
	<p pid=".235.6/2">It seems to me that the executive committee of the Army Board unwisely took the advice of the colonel-commandant of the Prince of Wales Division, instead of listening to the Welsh regiment's colonel, Major-General Brian Plummer. The seven regiments that make up the Prince of Wales Division select a colonel-commandant between them. He was not privy to the Welsh view, or, if he was, perhaps he mistakenly failed to put it across.</p>

I hope that the Minister will take on board the fact that the decision is neither tactical, nor expensive, but is based purely on common sense. It would aid recruiting and give people in Wales and their tremendous regiment, which was formed in 1689, exactly what people in Scotland have.</p>

	<p pid=".236.0/1">On this occasion, the hon. Gentleman is correct. I hope that the Minister notes that there is a large measure of cross-party support on this issue. My point is that even before subsequent developments there was a strong head of steam behind retaining the old names. To add insult to injury, the Scottish regiments&mdash;and one has great respect for their traditions&mdash;were allowed the same concession that I and fellow hon. Members seek for the Welsh regiments.</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/2">Scotland loses a regiment and we are sorry about that, but the names of the antecedent regiments in Scotland are given proper respect and priority in their new titles. For instance, in the case of the Royal Highland Fusiliers the title of the new battalion is the Royal Highland Fusiliers (2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland). These are significant changes, and we are dealing with matters of sentiment and loyalty which are fundamental to the morale of our forces. I am sure that the Minister accepts that.</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/3">If the Minister was not already aware, I can tell him that the situation has gone down very badly, and, rightly or wrongly, the disparity of treatment between Wales and Scotland is perceived as a slight to Wales. I will quote from three letters, which are a sample of a much larger collection of correspondence that I have received on the issue. The first is from Mr. P W Jones, president of the Colwyn Bay Royal Welch Fusiliers Comrades Association. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/4" class="indent">&quot;As a Welshman and former serving soldier, I was dismayed to learn that in the Government's recent re-organisation of infantry regiments, Wales is being treated less equitably than Scotland . . . we are to have our proud name demoted to brackets and be known as 1st Battalion The Royal Welsh (the Royal Welch Fusiliers) . . . So my question is why is Wales being treated less equitably and why are proud names and traditions being cast aside? We have asked for no more than has been granted to the Scottish regiments. This unfair treatment of the regiments and Wales must be put right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/5">Another letter came from Mr. Bryan Lewis from Ruthin, a former national service subaltern in the Royal Welch Fusiliers who made his point quite strongly. Talking about that regiment, he said:</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It is the least that this Government can do to respect the traditions of this fine Regiment of which the Principality is truly proud and in showing some gratitude to those who have served the Regiment and their country with distinction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/7">The final letter, which was distributed to all Welsh Members, came from the right hon. Lord Morris of Aberavon, who served in this place with distinction for many years and is a former Secretary of State for Wales. He put the matter succinctly. He referred to the two old regiments, the Royal Welch Fusiliers and the Royal Regiment of Wales and said:</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Allowing them to place their current names first might, on the face of it, seem to be mere detail in the great scheme of things, especially when there is much that is positive in this reorganisation for our soldiers. But to them, of course, it matters a very great deal as history continues to show, and we fear that, despite general assurances to the contrary, the naming of the regiments in this way will soon strip them of their identity and traditions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/9">I accept what not only Lord Morris, but my constituents have said on the issue, and I ask the Government to reconsider their decision. I understand that negotiations and discussions are continuing with the Army Board and I hope that there will be movement on the issue. I know that a cross-party petition will be presented next week. A great many Labour Members have signed a letter expressing concern about the decision and explaining how strongly people in Wales feel.</p>
	<p pid=".236.0/10">I hope that my right hon. Friend agrees that we have a strong argument and that there should be equity. We are not asking for a lot. The regiments are proud and many people who have served in them lost their lives or suffered great injuries. They are asking for no more than a prefix rather than a suffix. They want their traditions and loyalties to be respected by the Government at a time when their services are, unfortunately, much required.</p>

	<p pid=".237.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1277" name="Gareth Thomas">my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West (Gareth Thomas)</phrase> on securing this debate on Army restructuring in Wales and I appreciate his thoughts and comments on the tragedy in Iraq. In previous debates we have set out the logic underpinning the decision to restructure the infantry, but I recognise that the changes have generated and continue to generate considerable debate. My hon. Friend enumerated some Welsh views, which are mirrored elsewhere in the country, and the attendance at this short Adjournment debate indicates the strength of feeling on the subject.</p>
	<p pid=".237.0/2">My hon. Friend did not question the underlying organisational changes that have resulted in the decision to form the new Welsh regiment, but rather voiced his concern about the formulation of the names of the two battalions that will form the regiment. It is always worth putting on record the rationale behind the overall changes to the Army structure. I recognise that he accepts that rationale, but not everyone does and not everyone acknowledges the quality of the debate. There are those who still argue against the fundamental principle behind the changes.</p>
	<p pid=".237.0/3">Nobody would dispute that the Army must continue to evolve to meet future challenges; to do otherwise would be to jeopardise the fighting effectiveness of our forces. The changes to the infantry are only one aspect of a wider evolution that will enhance the deployability of the whole Army. Once fully implemented, the future Army structure will provide a force better suited to meet the challenges of the 21st century. We are moving towards a more balanced force organised around two armoured brigades, three mechanised brigades, a light and an air assault brigade, and the Royal Marines commando brigade.</p>
	<p pid=".237.0/4">It is important to emphasise that we cannot deploy forces that we are unable to sustain in operations. The Army has therefore been reorganised to be more robust and with enhanced enablers. That requires us to make significant enhancements to the key specialist capabilities, including communications, engineers, logisticians and intelligence experts. At the same time, we want to make fighting units, including the infantry, more robust by ensuring that they have adequate numbers and increased availability for deployment. It is our view in the Ministry of Defence that those enhancements can be achieved only as a result of a reduction by four in the number of infantry battalions, which will release 2,400 posts for redeployment across the force structure. That measure is made possible by the improved security situation in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid=".237.0/5">I will come to the points raised about the name of the regiment in a moment, but there is a misunderstanding about the size of the Army. It will remain broadly the same size as it is today&mdash;between 103,000 and 104,000&mdash;until normalisation in Northern Ireland is complete, when it will settle at 102,000. It is worth noting that the Regular Army is measurably larger than it was in 1997, so we have been recruiting successfully and expanding the strength of the Regular Army as a result of a lot of effort. No area in the country has it easy in terms of recruitment: some are better than others, but when we compare establishment to real strength, we find that some areas are significantly under strength. We have been succeeding against some very difficult odds.</p>
	<p pid=".237.0/6">The most important factor in the changes to the structure of the infantry is the decision to end the infantry arms plot and the associated move to multi-battalion regiments. The arms plot was a process whereby we moved infantry battalions from role to role and place to place every few years. Although the arms plot maintained broad experience and variety, it hampered the availability of infantry battalions. As we have said time and again&mdash;some people are still not prepared to take on board the logic of ending the arms plot&mdash;of the 40 infantry battalions, only 26 or 27 are available for deployment at any time. Seven or eight battalions are unavailable due to the arms plot, which is some 20 per cent. of the total infantry strength. That is simply impractical and inefficient.</p>
	<p pid=".237.0/7">Ending the arms plot will make most of the 36 battalions available for deployment, as opposed to 26 or 27. The logic and benefits of that are undeniable. Ceasing the arms plot will increase our operational capability. I am grateful that my hon. Friend accepts all that.</p>
	<p pid=".237.0/8">In future, battalions will be fixed by role and largely by location. That will release resources routinely tied up in moving location or retraining. The Army will be more capable and effective, because as well as more battalions being available for operations, the new structure will provide continuity of expertise in respect of role and greater brigade stability.</p>

	<p pid=".238.1/1">In a moment. I shall come on to the naming of the regiment, but I thought that it was worth while setting out the background. If the hon. Gentleman is disputing the logic of what I have set out, I am interested to hear his position.</p>

	<p pid=".238.2/1">The Minister has talked about the effectiveness of the Army, and we all accept that arms plotting should come to an end, but I want to press him on one issue.

	<p pid=".239.0/1">I shall certainly listen to my Welsh colleagues. If the hon.

	<p pid=".239.2/1">All the other issues in terms of where people will be based&mdash;super-garrisons and so on&mdash;have to be determined. We are developing a process to get to the best position. Again, that applies to where we base the future regiments within the UK overall. There is sensitivity about that issue, which is important because we want maximum regional impact.</p>
	<p pid=".239.2/2">The end of the arms plot&mdash;I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman recognises that that is desirable; not everyone in his party does&mdash;means that the single-battalion regiments, including the Royal Regiment of Wales and the Royal Welch Fusiliers, need to reorganise themselves to meet the requirements for regiments of two or more battalions. There is a drive to all that.</p>
	<p pid=".239.2/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West referred to the announcement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase>, when he set out the new structure with regard not only to Wales, but to what is happening in Scotland and in every other part of the United Kingdom. Different decisions were taken accordingly.</p>
	<p pid=".239.2/4">We have made it clear throughout that the process of restructuring the infantry has been worked through by the Army. The process has not been manipulated or dictated by Ministers. It is best left to the Army, because the Army has the best understanding in historical and tradition terms and in terms of effectiveness and what it wants to come out of this important restructuring.</p>
	<p pid=".239.2/5">A key element of all that was the consultation with the divisions and regiments concerned. In making the recommendation on naming the Royal Welsh Regiment, the executive committee of the Army Board took into account advice from the colonel commandant of the Prince of Wales's Division, in which the Welsh regiments sit. He is the representative of the regiments concerned. I do not believe that he arrived at this out of the blue&mdash; <i>[Interruption.] </i>Well, hon. Members say that that is the case, but there has to be a process of consultation. Every other division went through that process.</p>
	<p pid=".239.2/6">A lot of heat was generated&mdash;justifiable heat, I have to say, because of the scale of what was going on. I think I am being told here that in Wales one person made a decision, did not speak to anyone and simply passed it on to ECAB. I shall check that out, but I do not think that it will accord with what is happening in the other divisions. ECAB left the matter to the divisions in one sense, but it was not wholly left to them as it had to take into account a number of competing arguments in terms of some advice that was given. ECAB had to assimilate that advice and come to a conclusion.</p>
	<p pid=".239.2/7">The new regiment, we believe, will preserve a distinct Welsh identity within the future infantry and will explicitly identify the two new battalions with their antecedent regiments. Their traditional recruiting areas and links to the local community will also be maintained. We have made clear our commitment to maintain the traditions and ethos of the battalions in the new regiment. That will include further work&mdash;this is not a completed, rounded-off process&mdash;and the regiment and the division will have to consider accoutrements issues, such as the cap badge. It has not yet been determined whether there should be a single cap badge and I would be interested to know whether anyone here has a view on that matter.</p>

	<p pid=".240.1/1">No, I have already given way. My hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West asked about headquarters, basing and local identity. Again, I say that the Army is very sensitive to that matter, as the one thing it does not want to lose is the point of local contact. The preservation of local ties is a matter that it will have to work through carefully to arrive at the best solution. The key is maintaining the links between the regions and the Army units.</p>
	<p pid=".240.1/2">Some famous regimental names are going. The Glosters have an issue, as the regiment is being combined with the Devonshire and Dorset Regiment to become a single-battalion regiment of the Light Infantry. There will be a lot of pain and discomfort in the reorganisation, but to get to the position that I set out at the beginning of my speech we have to take some of the pain to get that big, maximum gain.</p>
	<p pid=".240.1/3">My hon. Friend compared the arrangements for the Welsh and Scottish battalions&mdash;I must say that this has not been an easy process for me in Scotland&mdash;and referred to the Royal Highland Fusiliers, which is not a long-standing regiment in the Army, but an amalgamated regiment, as he may be aware.

	<p pid=".240.3/1">Let me finish this point. That does not mean that the issue is not &quot;out there&quot;; it just has not generated the same issues. That is not a reflection on Scotland's commitment to those regiments that recruit in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid=".240.5/1">Many in Scotland do not take that view. Remember, before the announcement there were six regiments or battalions. There was a possibility that two would go, but to maintain maximum regional impact it was determined that it would be best to reduce from six regiments or battalions to one regiment with five battalions.</p>
	<p pid=".240.5/2">The determination was made that because the regiment would be the single biggest in the British Army in its new form&mdash;going to a single cap badge and a single tartan&mdash;this decision on the name should therefore be taken. Every other division was asked whether it had a comment to make on the issue and there were no adverse remarks. There were no representations on getting the same provision for the Welsh regiment. If that had happened, the decision may have been different.</p>
	<p pid=".240.5/3">We understand the strength of feeling and my hon. Friend is right: I have received a letter on the matter, which is being attended to, and a reply will be issued shortly. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is due to meet a cross-party group next week and the petition might be given to him then. He will also meet interests from elsewhere in the country that want to raise particular issues.</p>
	<p pid=".240.5/4">This is an important issue, but I believe that it is best left to the Army to come the conclusions.</p>

	Housing Proposals (Gloucestershire)

	<p pid=".242.1/1">I think that we are about to be interrupted by another vote, but I shall see what progress I can make. I am grateful to the Minister for turning up to hear what I have to say, and I look forward to hearing her response.</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/2">I intend to discuss the South West regional assembly's proposals for housing in Gloucestershire and, in particular, the consultation document that it has issued, which is entitled, &quot;Shaping the future of Cheltenham and Gloucester to 2026.&quot; The proposals are part of the spatial strategy required by the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. The title page of the document also includes the words,</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Work undertaken on behalf of The South West Regional Assembly&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/4">I understand that some of that work was done by Gloucestershire county council.</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/5">I have a number of problems with the document, and I will list five of them. First, the consultation period on the document is very short. Secondly, the document is very confusing and, in some areas, incomprehensible. Thirdly, it has taken the wrong tack on housing. Fourthly, its proposals seriously compromise the position of the green belt, and fifthly, they certainly endanger the flood plain.</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/6">Powers given to the South West regional assembly and to the Deputy Prime Minister are quite strong. Some might even call them excessive, in terms of house building. In my view, it should be left to local bodies to decide the basis on which houses are built in their area.</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/7">Regional government was rejected by the people of the north-east, yet the Government seem to be introducing it by stealth, by giving increasing power to unelected quangos. The regionalisation of England is consistent with the breaking down of the United Kingdom through devolution, which is convenient if we are to move towards a federal Europe of regions, in which countries do not exist. Perhaps I digress too much, but that is an important argument against regionalisation. The quality, or lack thereof, of the document is also important. It demonstrates the folly of having too many layers of bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/8">The spatial strategies will supersede the local plans and the county structure plan. Already, Tewkesbury borough council's plan has cost &pound;300,000, largely because of costs associated with a Government inspection of the local plan inquiry. There are five other districts in Gloucestershire. I think that I am right in saying that Gloucester itself has not prepared a local plan; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/852" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase> will correct me if I am wrong. A lot of money has been spent on preparing those local plans and the structure plan, all of which will be swept aside by the spatial strategy.</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/9">I shall discuss each of the points that I mentioned. Printed along the bottom of the document in capital letters are the words, &quot;Have your say&quot;, yet the consultation period is just four and a half weeks; it closes on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">Friday 18 February</phrase>. It is already <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase>, and this debate has been held as soon as it could be. The Government guidelines for the consultation period on this type of document suggest 12 weeks. Why, therefore, is this consultation period not 12 weeks? Was the publication of the document delayed? Has that truncated the consultation period and, if so, why was that allowed to happen?</p>
	<p pid=".242.1/10">I described the document as confusing. The proposals and the analysis are in parts incomprehensible.</p>

	<p pid=".243.0/1">I thank my neighbour for giving way. I have sympathy with much of what he has said. Dose he agree that the confusion has arisen at a time when the county council's local plan has not been agreed? He and I both attended a meeting with the Government office for the south-west a little while ago, and there was some contention about the local plan, not least the sustainability of the balance of 16,000 local homes proposed by the county plan, versus 6,000 in Cheltenham, which he knows that I oppose. That is a balance in one area rather than another. This matter arises when we do not know whether that plan has been adopted, so there is no coherence.</p>

	<p pid=".243.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. The confusion is not helpful, and now we get another confusing aspect to the matter with the publication of this document.</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/2">Regional planning guidance note 10 suggests that 2,400 houses per annum are required between 2005 and 2016. The document that we are discussing tests other proposals, including RPG10 plus 25 per cent and RPG10 plus 50 per cent. It says:</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Steering Group's studies have led to the RPG10 Levels of growth + 50% being discounted as a viable option due to transport constraints and the inability of the local economy to sustain this level of growth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/4">But it is not being discounted. The South West regional assembly and the Government could go for that option. The wording is not only misleading, but downright wrong. How can this be a serious consultation document if it says that one option has been discounted when it has not? Where have the plus 25 per cent. and plus 50 per cent. figures come from? Were they just plucked out of the air, or are they based on past trends and, therefore, a reliable extrapolation?</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/5">Furthermore, the document says that 60 per cent. of the houses should be in the principal urban area. That is also not true; that is not the proposal. The 60 per cent. figure is what the county structure plan third alteration panel report 2004 recommended, but that has not been accepted by the South West regional assembly. It has not been decided that 60 per cent. of the houses should be in the principal urban area. Page 5 of the document, headed,</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/6" class="indent">&quot;How Much Development are We Talking About?&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/7">is based on false premises. The highlighted area of the page&mdash;probably the most critical part of the document&mdash;is based on falsely represented assumptions and arbitrary figures.</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/8" class="italic">Sitting suspended for a Division in the House.</p>
	<p pid=".243.1/9" class="italic">On resuming:&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.243.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1192" speakername="Laurence Robertson" colnum="243"  time="17:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h05.htm#50201h05_spnew3">
	<p pid=".243.2/1">I was referring to the document on housing in Cheltenham and Gloucester as being very confusing, and I went through some of the detailed reasons for that. I also mentioned the misleading quote in the document, and was about to say that the highlighted bit on page 5 is probably the most important part, but is based on a completely false premise. Falsely represented assumptions, arbitrary figures, approximations, guesswork and a very misleading quote all appear in a very small part of the document.</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/2">My next concern is that the regional assembly and the other people who worked on the document are taking the wrong tack on housing altogether. I do not intend to be party political, but in opposition the Labour party said that it would end the predict-and-provide approach to planning. I welcomed that, but in the document we have proposals being made on the basis of birth and death rates, migration, household size, divorce rates and economic trends. Page 13 states:</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/3" class="indent">&quot;If this continues the population of Gloucestershire in 2026 is likely to be in the order of 668,000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/4">If that is not a prediction, I do not know what is, and if this document is not about providing in order to satisfy that prediction, I do not know what is. Unfortunately, the principle of predict and provide is still going strong. When will the Government fulfil their 1997 commitment to end that approach to housing?</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/5">I turn to the green belt. In Question Time on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January</phrase>, in answer to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/743" name="Tim Boswell">my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase>, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/6" class="indent">&quot;For those families who are struggling to get on the housing ladder, it is important that we increase the supply of housing in a planned and orderly way that does not affect the green belt.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January 2005</phrase>; Vol. 429, c. 810.]</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/7">In this document, four options for that increased housing are put forward. Option 1 would be in a &quot;Green Belt, greenfield area&quot;. Option 2 would also be in a &quot;Green Belt, greenfield area&quot;. Option 3 says that it will have a</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Major impact on critical area of Green Belt. This development would encroach on the area that is most important for maintaining the separation of Cheltenham and Gloucester.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/9">Option 4 also says that it would include the green belt. Therefore, all four options include major building&mdash;if not the entirety of the building&mdash;on the green belt. How does the Prime Minister square his words in the Chamber less than two weeks ago about protecting the green belt with the document that the Deputy Prime Minister will consider that proposes major incursions into the green belt?</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/10">I turn now to the flood plain. Two rivers, the Severn and the Avon, converge at Tewkesbury and continue down the Severn vale as the River Severn, causing flooding all the way down at certain times of the year. It will make matters considerably worse to build on or near the flood plain. Last year the Government's inspector, Mary Travers, suggested building 580 houses both on and near the flood plain between Longford and Innsworth. That was bad enough, but this document goes much further. Its proposals would involve a massive building programme either on or very near the flood plain. That could have serious implications, and it is wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".243.2/11">This is a poor document. It is badly written, its assumptions are general and arbitrary, and it proposes a development the size of Gloucester&mdash;which is a considerable size&mdash;to be built largely if not entirely in my constituency, on the green belt, and close to, if not on, the flood plain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.245.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" speakername="David Drew" colnum="245"  time="17:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h05.htm#50201h05_spnew4">
	<p pid=".245.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that one of the basic fallacies in this document and the one that comes from the third review of the structure plan is the failure to address the need for some building in rural areas? We do not want to swamp rural areas, but our villages are in desperate need of some housing, and that is left out of all these documents.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-01.245.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1192" speakername="Laurence Robertson" colnum="245"  time="17:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050201/halltext/50201h05.htm#50201h05_spnew5">
	<p pid=".245.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. I do not want to name areas, but there are places where villages are dying. They could do with a little extra building, and a little extra infrastructure, too. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that that need is not mentioned in this document. People trot out the mantra, &quot;The houses have to go somewhere,&quot; but certain areas of the south-west are not developed properly; for example, Cornwall and Devon are not economically developed. All we will end up with is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If we build more and more houses in my constituency, the prices will fall, and people will fill up the houses and then turn around and say, &quot;Well, there we are; we needed the houses.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".245.1/2">I am digressing slightly, but I am concerned about this document. The consultation period ends on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">18 February</phrase>. That is bad enough, but I defy most people to understand what it is going on about, the figures that are being bandied about, where they have come from, what this means, what period of time we are talking about, and what is the total number of houses we are talking about. It is incomprehensible. Asking people to respond in such a short time and asking them to understand this nonsense of a document is asking far too much. We are talking about a serious matter, which, given all the problems that go with building houses, could completely change not only my constituency, but the surrounding areas.</p>
	<p pid=".245.1/3">I would be grateful if the Minister could address the points that I have raised about the document and let me know whether there is anything that she can do, not to wreck the whole process&mdash;I accept that there has to be a process&mdash;but to ensure that it is carried out fairly, professionally and competently, because at the moment that is not being done.</p>

	<p pid=".245.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1192" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know that he feels strongly about the issue and that he has asked a series of written questions about it to which my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning has responded.</p>
	<p pid=".245.2/2">I want to set out where we are in the process in relation to Gloucestershire and the current debate on developing a new regional spatial strategy. The Government are committed to creating sustainable communities, to delivering the homes that communities need and to ensuring that we have a planning system that will put in place the long-term strategies for delivering the homes and jobs in a sustainable way. As part of that we must ensure that communities are fully involved in developing those strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".245.2/3">The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004, which came into effect last September, implemented a series of important reforms to the planning system. A key feature of the new system is the development of regional spatial strategies. Their aim is to ensure much greater co-ordination of all the work that is essential to deliver homes, jobs, infrastructure, services and facilities. Regional spatial strategies will need to be developed by the regional planning bodies. The reason for doing that is to recognise that many planning issues, including housing markets, go beyond local administrative boundaries. They therefore need to be considered at the regional level and at a more strategic level.</p>
	<p pid=".245.2/4">Regional planning bodies are required by the new planning Act to have at least 60 per cent. of their membership from local authorities with planning expertise. At least 30 per cent. of their membership comes from community interests, such as business, voluntary and environmental groups, to ensure that a wide range of views are brought to the planning process. Ultimately, the Secretary of State must also approve the regional spatial strategy, so that there is further democratic accountability at national level.</p>
	<p pid=".245.2/5">Regional spatial strategies are not aimed to be one-size-fits-all documents. They need to address particular issues that will come up in their own regions. They also need to seek advice and consider sub-regional issues, which might be more localised than the regional level, and discuss them with county and unitary authorities, which have strategic planning expertise. They also need to work in partnership with planning authorities and others to carry out joint studies, monitoring and other work that is essential to their work.</p>
	<p pid=".245.2/6">That is the way that work has progressed on the regional strategy for the south-west. Well before the new Act was in place, the South West regional assembly took the initiative in developing partnership arrangements with the local county councils and the unitary authorities. Joint studies have been agreed for eight sub-regions, based largely on the region's largest urban areas, including Cheltenham and Gloucester. They have been under way for some months and are expected to report in March. Their purpose is to feed into the more detailed consideration that needs to take place later on and into the development of the regional spatial strategies.</p>
	<p pid=".245.2/7">The partnerships have been asked to undertake technical work, not to set out proposals for housing or any other type of development. They have been asked to consider a series of alternative future scenarios and take into account issues around demographics, housing and economic studies, green belt and environmental designations, transport and a range of other considerations.</p>
	<p pid=".245.2/8">To ensure consistency and comparability between the eight studies in different parts of the south-west, all the partnerships were asked to consider the possible implications of three hypothetical levels of growth: a continuation of existing levels as set out in the current regional planning guidance for the south-west; an increase of 25 per cent. in those levels; and an increase of 50 per cent. in those levels. It is important to stress that those are not development proposals, but different hypothetical scenarios to complete the studies and test the work that was being done. Importantly, the partnerships were also asked to consult local people and stakeholders on that work.</p>

	<p pid=".247.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the issues very clearly.

	<p pid=".247.1/1">I want to come on to the document to which the hon. Gentleman refers. It is entitled &quot;Shaping the Future of Cheltenham and Gloucester to 2026&quot;, and is published by a steering group for the Cheltenham and Gloucester sub-region. That group is led by Gloucestershire county council and includes all that county's district councils, the Campaign to Protect Rural England, the community and voluntary services, the Gloucestershire strategic partnership and Gloucester First, which represents businesses. The group is independently chaired. The document contains technical work as well. The consultation paper sets out the steering group's thoughts on what might be the spatial implications of different levels of growth, and asks for people's views.</p>

	<p pid=".247.2/1">I hear what the Minister says. She makes excellent points, particularly about the fact that housing proposals are not made in this strategy. However, at a meeting last week, one of the developers highlighted something to me which implied that a specific scheme called Hunts Grove&mdash;of which the Minister will not be aware&mdash;in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, is in that strategy as a given.</p>
	<p pid=".247.2/2">Bearing it in mind that there is controversy in Gloucester and Gloucestershire on whether that scheme should be included&mdash;not least because there is a competing scheme that would give money towards a &pound;7 million bypass through my constituency&mdash;will the Minister urge people to take a closer look and ensure that there are not givens such as that scheme?

	<p pid=".247.3/1">Obviously, as my hon. Friend points out, I do not know the case that he mentions, nor its status in the current planning system.</p>
	<p pid=".247.3/2">I reiterate that the document sets out the preliminary work required to develop a regional spatial strategy. This is not a regional spatial strategy, nor is it a local development framework. It is not a planning document, but part of the process through which the local area is going to establish the regional spatial strategy. There is an opportunity for consultation on this document right now, and there will be further opportunities for consultation when specific proposals are put forward at a later stage. It is important to reiterate that.</p>
	<p pid=".247.3/3">As I have said, the consultation document makes clear the purpose for which it has been prepared and the fact that it does not set out housing proposals by the South West regional assembly. It is right that the community is asked for its views on these important issues at an early stage so that those views can be taken into account as the regional spatial strategy develops. That is what is happening in Gloucestershire and elsewhere in the south-west, with joint study area partnerships for Swindon, the west of England, Taunton and south-east Dorset. They, too, have already issued consultation reports. I understand that other partnerships will also be consulting shortly.</p>
	<p pid=".247.3/4">It is consistent with the reform of the planning system that the public are given the earliest possible opportunity to consider issues that can be complex and contentious, and, indeed, matters for strong local disagreement. There will of course be full consultation on the draft regional spatial strategy itself. That is where any firm proposals for housing growth will be made, and that will be the opportunity for full public discussion and consideration. The regional spatial strategy will be submitted to the Secretary of State in December, after full consultation. There will also, however, be a subsequent examination in public by an independent panel during 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".247.3/5">There are a series of opportunities for hon. Members' constituents to engage with the process. I recognise that these are issues which constituents want to debate in full. It is important to have as many opportunities as possible at every stage in the process, and not simply at its very end, when definitive proposals have been put forward.</p>

	<p pid=".248.0/1">I accept that there are different stages to the process, but I would suggest it is off to a bad start in this particular case. The Minister says there will be further consultation in 2006. Without wishing to be pedantic, I have to say that that really proves the point I was trying to make about the document. It says &quot;if necessary&quot; there will be further consultation, which seems slightly different from what the Minister is saying. So will there be more consultation, or not? Is it intended that there will be, rather than that it will occur &quot;if necessary&quot;?</p>

	<p pid=".248.1/1">Let me clarify that point, although I am obviously unsure of the exact wording on the page that the hon. Gentleman is talking about. A draft regional spatial strategy will be drawn up. There will be full consultation on that draft. It will then be submitted to the Secretary of State in December, and there will also be a subsequent examination in public by an independent panel during 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".248.1/2">I think we need to recognise the context here. We need to have wide public debate about the future of communities and the need to ensure that the planning system delivers the homes and jobs required. In the south-west, including the hon. Gentleman's constituency, the availability of enough affordable housing is a major problem. The current average house price in Gloucestershire is &pound;191,000&mdash;higher than the average for the south-west as a whole. Between 2001 and 2026 the number of households in Gloucestershire is expected to increase by 22 per cent. We cannot ignore or wish away those figures. If we want to ensure that existing and new households in Gloucestershire, and elsewhere, have the opportunity to live in an affordable home, we must ensure that these issues are debated within the planning system, and that the planning system can deliver homes for the whole community, in the right places and at the right time.</p>
	<p pid=".248.1/3">The Government are committed to creating sustainable communities and to ensuring that community members have a full opportunity to debate these issues through the development of the regional spatial strategies. That involves a series of different consultations and discussions, in order to ensure that everybody has the full opportunity to debate the future of our towns and cities before final decisions are made. That is happening in Gloucestershire and elsewhere in the region. We need to see that good work continue, and we look forward to seeing it brought together into a regional spatial strategy to help us to deliver the homes, the jobs and the services that our communities need.</p>
