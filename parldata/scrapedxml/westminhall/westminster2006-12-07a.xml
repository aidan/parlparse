	<p pid="a.153.2/1">I am delighted to open the debate and I am gratefulthat the relevant authorities agreed that both Select Committee reports can be debated at the same time. Not only does that make better use of the Minister's time, but it makes a great deal of sense because they examine essentially the same issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2">On the way in which we discuss terrorism legislation and the lessons that can be drawn from the debate on 90-day pre-charge detention, an early conclusion of the Select Committee on Home Affairs was that</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3" class="indent">&quot;in our view the primary origin of the difficulties experienced by the Government lies in the lack of care with which the case for a maximum 90 day detention period was promoted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4">I make that point at the outset because, this afternoon, we need to look for ways to ensure that when we consider terrorism legislation in future, we learn some of the lessons from the difficult period that the House of Commons and Parliament as a whole went through last year when we dealt with a vital piece of legislation. I make that point not to get at or to over-criticise the Government, but to say that we need to move on and ask how we can do things better.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/5">We have in front of us two reports on similar issues, but with different approaches. To some extent, they reached different conclusions, and careful reading shows that the two Committees asked slightly different questions. I have no doubt that if last year's debate on pre-charge detention had taken place after the inquiries by the two Committees the debate would have been better and the House would have reached a consensus much more easily on the appropriate detention period.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.3/1">One thing that was unsatisfactory about the process was that when the Committee was able to look in great detail at a substantial numberof cases in private evidence, the case for going beyond 14 days was compelling. There was not a compelling case for going to 90 days, but a very good case could be made for 28 days. With due respect, when most hon. Members voted for 28 days, they could not have done so on the basis of the evidence because the evidence was not in front of the House. Whatever the reason for the way in which Members voted&mdash;I was one of those who voted for 90 days, partly from having been involved in such matters as a Home Office Minister&mdash;none of us could base our votes on a considered examination of the evidence. One could argue that in some ways the police case was stronger for an extension of detention powers than came across at the time, although they could not, in our view, make the case for 90 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/2">We put it to Assistant Commissioner Hayman that the police were certain of the need for the maximum period to go beyond 14 days, but that the</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/3" class="indent">&quot;question of whether the maximum period should be 90 days&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/4">was&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/5" class="indent">&quot;much more...an instinctive judgment of what&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/6">felt about right. Mr. Hayman agreed. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/7" class="indent">&quot;That is absolutely fair. I know that sounds pretty flaky. I expect members are sitting here thinking, 'Crikey, there should be more basis for that', but that was the question that was asked.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/8">To be fair, he went on to say that it was a difficult judgment and that the police gave a professional judgment. I do not disrespect him for that, but yes, I thought it was rather flaky to base the case for suchan enormous extension of detention pre-charge ona maximum period without more evidence. We concluded that the extension to 28 days was convincing; we did not find the arguments for 90 days compelling at all. Ministers said that on the same limited evidence&mdash;those few bits of paper&mdash;they had found the case compelling. We found that surprising.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/9">There was no division in the Committee on the central proposition&mdash;that the nature of the threat has changed. Some witnesses said that it is not very different from the threat that we faced from the IRA. We felt, however, that the centrality of mass murder as the aim of terrorist actions, the willingness to use suicide bombings and the international links, put the threat on a different order of magnitude. That is to take nothing away from the horrific actions of the IRA and others and their willingness to take human life as part of their activities, but the centrality of mass murder as the prime political tactic of current terrorism puts it in a different category.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/10">The Committee therefore tried to understand the nature of the policing involved in trying to tackle that terrorism. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> will speak for himself, but there was a slight distinction between our Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which considered the legal framework in which things took place. We, onthe other hand, spent considerable time trying to understand the day-to-day practical realities of policing the threat. One of our early conclusions was that the police now inevitably move to arrest much earlier in an investigation than they would with any other type of crime. We caused a stir by suggesting that there was a preventive element to those arrests. The report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights used different language. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/11" class="indent">&quot;Nowadays we are told arrests are usually intelligence-driven: suspects are arrested first, then the case against them can begin to be built.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/12">That is inevitable. One reason why there is a case for an extended period of pre-charge detention is precisely because the fear of allowing a bombing or similar event to happen requires people to act more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/13">One of our conclusions was that there should be judicial oversight of the decision to arrest early in terrorism cases. The Forest Gate raid was in part&mdash;we read in the papers, at least&mdash;prompted by the danger that authorities in other countries would trigger action that would undermine the investigation. Had there been judicial oversight of the case, however, there is no doubt that the police would have been protected from some of the subsequent criticism, which said that they moved too early and in too precipitate a way. If it had been a bank robbery conspiracy, there is no way that the police would have intervened as early as they did in their investigation, because they would have taken a different judgment of the risk involved in allowing the conspiracy to develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.3/14">Another of our early conclusions was that we should consider judicial oversight of the initial decision to undertake major arrests under the Terrorism Act 2006.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-07a.158.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" speakername="John Denham" colnum="158"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/halltext/61207h0001.htm#06120756000285">
	<p pid="a.158.1/1">The difference is a matter of degree or judgment. Despite the appalling atrocities committed during the conflict in Northern Ireland, we were not&mdash;at least not most of the time&mdash;facing an enemy for whom maximum death among the civilian population was the primary objective of every action that they took. There was a casualness and an arbitrariness about the willingness of the IRA to take life and not to apologise for it, but the scale of the threat does not turn something white into something black; it shifts the boundaries of the judgments that have to be made. We ask an enormous amount of the police in making the judgment about whether we will secure enough information and evidence on which we can base a satisfactory conviction, and about whether we are making the right intervention to protect the public from the risk. Bringing other elements into that discussion would be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/2">In private session, in conversations with operational officers at Paddington Green police station and in public session, our Committee was able to consider several recent cases. Some have subsequently gone to court, but others have not yet done so, and I shall not go into them in detail. We went through the elements of the police case and found some things that they had prayed in aid&mdash;the difficulties in obtaining translation, the time for prayer, and multiple representation of the same clients by the same firm of solicitors&mdash;not proven at all. They may have been issues and difficulties for investigations, but they did not provide a sound basis for a longer detention period.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/3">Other elements&mdash;the need to arrest early, the international nature of investigations, the problems involved with computer encryption and difficulties of forensic capacity when there are many different suspects and activities&mdash;persuaded us, on the basisnot of theory but of actual cases that had been investigated, that there was a convincing case for going up to 28 days. However, we did not reach the conclusion at that stage that the case had been made for going further. We said that</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the growing number of cases and the increase in suspects monitored by the police and security services make it entirely possible, and perhaps increasingly likely, that there will be cases that do provide that justification. We believe, therefore, that the 28 day limit may well prove inadequate in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/5">I can say, without giving away any confidences, that the head of MI5's recent ballpark figures on the number of conspiracies and of people involved in them is of quite a different order of magnitude from the numbers that were kicking around even at the time of our inquiry earlier this year. Things are getting more difficult and more challenging.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/6">That leads me to two conclusions. The first is that if our assessment had been done this time last year, the House could have settled on 28 days without much division and with half the pain. The second is that we need a mechanism for keeping the matter under review, partly because of its history. It is unlikely to be satisfactory if we simply wait for the Government and police to return and say, &quot;Well, we had another look at it, and now we want 45 days, or 60 days.&quot; It will take some time to undo the damage caused to the process's credibility by the way in which the argument was first made. Even if it had been advanced in a much more satisfactory and well-argued way, it might have carried the House, but not the public. That is why we suggested&mdash;although there could be other ways to do it&mdash;that the Government use an independent committee of Privy Councillors to review the evidence. The Newton committee showed how effective that can be. The noble Lord Carlile clearly plays a vital role for all of us in analysing the issues independently. Something along those lines would be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/7">We considered alternatives that would allow us not to need extended detention: using intercept evidence, lowering the charge threshold, using post-charge questioning, allowing inferences from witness silence and so on. Our Committee agreed that they would all be useful. Having considered a significant number of cases, though, we came to the conclusion that they would not resolve the problem. Even if we used intercept evidence, problems with the nature of the information and associated problems with disclosure would mean that in some cases it could not be used, even though it might be enormously important as a basis for the police investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/8">That knocks on to the limited effect that lowering the threshold is likely to have. Post-charge questioning is difficult. The vast majority of serious terrorist suspects never say a word from beginning to end. They are not going to say more after a charge. We were convinced that some way down the line, people on the fringes of a conspiracy might see it as in their interests to spill what beans they have, but it would not allow much to be done about the prime suspects. As most judges have a history as criminal lawyers and most criminal lawyers advise their clients not to say anything that they do not want to say, the reality is that judges are not likely to invite juries to draw too many inferences from the silence of a defendant, whatever the House says. That is what we have found.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/9">Our view is that lots of procedural changes should be introduced&mdash;I shall not discuss them in detail&mdash;but the point of principle is that they would not reallysolve the problem. There would always be terrorist conspiracies that would not be prosecutable despite the changes, and the issue of detention would therefore continue to arise. Hopefully, the number of cases would be smaller, and clearly everybody will agree that the more people we can prosecute the better, but the changes would not solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/10">I am sorry for having spoken for so long, as other hon. Members are here, but I took all the interventions that arose. I hope that the Minister will give us an indication of the Government's current thinking on their plans for legislation this year. Perhaps he will also assure us that some lessons have been learned from the problems of last year's Bill and that an extensive consultation period and the opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny will be available to the House. If we can reach decisions after a lot of debate but without too much division, so much the better.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.1/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's comment, because that was the view that we, too, were led to believe. I hope that that position has not changed and that my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm both that the rumours that have been flying around are not true and that the Government will allow proper scrutiny of all aspects of counter-terrorism legislation as a piece. I hope, too, that they will debate with us ideas that our Select Committees and other parties put forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/2">My Committee intends to scrutinise any legislation or draft legislation for its human rights implications, even if formal pre-legislative scrutiny is undertaken by another Committee, including under the new Public Bill Committee procedure. We are concerned to ensure that even if the new legislation goes through under the Public Bill Committee procedure, that does not exclude either the Home Affairs Committee or my Committee from doing the proper job that we are appointed by Parliament to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/3">Apart from time, the other main factor affecting our scrutiny of Government proposals is the adequacy of the evidence and information that are provided. One of the judgments that we on the Joint Committee on Human Rights are continually called on to make is whether proposed measures are proportionate to their objectives. In other words, when considering counter-terrorism proposals, we have to judge whether the inevitable interferences with individuals' rights and the impact on human rights law and standards go only so far as is necessary to meet the specified purposes set out in the European convention, such as the interests of national security. We also need to consider whether proposed measures meet the conditions set out in the convention, such as those under which persons may be lawfully detained, under article 5. In the absence of more detailed information on the precise nature and level of the threat from terrorism or on the threat posed by individuals, such as those subject to control orders, that is an exceedingly difficult judgment for us to make, so as to inform Parliament about the human rights compatibility of proposed legislation and policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.1/4">We recognize the important work that has been carried out by Lord Carlile, who is the independent reviewer, and by the Intelligence and Security Committee. However, we consider that neitherprovides the degree of parliamentary involvement that is necessary to provide the basis for informed debate and decisions by Parliament on counter-terrorism legislation and policy. In our report, we called for more direct parliamentary accountability. We said that the concept of an arms-length monitoring body, charged with oversight of the security and intelligence agencies, independent of the Government and those agencies, and reporting directly to Parliament, was worthyof consideration. The Government rejected that recommendation. They also rejected the Home Affairs Committee suggestion, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen repeated, that an independent committee could be established to review the maximum detention period annually. I would urge the Minister to reflect further on those points.</p>

Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> certainly has more extensive and recent military experience than I. We listened with great interest to what he said about his experience in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/2">I am glad that we have the opportunity today to discuss the two reports. I am a member of the Home Affairs Committee, and I enjoyed&mdash;if that is the right word&mdash;our inquiry. At the end of the day, I could not go along with the report; I voted against, for reasons that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> knows about. However, I hope that he, other members of the Committee of all political persuasions and I came to certain common conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/3">There is a difference between the IRA murders and the terrorist threat that we now face. The IRA murdered indiscriminately; for example, 21 people were murdered in Birmingham, quite near my constituency, in November 1974. The IRA certainly did not take steps to minimise the murders. There was alsothe Guildford bombing, and the bombing on Remembrance day 1987 in Northern Ireland, where most of the atrocities were committed. Of course, there were also loyalist murder gangs who murdered ordinary civilian Catholics who were in no way involved in paramilitary activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/4">I suppose that the present-day mass murderers are different to this degree: they bring religion into it. They believe that they are carrying out the will of the god in whom they believe and that they will go to paradise. I doubt whether the IRA murderers took the view that they would go immediately to heaven, but the present-day terrorists believe that they will, and that they will wake up with 72 virgins or otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/5">Sometimes it is said that those of us opposed to any further extension of detention time place far too much emphasis on civil liberties at the expense of protecting this country against terror. That accusation is common. It is not necessarily made by the Government, but the argument has gone&mdash;even more so since 7/7&mdash;that we are so interested in civil liberties that we do not understand the acute terrorist threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/6">I do not believe that that accusation is right in any way. The hon. Member for Newark said that he was satisfied with seven days, and could accept 14 days and just about swallow 28 days. It is interesting to note that in the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the debates on the increase in the period of detention without charge from seven to 14 days occurred without any Divisions. Of course, there were reservations; only a very odd House of Commons and House of Lords would be willing to increase that period without expressing concern and reservation, bearing in mind this country's long tradition that people should not be held for such a long period without being charged or released. The 14 days was agreed to in the House of Commons on 20<sup>( )</sup>May 2003, without any Division; in the Lords, it was agreed to in October of that year&mdash;again, without a Division.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/7">I have tried to recollect my views at the time. I am almost certain that I did not participate in the debate because in 2003&mdash;before 7/7, of course&mdash;I was persuaded that since there could be an acute terrorist attack, it would be reasonable to increase the period from seven to 14 days. I always went along with the view that some atrocity would happen, and I continue to take that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/8">My concern arose when it was proposed that the period should be 90 days. It is interesting that the28 days amendment was accepted, again, without a vote. The hon. Member for Newark said that he swallowed it with some difficulty&mdash;so be it&mdash;but there was no vote. The Conservative Opposition did not vote against 28 days; neither did the Liberal Democrats. Of course, just as when we moved from 7 to 14 days, there were concerns and reservations. We would all like to reduce the period when it is appropriate to do so, but, given the circumstances at the time and the terrorist threat faced by this country, it was agreed to increase it.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/9">There is a reference in paragraph 144 on page 45 of the Home Affairs Committee report to what I would describe as a foolish and rather misguided move by Government ultra-loyalists in the House of Lords to extend the period to 60 days. As stated in the report, it was defeated by 210 to 108 votes. I understand that the Government decided that they would not involve themselves one way or the other but would leave it to the Lords to decide. It would have been much better if the Government had told the ultra-loyalists that it was a foolish step to take and had tried to persuade them&mdash;perhaps they would not have succeeded&mdash;not to do what they did.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/10">The extension to 14 days did not come into force until <phrase class="date" code="2004-01-20">20 January 2004</phrase>, and much was made of that in the debate on 90 days on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-09">9 November</phrase> last year, as hon. Members may recall. The extension to 28 days came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July</phrase>. There is an interesting point that the Minister may wish to explain. If there was such urgency, if it was essential that 90 days should be brought into force, why was there such a delay before the Act came into force? There seems to have been, shall we say, a certain lack of urgency, despite what the Government said in the debate last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/11">I tried to find out how many of those who were detained and then released were later charged with terrorist offences. I tabled two parliamentary questions and on each occasion was told that it was not possible to answer on grounds of cost. It is an impertinence to the House of Commons that we should be denied an answer on an issue as important as how many people are detained, released and then charged&mdash;or not charged, as the case may be&mdash;with terrorist offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/12">I am glad that my hon. Friend the Minister has given me a note assuring me that the Home Office is looking into the matter. I hope that he will not mind my mentioning this, as in some respects it was a private conversation. I asked him whether we could have the information for this debate, but he said, &quot;No, it has taken too much time.&quot; Taken too much time? How many people have been held and then released? I know that the House of Commons computers are not always what they should be, but I should not have thought that obtaining the information would be so difficult. Perhaps the Minister will explain the problems when he replies.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/13">Bearing in mind that 28 days has been in operation for some five months only, I hope there will not be a move by the Government to reintroduce 90 days. There is a rumour going around&mdash;in fact, more than one rumour&mdash;that they will, but it would be wrong to do that. It would certainly divide the House again, but, for all I know, the proposal may be carried. Some of those who voted for 28 days as opposed to 90 days&mdash;but perhaps not my hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;may change their mind. I have not carried out a survey among colleagues who voted for 28 days as opposed to 90 days, but neither have I found many who have changed their mind. Indeed, I have yet to find anyone who has.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/14">It is clear that any proposal for 90 days or, indeed, for 45 or 60 days&mdash;there are other rumours&mdash;would cause the same difficulties for the Government. There will be the same bitterness and controversy in Labour's ranks. I should have thought that we could avoid that.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/15">If there were compelling, clear, hard evidence that an extension is necessary, I believe that the House of Commons would agree to one. But since the 90 days debate&mdash;in the past few weeks&mdash;the Attorney-General has said that he has not seen any evidence that persuades him to support an extension. Imagine the Government reintroducing the proposal. Even if the Attorney-General were to change his mind by that time, it is obvious that Labour critics such as myself and Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members would endlessly quote what he had said. The most senior Law Officer in the land has said that he has seen no evidence to justify an extension beyond 28 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/16">My advice to the Government&mdash;they may not want any advice from me; so be it&mdash;is to accept the fact that Parliament agreed to double the detention period from 14 to 28 days. To repeat myself, it has been in operation for only five months, the most senior Law Officer has stated that he has seen no evidence to justify an extension, and both Select Committee reports had reservations and so on but came to the same conclusion. In such circumstances, I hope that the Government will let the matter rest for the time being.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for that helpful clarification.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/2">I turn now to the general subject of detention. The level of threat that we are informed we are facing is so great that I am sure no politician of any persuasion in the House of Commons would simply say that there can be no change to and no infringement of civil liberties, rights or freedoms. I have not found it helpful that we have stood accused of being soft on terrorism because we have raised concerns, put arguments and questioned the draconian request for such a great extension. The shift has to be demonstrated to be vital to the safety of the state and its citizens, because detention without charge strikes at the heart of British justice. That is why the Government were defeated on the last outing we had on the matter of 90 days. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase> said, we did shift to a doubling of the time for which someone could be held and that was quite an extension on skimpy evidence&mdash;more of a compromise than an evidence-based shift.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/3">I hope that the Government were bitten by that experience and that if they come back again, they will do so based on sound evidence. The police did not help the Government with their argument, although I hear today that there was more evidence than we were privy to. The quality of the evidence presented in the House and the example of the ricin terrorist skipping the country considerably damaged the case for those of us who were trying to make an honest judgment about the evidence before us. The aeroplane plot, which the police and intelligence service foiled brilliantly last summer, did not point to their conclusion either. It strained resources and went to the wire in terms of the 28-day limit&mdash;the police say that they were up against it and able to bring charges on the 27th day at the 11th hour. To me, that is a resource issue and not entirely to do with curtailing freedoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.0/4">The problem for the Liberal Democrats has always been that civil liberties seem to go as the first rather than the last resort. One problem is that when we are trying to work together and to trust the Government, the argument that is made for accommodating an extension against our usual liberties is that it will be used only in extreme circumstances and that great care will be taken, with great supervision. Then, to use a well-worn example, we see the farcical absurdity of an old man being held under anti-terrorist legislation for shouting a heckle at a Labour conference.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-12-07a.176.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="176"  time="015:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm061207/halltext/61207h0004.htm#06120756000307">
	<p pid="a.176.2/1">I see the Minister shaking his head, but that probably was an accidental and not very brilliant example. My next example puts in a nutshell some of the difficulties that we face as Members of Parliament in representing our constituents. Into my surgery came Mouloud Sihali. He was tried and acquitted in relation to the Wood Green ricin plot, but it is clear that the authorities still suspect him.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">As I have mentioned, the ricin plot was used as justification for extending the period for which people can be detained without trial. It is true that one person skipped to Algeria, but he was actually released after only two days, so even under the law as it stood the police could have kept him in detention for much longer if they had wanted to and he could have been charged with acts preparatory to terrorism. I keep returning to this point: if he was a major terrorist whose existence would justify detention without trial for 90 days, why did the police let him go after two?</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">Mr. Sihali came to see me because he is under a virtual control order, without being under a control order per se. Despite being cleared and acquitted of the ricin plot and freed&mdash;he was allowed to go completely free&mdash;for five months, he is now tagged, under curfew, not allowed to have a mobile phone, to use the internet or to have visitors to his room, and he has to report each day to the police. My concern is that he was completely free for five months. If the authorities are convinced he is a terrorist, why was he allowed to wander round completely free for five months? Did they change their mind back and forth as to whether he was a terrorist, and if they have changed their mind, how good was the basic evidence?</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">Mr. Sihali is facing deportation as a threat to national security, but the evidence will be judged in secret and will never be seen by either a normal court or Mr. Sihali. He has been convicted of a passport offence and was in this country illegally, so I do not have a problem&mdash;nor does he&mdash;with deportation on those grounds. However, he is facing deportation on the grounds of being a threat to national security and if he is deported on those grounds, for the rest of his days he will have the stigma of having been thought to be a terrorist. That is an awful burden to carry, unless he really is a terrorist. The point is he will not have the chance to argue his innocence and he argues that he should be given a chance to clear his name.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/5">I had sitting in front of me in my surgery the whole problem in a nutshell. It was about the issue and legality of some of the powers under the Terrorism Act 2000&mdash;about control orders and secret evidence, the terrorist threat and civil liberties. If we get it wrong either way we face huge consequences&mdash;either letting a terrorist go free or tarring an innocent man for life. He is one of my constituents, but would I be fighting to help an innocent man or aiding a terrorist? I have no idea without knowing what the secret evidence is. The only route that I can follow is to get a meeting with the Home Secretary, which I am trying desperately to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/6">For me, that sums up how the legislation comes down to the coal face of reality when we try to deal with such issues. I would prefer it if the reports made some suggestion that might allow a charge to be made on other grounds, by using the lower threshold, post-charge questioning or intercept evidence&mdash;anything that would enable steps to be taken towards bringing a charge or prosecution&mdash;rather than this no-man's land where I, Mr. Sihali and a great number of people have no idea where the truth lies.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/7">As the report by the Home Affairs Committee indicated, the nature of the terrorist threat might well have changed beyond all recognition compared tothe threat posed by terrorism connected with Irish republicanism. However, although the nature of terrorism might be changing it is absolutely essential that the rules and framework of international law within which it must be tackled do not change. The close scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Human Rights of the Government's counter-terrorism legislation has sent a clear message: national laws might change in the wake of an attack to the extent required by human rights law, but the applicable human rights rules should not.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/8">I found it interesting that the Joint Committee on Human Rights used France and Spain as examples where prosecutions are public and where open trials go on according to criminal procedures. By contrast, in the UK there appeared to be a fear among the police and security services that criminal prosecution using intercept evidence would inevitably lead to sensitive sources being revealed in open court, which leaves the need to resort to the use of administrative detention, control orders and memorandums of understanding with foreign countries instead of prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/9">The Joint Committee report also makes a number of suggestions that many hon. Members have spoken about today, so I will not hold up the Chamber by reiterating them all. Apart from those matters that I have already mentioned, on which the report is good, I note the stress that it places on the importance of turning intelligence into evidence. That is critical. We need to move more towards evidence rather than simply holding on to intelligence in the hope that, in time, further evidence will be accidentally produced. I hope the Government will make a note of that, particularly the section on intercept evidence. The irony is that the Government are willing to lock up suspects without charge, but not to use intercept evidence to prove their case and to convict. What is the purpose of incarceration without a conviction?</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/10">The Liberal Democrats wish to see the bar on intercept evidence in criminal trials removed. The inadmissibility of intercept evidence must be a major factor in not being able to bring charges. We presume that much evidence must be gathered by way of intercept, and that it would not meet the relevant charging standards. Continuing inadmissibility means that charges cannot be brought so easily. Earlier this year, Lord Carlile reiterated his view that</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/11" class="indent">&quot;there might possibly be a few cases in which it would be appropriate and useful to deploy in a criminal prosecution material derived from public system telephone interceptions and convertible into criminal evidence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/12">The JCHR concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/13" class="indent">&quot;the ban on the use of intercept evidence in court should now be removed, and attention should be turned urgently to ways of relaxing the ban.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/14">As we heard from other Members, the Attorney-General too has come out recently on post-charge questioning and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/15">I shall summarise. Our country faces a deadly threat. All sides in the House agree on that. We are fortunate that our police and intelligence services have been able to disrupt and prevent so many attempts to bring death and mayhem to our streets. Laws that prevent an act from taking place by restricting liberty or removing due judicial process must, as the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen said, be kept under constant scrutiny and examination, and be constantly improved, lest they cross the line of absolute necessity.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/16">Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, for example, allows stops without reasonable grounds for suspicion. Applications under that provision are made for particular areas, and once they are made the police do not need to apply the normal grounds in order to stop and search. Since coming into force, that section has been applied over the whole of London all the time. Once a power is given, its use can be seen as convenient&mdash;it is there in perpetuity rather than being used only for the extreme circumstances for which Parliament granted it.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/17">I urge the Government to heed and take seriously the findings and conclusions of both of these excellent reports.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in the debate and I welcome the opportunity to discuss the reports. I am grateful to the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Joint Committee on Human Rights for producing them. They both strike me as being full of useful and interesting material that can make a powerful contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">We have to face up to the fact that when serious legislation has come to the Floor of the House over the past 12 months and beyond, we have been in the midst of a rather fevered debate. That is profoundly unsatisfactory, because there clearly is a common meeting of minds on many of the things on which we have to make a decision, just as there has been today.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/3">I start with something that may seem so basic that it is not worth saying. I entirely agree with the Home Affairs Committee that we face a serious terrorist threat. I have had the opportunity of debating that in the past, but I restate my belief now, not least because I deal with community cohesion matters for my party, that my experience leads me to suppose that the extent of the threat may be understated. I have no difficulty with the figures recently put forward by Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller. I regret to say that they are entirely in keeping with the impressions that I get when travelling up and down the country doing my community cohesion work.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/4">After the July bombings, there was a slight sense that the Government, perhaps with a desire to reassure the public, projected the impression that the bombers came from Planet Tharg&mdash;that they were from outer space&mdash;and that those monsters who had suddenly appeared in our midst could be isolated and removed. My conclusion, painful though it may be, is that that does not bear scrutiny. The bombers undoubtedly have international connections, as do other terrorists threatening our country, but they are also a home-grown phenomenon. They are deeply embedded in certain sections of our society and, as I said, they are angry and alienated, and have chillingly distorted perspectives about the general state of the world and the society in which they live.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/5">That is a big challenge for us all. It is precisely that challenge that has always coloured my approach and that of my party to the matter of security. At the end of the day, there are no short cuts to be had. I fear very much that the problem will be with us for some time&mdash;we could easily be talking of one or two generations. It will be a battle for hearts and minds. It will not be a clash of civilisations, but a battle about values. We will win that debate if we are strong in asserting our own values, which will allow a much better environment to exist, in which people of diverse faiths and backgrounds can live in peace, prosperity and freedom, than the alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/6">For that reason, we must be careful how we deal with the security issues relating to terrorism. In all our debates&mdash;whether over 90-day detention or over control orders, which oddly enough I believe better highlights the problem&mdash;we must be careful that what we do does not give even an impression that might undermine our core values of freedom and the rule of law in the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/7">Language matters. Even the way in which the Government come to the House to ask for more powers matters, because it can send out powerful signals about the underlying intentions that they&mdash;and we, if we co-operate&mdash;have. Many of the communities from which the bombers and terrorists spring are affected by profound paranoia, believing that inimical forces are working against them, their religion and their community. Our actions can therefore act as a powerful fuel, making the engagement process that can bring them out of that mindset much more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/8">It is with that in mind that I shall deal with some of the issues that both Committees have considered. I start with 90-day detention. Much has been said, and I do not wish to go over old ground. However, the simple fact is that when 90-day detention was introduced in the Commons, the case for it was not properly made. A decision taken by an ACPO committee&mdash;as I said earlier, it was soon revealed by subsequent inquiry that it could have been divided on the question, with some members feeling that they were being hijacked into making a precipitate decision that might have an adverse impact on relations with the Muslim communities in Britain&mdash;that was translated into flimsy bits of paper, as highlighted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1827" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>. In the course of two weeks of polemic, it was elevated into holy writ.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/9">That illustrates precisely how not to approach such debates. I have always accepted that there were powerful arguments for extending the 14-day period to 28 days. I entirely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that we did not decide 28 days on a rational basis. It was a compromise, based on gut feelings and talking to people. I suspect that we probably got it about right. Indeed, I have seen persuasive evidence for 28 days. However, it is a regrettable fact that, at the time we debated it, I doubt we had a rationale behind the decisions. The evidence simply was not available for the 90-day detention period and I am interested to learn that the Attorney-General's current view is that an extension beyond 28 days is not justified. I am pragmatic, as is my party, about these issues. If powerful and persuasive arguments can be advanced which indicate that a move from 28 days needs to be made, we will consider it and if necessary we will restrict our distaste for it. However, at the moment the argument is not there and I will need a lot of persuasion and evidence to shift my position. That is not to say that, on our part, moving from 28 days becomes the ditching of some holy writ; it does not. But we must bear it in mind that every day that we extend the principle of pre-charge detention, we are subtly completely undermining some of our basic, core legal principles, and it rapidly turns into detention without trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a good point. One of the problems in the debate on control orders was that, as he will recollect, the sense of urgency when it was announced was such that the whole thing was rushed through Parliament in a way that was bound to raise hackles. He may recollectthat in Committee and on Report, vast chunks of amendments were sensibly tabled to the Bill, but there was no opportunity to consider them&mdash;causing fury not only for our party, but on the Labour Back Benches. There was a remorseless sense that unless one signed up immediately to support the Bill, one was almost treasonable or aiding and abetting terrorists. That is a very bad state in which to legislate.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/2">I entirely welcome the suggestion that we should have full legislation and, as the right hon. Gentleman will recollect, the final compromise came when the Home Secretary wisely announced at the Dispatch Box that although he was not prepared to concede a sunset clause, he was prepared to concede to Lord Carlile's review. Major consolidating legislation would then offer the opportunity for amendment and full debate on every aspect of our anti-terrorism legislation. I repeat what I said when I intervened on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase>: I hope that the Government keep that promise. The suggestion that this consolidating legislation may just be a rubber stamp exercise to bring together everything that is currently on different statutes into one piece of legislation, would be, to my mind, a flagrant breach of the undertaking that I understood had been promised at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/3">I hope that the Minister will tell the Home Secretary that it is in the interests of the Government and, indeed, the public that we should have an opportunity for reviewing the armoury of legislation that we now have&mdash;some of which has never actually been used or may not even have come into effect. We need a sensible and comprehensive piece of legislation. That can be done, but it means that people have the right to question what it is made up of.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/4">There are many references in the reports to thresholds for prosecutions and holding charges. I appreciate from that that it is probable that we who are lawyers and have participated in earlier debates may have failed hon. Members by not communicating something that was obvious to us, but not to others. I am afraid that that sometimes happens and I was struck by the bit in the report dealing with thresholds for prosecutions. It has long been the case that the test for the threshold as to whether to charge may be a lower threshold where there is reasonable anticipation that more material will come to light. In the context of drug importation and all sorts of other things with which I have been involved, such as ordinary crime, that is a common place. Therefore, it is something that was always in the back of my mind when considering the necessity for a 90 day pre-charge detention. I imagined that it was in the back of the Government's mind as well and I shall be interested to hear from the Minister about that. I may be a bit muddled, but I should be grateful for clarification as to why, apparently, it might not apply to certain terrorism cases, because I am mystified by that. I do not see why terrorism cases are any different in their nature from any other form of criminal activity in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.1/5">On holding charges, I am slightly concerned that we might be giving a mistaken impression. Of course charging someone with a holding charge merely as a pretext for detention cannot be tolerated, but charging someone with an offence for which there is plainly material to justify it and when one intends to bring them to trial, with the knowledge that there are other, more serious matters that one wishes to investigate so that one is happily able to marry the two things together from the point of view of preventing crime, is perfectly acceptable and, indeed, is done all the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.0/1">It has been under active consideration for ever. The Minister and I have been having these discussions for a very long time and I return to the point that those at the sharp end are saying that they need it, and quickly. I absolutely accept that it is not a panacea and that were it to be introduced that would not mean that the job was done, but can the Minister give us any idea of when the review might be complete?</p>

	<p pid="a.188.1/1">As I said, as soon as possible, I hope. I do not have the whole timetable to hand, nor in my head, because we are coming to the end of the review and it will duly report to the Prime Minister. Were there to be a terrorism Bill in this Session, it would need to be sooner rather than later. One would have thought that the Government would take that legislative opportunity to declare whether intercept evidence should be available, and if so, whether changes to primary legislation were necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/2">I accept the points made about some of the other elements in both reports. Some of them are nothing to do with legislation. I was interested, for instance, in the dialogue about examining magistrates, and on that I think that I am on the same side as the hon. Member for Hendon. Being in the middle of things, I do not understand the notion that the Government are rushing headlong, siren-led or otherwise, to a French administrative model. The hon. Member for Beaconsfield was, I think, entirely accurate in saying that the French see justice rooted in their own system, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said the same. Given the extent of the difference in the substantive and historical legal base, the worst of all worlds is probably to graft a bit from one on to the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/3">The point made in my hon. Friend's report about the growing and more proactive role of the Crown Prosecution Service in the prosecution of such cases was well made. Behind that, some of the other issues that we need to examine, even if the activity level stays as it is, touch on the capacity of the courts, the CPS and others on the criminal justice side.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/4">I take umbrage at the notion that the Government, the Association of Chief Police Officers or anyone else, in a terribly lazy fashion, wanted 90 days because of resources and the notion that if we were really serious, we would give all the available resources to the Service and it could do in 14 days what we have requested to be done on the cheap in 90 days. That is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/5">By 2008, as Dame Eliza has suggested, the service's budget will have doubled. Hon. Members drew out elements about encryption, the international dimension and the seamless nature of the threat between the domestic and the international. Translation and other elements hinted at by Peter Clarke in August are involved. In some cases, the magnitude of things, the level of expertise and the capacity of that level of expertise that are involved are such that this is nothing to do with resources in the main. There are only so many Urdu or Farsi speaking cryptologists who can sit down to try to crack the code on a mobile phone, a computer or whatever else. Doubling the resources overnight will not create another pot of such expertise. The point made about resources is not well made, and I do not accept it.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/6">We are still examining all the issues raised about28 days&mdash;I shall be as frank as that. I do not know where the Government will alight in terms of the review, but I do know that we have a right and duty to examine such an issue. We should do so in the broader context. We should consider it in the context of whether or not to allow intercept evidence and whether to enhance the capabilities and capacities of the prosecution and all sorts of other agencies who are party to this.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/7">We should seriously review the point about post-charge questioning. I was struck by the honesty of the report by my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon, which implied, at the very least, even if it was not explicit, an adverse inference from the exercising of the right to silence. I was also grateful for the comments made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield. It must be the case; otherwise we would have post-charge questioning with nothing about the inference from silence and, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen suggested, terror suspects would say nothing and one would not be further forward in the process. We need to bite that proverbial bullet too.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.1/8">In the balance of civil liberties versus our security, some will say that any negative inference on the exercising of the right to silence is a step that they do not want to take. That is a perfectly logical view, but I was grateful that the report said there could be post-charge questioning in that context and looking in that regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.1/1">I accept that, as it is precisely the point on which I was congratulating my hon. Friend's Committee. As an aside, in substance we have before us a review of the whole of PACE. As part of the process, it might well be appropriate to take the counter-terrorism-related aspects of PACE to one side and deal with them in quicker fashion than the longer-term review that is overdue or due now.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/2">I am sorry that that does not take us much further in terms of current thinking on legislation. I assure both Committees and this Chamber that we are looking in substance at all of the suggestions that have been made. This labours the point, and I apologise for doing so, but none offer an alternative to our current position. They may well enhance some aspects of it, and we might reach the stage where a package means that we do not have to open up the 28 days&mdash;I simply do not know.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/3">It might be that the emphasis should be on 28 days and no more. I do not know whether we could collectively come up with a set of extraordinary circumstances where we might go beyond that, what the level of evidence that would be required for such a scenario would be or what the judicial oversight and all the other areas that would be involved would be. Within this whole panoply there is a duty on us all to revisit constantly the balance between liberty and public security. I want to come back to points made about pre-legislative scrutiny and the consolidated Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.7/1">As I have tried to make clear throughout our debate, Government policy is being determined as we speak during the course of the review of our counter-terrorist response, including legislation, which is taking place across the whole of Government. With respect to my hon. Friend, it was right and proper for me to shake my head because I cannot tell him what was in the Attorney-General's mind when he said what he did. In that context, my hon. Friend's question was not really appropriate. That is why I was shaking my head, and I hope that he will forgive me.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.7/2">There must be scope and space for mature and reflective debate across Government and across Parliament, so that we end up with the package and the legislation that we all require and accept is necessary to take our challenge to this threat far more seriously. By the by, in response to a comment that I think was made by the hon. Member for Beaconsfield, I am not aware of any terrorism provision in the legislation from 2000, 2001, 2005, or 2006 that has not yet been brought into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.7/3">I shall address another entirely unnecessary point. I was the person in charge of this at the time, and once we got the 28-day provision through one of the most serious points that the Government took into account from all quarters of the House was that there should be very plainly a code of conduct as to how the provision was operated. When we take the time not only to draft that code of conduct but to consult on it before empowering it, we are told, &quot;It couldn't be that urgent because you took so long between Royal Assent and starting the process.&quot; That is not entirely fair. Throughout that process, as part of a little transition thing, I was intimately involved.</p>

	<p pid="a.192.3/1">I am saying candidly and honestly that I do not know. We are more than three quarters of the way into the review, and legislation is included in that. We are close&mdash;but not yet there&mdash;to informing the Prime Minister of those deliberations. We shall then see where things go from there. All I was trying to suggest is that, as my right hon. Friend suggested, the Committee may feel sufficiently serious about the matter to have some form of scrutiny, albeit truncated, as and when there is a Bill. That would be above and beyond what the new-fangled modernisation monster might provide with every Standing Committee being a Select Committee of some sort with limited public hearings on their Bills at the start of the process. We must wait and see, but my contention&mdash;I will not go there. We must wait and see.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/2">I have deliberately not revisited where we have come from, because that is appropriate for another time, not now. I have deliberately not discussed Irish terrorism versus where we are now, although I fully respect the background and experience of the hon. Member for Newark. That is an interesting debate, but it is a moot point in terms of where we are now.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.3/3">I have tried to address in a limited and narrow way the concerns about legislation and the future that were expressed in both reports, and the wider concerns about how we do what we do, consensus and having as open and transparent a debate as possible on why we are proposing what we are proposing, what the outcome will be and where we have come from in terms of both previous legislation and any body of evidence, such as that offered by ACPO, the service and so on.</p>
