	<p pid="a.75.0/1">I cannot agree with the hon. Gentleman, who I know well and for whom I have a lot of respect. The truth is that the economy was recovering during the early months of this year, as the figures show. I am not giving my own opinion; I am talking about the opinion of experienced business people, house builders, lenders and analysts who all say exactly the same thing: the housing market was recovering and there was the prospect of growth. In the past five months, that has been taken away by a series of measures-Budget measures introduced by the Government, changes in planning policy and changes affecting institutions that have been summarily abolished. A series of ad hoc, poorly co-ordinated and ill-thought-out proposals have damaged confidence in the market. Any person who is seriously worried about housing should feel very alarmed about that.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">Is my right hon. Friend aware that a growing body of research demonstrates the negative impact upon children's well-being of high enforced mobility? The savings gained as a result of some of those measures and the removal of security of tenure will be more than offset by the damage done to children's health, emotional well-being and educational achievement?</p>

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">My hon. Friend speaks with considerable knowledge and experience of the subject, and I wholly endorse what she said. That is an area where there is great cause for concern. It is rather depressing that it is coming from a Minister whose language reveals the rather cavalier approach that he is adopting towards his policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">In March this year, in the run-up to the general election, the current Housing Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Conservatives will ensure that living in social accommodation means that you'll get a &quot;freedom pass&quot; to get on and do more with your life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/4">That is the first time that I have heard a notice to quit described as a freedom pass. That is an indication of the Orwellian language that the Government are using to justify some of their wholly unacceptable policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/5">All of us recognise that security is so important for people's life prospects, so why should the coalition Government, without any manifesto commitment or reference in the coalition agreement, move to take away that precious security from a group of our fellow citizens who arguably need it more than anyone? The only credible argument advanced by those who advocate the policy is that it will free up social housing, making more homes available to those in need, but any serious analysis of the Government's proposals shows clearly that it will not have that effect-on the contrary, it will discourage mobility-and that, even if it did have the intended effect, it would have disastrous social consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/6">Let us take those arguments in turn. If existing tenants are not to lose their security, and if new lettings are to be made on a new basis without the traditional security and at 80% of market rents, existing tenants who might have considered moving to a smaller home, so releasing larger accommodation for those in need, will obviously have second thoughts if the result will be a loss of security and a rent increase. The policy would have the opposite effect of that intended. If, however, to counter that perverse incentive to remain in an under-occupied home, tenants are allowed to keep their security when moving and not have a rent increase, there will be grotesque anomalies. Wholly different rents and tenancy terms will be perpetuated solely on the arbitrary criterion of whether the tenancy is offered to a transferring tenant or a new applicant.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/7">Worse still will be the consequences of using the new insecure tenancies to require tenants to move on if their income increases or if they are judged to have enjoyed sufficient time in social housing. What chance is there of creating mixed and balanced communities, rather than ghettos of deprivation, if anyone who gets on is told to leave? If only the poor and the unemployed can occupy social housing, that is a recipe for residualisation and a total disincentive to aspiration.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>. As he rightly says, we have not so much crossed swords as spoken on many occasions on various Bill Committees and in Westminster Hall. Like him, the issue of social housing lies close to my heart. On one level, I was disappointed to see that the capital grant funding has been halved, although I entirely understand the reasons behind the Government's decision given the deficit that we face-I suspect that the right hon. Gentleman will not follow me on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">I am delighted at the introduction of further rent flexibility to generate a greater borrowing capacity. I take on board the point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> and I hope that the Minister will indicate whether the powers are mandatory or, as I suspect, part of the panoply of options open to housing associations.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/3">In January 2009, I initiated a debate in Westminster Hall that highlighted the need for social landlords to be allowed to use their stock more flexibly. At the time, I argued that the current economic climate-which I suspect has not changed much over the past two years-provided us with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a more flexible rental market. I advised:</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Housing associations are often frustrated that the income they receive from renting a property barely covers maintenance costs and that the rental income from a four-bedroom house is only slightly more than that from a two-bedroom flat... A relaxation in rent policy will increase incentives to build to higher standards and reflect the relative value of a social tenancy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> referred to that point in his comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Rent differentiation would also provide an incentive for a couple to downsize when they no longer need to stay in a large property when their children are grown up. That would hopefully free-up valuable family-size accommodation to address the problems of overcrowding.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2010-01-14.76"><i>Official Report, </i>14 January 2010; Vol. 486, c. 76WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/7">Such problems of overcrowding are particularly acute in the middle of cities such as London.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/8">I went on to use the example of the housing arrangements of one of my constituents who had recently passed away. She lived as a secure tenant on the Peabody Wild Street estate, at a rate of &#163;75.50 a week, which included services. That estate is moments away from Covent Garden piazza, and the market rent for such a flat would be around &#163;320 a week, probably more by now. When she passed away, the flat was re-let at &#163;116 a week to a tenant with support needs. The difference between the social and market rent was &#163;200 a week, or &#163;10,000 a year. That situation has been worsening over the past couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/9">With the neediest households receiving priority for housing in my constituency and many other constituencies in the capital, my worry is that such places have become home almost exclusively to either the super-rich or the very poor. That polarisation is not a healthy state of affairs. I do not want to be too London-based; I am sure that the same point applies in Sheffield and many other big cities. All hon. Members will have constituents who earn multiples of the average national wage, who cannot get on the property ladder or afford inner-city rents, but who are regarded as far too wealthy to qualify for social housing. The gap between social and market rents and the inflexibility of the social rent structure has meant that the cost of renting in London remains a significant issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/10">I accept that some of the Government's policies are still in gestation. One hopes that they will take on board some of the concerns reiterated over the years by myself and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. Too often in these debates we end up talking about the interests of existing tenants who are understandably anxious about the idea of their situation changing. In doing so, however, we ignore those less vocal people who make huge sacrifices of time and money to commute to their jobs in the inner cities, or those whose families have been in a local area for generations, but who are forced to move away because of the unaffordability of city centres, particularly in London. It is right to identify the interests of those who will be affected by the new policy, but we should not forget those who have suffered under the existing regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/11">The polarisation of our inner cities is a direct result of decades of well-meaning Government intervention from parties on both sides. If some of the Government's proposals make it easier for young, hard-working people on middle incomes to afford to live in the centre of London, that is a good thing. This week, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40055" name="Margaret Hodge">the right hon. Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase> warned that the Government's policy will create middle-class ghettos in our inner cities. In truth, the young middle classes have been virtually excluded from my constituency over the past decade. We have the absurd situation where the taxpayer massively subsidises the unemployed to live in the centre of London, while working people pay extortionate amounts to commute to their jobs because they find rent levels unaffordable in the centre of town.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/12">Some of the G15 housing associations have come up with a number of new schemes. I hope that some of that innovation will allow young people and young families, who are particularly important, to live at affordable rents while being able to save so as to move to another property or perhaps to buy a share in one in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/13">However, I also accept that the speed at which the cap is being put in place perhaps ignores some of the logistical problems for local authorities-huge logistical problems for some local authorities-in arranging new accommodation, but also coping with a sudden influx of new claimants. About 80% of the people living on housing benefit in my constituency receive a sum in excess of the housing benefit cap. I suspect that that is relatively unusual, but we are still talking about relatively high percentages even in other parts of the capital. For those individuals, this is an incredibly unsettling time. For the areas to which they will move, there will be huge social upheaval, which will affect health services and education as well as, obviously, the basic housing in the locality.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/14">It is likely that, given the option of being able to rent out central London properties at 80% of the market value, social landlords will, to a large extent, choose to do so. At one level, that is no bad thing, because it will allow them to invest in new stock and improve the derisory levels of house building seen in recent years, but equally, as a number of hon. Members pointed out, some unintended consequences may come into play.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-10-27a.91.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" speakername="Alison Seabeck" colnum="91"  time="010:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101027/halltext/101027h0001.htm#10102747000483">
	<p pid="a.91.0/1">It is a pleasure to be called to speak under your chairmanship, Mr Gray, for the first time in my new role.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">I start by congratulating my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> for securing the debate on a matter of such fundamental importance to our country and local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">Let us be clear: there is a shortage of supply. We have been through the worst recession since the 1930s. However, in the teeth of the global recession, the Labour Government supported the building of 50,000 homes in the first six months of this year through the Homes and Communities Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">The housing sector has been like a patient on life support-but this month the Government pulled the plug. In the comprehensive spending review, they have failed to offer the sector any sense of direction. Instead, we have had the revocation of planning rules, whereby hundreds of thousands of much-needed homes will be scrapped, while the new homes bonus scheme has been long delayed. Given the time lag inherent in the eventual payment arrangements for that policy, when does the Minister anticipate that the first foundations of such homes will be laid?</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">The Government have shown over the past few months that they have the capacity to destroy confidence in the housing market, to reduce the number of new homes being built and to eviscerate the very concept of social homes. Rent at 80% of market rates is simply not affordable for many hard-working families on low incomes or, indeed, for pensioners. Many families will not accept new, more expensive and less secure tenancies, leaving them with the unpalatable choice of remaining in overcrowded accommodation. Does the Minister believe that that would represent a fair deal for tenants? Tenants do not seem to matter any more.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/6">If the economy is to grow-<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr Field)</phrase> highlighted the importance of growth-we need to ensure that people can be mobile. The changes proposed by the Government represent a significant block to moving by choice to access new jobs. I said &quot;moving by choice&quot; deliberately-we will see people having to move, because they have no choice, to areas of poorer housing, with few job opportunities, since that is where all the cheap accommodation will be. According to London Councils' briefing on housing benefit changes, local authorities are already looking to the outer ring of London and beyond for suitable temporary accommodation, moving families away from the areas that they know to bed and breakfasts in seaside towns-something we have not seen since the early 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/7">My hon. Friends cited many examples of the impact of current and future policies, and they all supported the general thrust of the speech made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich that we need to have a viable intermediate and social housing sector to meet needs. He also highlighted the month-on-month improvement in sales up to the general election, followed by the fear of a double-dip recession as the implications of Government policies are understood in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, in his genuine search for knowledge and answers to questions, highlighted not only the importance of the good use of public sector land in his area, but, importantly, the issue of mortgage funding and the concern that there is a narrow view in the Financial Services Authority that is not allowing sensible risk or flexibility in the lending sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> spoke of others' expertise, but his contribution to the debate gave us the benefit of his own. His unpicking of the detail of the housing benefit and its associated costs was forensic, highlighting the confusion in the advice given in Government documents. I hope that we get some prompt clarification of some of his points from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/10">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster also mentioned the uncertainty about the precise implications of Government policy. He touched on repairs and maintenance as well, but my understanding is that the money raised from the new higher rent will not be earmarked for maintenance. If that issue is not tackled, we will see a drift back into a huge backlog of disrepair. He also mentioned housing finance being treated as off the balance sheet-I would welcome the Government's clarification on that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/11">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase> made a powerful speech highlighting the personal misery that can be caused by Government policies and the housing trap.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/12">Every stone that I have lifted since coming into my post has revealed another issue that does not seem to have been understood or addressed by the Government. The Minister must see the contradictions between the different strands of his Government's policies. He must see the damage that his policies are doing to the aspirations of families who just want to secure a roof over their heads.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/13">Many right hon. and hon. Members value the diversity of their constituencies-a point made by the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster-and they know that the changes advocated by the Government and the Minister will tear it apart, through a housing and benefits policy that will, essentially, ghettoise those in social housing and on low incomes. We need to value mixed communities and the Government's policies do not deliver that.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/14">To return to tenancies before I wind up, the Minister was once a vocal supporter of secure tenancies and low social rents. We have to ask, if there were a Conservative majority Government and he were still in opposition, would he have kept true to his earlier beliefs? We know what those beliefs were-the Minister was a serious, cautious, discriminate and highly selective signer of early-day motions while in opposition. He signed more than 2,800 in the last Parliament and, in 2008, put his name to early-day motion 355. Perhaps he does not recall it, but let me quote it:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/15" class="indent">&quot;That this House points out the urgent need to boost the economy by a massive programme of public investment to improve existing council homes and estates and build a new generation of first-class council housing to provide secure tenancies and low rents&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/16">sentiments supported by many hon. Members in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/17">The Minister has a waiting list of around 9,000 in his own authority. The average weekly rent for a property there is about &#163;54, yet he now advocates rents at 80% of the market: an increase in London of about &#163;200 a week for a two-bedroom property and of about &#163;50 in Hazel Grove. How many of his constituents will be able to afford to remain living in his constituency? Perhaps his majority, too, is being gerrymandered?</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/18">As a member of the Government, the Minister will have to vote in favour of the removal of the security of tenure. He will oversee a 60% reduction in the Government's funding for new affordable homes. Call it a U-turn or a volte-face, but whatever we call it, we know the decision is wrong for this country, making a mockery of the phrase, &quot;We're all in this together.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/19">No, it does not really matter when the Minister changed his mind. Was it before or after the coalition discovered that the debt was lower and economic growth higher than they expected when taking office? Was it before he ceased to be an Opposition MP or, as I suspect, when the chance of cosying up to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government proved too much to resist?</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/20">Can the Minister confirm, in addition to responding to the excellent points made by right hon. and hon. Members, that the 67,000 homes to be built in the next two years are in fact a carry-over from the previous Labour Government's plans? They are Labour's houses. Can he confirm that the remaining 80,000 homes that the Government hope to build will not be for social rent at all and that to call a rent of 80% of the market rate affordable is disingenuous? Can he confirm that any lack of take-up of the new tenancy will create a shortfall in the Government's funding plans for new housing? Can he confirm that the revocation of the regional spatial strategies will cause the cancellation of more than 300,000 planned homes between now and next year, as the National Housing Federation suggests?</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/21">What is the Housing Minister's plan B? According to the response that he made to the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, it is to keep upping incentives until the local authorities bite. At what point will a decision be taken to increase the incentive? What is the figure for new builds that will give rise to a review of the payment? What hope does the scheme have if local authorities and, to a certain extent, developers know that Ministers will increase the money that they receive if they simply wait? The consequences of the Government's actions will be felt for a generation. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.4/1">Absolutely. That goes back to my original point about the pathways to work scheme, which was successful because it considered the individual, rather than how to get people moved off benefits and into tax-paying employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.4/2">I wish to ask a couple of questions, the first of which is a wider economic one. The Government will be moving people from incapacity benefit, or from employment and support allowance via the work capability assessment, to the jobseeker's allowance, at a time when the Government have admitted that there will be 490,000 job losses in the public sector, and there will be a massive knock-on effect on the private sector. Even the Minister has to admit that unemployment will be going down rather than up. Where will the jobs come from?</p>
	<p pid="a.101.4/3">My second question may seem a minor point, but the Government will be taking &#163;25 a week from those on incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance by putting them on JSA. That may save the Government &#163;25 a week per claimant, but that money will not go back into the local economy. Such people have so little money that they spend it all. In rural ex-pit villages such as those in my constituency, many people are on passive benefits, but it is those people who keep the local shops going. Such shops will now close. How will that help growth? How will that help the economy? How will that provide more jobs?</p>
	<p pid="a.101.4/4">We are already struggling. Many people will have been on passive benefits for well over two years, yet they are still more likely to retire or die than get jobs. They may get batted into the nearest towns where there is work, but that work will be taken by people fresh out of university who are far closer to the labour market. How exactly will it work?</p>
	<p pid="a.101.4/5">Huge cuts have been announced to the Ministry of Justice budget. We have already heard that the tribunal system will be overloaded by appeals against people being taken off employment and support allowance and put on JSA. Many of those appeals are successful. However, at a time when the Ministry budget is being cut, how on earth will it work? Is the tribunal service ready for that enormous spike in its work?</p>
	<p pid="a.101.4/6">To sum up, I would like to hear the Minister give those on passive benefits the idea that there is some light at the end of the tunnel. The vast majority want to work. They are not workshy; they simply need the correct help and support. Of those on benefits, 45% have some sort of mental health condition, which often fluctuates. How are we personalising the service to get those people off benefits and into work? I shall list my questions, and if I do not receive answers, I shall intervene on the Minister or write to him.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving me prior notice of his concerns. One of the things that I am happy to consider-I have said that we will carry on reviewing this process as we go forward-is some kind of emergency break for people who suffer an immediate and very sharp deterioration in their condition. We should be able to reflect that, and I will ask officials to consider how we deal with such a situation. The goal is to do the right thing by people. What I do not want to do is say of any condition, &quot;Nobody with that condition can ever work.&quot; I do not want to give people an automatic path into the support group because where we can, and where circumstances enable us to do so, we should be trying to help people into work. Clearly, when things change rapidly, we need to see whether there is a way in which to address that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-10-27a.107.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40149" speakername="John Stevenson" colnum="107"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101027/halltext/101027h0001.htm#10102747000515">
	<p pid="a.107.3/1">I am grateful, Mr Robertson, for the opportunity to debate what I believe is the very significant issue of elected mayors. It is a topic that, to all intents and purposes, flies below the radar. However, it has the potential to affect our democracy profoundly, not only at the local level but at the national level, in what I would like to think is a positive way. The number of Members here for this debate demonstrates that the topic is flying below the radar and yet, as I say, it could have a profound effect on our constituencies up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/2">At present, there are 13 elected mayors. They affect at least 50 constituencies and if there are a further 12 elected mayors, as proposed by the Government, another 50 to 100 constituencies would have an elected mayor in their area, affecting local politics and their debates. That would make a total of 150 constituencies, and if we reach that point there may be a critical mass.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/3">The idea of a mayor is extremely well established, not only in this country but all over the world. However, in most respects there is a huge difference between our style of mayors and those in other countries. Our tradition is very much one of having a ceremonial mayor who carries out civic duties. Quite often the post is held by a councillor, usually in the last year of their term in office and who therefore is coming to the end of their career.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/4">In most other countries that have mayors, however, the mayors exercise varying degrees of executive authority. In those countries, the large cities often have executive mayors, with the obvious examples coming from the United States, where the major cities, including New York and Chicago, traditionally all have mayors with executive powers. We can also look to our Commonwealth countries, such as Australia and New Zealand, or to other European cities, many of which have mayors who are executive and not ceremonial in the way that ours are. Often those mayors are seen as an integral component of local democracy. The most recent example of the election of a new mayor was in Wellington in New Zealand. That election was an extremely closely-fought battle, with the count going on for a number of days after the election was over. As a result, a great deal of publicity was generated. Therefore, I see no reason why mayors with real executive powers cannot become part of our democratic landscape and, in the time-honoured British fashion, become a traditional part of our democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/5">For completeness, I just want to cover the recent origins of the elected mayor concept in Britain. The idea was first introduced by the Labour Government under the Local Government Act 2000, which allowed local authorities to instigate a referendum for an elected mayor by means of a simple resolution of the council. The Act also allowed local residents to petition for a referendum. When local residents wanted to do that, they needed 5% of the electorate to sign that petition and only then would the council be duty-bound to instigate such a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/6">That was the situation in 2000 but it was altered by the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007, which allowed councils to introduce the new mayoral system by passing a simple resolution and without the requirement to hold a referendum. However, to achieve that there would need to be a two-thirds majority on the council in favour of that resolution. That Act also stated that there should be no more than one referendum in any 10-year period.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/7">I genuinely believe that, back in 2000, the Labour Government wanted the idea of elected mayors to catch on and become widespread. I believe that they thought that the idea of elected mayors was an opportunity to transform local government and they thought that such a transformation would happen. I also believe that they thought that elected mayors would become commonplace and that by now we would have many mayors up and down the country. In 2006, they actually expressed their disappointment that that had not happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/8">So what success has there been? To be entirely honest, even as somebody who fully supports the concept of elected mayors, I must accept that the answer is that success has been very mixed. Since 2000, there have been 37 mayoral referendums. Of those 37 referendums, there was a yes vote in 13 with a no vote in the remainder. There are two possible reasons why that has been the case. First, is the fact that only a third of those referendums have been successful an indication that overall people are against the idea of elected mayors? Secondly and quite simply, there have been only 37 referendums, when there could have been up to 400, or at least 100 to 200, if the idea of elected mayors had taken hold. Therefore I must accept that the number of referendums that we have had is a bit of a disappointment, and that, of those that we have had, only a third have come up with an affirmative answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/9">I acknowledge that the idea of elected mayors has had a mixed start, but I believe that there are obvious reasons for that, many of which can be overcome. Quite simply, at the outset the Blair Government did not push the idea of elected mayors in the way that I thought they would. I do not know what the internal politics of the Labour party or the Labour Government were at that time, whether people felt that it was not the right idea and it was consequently put on the backburner, but I genuinely believe that the Blair Government wanted the idea of elected mayors to succeed. However, for whatever reason they did not push the idea at that time and to all intents and purposes they lost interest in it. I also think that, at that time, none of the national parties-Conservative, Labour or the Liberal Democrats-were actively engaged in promoting the idea of elected mayors, although I think that that attitude has begun to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/10">What is probably the most important factor of all is that there has been local opposition to the idea of elected mayors, coming from local parties of all persuasions, many-although I hasten to add not all-councillors and quite often from council leaders, local opposition leaders and indeed chief executives and senior officers on councils. Together, those people quite often stymie the hope of having referendums and particularly the hope of having successful referendums. Quite often, the lack of publicity about the idea of elected mayors, which in turn has prevented a proper debate about elected mayors and their genuine pros and cons, has reduced the success rate that I like to think could have been achieved. Finally, the threshold for a petition for a referendum is set at too high a level, at 5% of those on the electoral register. That is just one of the issues that I will ask the Minister to address when he responds to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/11">As I have said, however, matters are starting to change. The London mayoralty has undoubtedly boosted the concept of elected mayors and credit for that has to go to both Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson. They have raised the profile of the idea of elected mayors. It affects London, but I think that it is now permeating out to the rest of the country. People see them as national figures as well as a figure for the city of London. I genuinely believe that this new Government are also starting to take a lead on this issue and I hope that the Minister will confirm that when he replies. Through Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone, the London mayoralty, and the various elections up and down the country, there is growing interest in the idea of elected mayors in both local and national media, and also among local politicians and local people. Middlesbrough and Hartlepool are obvious examples of places with high-profile mayors who have made a difference. Furthermore, those voting in the recent referendum in Tower Hamlets chose to go down the route of having an elected mayor, which I hope is an indicator of the future, although I must say that there was a very interesting election in Tower Hamlets thereafter. However, other people can comment on the merits of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/12">Circumstances have now changed and with increased awareness of the idea of elected mayors, among the public and at Government level, we have a real chance to change things. However, before I refer to the many advantages that I believe elected mayors would bring to our democracy, I will touch on some very basic reasons as to why change in local government governance is both desirable and necessary. Our present local government system was set up in the 1970s. Time has moved on and we now live in a very different world. Technology has also moved on, including the development of 24-hour media, as have people's expectations. Clearer and quicker decision making is now a necessity and, in many respects, it is part of everyday life. There have been changes to the way that councils run. We now have executives and scrutiny panels. However, I do not think that those changes actually go far enough to reflect the modern world and the way that we deal with things now. Given that background, elected mayors would help modernise local government enormously, and there are many clear-cut advantages to having them. They are open and transparent. Local people, not councillors, choose in an election who they want as their local democratic leader. It might not always give the result that we as politicians want, but that is what democracy is all about.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/13">Elected mayors provide greater accessibility. It is obvious who is in charge. The mayor carries the responsibility for running the council and cannot hide behind the machinations of local politics. Four-year terms also go some way to help, as they give the individual time to implement programmes properly. It is interesting that a number of mayors, particularly independents, are being re-elected at the end of their four-year term. A mayor brings strong leadership-not always, but in most cases. Mayors have the authority to get on and do things in their local community. They also provide visible and clear leadership, which goes a long way to improve the clarity of decision making.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/14">Ironically, having more elected mayors could enhance the role of councillors. I would like to think that there would be fewer of them. To take my county of Cumbria as an example, we have six district councils, one county council, one national park and 400 councillors to represent only 500,000 people. Clearly, if elected mayors were accepted in my part of the world, fewer councillors would be needed, but their role would be greatly improved. Some would still be involved with executive authority in the mayor's Cabinet, but that would enhance their scrutiny of the mayor. It would also allow councillors to be more critical of a mayor from their own party, because they would not be bound by the three-line whip in quite the same way as under the present regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/15">Mayoral elections to date have illustrated that mayors can bring personality as well as party politics into play. Again, that reflects the modern age. Personality is already a huge part of our democratic process, as evidenced clearly by the leadership debates during the general election. If ever there were a case of personality politics, that was it. Arguably, the same thing goes on with MPs up and down the country. Personalities matter, and I think that they bring something to the political system. Interestingly, of the 13 elected mayors, three are Conservative, three are Labour, two are Liberal Democrat, one is English Democrat and four are independent. That reflects the huge role that party politics will still play. Parties will still be the dominant force behind elected mayors, but the role allows room for independence, which reflects to a certain extent the politics that people want now. The evidence suggests and the experience in other countries reflects that main parties will still dominate mayoral politics, but there is room for others to get involved. That could make politics, particularly local politics, far more interesting and reconnect politicians with the general public. In many respects, it would be direct democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/16">Overall, in my view, elected mayors will bring better governance to local authorities, but could also affect national politics in time, effectively creating greater movement between national and local politics. A mayor with executive experience running a major authority could bring a lot to Parliament and national Government. Equally, a national politician could bring national experience and standing if elected as mayor of one of our major cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/17">To summarise my view of the advantage of elected mayors, I quote the words of Michael Heseltine:</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/18" class="indent">&quot;To create dynamic local leadership and to attract high-calibre individuals, we believe that directly elected executive mayors for...authorities is the best governance model&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/19">Ultimately, what matters to the public is effective democratic leadership. Although executive mayors have been going for only a short period and there are only 13 of them, the evidence suggests that they have been a success and have made a difference in many cases. They are far better known than their predecessors the council leaders, their councils often have higher profiles and they often campaign on their own initiatives, which they subsequently implement as mayors.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/20">However, it is the future that matters. I welcome this Government's approach to local government and their move to decentralise and return power and responsibility to local authorities and communities. We are a hugely over-centralised country, so the forthcoming Decentralisation and Localism Bill is welcome news. There is momentum for change not just here in Westminster but in all other parts of the country, and I certainly view localism as a way forward. Elected executive mayors can play a significant role in the localism agenda. My questions to the Minister therefore involve that issue, and I hope that he will give me a positive response.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/21">The Government propose a potential 12 new elected mayors. What about York, Chester, Blackpool and my own constituency, Carlisle? Why should they not also be involved and have the opportunity to decide whether they want an elected mayor? Places with strong identities that might benefit greatly from an elected mayor will be omitted. Is the Minister willing to extend the number of places where referendums will be held and elected mayors will be possible?</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/22">What additional powers is the Minister willing to pass to such mayors? Are they to be glorified council leaders, or can we give them extra powers such as appointments to local bodies or additional tax-raising powers? Where a mayor is elected, will the Minister consider the size and role of the council? It appears sensible to reduce the number of councillors while giving them an enhanced role in scrutiny and more generally. Will the Government be considering that? These matters are being handled by politicians, but what about the people? Will the Minister reduce the number of local people required to petition for a referendum from 5% to 2%? That would allow individuals in places where local politicians are preventing a referendum the opportunity to petition and campaign for one.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.3/23">Generally, do the Government want elected mayors established throughout the country? If that comes to pass, it will transform British politics in ways that many of us do not realise and which have a profound effect not just locally but nationally. The Government say that they are committed to localism. I hope that they are also committed to changing the governance of our local authorities through elected mayors. We now have an opportunity to create a renaissance in local government. As part of that, the time has finally come for elected mayors. I hope that the Minister will give me that confidence and assurance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-10-27a.119.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="119"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101027/halltext/101027h0002.htm#10102747000531">
	<p pid="a.119.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will bear with me, I will address the issue of the timing of referendums. However, I want to put it in the context of the rest of the policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/2">Having set out the policy position, let me say that our commitment recognises the positive contribution that, international experience suggests, elected mayors can make, in terms of strong local leadership and instigating real change-something that my hon. Friend the Member for Carlisle and others have observed. There are many examples of successful elected mayors, some of whom are in this country. I have had the pleasure of working with Mayors of London of both political persuasions. Other examples come from our other authorities. Clearly, there are also examples abroad. One need only look to London's best comparator city, New York, or observe the real resilience that directly elected mayors bring to the great cities of many of our continental friends and partners in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and so on, where that governance model is regarded as the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/3">That experience supports the case for mayors in our largest cities, which is founded on mayors having greater potential to achieve successful economic, social and environmental outcomes in their cities than do other forms of government. I think that that is the result of the sharper accountability, greater legitimacy and stronger leadership that direct elections bring. Mayors can both be entrusted with greater powers and be expected to exercise them more effectively than perhaps councils generally are. In our largest cities, creating mayors and equipping them with the powers that they need will enable them to seize opportunities so that those cities can fulfil their potential as drivers of genuine economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/4">We believe that elected mayors are an effective model-a model that can result in greater prosperity and improved social outcomes for our great cities, and a model that can restore the prestige of our cities, bettering the life of those who live and work in them. However, the decision of whether to have a mayor must ultimately rest with local people. That is why our commitment is to create mayors subject to confirmatory referendums. The timing of the referendums is important, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State recognised when he said in the House last week, in response to a suggestion that we would impose mayors,</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/5" class="indent">&quot;of course we will not-that is completely out of the question. The proposals will be subject to referendums.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/6">I can do no more than refer hon. Members who have asked about the timing to what my right hon. Friend said last week. He put it very simply:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Once we know the views of the people in those 12 cities, we will move on to the election of a mayor if people vote for that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/8">I should have thought that that was pretty crystal clear.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-10-27a.126.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40388" speakername="John Leech" colnum="126"  time="015:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101027/halltext/101027h0002.htm#10102747000540">
	<p pid="a.126.2/1">Manchester, Withington) (LD): It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this afternoon, Mr Robertson. I want to start by thanking my hon. Friend the Minister for contacting me in advance of the debate for an indication of the matters that I want to raise on a wide-ranging subject. The title is particularly wide. I also thank the numerous organisations that contacted me with information for the debate and apologise to those whose issues will not be addressed this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/2">In this short debate, I want to make some time available to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40270" name="Rehman Chishti">the Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman Chishti)</phrase>, who wants to say a few words, and to take the opportunity to raise two specific issues, the first of which is lack of awareness among MPs of the issues surrounding funding for the treatment of rarer cancers in general and the lack of understanding of the complex processes and institutions that make decisions about the availability of drugs, especially to sufferers of rarer cancers.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/3">The second, related, topic is the recent health technology appraisal by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of the use of azacitidine for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome. That is a bit of a tongue twister, so I shall refer to it as MDS. NICE's appraisal and decision-making process for azacitidine highlights the problems and inequalities facing sufferers of rarer cancers in getting access to what are often life-saving treatments. NICE's refusal to recognise orphan drug status has created a great disparity in the treatment options for the sufferers of rarer cancers. With the move to value-based pricing not due to come into effect until 2014 and with the lack of details about how it will work, it is essential that that inequality is addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/4">The initial &#163;50 million of funding from the cancer drugs fund has been distributed to the strategic health authorities, and today sees the opening of the consultation on the main cancer drugs fund. I suggest that today is the perfect day to restate the case for far greater funding for rarer cancers.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/5">I start by mentioning the need for MPs to have a greater awareness of rarer cancers, and of the processes and institutions that evaluate the drugs needed to treat them. A number of patients and their family members attended the MDS UK lobby of Parliament yesterday. As part of that lobby, MDS UK launched the results of a survey, which showed that two thirds of MPs had no understanding of the term &quot;health technology assessment&quot;, and one third had no understanding of the term &quot;quality-adjusted life year.&quot; I confess that I was one of those people until I was contacted by MDS UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/6">MPs are expected to have a broad knowledge of many subjects, but we cannot claim, or expect, to have a detailed knowledge of all subjects-some of our constituents may argue that we do not have much knowledge of any subjects. With large-scale reforms of the NHS due to be discussed and voted on, it is vital that MPs gain a greater knowledge of such subjects, and understand how those who suffer from rarer forms of cancer are currently discriminated against.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/7">There is a need for greater awareness about how the details of value-based pricing and decisions on how to allocate the cancer drugs fund may, or may not, remove barriers to treatment for those with rarer cancers. I do not intend to spend any more time on that aspect of the debate, other than to highlight the rarer cancers toolkit collated by MDS UK, which I hope the Minister is aware of and has seen. Although today I am concentrating on MDS, there are other rare cancers such as pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer or mesothelioma that also struggle with either a lack of access to drugs, or with the need to raise awareness among the general public.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/8">I want to mention the fiasco surrounding the NICE appraisal of azacitidine. The process has already taken 18 months and, as a solution is not necessarily assured until March 2011, it may end up being a two-year process in total. In the meantime, up to 1,500 patients will have missed out on the opportunity to access azacitidine during that decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/9">The mishandling of the evidence by the evaluation team, as highlighted by the appeals committee, has not helped. The process is long-winded and ponderous even without an appeal. More worryingly, setting aside the length of time involved, the decision-making process itself is flawed, especially NICE's refusal to recognise orphan drug status. The MDS Forum, the Royal College of Pathology and the British Society for Haematology, which collectively represent the UK's top haematologists, have all written to NICE to highlight the unsuitability of NICE's health technology assessments for considering orphan medicines. Haematologists from centres of excellence across Europe have signed a letter echoing that view. Of the 50 orphan-status drugs that are licensed by the European Medicines Agency, only three have been recommended by NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/10">There is an exceptionally strong case for further reform to the NICE process to ensure that it captures the full value of new and innovative medicines for patients with rarer cancers. It is widely accepted that there are problems with the NICE process and that it is unfair to those who suffer with rarer cancers. Extremely high costs are associated with the research and development of drugs, and the relative lack of expertise means that drugs for rarer conditions cost even more. The fact that some drugs are for small patient groups means that sales are relatively low, and the unit cost of such drugs is incredibly high. Nevertheless, the innovative value added by those drugs is great. They are not &quot;me too&quot; drugs, with a relatively low incremental clinical improvement to the patient compared with the drug that is replaced. Such drugs are unique and often provide the only treatment available to the patient. Azacitidine for MDS is a perfect example. The only alternative to it is usually &quot;best supportive care&quot;, which treats only the symptoms and not the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/11">I do not know why the process cannot be adjusted to take orphan status into account, and I would be grateful if the Minister could address that question in his response. It seems that the UK is almost unique in that decision. The problems with the NICE process are not unknown, and I know that the Minister and his Department are fully aware of them. The decision to move to value-based pricing, and the introduction of end-of-life criteria and patient access schemes are recognition of such problems. However, end-of-life criteria and patient access schemes have not succeeded in making appraisals more flexible to innovative treatments for rarer cancers, especially cancers where the small number of patients eligible to take part in trials means that there is often considerable uncertainty surrounding the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/12">An interesting example of the current problems with NICE's methodology is the fact that even if azacitidine were to be given to the patient for free, its quality-adjusted life year cost would still be &#163;20,000. I do not understand how that can be the case; perhaps the Minister will explain.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/13">Unfortunately, value-based pricing is more than three years away. That will be too late for some patients. Furthermore, the devil will be in the detail as to how the scheme will work and how effective it will be at addressing the needs of small patient groups. In the meantime, short of further reform of the NICE process, the only option for MDS patients and similarly disadvantaged sufferers of other rare cancers is the cancer drugs fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/14">Before I move on to the cancer drugs fund, I urge the Minister to ensure that value-based pricing is constructed in such a way that drugs such as azacitidine become available to UK citizens, just as they are available across the rest of Europe. Azacitidine provides a vast improvement to patient outcomes compared with current treatments, and it is therefore the very definition of &quot;high value&quot;, which value-based pricing must be designed around.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/15">I urge the Department of Health to ensure that the cancer drugs fund is used to help sufferers of cancers such as MDS. MDS is a life-threatening illness and it is terribly served by the NICE process. The only available treatment is currently being denied to patients, and although I hope that NICE reverses its decision, I fear that ministerial intervention may be needed to bring access to azacitidine to MDS sufferers. It is exactly the kind of treatment that the cancer drugs fund was designed to support and must provide for. Of course, MDS sufferers will have to wait even longer while NICE makes its decision, before they are even allowed to apply to the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.2/16">In conclusion, I urge the Minister to ensure that NICE methodology is reformed to make it more suitable for assessing medicines for rarer cancers, or that cancers such as MDS are taken out of the NICE health technology assessment process. I request value-based pricing to be constructed in a way that ensures that innovative drugs with a high benefit to patient outcome, such as azacitidine, are correctly appraised. In the meantime, I ask for the cancer drugs fund to be used to correct the inequality faced by sufferers of rarer cancers due to the disparity in the appraisal process of drugs for those rarer cancers.</p>
