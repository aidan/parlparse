	<p pid="b.1.2/1">I thank you for chairing this debate, Mr. O'Hara, and I thank the Minister for attending. I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> for attending on behalf of the Conservative Front Bench and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> for the Liberal Democrats, as well as other hon. Members from throughout the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/2">This debate is about care homes for the elderly and the problems that they face, particularly with funding. I acknowledge the excellent work done by the Abbeyfield Society, which celebrated its golden jubilee this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/3">In June, in our beautiful cathedral of St. Albans, Abbeyfield residents, volunteer supporters and staff gathered for a service of celebration and thanksgiving for the Abbeyfield Society's 50th anniversary. The headquarters of that champion for the elderly is in my constituency and it provides a valued service in many hon. Members' constituencies. The joyful service of celebration was led by the Bishop of St. Albans, theRt. Rev. Christopher Herbert, in the presence of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who is a patron of the Abbeyfield Society. Baroness Bottomley, who is president of the society, also attended and was resplendent in a golden hat. She works tirelessly on behalf of that wonderful organisation, which is valued by hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/4">Why was the Abbeyfield community created, what needs pressed it into existence and are those needs being met in care homes everywhere? Abbeyfield began in 1956 because, during a visit to Bermondsey, Richard Carr-Gomm became concerned about the number of sad, elderly faces staring fixedly from windows. He was so moved that he resigned his commission with the Coldstream Guards, moved from Chelsea barracks to a bedsit in Abbeyfield road and became a home help. During his visits as a home help he found that loneliness was a problem, so he spent his Army gratuity on a house and invited four lonely people to join him. By Christmas 1956, he was the first Abbeyfield housekeeper.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/5">Today, Abbeyfield leads the way in care homes for the elderly. It is a major player, with around 500 member societies throughout the United Kingdom and more than 800 houses providing accommodation for more than 8,000 residents, involving 10,000 volunteers and serviced by a small staff in my constituency. It acts as a pretty good barometer of the issues affecting all care homes throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/6">The English Community Care Association, of which Abbeyfield is a member, rightly points out that for too long older people have been left off the political agenda. For many older people, moving to a good care home can be a hugely positive experience and a means of increasing independence. For older people who do not have family and friends to visit, a knock on the door can be a terrifying experience. Indeed, Hallowe'en tonight will be a source of much worry for many elderly people throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/7">When struggling to stay in their own home, elderly people sometimes see different domiciliary care workers come and go. Faces change and no one stays around long enough to give real care or, importantly, as Richard Carr-Gomm recognised, companionship. Loneliness, lack of assistance, injuries and poor nutrition are not uncommon for the elderly. The ECCA wants to ensure that no vulnerable people are left alone simply because social services have clocked off. It believes, as I do, that there is no substitute for direct human contact being on offer 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and that that can be provided by an excellent care home system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/8">Before I begin the wider debate on how to ensure that a 24-hour, 365-days-a-year excellent care vision is delivered and address the pressing issues facing all care homes for the elderly, I want to thank the staff, board and volunteers at Abbeyfield who work tirelessly for their residents and who, thanks to their founder Richard Carr-Gomm, strive to deliver that vision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/9">Abbeyfield is a charitable organisation and provides a range of services for older people. It currently offers two main sorts of accommodation for older people&mdash;that is often mirrored in other care systems. It offers supported sheltered housing in which the average age is 85-plus and residents, who live in family-type housing, are supported by the &quot;Supporting People&quot; programme. According to the Government's objectives, that programme, to which I shall return, is supposed to deliver quality of life and to ensure high-quality, strategically planned services. Abbeyfield also offers care homes for residents who need access to 24-hour personal care or nursing care. They often live in relatively small, non-institutional settings and are supported to enable them to retain as much independence as possible. The average age of entry into an Abbeyfield care home is 94-plus. Some residents are self-funding, but others are supported by their local authorities. Funding&mdash;and its inadequacies&mdash;is an issue that recurs again and again with regard to care for the elderly. It is cited by all providers as a source of deep concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/10">If I give some examples of how this issue directly affects the Abbeyfield care system and similar providers, it will become apparent to the Minister how some sectors of our ageing society seem to be perversely disadvantaged by current funding, which can vary hugely from area to area. One example is funding problems in supported sheltered housing. Abbeyfield is not alone in encountering serious issues with the new &quot;Supporting People&quot; contracts, and the viability of its services is seriously threatened, along with the services of many other care home providers. Local authorities, for example, are starting to issue steady state contracts for the provision of &quot;Supporting People&quot; services. The former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, now the Department for Communities and Local Government, advised authorities that within the contract there should be a clause that prohibits providers from recovering from users any moneys for support in excess of the amount agreed within the contract as the price for support. In reality, that means that if the cost of support is greater than the amount that the authority agreed to pay, providers cannot recover those costs from the service user.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.2/11">Staff costs are the largest part of support costs and it is not possible to reduce those costs and maintain a high-quality service. After all, would anyone advocate using poorly trained staff?</p>

	<p pid="b.3.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate on a matter that has been neglected in the House for too long. Does she agree that when county councils have sold off their residential homes to the private sector, which has then ignored the arrangements under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 and sought to reduce the staff pay and conditions by replacing staff with staff from abroad who perhaps do not speak or understand the language well, that has damaged the care of the elderly? Does she agree that we should address that important problem now?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0001.htm#06103157000490">
	<p pid="b.3.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention and will touch on the matter later. He is absolutely right. People often refer to Cinderella organisations that attract poorly trained staff or people who would struggle to find a job in any other system and provide a poor service. That is what happens if prices are pushed down too far. Our elderly people deserve better. If the use of poorly trained staff is advocated, residents might be carelessly or even cruelly treated. As my hon. Friend said, we have heard how less scrupulous care homes try to cut costs to the bone not only with poorly trained staff, but by serving bland, poorly nutritious food that fails to tempt the palate, feed the appetite or deliver a balanced diet, sometimes with fatal consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/2">Abbeyfield provides an excellent service but is facing a dilemma because it and similar organisations are unable to pass costs on to service users, sponsors or relatives, so the only alternative is to close houses, which would put vulnerable people at risk, or even worse. Does the Minister agree that our older people deserve excellence and that it is not possible to have excellence on the cheap? I look forward to hearing his views on that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.3.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" speakername="Mark Williams" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0001.htm#06103157000491">
	<p pid="b.3.2/1">Does the hon. Lady agree that the problems that she has identified are exacerbated in rural areas where the reality of care home closures means that elderly people and their families must travel vast distances to secure the care that they need? One of the great strengths of Abbeyfield is that it provides strong, localised support for the elderly.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.3.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0001.htm#06103157000492">
	<p pid="b.3.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. Richard Carr-Gomm's vision was that Abbeyfield should provide companionship. A vital part of companionship is that people can visit their families. In my constituency there are no national health service beds for care home provision, so families may have to travel long distances to visit their relatives if they are placed with the cheapest possible provider. That can be particularly bad in rural districts.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/2">The advice issued by the DCLG to local authorities is not mandatory, so Abbeyfield and other care home providers are finding huge differences in local interpretation of that advice. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on that. Some administering authorities are insisting that Abbeyfield cannot require payment of money for support from residents beyond the amount paid by the local authority&mdash;that happens in Telford&mdash;whereas other authorities will allow that arrangement. Providers across the spectrum tell me that they need clarity and certainty in funding and I ask the Government to reconsider their advice to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/3">The Royal College of Nursing backed up those concerns when it said,</p>
	<p pid="b.3.3/4" class="indent">&quot;we are particularly concerned about the imparity of costs for care homes. In some areas we know that self-funders are in effect subsidising social service places as local authorities have limits on how much they can pay for care home places.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.4.0/1">I had the good fortune to meet and know Richard Carr-Gomm and I am sure that my hon. Friend agrees that he would be appalled that although in Scotland care provision&mdash;nursing and residential care&mdash;is free, it is not free in England and Wales. Will she say something about that, because it is discrimination against the English?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0001.htm#06103157000494">
	<p pid="b.4.1/1">I am sure that the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench spokeswoman, the hon. Member for Romsey, will have something to say about that. I would not use the word &quot;discrimination&quot;, but there is a lack of parity. Scotland has made that decision and we have not, but there is no reason why we should not move matters further forward than we have.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/2">The provision of all care free at the point of use is an ideal that we all aspire to and agree with if it is affordable. However, our provision falls far below that standard, and we must raise our game. The result of self-funders subsidising social service providers is the limited availability of social services places in any one area. Independent providers struggle to keep their costs low, too. The Royal College of Nursing says that it is</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/3" class="indent">&quot;keen that clear guidance is given for the calculation of costings for care home places so that there is parity amongst what self-funders and social services pay for provision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/4">There is an uneven playing field, and its results hit particularly hard.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/5">If we do not receive any clarity about funding, the closure of some homes is a possibility. Abbeyfield and other excellent care providers would take such a step with the greatest reluctance, but the Minister must recognise that care providers such as Abbeyfield cannot jeopardise the financial viability of their organisation by planning service delivery without a clearly identified source of funding. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views on the realistic funding of care homes and on the need for clarity.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/6">If a home is forced to close for financial reasons, it is stressful not only for staff, but for residents. An article in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> earlier this month included a quotation by Professor David Jolley, a consultant psychiatrist specialising in old age, who said that it is</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/7" class="indent">&quot;an inescapable truism that relocation is a stressful event (for frail elderly people) and can precipitate problems of mental health, physical health and can even bring forward death.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/8">Another psychiatrist, Dr. Peter Jeffreys, rates it as</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/9" class="indent">&quot;only marginally less significant than the death of a spouse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/10">Care homes face particular funding problems. As the Minister knows, self-financing residents are assessed by the local authority, and if they have more than &pound;21,000 they pay full fees themselves, apart from any nursing element. Many must sell their homes to meet the fees, and that is often the source of much distress to the resident and to their families. Indeed, the Wanless social care review led by Sir Derek Wanless said of the social care services in its 2006 report, &quot;Securing Good Care for Older People: Taking a Long-Term View&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/11" class="indent">&quot;There is...widespread dissatisfaction with the current funding system....It often comes as an unwelcome surprise to older people that social care is means tested and that they are expected to rely on their own savings and income until their assets have fallen to the threshold set for state funded care. It is a common complaint that the existing system penalises those who have saved for their old age.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/12">If the elderly have less than &pound;21,000, they may be eligible for local authority support. Local authorities, however, consistently fail to meet the full fees. The resident is not allowed to make up the shortfall, whether it is &pound;5 or &pound;100 a week. If the local authority is asked to meet the shortfall, a common reply is that there may be a cheaper option, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> referred to, and that the resident should move to another home, which is often miles away in a rural district. That is a distressing prospect for all involved, and it can have adverse health implications.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/13">Relatives often have to pay the shortfall or the top-up, but they may be pensioners themselves. Abbeyfield had an 85-year old relative funding the top-up fees for another Abbeyfield resident in care. That cannot be right. Care homes often face contractual constraints. Some authorities may be prepared to meet the shortfall, but others neither meet it nor allow the resident, relative or sponsor to do so, putting the resident and the care home in an impossible position.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/14">Several nationally imposed policies will impact on the costs of running care homes, and local councils and the national health service will have to fund them properly. They must pay particular attention to the minimum wage, proposed increases in statutory annual leave, increases in registration and inspection fees, proposed registration of all care workers, and Criminal Records Bureau and protection of vulnerable adults costs. For example, the 2005 regulatory fees per provider were &pound;1,901, but in 2006 they leapt to &pound;2,186, and registration costs leapt from &pound;518 in 2005 to &pound;596 in 2006. Commission for Social Care Inspection fees increased from &pound;259 to &pound;297, and when we add on increased wages and CRB checks, the bills hugely outstrip an individual home's ability to cover its costs. I look forward to hearing the Minister's views about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/15">Training is vital to maintaining high quality care services and to recruiting and, importantly, retaining capable and caring staff. We need good quality staff in the care industry. For too long, as I have said, it has been considered a Cinderella career that is undertaken by people who have few qualifications and few options. The potential merry-go-round of staff does everybody a disservice, but particularly the residents. Evidence from Laing and Buisson's study for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, entitled &quot;A Fair Price for Care&quot;, shows that the income from statutory purchasers, most notably from local authorities, does not cover the costs that an efficient home incurs to meet regulatory standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/16">Several local costs-of-care exercises carried out throughout the country support that study. In recent years, the result has been widespread home closures and an increased need for residents to seek top-ups before gaining admission to a care home. The Office of Fair Trading's May 2005 study of care homes showed that nationally, 35 per cent. of residents have to top up the care payment that they receive from the council. And that may be a low estimate.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/17">The fear is of a renewed spate of care home closures, and with an ageing population, that would be madness. We must invest in our elderly people; otherwise, residents will experience reduced choice and there will be downward pressure on the quality of service. I look forward to hearing the Minister's assurance that there will be no more care home closures.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/18">We are talking about frail, elderly people in the autumn of their lives. As I said, the average age of entry to a care home is 95. Those people should receive the best appropriate care; they should not be regarded as a throwaway commodity that society can cater for at the lowest possible cost. As a society, we should strive to ensure that the elderly do not miss out, because their voices are not being heard above the clamour of younger voices.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/19">Best value for the taxpayer means that the fee and the quality of care must balance. It would ensure that an individual's needs were met and not just paid lip service to. If we settle for second-rate or poorly funded care homes, we will let down our elderly people. Councils are slow both to acknowledge the rising costs imposed on care homes and to reflect them in the fees paid to care homes. Care homes should not be caught in the middle of a battle over adequate funding between the Government and councils. The Government should provide councils with adequate advice. I look to the Minister today to provide me with information about the steps that the Government are taking to ensure adequate funding and parity of delivery throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/20">If the Government want national policies and the implementation of national standards, they must be correctly funded. Nursing homes often face greater funding problems than care homes. The additional nursing element, which the health authority pays, is prescribed in three bands: high, medium and low. However, it bears no relation to the actual costs of providing person-centred care for individuals in different homes, and it can be widely interpreted, leading to an even greater shortfall in fees. Again, in an attempt to save money, local authorities are sometimes overly restrictive in their interpretation of the criteria.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/21">Ann Abraham, the health service ombudsman, made that critical point in her February 2003 report, when she said that some local criteria</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/22" class="indent">&quot;appeared to be significantly more restrictive than guidance permitted&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/23">It is a cost-saving exercise at the expense of the elderly people, leaving some financially disadvantaged and struggling to meet the fees.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/24">The restrictive application of the criteria can lead to the distressing situation in which one partner in a married couple has their fees paid for nursing care while the other does not. There are no local NHS-funded nursing care places within St. Albans city and district in my constituency, so in theory, couples can be split up and housed in different homes outside the area, depending on whether they need nursing care.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/25">Spousal liability for fees is also a big issue, and I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply. If one is married, one may be seriously disadvantaged under the fee system. A local authority may ask a spouse to refund part or all of its expenditure on providing residential accommodation for their husband or wife. A council can negotiate a liable-relative contribution, even if the liable relative does not wish to supply details of his or her resources. Perversely, however, unmarried couples are not legally liable to maintain one another, even though they may live together as husband and wife. It appears that the maxim, &quot;Don't get married and don't get old,&quot; is very true in our care system.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.0/1">My hon. Friend's speech on the subject, particularly its financial aspects, has been a tour de force, and we are grateful to her. Will she address the issue whereby many old people do not want to go into a home, but want to stay in their own home for as long as they possibly can? Society can enable that by providing technology and communications. The solution is often cheaper and it provides a better quality of life for everyone. Will she ask the Minister to explain what the Government will do to facilitate it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" speakername="Anne Main" colnum="7"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0002.htm#06103157000496">
	<p pid="b.7.1/1">That was not going to be the thrust of today's debate, but my hon. Friend is absolutely right. The age of the people entering the care system indicates that people do not want to go into homes, although, as I have said, it can be a hugely liberating experience for elderly people, particularly if they are rurally isolated and do not have family. We should offer the best system for whatever elderly people want, including facilitating their staying in their own homes with adequate care systems&mdash;not just the occasional pop-in visit, being helped into bed at 4.30 in the afternoon because that is the time slot allocated or being given boring meals that are inappropriately timed or inappropriate for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/2">I wish to focus today on care homes; I do not want to sidetrack the Minister by speaking about care in the community, which is a wider issue for a future debate. The Department of Health has said that it is</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3" class="indent">&quot;planning to repeal the liable relatives rules at the earliest opportunity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/4">I note that no time frame is mentioned, and in the latest edition of the &quot;Charging for Residential Accommodation Guide&quot; the rules continue. I hope that the Minister will update us on the matter today.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/5">In the Abbeyfield Society's golden jubilee year I want to celebrate its excellent work and hold on to the vision of Richard Carr-Gomm, who recognised the plight of lonely, elderly people struggling to stay in their own homes. More importantly I wish to draw the Minister's attention to the funding issues faced by those who enter the care homes system. Such problems may be the death-knell for many excellent care homes, including some of those run by the Abbeyfield Society.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I concur with her sentiment that we speak about nursing homes and care homes far too rarely in the House, so she has brought about an excellent opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/2">I wish to make a couple of points that are pertinent to my constituency. There is tremendous pressureon care and nursing homes because of the debtat the Royal Shrewsbury hospital, which stands at&pound;34 million. As a result, hard-hitting plans are being made to cut a significant number of beds at both major hospitals in Shropshire. As the representative of that area, I wonder to myself what impact that will have on nursing homes and their capacity to deal with extra people. Many of my constituents are concerned about what will happen to their elderly parents as hospitals are told, more and more, to have a quicker turnaround of patients, treat them more quickly and get them back out into society. That has a huge impact, as hospitals do a tremendous amount of work on improving people's health, mental health and other attributes.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/3">I am also concerned about the regulations and red tape that are being imposed on nursing homes. I recently went to the Uplands nursing home in Dorrington, a little village just south of Shrewsbury. I spoke to the lady who runs it, Mandy Thorn. She told me that the regulations and red tape that are being foisted on the home by the Government and the European Union mean that the costs are added to the fees. The elderly patients are forced to pay more because of the burden of regulations. While I was there, a new machine arrived. It is a huge, automated machine for cleaning bedpans and it cost more than &pound;10,000. For years the home had had a very professional way of cleaning bedpans manually, and it has excellent star ratings, but the new regulation has forced it to abandon its practices and have an automated system costing an extra &pound;10,000. Of course, Mrs. Thorn asked me, &quot;Where is that extra money going to come from? It will come from extra charges to the people who are staying here.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/4">She also expressed great concern about the rise in national insurance contributions. For a small business such as the Uplands nursing home, any change to that contribution makes a big impact on the ability to retain staff. Mrs. Thorn said to me, as my hon. Friend has also said, that the work is done not for profit or with a view to making lots of money. The carers do it because they are unique, special people who are prepared to work for little money. Their mentality is that they want to work with people and help them. But at the end of the day, it is difficult to retain staff if someone can earn more by packing shelves at Tesco than by working in a nursing home. People such as Mrs. Thorn cannot afford to pay higher wages when the cost of national insurance contributions is going up.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/5">As my hon. Friend mentioned, there should be a level playing field between private care homes and council-run homes. I will be fascinated to hear what the Government's attitude is on that. Does the Minister believe that in future there should be more council-run and funded care homes, more private care homes or a mix of the two? He looks at me in a bewildered manner, but that is an important question. There is not a level playing field between private care homes and council care homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/6">I also ask the Minister about funding for the institutions in question. Shropshire has an ageing population, and it is very rural. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase>, from Plaid Cymru, has said&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.9.1/1">I beg your pardon. The Liberal Democrat Member said that there are costs for councils in caring for people across a rural area. What extra help are the Government considering giving to such rural areas as Shropshire to deal with that problem in an ageing population? There must surely be a Government strategy to examine areas of England with high concentrations of elderly people and an ageing population, and to give councils in those areas more money than others to deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/2">Social care is means-tested, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans stated. I feel strongly and passionately about the matter, and the only real party political point that I wish to make is that the Government are punishing those who have saved. People in Shropshire are not mega-wealthy.</p>

They always return to the same Labour-Liberal Democrat theory, &quot;Well, the Tories did it more than 10 years ago.&quot; I must inform the hon. Lady that we have not been in power for more than 10 years. Conservative Members of Parliament of my generation, who are in our 30s and barely remember the Thatcher Governments and others, have the right to set our own agenda for this generation of Conservatives.

	<p pid="b.9.4/1">I say to the hon. Gentleman that certain things are so structurally inherent to the ideological and philosophical system created by his Government that their importance is indisputable. The privatisation of large swathes of the residential and nursing sector was a deliberate philosophical and ideological policy of his party when in government. That is the market that exists in residential and nursing care. Means-testing was at the heart of the system that his Government created and set in stone. He cannot simply pretend that the social care system has been created by this Government; its architecture was actually put in place by the Government that he claims to distance himself from.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.6/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> on introducing this debate. She has already declared my interest in that, in succession to Dame Gillian Wagner, my wife is the national president of the Abbeyfield Society. I first visited an Abbeyfield home 30 years ago, in my previous constituency of Woolwich, West&mdash;or Eltham, as it is now called. I am delighted that there are Abbeyfield homes in Worthing, West, as well as two in Ferring.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/2">We should view this debate from the perspective of elderly people. They do not set out to live in an Abbeyfield home or a care home. They want to live and have choices. I pay tribute to the great number of people who manage to look after themselves, someone whom they love and live with, or their neighbours. That network of formal and informal relationships matters. That was brought back to me yesterday when I heard about the not unexpected death of my constituent George Philps; he died peacefully at home after 54 years of marriage. The love and support that George and Shirley gave to each other and to their great circle of friends, most of whom they were helping, is normal and natural.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/3">One of the best tributes that can be paid to the Abbeyfield legacy&mdash;which will continue to bear dividends, if I can put it that way, albeit no doubt with some adaptations&mdash;is that it, too, is natural. I visit people whom I either do not know or knew in their own homes before they became Abbeyfield residents. Their relationships with their direct carers and the trustees who volunteer are also natural relationships.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/4">We ought to see the Abbeyfield society homes in context. If I may be permitted to say a few words about the pattern in my constituency on the south coast, there are some places with dual registration, such as Princess Marina house, which is run by the Royal Air Force benevolent fund, and the St. Bridget's home, which is one of the great Leonard Cheshire establishments for people with particular challenges. The way in which they face those challenges and overcome them is a living miracle. There are also places such as Rustington hall, which people can move into when they are fully able and which provides a spectrum of care. I pay tribute to the residents, staff and trustees there for carrying on making that investment, which is similar to what happens at Gifford house&mdash;the Queen Alexandra hospital home&mdash;where elderly people, mainly from the services, live a good, healthy and happy life, even though some of the physical challenges that they face are pretty significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/5">So Abbeyfield homes do not operate alone, but are part of the continuum, although they provide more natural settings where the number of people living together is relatively small. They are truly homes, as I have seen going round as the driver during this 50th anniversary year.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/6">Incidentally, I pay tribute to those who organised the cathedral services, which have been marvels to be part of, although I have not been able to go to as many as the golden hatter. The experience has been enjoyable, as was the theatrical performance in the west end of London one Sunday evening, when people came from all over the country to enjoy being together and to raise funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/7">The challenges that the Government face are not new and they will not go away. The financial dispute and discussion can continue. I want to confine myself to one significant point. When I took a home in my current constituency, there was a man who lived two floors above me and who had helped us to spot the block. He told me, &quot;By the way, I vote Liberal,&quot; to which I replied, &quot;Well, nobody's perfect.&quot; After about three weeks he told my wife that he was going to help me by voting Labour&mdash;in practice, if everyone in my constituency who wanted to vote Labour did so, they would probably drive the Liberals into third place, although that is a separate point. After six months he said that he was going to vote for me, although he would not necessarily vote Conservative. I explained to him that we accepted votes from those who are not political, as well from those who are. We asked why he had decided to vote for me, and he said that he had lived in that block of six flats for six years, but that he had spoken more with Virginia and me in the six months that we had been there than he had with all his other neighbours. Yet we are at Westminster much of the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/8">It is that level of isolation that is the worry. It is the isolation of an elderly man with a white stick whom I saw late one winter night wandering around near the A27. I stopped to ask whether he was trying to cross that rather dangerous road and he said no, he was going for a walk, as he did every evening. He said that he wished that he was dead, so I said, &quot;Tell me a bit more about it, if you like.&quot; He told me that his wife had died four years ago, that he was looking after himself and that he really did not think that there was much point in going on. I asked him whether he had served in the forces. He said that he had, so I said, &quot;Are you in touch with your local ex-service association?&quot; He replied, &quot;I don't think that they'd want me to be with them, because I'm blind and I don't find it easy to participate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/9">It is that withholding of participation and that isolation, which my neighbour also felt, that we need to keep on recognising. It is all right being with those who are in society one way or another&mdash;those who go dancing, go to the luncheon clubs or are out and about, so to speak&mdash;and with those who still have somebody to care for them. One of the great advantages of the Abbeyfield Society system is that people will notice if somebody else is feeling under the weather or unwell, or if they do not turn up. It is that noticing of humanity that matters as much as the pound notes. It matters as much as the arguments over regulation or over who invented what system and what can be done to improve it.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/10">Of course we must pay tribute to those who provide domiciliary care. Most of us will have experience of that in our extended families and networks of people who receive significant personal support in their own homes. However, in that continuity of provision and width of experience, having someone who notices whether a person is looking cheerful or miserable and who can interact with them can make a difference. My wife once shocked someone by saying to a group of widows and widowers, &quot;I suppose the real thing about being left on your own is that there's no one you can be rude to.&quot; If one is rude to one's neighbours, they will not necessarily make it up by supper. It is people sharing those feelings, saying them out loud and recognising that they can build a future together that matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.6/11">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member forSt. Albans and particularly to the Abbeyfield Society people for the contributions that they have made that have touched the lives of so many people&mdash;not just residents, but those who are with them.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> on securing this important debate. The fact that I shall probably disagree with her on a couple of things does not diminish my congratulations in any way; she has a real interest and commitment to the issues involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/2">I am very honoured to have an Abbeyfield home in my constituency. I must admit that I have never thought of it as a care home, because it strikes me as more of a community. Most of the residents in Romsey Abbeyfield are mobile and do not require any sort of care, but have reached a stage in their lives of needing the company of others, which is provided by the communal nature of the home, and a little bit of looking after such as cooking and cleaning.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/3">In some ways, the daily responsibilities of life are taken away from them, but the residents are all very active. They walk into town and engage with the community; they also provide the best cakes of any home in the constituency. I learned with great sadness that the home's housekeeper, Pam, had died recently. She was much loved by all the residents in what is a real home from home. The residents are also not averse to getting out the sherry bottle when the local Member of Parliament visits, which is unusual in my experience.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">The hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> made an important point about isolation. My local Abbeyfield provides the company of others. Residents can go to their own rooms, but it is interesting how many of them prefer to interact and mingle in the communal areas. When we get older, choice is very important. I fully agree that the vast majority of older people do not want to go into any sort of home or institutional setting.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/5">However, this debate is not about domiciliary care. Recent research by the Commission for Social Care Inspection&mdash;I say &quot;recent&quot;, but it is probably a year old by now&mdash;showed that, although the vast majority of older people wanted to stay at home, a significant number thought that a care home was the appropriate place to be at the end of their days. I worry sometimes that there seems to be a mantra that home is good and care home is bad; we need a range of provision for the range of needs out there.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/6">I probably started visiting care homes regularly in about 1997; I was the town mayor and the habit has stuck. One of the things that I have found slightly depressing during those nine years is the significant deterioration that I have noticed in the health of people in care homes. People in care homes who were once fairly mobile now require a lot more personal care, and I would contend that some years ago people now in nursing homes would probably have been in a hospital setting. I do not think that such a setting is necessarily the right place, but there has been a significant shift.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/7">Funding has been touched on in this debate. The hon. Member for St. Albans raised the problems with supported sheltered housing, so I shall not repeat them, although I fully agree with her. The issue of top-ups is very fraught. Some people are happy to make a choice, so that they go to a local home or one that has the ethos that they prefer. In our multicultural society, it is interesting to see that homes are run by various different faith groups. That is important, because care staff who are not aware of cultural differences can upset or offend older people; such awareness, particularly in areas with less diversity, is not as great as it could be.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/8">There inevitably comes a stage in any person's or couple's journey at which there is simply no money left to carry on providing top-ups, and decisions about what will be funded have to be made. Almost invariably, especially in constituencies such as mine, in the south&mdash;and, I suspect, those of many hon. Members here today&mdash;the cost of nursing homes is much higher than the local authority grants. As has been stated, the individuals themselves are not allowed to top up, although they may have savings and wish to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/9">There are other problems when the threshold at which a person becomes eligible for local authority funding is reached. The individual in the care home may have to move, but the funding also impacts if there is a married partner who does not have an individual pension; a fairly modest house can have substantial outgoings these days. Recently, I have come across a worrying number of people whose partner is in a care home and who simply do not know how they will survive financially. On occasions, we are not good at taking the whole picture into account. However much people in such situations are reassured that they are not going to lose their homes, for those who have always paid their debts and been used to paying their own way, their predicament is very real. That is greatly underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/10">In the past couple of elections, Liberal Democrats stood on a manifesto of free personal care for the elderly, following the recommendation of the Sutherland commission. The commission made many recommendations. To their credit, the Government acknowledged and honoured most of them, but they ignored the one that I have mentioned, claiming that money was put into the system in other ways and more people were being funded under their system. I am not sure how that works out, because I have not noticed it happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/11">In nursing homes, a lot of people have conditions, such as Alzheimer's, that most regard as health-based. Such people are often doubly incontinent and cannot look after themselves in any shape or form, yet they are described as requiring personal rather than nursing care. People in that situation are often forced into a battle to secure continuing care funding under the NHS programme. To be honest, most people do not have the energy or strength, or an advocate, to fight that battle for them. As has been said, one of the problems is that each local authority has drawn up different criteria. Anybody looking at those criteria would probably be shocked, because they are very subjective. It is very easy to put somebody into a personal care category and deny that they have a health need. I gather that the Government were aware of the problem and that meetings have taken place about producing national guidelines. It would be helpful if the Minister updated us on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/12">Staffing has been mentioned. The tone was that some staff attracted to work in care homes were of low quality. I am fairly sure that that was not the intention, but I agree that working in a care home has low status. Somebody probably has more kudos in the community if they look after pets in the local veterinary surgery than if they look after older people. It is damning of our society that we do not value or fund roles in care homes. The point that the local authority contribution is so low that it is difficult to fund the staff, provide adequate training and jump through all the other hoops to meet the standards was well made.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.1/1">The Conservative back-out is, &quot;We are reviewing policy,&quot; and that is true in this case for my party, which has a health policy working group. The early signs are that we are committed to keeping the policy, but we are doing more work before we finally announce it. We introduced it in Scotland, where we are in a joint Administration with Labour, and it has worked well. It costs slightly more than anticipated, so we are redoing our sums, as any responsible party would. I hope that the Minister will concede that the policy has been well received and is popular in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.3/1">As health care in Scotland is a devolved matter, I am not fully familiar with all the details of what is happening there, but I will find out, as that would be useful information. We are revisiting the Scotland experience to try to iron out some of the problems before we introduce our new policy, and I do not believe that hon. Members would expect us to do anything else.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.3/2">I was discussing funding. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> claimed that areas with a high number of older people do not receive adequate funding, and I agree entirely. At the Health Committee a couple of weeks ago, we heard evidence from some academics&mdash;they have the time to investigate such matters&mdash;that age is not fully taken into account in the funding formula, and areas with a high proportion of older people but relatively low deprivation do not receive a fair amount compared with areas with a relatively young population but more deprivation. I cannot predict what the Select Committee will recommend, but the evidence that we took was persuasive, and I hazard a guess that it will make a strong recommendation on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.3/3">A problematic aspect of care homes that has not been mentioned is managing medication. It is part of the national minimum standards, but the Commission for Social Care Inspection stated this year:</p>
	<p pid="b.15.3/4" class="indent">&quot;The management of medication in care homes is one of the most important aspects of care for some of the most vulnerable people in this country. Homes are not placing enough importance on this critical area of care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.15.3/5">In fact, there is a lack of joined-up thinking. The national service framework for older people states that patients over 75 years old taking four or more medicines should have a medication review every six months, and patients on fewer than four medicines should have a review at least once year. There was a chance to enshrine that in the GP contract and ensure that GPs had quality and outcomes framework points for providing the service, but the standard in the contract is different from the standard in the NSF. It would be helpful if the Minister explained why, as I have never managed to obtain an adequate answer on the subject. Is the long-term aim to move to standards that are the same in the NSF and the GPs' contract, and, if not, why not?</p>
	<p pid="b.15.3/6">The other aspect of the problem is that pharmacists in the community are now paid for performing medicine use reviews. If medicines management is so poor in care homes, surely there is an opportunity for joining up the two so that medication in care homes is better managed.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.3/7">Some people could be taking a considerable number of medicines. A survey conducted in 2002 by the Parkinson's Disease Society showed that, on average, people with Parkinson's disease took at least five different medicines a day, and some were prescribed 15 or more to be taken three or four times a day. It is difficult for people to keep track of them, and there are bound to be interactions when so many medicines are being taken. I hope that the Minister takes the matter seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.3/8">I shall draw my remarks to a close. I look forward to hearing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> explain how the Conservatives will fund their new-found concern about means testing and how their manifesto might change at the next election.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.0/1">I beginby congratulating my hon. Friend the Member forSt. Albans (Anne Main) on securing this important and timely debate, and on her outstanding opening speech. It set the tone for what has been an important and good debate. Her comments on the Abbeyfield Society and its care homes were right, and I wish to associate myself and the official Opposition with her remarks. The society's golden jubilee year has been a wonderful year of celebration, and it was an inspiration to us all to hear how Richard Carr-Gomm had such a driving motivation to care for others and to put others before himself. That is wonderful, particularly in t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">his day and age. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> highlighted that with the advantages of modern society, it is often easy to overlook the pressures that come of isolation and loneliness.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/2">I have many close family members who have been involved in the sector for many years. Independence, security, dignity and companionship are the four pillars upon which we should seek to build policy for our older people. We must be sensitive in those areas on the basis that our society is ageing, and we will have many more people growing into their older years who have a variable set of needs and opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/3">I know the Abbeyfield well, more particularly in the Lake district through close family connections. It does an outstanding job. I am familiar with its connections in Cheshire, although not in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/4">I also take this opportunity to congratulate ny hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on his interesting contribution and on his dedication to the sector. We are discussing people who are at one end of the life spectrum, but he and his wife have recently become the parents of a new baby girl, Alexis. I am sure that the House will join me in congratulating him.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/5">I was also touched by the remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West about the lifetime dedication of George Philps, his constituent who recently passed away. His experience demonstrates what I believe we all aspire to: lifelong companionship and mutual dependence.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/6">In her opening speech, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans set the scene well, and now it is incumbent on us to get to the nub of the issue, which is funding&mdash;the harder, grungier issue that is always more difficult to discuss than the easier, softer issues&mdash;but that is where this debate lies. Whatever the Minister may think about the funding of long-term care, it is clear that the Government have dodged the issue for the 10 years that they have been in office. The Minister and his colleagues have had 10 years to deal with the problem but, despite so obviously and violently despising everything that took place under a previous Government 15 to 20 years ago, it has taken 10 years for him simply to refer to the fact that he does not like what took place all that time ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/7">We know that the Prime Minister, just before the 1997 election, bemoaned the fact that people had to sell their homes to fund their long-term care, yet we have not seen any policies brought forward by Government to combat that continuing pressure and problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/8">At the last election&mdash;it was interesting that the spokesperson for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase>, alluded to this&mdash;the Conservative party offered a substantive policy on long-term care funding&mdash;the so-called limited liability model. That is something that we are now reviewing carefully and that we were pleased to offer. It is a possibility; I do not know the outcome yet and it would be wrong of me to prejudge it, but we are certainly considering whether the model needs tweaking to move it more to a partnership model, which is now advocated. The Government commissioned Sir Derek Wanless's admirable report, and we look forward to their response. So far, their response has been to commission another zero-based review.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/9">Interestingly, the Liberal Democrats proposed free personal care, as was confirmed by the hon. Lady. That is of course a policy that hides the reality, which I think is admitted, that an individual still bears the &quot;hotel costs&quot; of accommodation and food. The Government were even more brazen in their manifesto, merely crafting the words that they would</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/10" class="indent">&quot;continue to provide healthcare free in long-term care establishments.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.16.0/11">It has never been disputed that health care in the NHS will remain free under either party in government. The phrase simply begs the question of what on earth they were thinking of that might have been the alternative. Maybe the Minister has an answer to that, but it seemed to me to be a particular non-promise.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.1/1">Given the time constraints and the fact that I have not quite finished with the Liberal Democrats anyway, perhaps the hon. Lady would like to wait.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.1/2">The key is that the manifesto commitments failed to address all the issues of the hotel and social care costs linked to long-term care. We need that sort of understanding.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.1/3">It has been reported to me, although the hon. Lady might want to suggest that it is a misquote, that at the last Liberal Democrat conference&mdash;amazingly, I was not there&mdash;the hon. Lady called her party's policy of free personal care &quot;dishonest&quot;, because people thought that their accommodation costs would also be paid for, which is certainly not the case. In many parts of Scotland, despite the policy as it stands, many local authorities and local NHS organisations have not funded the promise and that is not happening for many elderly and vulnerable people in Scotland. In the coalition in the Scottish Executive, both the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats are increasingly embarrassed and say little about that policy. I hope that the Minister will deal with that and the hon. Lady will do so, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.2/1">The hon. Gentleman has quoted me correctly. I think that we should have been more open about what our policy did. That is how I prefer to do things; it is not how the people who wrote the manifesto try to do things. Will he accept that with the constant battle between health and social care funding, there has been an insidious creep to push funding into social care? It is not clear that the NHS funds that have been diminished have been transferred to the social care budget accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="b.18.5/1">Thank you. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">The right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/2" class="indent">&quot;Too often the complex needs of many vulnerable people have taken second place to a system plagued by boundaries, barriers and turf wars. They become trapped in a no-mans land between health and social services. They are not getting the help they should.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/3">It took until 2005 for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase> to announce a joint White Paper designed to deliver integrated health and social care systems, which was merged with the health White Paper to produce &quot;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&quot;, which contains a paucity of any measures on closing the gap between health and social care funding. As importantly, the initiatives that it does suggest are under threat because of massive NHS deficits. We heard the example of the Royal Shrewsbury hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/4">The temptation to shift costs on to local authorities has been too hard to resist for many PCTs. The County Councils Network, in its response to the White Paper on health and social care, said that</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/5" class="indent">&quot;we still have some concerns that in practice joint working might be undermined by the budgetary difficulties being faced by a number of PCTs and hospital trusts. This has in some areas already marred pooled budget arrangements as part of Local Area Agreement...arrangements and has significant implications for partners of health services. These pressures are further compounded by the additional challenge of health services releasing people with higher level of dependency into the care of social care services, due to their budgetary pressures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/6">We had, of course, the well-reported story of the NHS's removing &pound;3 million of Wiltshire county council's income one day before this financial year started. Those issues are incredibly important and need to be addressed because the budgetary pressures are now having a major distorting effect on the debate about the overall strategy of funding for long-term care.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/7">We also have the issue of continuing care funding. In its response to the health and social care White Paper, the County Councils Network said that concerns about PCT cost shifting</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/8" class="indent">&quot;have been exacerbated by the ongoing debate about NHS Continuing Health Care, following the Grogan Judgement. The proposed national criteria have been reported as indicating a transfer of costs from the NHS to Local Authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/9">Last week the Government sent to strategic health authorities a document entitled &quot;NHS Continuing Healthcare: Transitional Arrangements Following NHS Reorganisation and Pending National Framework Implementation&quot;. Paragraph 20 states that</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/10" class="indent">&quot;SHAs will need to review their inherited criteria&mdash;all of which should be Grogan compliant...&mdash;over a reasonable period after 1st July 2006 with a view to establishing a single set of criteria for their area. In deciding what is a reasonable period, SHAs will want to have regard to...the likelihood and timescale for new criteria being introduced on a national basis (the 'National Framework'). The longer the period is likely to be, the more reasonable it will be for the SHA to review and amalgamate its own criteria in the interim&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/11">That is truly bizarre. The Department of Health is putting together the national framework, and so only it knows what the likelihood and time scale will be. The paragraph goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/12" class="indent">&quot;If changes were to be substantial and affect the way in which services are provided, wider consultation may be required.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/13">Surely that is what the Government have already done in their consultation that was launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June</phrase> and is now closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/14">We are entitled to ask what on earth is going on. Why is there this stasis? I am sure the Minister will deny it, but is it because everyone is waiting until Gordon gets the job? But will the Minister tell us at least, if not the hard-working NHS staff, when he expects the national framework to be published?</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/15">What assurance has the Minister for the House, the public and the councils on whose budgets the burden will fall that the national framework will not be used to raise the bar on eligibility for NHS continuing care? He owes all the participants and patients that assurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/16">Finally, I want to draw the Minister's attention to staffing issues faced by care homes. The first question, because the status issue is so important, is about the registration of domiciliary care workers. My concern is that Ministers are pressuring for registration to take place without recognising the moves forward that have been made in regulation since 1997. The Commission for Social Care Inspection already inspects agencies and homes that employ domiciliary care workers to ensure that they follow minimum standards and there are Criminal Records Bureau checks, referencing, face-to-face interviews and induction training. In addition we have the protection of vulnerable adults&mdash;POVA&mdash;list. Not only will the move increase bureaucracy in an already overburdened sector, but it will represent a cost that I fear will be passed on to the carer, who might only work a couple of days a week and can ill afford the cost. We must not resort to burdensome regulation, however much we agree that the status of social care workers must be raised. The money would be better spent on training and a recognition of the sector through greater professionalism.</p>
	<p pid="b.18.5/17">I hope that the Minister says whether he will provide funds for registration of social care workers with the General Social Care Council. I hope that he will address those important and detailed issues as well as the overall strategy for funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the hon. Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase>, not only on securing this debate but on how she presented her case. She spoke genuinely about the needs of older people and the responsibility that a civilised and decent society has to ensure that they have access to choice and quality, and on the whole she resisted making petty party political points.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">The only problem, as the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> said, is that although it is good to say incredibly nice, positive and caring things that would unite hon. Members on all sides of the House, some difficult and challenging debates are necessary on the future financing of the social care system, particularly in the context of changing demographics and the rising expectations of older people and their families. We all share the hon. Lady's passion about our primary duty to ensure that older people receive the kind of dignity and independence that they have a right to expect. At the end of the day, it is they who built this country; they have made a massive contribution to enabling this country to be as good and successful as it is. We therefore have a serious and solemn duty to ensure that, whatever our political views, we offer older people the kind of support network that they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/3">I, too, pay tribute to the Abbeyfield Society; its 50th anniversary is a special moment. It is a special organisation given the ethos that underpins the way in which it seeks to offer support to older people. We sometimes pay tribute to organisations simply because they exist; rather, we should pay tribute to those that seek to provide high quality, dignified, responsive and personalised support, particularly for older people. I am happy to endorse Abbeyfield; it is an excellent example.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/4">In my constituency, an organisation called Heathlands provides a similar range of residential and nursing care, with extra care support, for older people. One needs only to visit that establishment to experience a sense of quality, and of family and support. Onecan also sense that people can have autonomy, independence and dignity even in a care setting. Those are the challenges that we face.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/5">I shall not reel off the list of resources that the Government have put in to extra care housing in recent years. It speaks for itself; it is on the record. A tremendous amount of money has been put in, not only by the Department of Health but through the Housing Corporation's approved development programme, which is a major investment in the extra care housing agenda. We are proud of the work that we have done to reflect the changing needs of older people and changing expectations; the care that we should offer people at the beginning of the 21st century will be very different from what we were offering 10, 15 or perhaps 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/6">I turn to what was said by the hon. Member for Eddisbury&mdash;the fun part of the debate, in which we need to talk politics. The rewriting of history on his fantasy island cannot be allowed to stand. I do not disagree with all that the Conservative Government did; in fact, much of the community care legislation that followed the Griffiths report is to be applauded. It said that our modern society needs to recognise that an increasing number of older people will want to stay in their own homes&mdash;that they will want to be supported within the community rather than remaining in some form of residential care. That legislation was incredibly important in shifting the balance and in moving resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/7">At the heart of that community care legislation was the requirement to assess people before it was determined that they should go into residential care. Basing those assessments on need was an important step forward; if we are honest, in all sorts of cases older people were being put in inappropriate settings because that was what relatives or professionals had decided for them. I welcome many of the principles that underpin the community care changes brought in by the Conservative Government in the early 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/8">However, we should not forget some of the market realities that were imposed at the same time. One was the requirement that local authorities should spend between 75 and 80 per cent. of their resources specifically in the independent sector. Why did the Tory Government insist on that? They did it to support their political backers in the private residential and nursing home sector, to ensure that their businesses would not only continue but would take over a greater share of the market.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.1/1">I shall provide detailed evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/2">The Tory Government created an uneven playing field, so it became financially unviable for most local authorities to continue being in-house providers of residential care to older people. Some local authorities retained an element of in-house provision, which was important as it let them keep some control over market forces. In many other areas, however, we saw the wholesale privatisation of the residential care sector; it was the result of the uneven playing field that the Tory Government deliberately created to support their friends and political supporters in the private residential care sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> raised that question, but he ought to reflect on why we saw the massive privatisation of that market&mdash;whether for good or for bad. I have never been ideological about it; I have seen many privately run nursing and residential homes that provide excellent quality care. It is not an ideological statement, but we must not be dishonest about the history of how that market developed.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.2/1">Mine is a brief intervention, because I want some answers from the Minister. The Verulam House nursing home in St. Albans would love to provide national health nursing home bed care, but it is not allowed to do so because the national health service has bought beds out of the constituency. The private system is complementary. It is not a fight. We can have both systems working together. All we ask is that we have a level playing field on funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.3/1">I agree entirely. We should not be ideological about it, just because a home is in the private sector; many of them provide excellent quality care. My point is that the market was deliberately distorted in the 1990s. As a result, many local authorities could not continue to provide direct residential care; they had no choice but to put it out to the private sector. That was an ideologically driven policy; it was not about the needs of older people. To some extent, the market today reflects that direction of travel. It would be disingenuous of me not to acknowledge that in a debate about the range of providers of residential care.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.4/1">The point I was making is that today will be a wasted opportunity if the Minister gets bogged down in backward-looking ideological arguments about ownership&mdash;whether private or public. That is not what today's debate is about. It is about the quality of care and quality of life for elderly residents in care homes, and how we fund it.</p>

	<p pid="b.22.5/1">The hon. Gentleman himself raised the matter of the transfer of staff to the private sector and the protection of their rights. Let us not pretend that I introduced the subject. We cannot consider the nature of the social care market without considering what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/2">The hon. Member for Eddisbury made a series of political points, and I am entitled to respond to them. The Conservative party presided over and developed a means-tested system and it does not propose changing it. The Tory Government slashed local authority funding. I, as a local Member, spent year after year presiding over damage limitation to deal with those cuts. The Conservative party has given no commitment on additional funding for social care. Indeed, if one considers its rhetoric on tax cuts and the new economic test, billions of pounds less will be available for public services. <i>[Interruption.]</i> As a Minister, I am entitled to raise the dividing lines and the realities of what political parties are saying, and what they are doing and are willing to do, in terms of the care of older people in our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/3">On staffing issues, the hon. Member for Eddisbury raised questions about the registration of the wider work force. That says a lot about how he regards the status of some of the people who work in social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">The hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> made a number of very important points. She said that it should not be a choice between staying at home or going into residential care and that we need more choice so that older people have access to a range of provisions. I entirely agree. However, we also have to be honest with the sector and with society. We have moved towards a system where more older people are supported and make the choice to remain in their homes or in a community setting, and as my generation makes that choice, more and more people will want to remain in their homes or in a community setting, which has major implications for the future role of care homes. It does not mean that there will not be a need for care homes&mdash;there will always be a need for high quality care homes&mdash;but to pretend that the move towards people staying in their own homes for longer periods does not have a significant impact on the residential care market is dishonest. We have to work with residential homes and with the sector to consider what its role will be in the future and in this new world where more and more people will want to remain in their own homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/5">Regarding the Derek Wanless report, I say to the hon. Lady that it was not a Government report; it was an independent report and one that I highly respect and welcome&mdash;an excellent piece of work by Sir Derek. He rejected the notion of free care and Scottish authorities, as has been said in this debate, are finding it increasingly difficult to sustain the funding model. Most revealingly of all in this debate, the hon. Lady said that, although it is no longer the policy because it is being reviewed, she regrets that her party misled the electorate at the last election by the way that it wrote its manifesto on the question of personal care.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/6">Frankly, I have never heard such an admission in this Chamber involving a Front-Bench spokesperson who, on such a sensitive and emotive issue, acknowledges that at the last election, her party set out to mislead the British people on this issue. I say to the hon. Lady that we will look at their next manifesto with great interest in terms of whether we ought to believe it or not when the Liberal Democrat Front-Bench team can undermine it and make it clear that people were misled.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/7">The hon. Lady raised the question of the requirement for people to sell their own homes. Actually, this Government have introduced a change to deferred liability that means that no older person has to sell their home to move into care. That was something that the previous Government resisted over many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/8">The hon. Members for Eddisbury and for Romsey raised the issue of the national guidance on continuing care. We have conducted a consultation on that and after analysing the responses we have had, will in the near future publish that national guidance.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">The hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase>&mdash;if he is not right honourable I am sure the new, cuddly, friendly leadership will put it right&mdash;made some very sensible points. He drew attention to the role of carers who do a tremendous job in society by looking after the people they love; partners, parents, friends, family members and neighbours. There are millions of carers and as a society we started to realise the need for legislation in the early 1990s, but this Government has moved that forward by recognising the distinct emotional and practical needs of carers as oppose to the people they care for. A lot of progress has been made and we pay tribute to the role of carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/10">I say to the hon. Gentleman that our thoughts across the political divide are with the family of George Philps&mdash;he was clearly a remarkable man and to be raised in a parliamentary debate he must have had a massive impact on the hon. Gentleman's experience. We pay tribute to him and our thoughts are with his family. The hon. Gentleman raised the question of isolation and loneliness, as did the hon. Member for Romsey and other hon. Members. I have a strong view on that. The words &quot;independence&quot; and&quot;autonomy&quot; are consistently used in debates on social care, but the word &quot;interdependence&quot; is rarely used. Everybody here is interdependent on their friends, neighbours or family and on contact with each other. In a debate about the future of social care we also need to have regard to the question of interdependence and the dependence that we have on other people. The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point that that is important as well as stressing independence.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> made a number of points, particularly on decisions by the NHS to reduce beds and the knock-on effect that has on community services and social care in local authorities. The national health service should not be doing that willy-nilly; it should be consulting and engaging with local authorities before making those decisions and where it is not doing so, it should put that right. It is not for Government to interfere in local decisions made by the national health service to meet the needs of the local health and social care economies, but it is right to put it on record that the NHS should properly engage with and consult local authorities when decisions are made that will have an impact on social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.5/12">The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of regulation and red tape. The Conservative party has too often taken a blanket negative approach towards the concept of regulation, as though all regulation is bad. Regulation has raised standards and improved quality. It is important to recognise that where there are unintended consequences of bad regulation, we do something about it. If specific examples of that can be brought to my attention, I am more than happy to raise those directly with the regulator and to investigate whether there is something we can do to change it. However, we should be honest about the benefits that regulation has brought to protecting vulnerable people, raising standards and improving quality in many of our care establishments. The regulatory regime has played an incredibly important part in that.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.1/1">I am not saying that at all&mdash;it is part of the process. The hon. Gentleman asked about the registration of the wider social care work force and we are considering that whole issue. It seems that the hon. Gentleman talked about status and I have made specific announcements about what we intend to do to raise the status of social care and those who work in it. Looking at the wider work force, if we say they should be consigned to a second-rate status, that does not give out the right messages in terms of social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/2">The hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham fell into the usual trap. He complained about the increases in national insurance and the impact that had on providers of residential care. The increase in national insurance went directly to pay for the massive extra investment that this Government have made in the national health service. We accuse the Conservatives of opposing that and they do not like it. The hon. Gentleman is now moaning that we have put national insurance up so we can massively expand the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/3">We all aspire towards a system for older people that has personalisation, dignity and independence at the heart of it. There will be an enhanced role for individual budgets as we transfer more power and control from providers to individuals and their families. There are also major challenges, as the Wanless report identified, such as demographics and rising public expectations. We have to address those issues as we seek to create a social system and a system of care for older people that is fit for purpose in the 21st-century. This Government intend to address that massive public challenge.</p>

	Reading Recovery Programme

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.26.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="26"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0004.htm#06103157000531">
	<p pid="b.26.1/1">In my city of Nottingham last year, nearly one in eight 11-year-olds were unable to read the first lesson at secondary school. That is one of the main causes of educational underachievement, exclusions, low attainment, truancy and poor results, yet that social blindness is a wholly preventable disease. The consequences go far wider than education. It may lead to a lifetime of massively expensive antisocial behaviour, ill health, poor skills and job prospects and drug abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/2">I refer hon. Members to the work of Heckman, the Nobel-prize-winning economist, done for the Scottish Executive on the economic return on investment in education at different ages in a child's life. He shows very clearly that the earlier we invest, the more we get for our money. I am happy to supply hon. Members with more details of that work if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/3">One study found that a quarter to a third of 10-year-olds who exhibited antisocial behaviour had a specific reading difficulty. Forty-eight per cent. of the prison population read poorly. Twenty-five per cent. of juveniles in custody have a reading age below that of the average seven-year-old, and so on. We are talking about needlessly broken and wasted lives, but the answers cannot be found through educational remedies alone. Incidentally, I welcome the fact that colleagues from all parties are here today. I intend this to be a wholly non-partisan debate; the subject is too serious for point scoring. I am delighted to see those colleagues and I hope that they will chip in to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/4">The broader causes of the problem have to be addressed by much more effective long-term social policy, focusing on prevention, pre-emption and early intervention. In fact, that is the motto of my local strategic partnership. All the local experts in Nottingham agree. Professor Colin Harrison, who is professor of literacy studies at Nottingham university, states:</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/5" class="indent">&quot;In my view the greatest single strategy the government could adopt to improve literacy standards nationally would be to support parents and carers in these vital first years, developing the excellent work done by the Sure Start programme, and extending it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/6">By the age of four, a professional's child will have heard 50 million words. A working-class child will have heard 30 million. A child on welfare will have heard less than a quarter of the words heard by a professional's child; 12 million words will have been addressed to the child on welfare.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/7">Hart and Risley were amazed at how well their measures of accomplishments at age three predicted language skills at the ages of nine to 10. They concluded that school had added little value after the age of three; it was already too late. That is another argument for early intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/8">Dr. Paul Thompson of Nottingham university, once a local head teacher, summed up the situation:</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/9" class="indent">&quot;It is intervention for very young children from poor families that is crucial in raising levels of reading achievement. Children under the age of three need intensive interaction with teachers to make up for what they are not getting at home.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/10">Nottingham city council's children's services director, Edwina Grant, who with her team and with teachers battles these problems every day, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/11" class="indent">&quot;We know that children in Nottingham enter early education with attainment levels well below national expectations, particularly in speaking and literacy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/12">That is the raw material that people have to deal with in trying to make progress on educational attainment. When I started, I intended us to have a debate on reading recovery, but I have come rapidly to a different debate about early intervention, for the two are inextricably linked.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/13">Some of the interventions needed are obvious. Locally, poor parenting skills can be addressed by early intervention with mothers of children aged zero to two. An example is the nurse-family partnership, which is being promoted, thankfully, through the Government's social exclusion policy. Our local education authority and the local strategic partnership, One Nottingham, which I chair, have together put an extra &pound;1 million into the teaching of social behaviour in primary schools, building on social and emotional aspects of learning&mdash;the SEAL programme&mdash;which is rolling out and will soon go to secondary level, I am glad to say. That will help to equip individuals to choose when they have children and, when they themselves are parents, enable them to raise their nought to five-year-olds to be school-ready, rather than starting 10 paces behind the rest.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/14">There is a distinct lack of joining up, however. I am told that, locally, the number of health visitors has dropped to its lowest since 1998. Starting pay for newly qualified health visitors is now set lower than it was previously, and there will be no incentive for nurses with valuable experience to consider entering that part of the profession and working with young people and their parents. Health visitors, community nurses and midwives are keys to the parenting agenda. They have the skills to make assessments of families and their needs. They introduce the Bookstart scheme to families and encourage parents to spend time with their children introducing them to books. For some families in my constituency, that may not be a priority. Domestic violence and child protection feature highly in Nottingham, North, and much of the health visitors' time is taken up with addressing those issues. That is all the more reason why they should have some focus and some assistance when it comes to the development of parenting skills</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/15">Other bits of joining up are necessary. Adult basic skills must be properly funded by the Learning and Skills Council. In Nottingham, we must resist the short-sighted proposals to close and asset-strip the only further education base in the UK's most educationally deprived constituency&mdash;my own, Nottingham, North. We must link community-based training much more to our local learning centres. Sure Start, which has been an absolute boon for people who live on the outer estates that I represent, must none the less reach out even further to the hardest-to-contact families and the youngest children.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/16">Nationally, the Government have to realise the destructive impact of their target culture. Forcing a chronically educationally underachieving city such as Nottingham to conform to middle England targets and outcomes means that only symptoms, rather than causes, are addressed, so even short-term improvements are not built on firm and sustainable foundations. In those circumstances, the very lowest achieving children do not receive the necessary attention. The focus can be on getting more children who are just a little behind up to the Government level 4 target, leaving the long tail of strugglers to sink. The day job then becomes administering the consequences of underachievement, rather than attacking its origins.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/17">In the era of the local Government White Paper, the Lyons review and, possibly, a change of Prime Minister and new ideas, we need locally to have the ambition and freedom to look those problems in the eye and not be looking over our shoulder for central Government approval. In that context, I have a request for my hon. Friend the Minister. I would appreciate knowing the 2006 results for the UK for 11-year-olds getting below level 3 in English nationally, for all children and for boys and girls separately, and the results by local authority. I do not expect the Minister to carry that information around with him, but if he will ask his officials to write to me, I shall be most grateful. I must put on the record the assistance that I have had from and the interaction that I have had with the excellent officials who have worked in the Department. Like all of us, they are trying to find ways to solve these problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/18">The information that I have asked for does not relate to an official target, yet it is vital for the life chances of youngsters in my constituency. It is not a box to tick&mdash;I am not looking for that&mdash;but it should be a spur to effective local partnership between our local society, parents and children and the voluntary sector. In the short term, however, we need to add reliable, effective, early interventions to tackle children's reading difficulties. That is why I have sought this debate. For many middle England areas, the work that I am concerned with might be dismissed as schemes or projects, but for a deprived area such as my constituency it is bedrock policy&mdash;a prerequisite for achievement and, beyond the education silo, a prerequisite for an effective civil society too.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/19">What can we do? The Government are doing excellent work to reduce the number of children who struggle with reading, by improving general classroom teaching. I always count blessings in this context, including the attention being paid to class sizes, improvements in attainment levels and the extraordinary change in the numbers achieving five A to C grades; they are very welcome and the Government should be praised for what they have done. I make a point of giving that praise, having to date made some criticisms.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/20">The city council in Nottingham is also already doing great work. At the foundation stage great progress is being made with the early reading development pilot, with the result that 56 schools are now involved in the communication, language and literacy development programmes. At key stage 1 Nottingham city is one of the few councils to show progress in reading. At key stage 2 it has made a 4 per cent. gain at level 4. In addition, the intensive support programme and the supporting progress initiative have made substantial gains. The family literacy scheme is doing superb work with parents; literacy volunteers are giving immense support; the Place2B is giving parents an understanding of their children's reading needs. Other innovations include the &quot;mega read&quot; project, linking primaries, secondaries and library services, and the web-based reading resource that will be sent out to all secondary schools in the next two years. All that tremendous effort from the LEA and teachers will make a serious difference to youngsters in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/21">The children whom I am most concerned about, however, are those who on arrival at school are referred to in report after report by Ofsted as being unable to speak in a sentence or recognise a letter or number, who do not understand what &quot;word&quot;, &quot;letter&quot; or &quot;page&quot; mean, and who cannot concentrate in a busy classroom. Those children need full-time, professional reading recovery. It gets 84 per cent. of children back to national average reading levels and sustains that progress. Several parliamentary colleagues present are no doubt from areas where the scheme has been used very successfully. Perhaps I may give an advertisement, since I see that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> is in her place, for a reception about reading recovery, which is to be held in Parliament next Tuesday; and perhaps if the Minister has not been invited he will still be able to pop in, with other Front Benchers, to add weight to the great work that is being done by the organisation concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/22">&quot;Every child a reader&quot; projects are operating in many parts of the UK and, indeed, throughout the English-speaking world. They involve a short-term intervention for six-year-olds. Children receive daily 30-minute one-to-one lessons for up to 20 weeks, from a specially trained teacher. The children's parents or carers are also engaged to support their children's learning. The approach is one of the cheapest innovations that we can provide. It is an inoculation against a lifetime of illiteracy. Cheap? To give an illiterate, alienated, disruptive 16-year-old a place in a secure unit for a year costs &pound;250,000. Giving that same child, earlier on, by reading recovery, the talent to read&mdash;to access the whole world through reading&mdash;costs &pound;2,500, so 100 youngsters could be given national level reading ability for the price of picking up the pieces for one child who perhaps did not get the intervention that they needed when they needed it.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/23">Reading recovery is not an easy option. It requires initial training for reading recovery teachers, which takes a year. That training continues, so that the teachers can stay at the same high level of skills. I do not disparage at all the fantastic effort of volunteers or teaching assistants in helping youngsters to read. I am concerned with getting the momentum going&mdash;with getting the youngsters to a level at which they will benefit even more from those other interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.1/24">Reading recovery was supported by large-scale Government funding, and was then funded by local authorities and school budgets, and through regeneration programmes, but now it needs clarity and direction from Government. It is, in some senses, at a turning point, and it needs Government&mdash;and the Minister&mdash;to be clear about how the future for reading recovery is seen.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.2/1">I cannot say that I disagree with anything that the hon.

	<p pid="b.30.3/1">The hon. Lady has hit on a serious and important point. All too often we are considering remedies&mdash;putting things right instead of getting them right in the first place, and instead of setting up a continual strategy to ensure that children achieve. Wherever we look in social policy we can perceive what is happening: for example, in relation to 16 to 18-year-olds in my constituency who are not in employment, education or training one might ask why&mdash;where is it going wrong? Then the analysis can be regressed back to secondary school and the skills taught there: one can ask why one in seven boys in my constituency could not read the first lesson at school. Then one can ask about primary level, the giving of support and, as I have mentioned, the teaching of social behaviour at that level; and then one can read the Ofsted reports of every primary school in my constituency&mdash;which, I admit, is at one end of the spectrum&mdash;highlighting the problem of youngsters not being ready for school. Regressing further, one comes to the point at which a child is born, and the level of parenting skills and interaction.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/2">I have seen an incredibly revealing slide from research work done by Worldwide Alternatives to Violence, which has been used in the social exclusion unit booklet, showing the brain of a three-year-old child who is loved, nurtured and spoken to, and who has all that a young child needs, alongside the brain of a neglected child who has no interaction, is poorly nourished and does not receive the stimulus that one would expect. There is a marked difference in size between the brains of those youngsters, aged three. To see that given physical expression was a shock and a sobering experience, even for someone who, like me, feels that they know a little about the subject. There are youngsters who are physically unable to do what everyone else takes for granted. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">The intervention by the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> is, therefore, absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/3">We need to complete a circle back to what we do to improve parenting skills, what we do prenatally and what we do before the people concerned decide&mdash;if a choice is indeed made&mdash;to have a child. The process should loop round to the parenting skills and the social and family skills that we are now beginning to teach in secondary school, so that people make the right choices and do not experience teenage pregnancy or take up the unhealthy lifestyles that so many youngsters engage in. If we complete that virtuous circle, we can start to tackle some of those problems, rather than spend billions of pounds on the consequences of neglect and the failure to intervene at the right time.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/4">The case is put particularly eloquently by a quote in the Select Committee on Education and Skills 2005 report, &quot;Teaching Children to Read&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/5" class="indent">&quot;Too many children fail to reach adequate levels of literacy: Whatever the impact of recent developments in the teaching of literacy, there has been little improvement at the lower end of the achievement spectrum&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/6">on which I have tried to focus today. It goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/7" class="indent">&quot;The education system in England is still failing to meet the needs of a significant proportion of children who leave school with inadequate literacy for the demands of the modern world...The implementation of Reading Recovery is under serious threat in England. In the past three years, schools in England have reported increasing difficulty in their ability to fund the programme for their least able children and six longstanding LEAs have ceased their implementation, with three more currently at risk. Lack of funding has been the principal reason given for closures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/8">The Select Committee goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/9" class="indent">&quot;If the Government wishes to make a real difference to the literacy rates among primary school children, it must ensure that suitable programmes are available to all those children who require intensive support, and that they are delivered by highly qualified professionals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/10">That sums up my argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/11">On one level, I would like to see a world in which all parents were helped to be skilled enough to ensure that every child arrived at school school-ready and prepared to take the journey of learning to read. Parents need that help. In my constituency, 58 per cent. of children are born out of wedlock. I make no moral judgment about that, but it is a structural fact that needs to be addressed in a constituency such as mine. Parents absolutely need that early intervention so that they can give their children the future that they want to give them just as much as any parent in the Chamber wants to give their children a good future.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/12">Until children are arriving at school school-ready, I would like reading recovery to be available to all children, not just in my constituency but everywhere in the UK where difficulties with literacy needlessly waste their potential. I make an offer: as chair of the local strategic partnership, One Nottingham, I am prepared to help to fund such an initiative in my city if and when the local education authority and the children and young people's partnership there feel that that is appropriate and are ready to go ahead with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.3/13">I end with a quote from someone who is learning to read and doing pretty well&mdash;my daughter Grace. This morning, while I was preparing for this speech and Grace was sitting reading a book, I said to her, &quot;Grace, I've got this speech in the House of Commons; I don't know really know how to finish it appropriately, because it is pretty serious. What do you think?&quot; She put down the Lemony Snicket book that she was reading and looked at me. I said, &quot;Tell me, Grace, why is reading important?&quot; and she replied, &quot;You don't get much out of life if you don't read.&quot; I ask the Minister to give every child that opportunity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.32.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" speakername="Mark Williams" colnum="32"  time="011:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0005.htm#06103157000536">
	<p pid="b.32.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> for raising this important issue. He spoke with a great deal of passion and conviction. I am sure that those of us who regard these matters enthusiastically are not unique; there are many others outside this place who feel that passion. I certainly feel it having spent 13 years in a classroom as a teacher of young children before coming to this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/2">The central feature of the case for enhanced reading recovery programmes is not simply about literacy or academic achievement, crucial though they are. As the hon. Gentleman has made clear, the capacity to read is closely linked&mdash;I apologise if there is a very child-centred feel to my remarks&mdash;to self-esteem, behavioural patterns in school and beyond, and the ability of all children fully to be involved in the school community and to access the entire curriculum. I shall not succumb to the temptation of relating anecdotes of my experiences, but I will say that one could guarantee that at one of the urban schools in which I taught, such behavioural problems and the more deep-seated problems on the estate could be traced back to the problems of underachievement, particularly in literacy. One could pinpoint those cases almost universally. That was the reality of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/3">I shall not get into the debate about standard assessment tests and particular statistics of achievement, on some of which the hon. Gentleman and I may beg to differ, other than to comment on the target culture that he mentioned. As a teacher&mdash;and professional, I hope&mdash;I know that we all felt that pressure very strongly. Mercifully, SATs have now gone in Wales. The teaching profession went through the rigours and stipulations of the national curriculum and the emergence of the literacy and numeracy hours. I welcomed the literacy hour because it gave me a focus as a new teacher, but many children simply could not keep up. For them, it was absolutely meaningless to look in detail at text for an hour every day and analyse word patterns. Those were children in years 5 and 6, not the youngest children about whom the hon. Gentleman is particularly concerned, as we all are.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/4">There is no doubt that a huge number of children are missing out. At the core of this debate are issues of inclusiveness and entitlement. I have seen figures that suggest that 440,000 adults in Wales&mdash;25 per cent. of the population&mdash;have serious literacy difficulties. We are told that young offenders in pupil referral units are missing out on basic educational programmes, but as the hon. Gentleman has said, the failing is much earlier on. We know that early intervention works, and that with approaches of the types suggested, two thirds of the children involved will go on to achieve expected levels at the end of key stage 1. Given that early impetus, and without extra help, half of those children will achieve expected levels four years on at the end of key stage 2. That is why it is vital to build a culture of reading and appreciating books. That is not just a middle-class phenomenon.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/5">I remember parent interviews and that all too often if I dared to suggest that there was work to be done at home, the response was that these matters are the responsibility of schools. Parents think, &quot;My children come here at 9 am and they leave at 3.30 pm. It is your responsibility.&quot; That is a real and broad phenomenon. I would send home reading books every day, but with the full expectation that they would be brought back unsigned the next day, week or, indeed, month.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/6">I understand why some of the pilot schemes have been focused on urban areas, because there is, of course, a huge need there, but there is also a need in rural areas such as those represented by me and other hon. Members. In a small village school with one underperforming child who has behavioural problems, the problem is magnified in the whole school community in the same way as with larger numbers of children in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/7">The &quot;every child a reader&quot; pilot is admirable&mdash;5,000 five and six-year-olds are being helped&mdash;but it is inevitably limited in its scope, and it will end in 2008. When I spoke to its director yesterday, she told me that she hopes that the experience of the pilot will win the hearts and minds of decision makers. I hope that the Minister will give us assurances about its future, its expansion and the promotion of such schemes after 2008. Will he also say something about rural areas?</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/8">In what environment, therefore, can reading be effectively taught to children who are perhaps two, three or more years behind their chronological reading age? Having taught classes ranging in size from 14 to 36 pupils, I know that the intensive catch-up programmes that are required cannot take place in a conventional class environment. Gone are the days when a teacher would dutifully hear children read every day, let alone teach those with particular difficulties. Early intervention is therefore the key. Normal teaching does not enable slow readers to catch up.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/9">Although we are right to praise the work done by the increased numbers of classroom assistants and teachers, this debate is not about class sizes. Of course, reducing class sizes will help, and my party has a lot of good things to say about the issue, but what we need is more focused intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/10">Nor can measures to promote reading be latched on to special educational needs policy in schools. SEN budgets are tight, SEN timetables are often full on the action and action plus levels, and there is the issue of statementing. Yesterday, I spoke to a special needs teacher who said that</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/11" class="indent">&quot;50 per cent. of the children&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/12">not only in year 1, but in years 5 and 6&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/13" class="indent">&quot;need extra teaching of reading.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/14">However, that teacher must rely on some of her children being away ill to fulfil the requirements of those who remain and give them the time that they need, even in her special needs classes. She strongly feels that she cannot deliver what is required without extra focused resources, and although I used to manage a small school improvement budget, it was never enough to supply anything other than the occasional focused support.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/15">All that points to the need for bold, imaginative and direct intervention focused on books. There are instances of children who do not know how to open a book, let alone read one; they do not understand the mechanism of turning pages or what the little numbers in the corners are. We need to build in an approach that deals with such issues, because if we target them early on, we shall be making a long-term investment in the future. That will help children who simply do not read at home, who do not have books at home and who would not dream of going to a library. It will help boys who are uninterested in reading or who are fully aware that they are slipping behind the girls&mdash;there is a strong gender issue here, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/16">A huge amount of pioneering work has been done in individual schools&mdash;it has been largely inspired by what has happened in New Zealand&mdash;and we have heard of the good work that is being done in Nottingham. However, I was struck by the thoughts of the educationist Barbara MacGilchrist, who wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Short-term uncoordinated initiatives to raise standards do not work...To combat underachievement in reading, a long-term, system-led strategy, nationally co-ordinated and locally managed is required.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/18">We need a joined-up approach at different levels of government in Scotland, Wales or England&mdash;I say that as someone who represents a Welsh constituency&mdash;to put the issue on the agenda. That approach was clearly articulated by the hon. Member for Nottingham, North.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/19">However, this is not just about schools or the six hours for which I had children in my care&mdash;it is about the other 18 hours, too. A key component of any reading policy must be reading in the home. The overwhelming research evidence shows that a huge difference can be made when parents, neighbours, family members and carers get involved. I commend the work of the Family Reading Campaign and the BBC, which has been promoting reading and writing in a way that actively involves parents and particularly fathers&mdash;again, there is a gender issue here, because reading is left to the wife. I am quite proud of the fact that I was sitting reading the last chapter of &quot;The Magic Faraway Tree&quot; with my daughter on Sunday night. I do not know whether Enid Blyton is in vogue, but my daughter got a lot out of it. She was certainly stimulated by the experience, and both my three-year-old and my six-year-old are stimulated by the English and Welsh language books that come home from school. The aim must be to build parents' confidence in their own literacy skills, although that is a huge job, and we have heard of the shortfall in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/20">Although there are issues about how Sure Start will be evaluated and about the way forward, it has made a big difference, particularly in the most deprived areas. In particular, I pay tribute to Book Start, which has been significant and has given many young children their first experience of books. It is managed by Booktrust, funded by Sure Start and delivered by libraries and local health services. My wife and I had twins just before Christmas, and I look forward to them having their bag of books from the local health service when they are a little older. Such measures have made a big difference for many families.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/21">I commend the report produced by Jim Rose, which was commissioned by the DFES. In it, he states that</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/22" class="indent">&quot;developing children's positive attitude to literacy, in the broadest sense, from the earliest stage is very important...For the youngest children, well before the age of five, sharing and enjoying favourite books with trusted adults...is at the heart of this activity. Parents and carers should be strongly encouraged in these pursuits and reassured that, in so doing, they are contributing massively to children's literacy and to their education in general.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/23">That really is an endless task, and it needs clearer, focused direction at all levels of government.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/24">Finally, let me say something about the key issues of teacher training and the training of experts in reading recovery. There are many failings in teacher training, and I endured a one-year postgraduate certificate of education course in which the education that I received in special needs was minimal. None the less, although the &pound;20,000 salaries that we are talking about for intensive provision to promote reading will cost a lot, most of us here will agree that that cost is ultimately worth paying.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.35.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="35"  time="011:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0006.htm#06103157000537">
	<p pid="b.35.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. O'Hara. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this debate on a subject that is crucial not only to my constituency, but nationally. Initially, I want to say a little about where I come from on the issue and about the issues in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/2">I have been interested in the issue of reading and children since I became a secondary school governor in the early 1990s. I went into a special educational needs class and saw 11-year-olds struggling to read books that normal five and six-year-olds would have no struggle reading. At that point, I thought that I really needed to see what was going on in our primary schools, so I became a primary school governor and served as one for nine years. Since then, as a mother and an MP, I have seen how Sure Start, quality under-fives provision, literacy hour and reading recovery have made a difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/3">Before he became Prime Minister, my right hon. Friend said that his priorities were &quot;education, education, education&quot;, and that script could have been written for Hackney. The challenges in Hackney schools and among Hackney's children were, and still are, many. Population turnover is high and ranges from 25 to 30 per cent. of the total. That does not affect all schools, but it does affect a number. Only last summer, I visited a school with my noble Friend Lord Adonis, who is Minister with responsibility for London schools. Fewer than 20 per cent. of the year 6 pupils at that school had been there since reception. The school was in the middle of some dense council estates, and people were trying to find a way to move and leave the school. That created huge challenges not only for that school, but for many others.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/4">Hackney also has higher than average numbers of children with English as a second language and on free school meals. In addition, there has been a lack of investment in school buildings over the years. It is worth paying tribute to the work done in my area by the London borough of Hackney, which has had its problems in the past. However, under the leadership of Hackney's current mayor and the Learning Trust&mdash;the agency that now runs Hackney schools&mdash;some real hard work has been done. There has been a political focus on providing a framework and support in respect of buildings and resources so that teachers and our excellent head teachers can do their jobs properly. The approach in Hackney has been, &quot;Let's take what the Government have to offer and make it work for Hackney.&quot; I therefore commend the Hackney experience to the Minister. If we can fix things in Hackney, that can be a real model for what can be done elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/5">Hackney schools really are schools plus. They work with children from some of the most challenging backgrounds, where alcohol and substance abuse are common. A lot of those children need child protection, but they intermingle with children who are perhaps from more stable backgrounds. However, our schools provide stability, and it is often the only stability that some of those children have in their chaotic lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/6">Hackney schools have embraced extended schools fully. I visited a number of schools in my constituency during September, all of which offer breakfast clubs and after-school activities, and several of the secondary schools provide weekend and evening activities too. Indeed, the head teacher of the Hackney Free and Parochial Church of England secondary school said that she wants a cleaning contract in the school to run from 10 pm to 6 am, because that is the only time of the day, week, or year that the school is not being used, save for a week or two's closure in the summer. I commend that model to other areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/7">There is also a great deal of adult learning in English, information and communications technology and general literacy in our schools. They are opened up for the parents, who hit the system at the point where their child gets to primary or secondary school, and they are welcomed into Hackney schools. Family learning is a particularly important area for Hackney schools, and I want to give a couple of examples in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/8">Burbage primary school's head teacher, Karen Glenister, who is a visionary woman, has been working with parents to encourage them to learn about how to be better parents. She talks about one experience involving a parent who was called in a number of times because his son was being a little difficult. Originally he would say, &quot;How dare you call me in? My son is an angel who never misbehaves, and you are picking on him.&quot; Gradually, she won him round and got him to acknowledge that there were some difficulties, although not insoluble ones, with his son's behaviour. She hooked him in to a parent support scheme, and at the end of the year, he turned up to the school smartly dressed in a suit and with a speech prepared. He asked whether he could make it as he was awarded his certificate for his adult learning experience. He spoke with great emotion about how his family life and his life as a father was so much better because of the support he had received through the primary school.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/9">That picks up on points made by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> that reading recovery, although important, needs to be part of a wider whole and that parental support is also crucial.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/10">Daubeney primary school in Homerton has just received a large sum of money over three years to ensure that it can provide family learning support of a similar nature. Those are just two examples, but all schools in Hackney are doing something. If the Minister would like to know more about this, I commend that he visit Hackney to see things for himself.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/11">Thanks to Government investment, new buildings and new schools are being built in Hackney. Three new city academies have either been built or are on the way. Mossbourne community academy, our first one, received an outstanding Ofsted report just a couple of weeks ago. Great progress has been made, which has translated into results. This year, for the first time in many years, more than 50 per cent. of pupils in Hackney schools gained five or more A* to C-grade GCSEs&mdash;the actual figure was 51 per cent, which represents an increase of 4 per cent. from last year. Results in Hackney are improving three times faster than those in the rest of England.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/12">Unfortunately, a Channel 4 programme recently decided to name Hackney as the worst place in Britain to live, but these results show that such programmes are living in the past. Perhaps people should visit Hackney and its schools to see how Hackney is definitely not the worst; I think it is one of the best places in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/13">We have also benefited from other national schemes such as Book Start, which runs from birth, Sure Start for all under-fives and the effect of Sure Start on four and five-year-olds in respect of support when they reach primary school. That is why reading recovery is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/14">Hackney reading recovery schemes are funded in a variety of ways in the borough: the neighbourhood renewal fund gives money to schemes in 10 schools; the Shoreditch trust is a new deal for communities partnership that funds six schools in the Shoreditch area; and &quot;Every child a reader&quot;, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, referred is a partnership between the Department for Education and Skills, charitable trusts and the business sector, including, in particular, the KPMG Foundation, that funds five schools. That scheme is hosting an event in Parliament next week, and I hope that the Minister will be able to go along to hear more about this. Four schools are self-funding; the value of reading recovery is such that they found the resources to provide this invaluable service.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/15">My hon. Friend went into great detail about the research in this area, so I shall not repeat all that. The cost of reading recovery is about &pound;2,500 a child. That provides the one-to-one tuition that is needed for half an hour a day over three to four months. As he said, it is peanuts when we consider the consequences of not tackling the issue and the impact on society of children who leave school with lower than average levels of literacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/16">The reading recovery programme is well established and is working well in Hackney, which was one of the first 11 areas in the country to use it. Currently, there are 43 trained reading recovery teachers, who work in 25 schools. Some 20 of those schools have one full-time reading recovery teacher per form entry.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/17">In Hackney, reading recovery is an important part of the work to tackle poverty and improve the life chances of children. The children in that scheme are some of the most in need. Two out of three children on the programme in Hackney are entitled to free school meals, and 13 per cent. are either looked-after children or are from asylum-seeking and refugee families. As we know from other research, children from families where the main impediment to learning relates to English language quickly catch up and go on to contribute a great deal if they receive the right support at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/18">Many children in Hackney schools are learning English as a second language, and reading recovery has an important role in improving attainment; some65 per cent.&mdash;well over half&mdash;have English as an additional language, and 25 per cent are Turkish or Kurdish speaking. I have discussed some of the issues for Turkish and Kurdish speakers in my constituency with the DFES. A couple of weeks ago, I spoke to parents at Alevi, which is a large Turkish and Kurdish organisation, about the challenges that face their children. They are concerned that their children are slipping behind in schools. It is a question not of their intelligence but of the barriers that are created, partly through language. I also gave those parents a challenge. I said that their children will not do so well unless they speak English, or even Turkish, at home. Many Hackney schools provide Turkish literacy lessons for parents, so that they learn to improve their speaking with their children in their mother tongue. That provides an enormous benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/19">Recently, I spoke to another hon. Member who represents a London constituency, who told me that some early research is being done&mdash;so I shall not name the constituency at this point&mdash;that seems to indicate that children who attend additional Saturday school English and Turkish classes then do better at GCSE level. We are collating that research, and I flag this up to the Minister because there is a London-wide issue about how our Turkish and Kurdish children are achieving. I want the slower rate of progress to change so that their achievement is on a par with that of other ethnic groups that have English as a second language.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/20">There have been major successes in the achievement of black boys. I give credit to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>, who represents my neighbouring constituency and who pioneered the issue before it was flavour of the month. She put it on the educational map. We need to do similar things with the education of Turkish and Kurdish pupils, and she, and others in Hackney and across London, are trying to do that. I want to flag that up to the Minister because he will be hearing more about it from a number of us over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/21">I return to the issue of reading recovery. Reading recovery teachers train and support teaching assistants in the talking partners programme, which focuses on important oral language skills for children: developing the speaking and listening skills that underpin literacy. As other hon. Members have said, many children do not get that development at home.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/22">It is important to ensure that investment is made in language development in schools. My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North referred to the perfect world that we may one day been in, where parents have all the parental support that some get through Hackney schools and hopefully others get through schools in his constituency. Parents do not all get that now, so we must ensure that we provide it in schools alongside the important parental learning.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/23">It is important that the programme is not just one in Hackney or Nottingham: it must be nationwide. In Hackney and in London generally, there is a high turnover in population. Children often do not stay in the same school. It is important that such children do not lose out just because they have changed school, particularly where their parents do not understand or value what the reading recovery programme gives them. It is unjust that a child on such a scheme can lose the support overnight by moving school; it does not travel with them and it is not universal. Some 6 to 7 per cent. of children, rising to 10 per cent. among boys, leave primary schools without the most basic reading and writing skills. That represents about 40,000 children a year in England. I am sure that the Minister takes this seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/24">The reading recovery scheme is one of the programmes that provides excellent results. Some83 per cent. of children in Hackney who take part in it catch up completely with their classmates, and often overtake them, after only 12 to 20 weeks of daily teaching. The &pound;2,500 is a small price to pay for that rapid, tangible progress. I know that the Government like to see tangible progress and like to point out how their investment is getting results. On that basis, I hope that the Minister was listening closely to those figures. Throughout the country and in Hackney, it is helping to give the best chance to the children who mostneed it.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/25">Numeracy recovery is also starting in some schools in Hackney and I shall be interested to see how that programme develops for slow learners in maths. Other issues are involved in how that is programmed in and it is not just a one-off hit, so a different approach may be needed, but it is an exciting project.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/26">We do not want children to fall behind at that crucial early stage in their lives and to be labelled a substandard reader, because that will impact on them for the rest of their lives. My hon. Friend referred to some of the figures on people in prison and youth custody who cannot read well. Of those in youth custody, 25 per cent. had a reading age of below seven. That is disgusting in our modern world and we must tackle the problem. It will take years to get the solution through the system, but if we deal with reading recovery now we will get there.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/27">My direct plea to the Minister is that we need continuity of funding, not one-off schemes. We need a national programme and to follow Hackney's example of the excellent parent and learning family support that is provided through our schools. In short, we need Sure Start not just for under-fives, but at five and for parents who did not have that start in life.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this debate and the ecumenical way in which he spoke&mdash;the seating arrangements this morning are also ecumenical. He mentioned deprivation and the effect that low literacy and numeracy standards can have on trapping people in the deprived circumstances they may have had since birth. He also mentioned the low literacy and numeracy standards of people in prison, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> when she spoke about young offenders. There is a large prison in my constituency and we know about the measurable levels of literacy and numeracy, but when one talks to prisoners their low articulation skills are striking and follow from low education skills. That partly explains why they find themselves in those dreadful circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/2">We know from the Government's research and the Department's report in 2005 that the gap in educational attainment between key stage 2 for children aged 11 who have free school meals and those in families that are not eligible for that support can be up to 2.9 terms&mdash;in anyone else's language that means a year's loss of teaching support. That feeds through into a wider gap at GCSE level. In higher education&mdash;I usually speak on that for my party&mdash;the participation rate for those from working class families is around15 per cent., whereas for those from professional families and whose parents have been to university it is 80 per cent. There is a yawning gap in participation rates in higher education. That gap grows wider from the age of seven and that is probably the age at which the gap at 18 is determined.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.0/3">The hon. Member for Nottingham, North mentioned the number of words that children from different families might hear at a young age. I think he said&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;that children from a professional family background might hear 50 million words, but those from a working class background might hear 12 million. Early intervention will pay a great dividend.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.0/1">I said that children in a family on benefits might hear 12 million words. The middle range for children in working class families is 30 million. Interaction and articulation in families on benefits is far less.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.40.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" speakername="Stephen Williams" colnum="40"  time="011:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0007.htm#06103157000540">
	<p pid="b.40.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that clarification. We both illustrated that there is a big gap in articulation levels and that is probably set very early by what children hear from their parents.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/2">I am reminded of my A-level history lessons on the counter-reformation and Ignatius Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, who said, &quot;If you give me a child until the age of seven he will have my standards for life thereafter.&quot; That applies in so many ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/3">We are debating the reading recovery programme&mdash;in some parts of the country it is called &quot;Every child a reader&quot;. We know from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the figures quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> that the levels of support that the programme can achieve are impressive. At key stage 1, two thirds of children who took part in the programme achieved the expected level and, even without further support, half achieved the expected level by the time they got to key stage 2. Going back to what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>&mdash;she has now left the Chamber&mdash;said during an intervention, if that support were maintained throughout education, those percentages and fractions would, I am sure, be much higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/4">Literacy is about not only reading skills, but language and communication. In a modern economy we need to turn out people who can go into the workplace at 16 or 18 to sell, to persuade, to negotiate and to achieve what is best for them and their employers. Alarming trends are set early in life for whether they are likely to leave school with those educational skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/5">The 2004-05 annual report of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority on English says that</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/6" class="indent">&quot;at key stages 1-3 there is still little evidence that speaking and listening is being taught explicitly or securely assessed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/7">I am a member of the Select Committee on Education and Skills and the hon. Member for Nottingham, North quoted from its report during the previous Parliament: &quot;Teaching Children to Read&quot;. Another extract says that</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/8" class="indent">&quot;children need to talk and to experience a rich diet of spoken language, in order to think and learn. Reading, writing and number may be the acknowledged curriculum 'basics', but talk is 'arguably the true foundation of learning'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/9">Partly for those reasons and partly because of evidence that we picked up elsewhere&mdash;this is the one party point I shall make&mdash;the Liberal Democrats have set up the 4Rs commission to examine not only reading, writing and arithmetic, but the skill of articulation. We have tried to take politics out of that commission by ensuring that it is headed by a respected educationist, Bethan Marshall, and consists of primary school teachers and people who work with children in other fields, including children's entertainment and TV.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion mentioned the role of other parts of government, such as local government and libraries. As a child, I discovered the joy of reading partly from going to my local library back in south Wales. I was lucky to have home support. I read Enid Blyton books and remember &quot;The Magic Faraway Tree&quot; and the &quot;The Enchanted Wood&quot;, as, I am sure, do many of us.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/11">One sector that has not been spoken about is the voluntary sector and its role. In my constituency recently, I met a group called Volunteer Reading Help, a charity that has existed in Bristol since the 1970s. It now provides support in more than 1,000 schools throughout the country. It goes into schools and works, typically, with groups of four children twice a week for 30 minutes to give them the reading support that they need. The emphasis in that support is not on achieving any key stage or curriculum requirements; it is all about the fun of reading. It teaches reading by encouraging children to read books that they enjoy and to take part in games. Its results have been impressive.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.1/12">There is also a role for possessions. I am not a father, but I am a godfather and I know that my godchildren love being given books. The bag of books that my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion mentioned is obviously playing a role, but there are many other ways open to the Government and voluntary sector. I was given an annual book at Sunday school and I still have them all at home. Just giving a child a book that belongs to them and they can hold on to will encourage them to take up the joy of reading. There is a role for the Government, a role for the profession, a role for parents and a role for volunteers to start children on the voyage of discovery that the joy of reading can lead them to.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.0/1">I am pleased to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Bayley, during the closing part of this discussion. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this debate. We have heard in some powerful contributions, showing that we feel strongly about this issue on both sides of the House, and I applaud his consensual approach to the debate, which is important, because as the hon. Gentleman said, the point at which we learn to read can determine so much of the rest of our lives. A child's vocabulary at five years old, and reading age at 10 years old, are pivotal. They are even more important than parental contribution, although the two go hand in hand. That is unsurprising, because if reading is not sound, accessing the remainder of the curriculum is a fundamental problem, and no one wants to see a waste of potential. That is why we are rightly concerned about literacy problems, and why I am concerned that one in five 11-year-olds does not achieve his or her expected reading age.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/2">The hon. Gentleman said that difficulty with reading varies. However, we should be concerned about all underachievement, because being unable to read properly early in life severely undermines our children's chances of a secure future. That is important, given the correlation between low literacy and children living in poverty.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/3">The concept of reading recovery was introduced to the UK in 1992 under a previous Government, but it enjoyed cross-party support. Many other schemes have drawn on the expertise of the reading recovery approach, but the original approach is intensive. There are daily half-hour sessions in which highly trained teachers support six-year-olds who are usually in the bottom 20 per cent. of their class for reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/4">As with any reading scheme, reading recovery has its critics. Some question the cost, but research indicates that the scheme has a positive impact when used effectively in schools. The Institute of Education and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority have assessed its impact and they feel that it helps the weakest readers&mdash;those to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. The published results are compelling. Seventy per cent. of those who were in the bottom20 per cent. of their class at six years old and received reading recovery support had moved up to the average band four years later. That is testament to the scheme's success.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/5">Few people doubt that reading recovery can help in the most difficult cases, but reading recovery is aimed at just that&mdash;recovering pupils who start to fail in the education system. The QCA believes that the main focus should be on catching children before they fail. I am interested in that view, because it has great merit.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/6">The hon. Gentleman discussed the city of Nottingham, where I attended school for a brief period and which I know quite well. All hon. Members owe it to the children in their constituencies to get right first time the teaching of reading. We must root out the underlying problems that create the need for reading recovery. The hon. Gentleman rightly said that the earlier we invest, the more we get it right. We should aim for prevention.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/7">That is why I shall concentrate on three areas on which I should welcome the Minister's response. They are Sure Start, nurseries and synthetic phonics. An important element of the original Sure Start idea was to work with the most disadvantaged families to break the cycle of poverty that exists in all constituencies. In my constituency, there are two small areas of extreme deprivation. Unfortunately, because of their geography, they do not receive the support of a Sure Start programme; however, they receive lots of support from other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/8">We must consider how we can break the cycle of poverty in which people are trapped. Education is an important element, and staff at the successful Sure Start programmes that I have visited in different parts of the country think that literacy is pivotal. The Sure Start programme in Reading, which I visited recently, has developed a home reading support scheme for the youngest children. It includes rhyming tapes to help mothers who may not know the nursery rhymes that we knew as children. Rhymes can be an important first step in gaining the communication skills that lead to reading skills. The Reading programme has also developed a book library, so that children who may not have access to books in their home have the opportunity from the very earliest years to see how books can add to their lives. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.43.4/1">Thank you, Mr. Bayley.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/2">Sure Start can make a valuable contribution to the improvement of literacy skills. There is a local example in Westminster. The Westminster Children's Society Sure Start programme involves the local library in its work to improve literacy skills from a very early age. The society runs story times at the library with the aim of introducing books to the very young&mdash;the pre-pre-school children. Importantly, it tries to identify where help is needed with parental literacy. I was most impressed with the range of books in the library that I visited in Westminster, which included works in more than 20 different languages. It showed how much work has been done to support the diverse community only a stone's throw from our place of work.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> said, Sure Start tries to develop a culture of learning very early on, and as other Members have said, it should reach out to an even broader community. After only a few short years, however, the fundamental changes to Sure Start funding and to the introduction of children's centres has called into question the future of such projects. Owing to the nature of children's centres, future funding per child will be cut from &pound;1,300 to &pound;250. How realistic is it to think that that important work will continue? I should welcome the Minister's thoughts, because established and highly motivated professionals who work in those organisations are worried by the changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/4">Hon. Members have this morning highlighted the important way in which nurseries and pre-school groups ensure readiness for school. The UK Effective Provision of Pre-school Education project, EPPE, found compelling evidence that those who attended nursery had significantly improved cognitive and social development skills, making them much better placed to start learning to read when they went to full-time school. Again, however, there is concern about the future funding of nurseries and, in particular, the funding of nursery places for three and four-year-olds. The change in funding will mean a bleak future for many nurseries throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/5">The voluntary sector runs many of those organisations. Given their importance in providing a bedrock for reading tuition, will the Minister confirm his commitment to ensure that the funding exists to deliver the Government's promise of free nursery places? Many nurseries find it hard to fulfil that concept, given the money that they receive from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/6">Too many of our children still fail to grasp reading the first time round. The evidence has been clear for some time that the best way to teach a child to read is by synthetic phonics. The Government's own Rose review reinforced the conclusions of a great deal of work that has been done here in the UK and elsewhere by stating that high-quality synthetic phonics should be used as a teaching tool by the age of five. I was glad to hear earlier this year that the Government now fully endorse that view. I will be interested to hear from the Minister what they are doing to embed the approach both in our schools and in the training of teachers. That is vital if this important method is to be used effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/7">All the factors that I have mentioned affect our children's ability to read. As the hon. Member for Nottingham, North said, reading recovery is an important tool. I was interested to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the contribution made by the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase>, who made a compelling argument for the use of reading recovery, particularly among children who have English as a second language and those who move schools more regularly than the average. The system clearly has an important role in those cases. However, that is one element of a much broader mix. Early years support, nursery schools and synthetic phonics are also vital ingredients. What are the Government doing to remove the question mark over some of the activities that are so successfully being undertaken in Sure Start, and what is the Minister doing to remove the sword of Damocles that is hanging over the heads of so many nurseries?</p>
	<p pid="b.43.4/8">Some &pound;500 million is used to fund literacy in England, but is it being used in the most effective way possible? The hon. Member for Nottingham, North clearly feels that it is not, and he has taken the opportunity afforded by this debate to articulate his views. The matters that I have raised on Sure Start and the future of our nurseries show that the Government have no room for complacency. I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. Reading recovery can help some of the children whom the system has failed, but it is most important that every child has the right to learn to read and get the right start to their school life.</p>

	<p pid="b.45.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Bayley. You managed to sneak in some way through the debate, and you are very welcome. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is clear from his speech that he cares deeply about the matter, and I know that he has secured Adjournment debates in the past on getting children school-ready by the age of five. I believe that he asked me a question about it just a couple of weeks ago. He made some startling points today, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1458" name="Stephen Williams">the one also made by the hon. Member for Bristol, West (Stephen Williams)</phrase> that children from working-class families on benefits have a quarter of the vocabulary of those from a middle-class background.

	<p pid="b.45.2/1">I am sorry, I am getting the wrong Member. We had a three-hour debate in Westminster Hall on Thursday to discuss the SEN report. We have invested in SEN to the tune of a 43 per cent. increase in the past three years and I assure the hon. Gentleman that we have an ongoing commitment. He made interesting points on reading and the involvement of parents. Reading should not be seen as something for girls or the middle class, or as a white thing. Part of my excuse for not being the best read Member of the House, to say the least, is that when I was a child neither of my parents could read particularly well in English.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> mentioned the value of family learning, which is happening in her borough. I recently visited a school in Camden that does a great deal of work on family learning, and it is a valued scheme that helps both children and parents. She also said that there are now three city academies in her borough, so Hackney, South and Shoreditch is setting the pace. I agree that it is far from the worst place in the country to live in&mdash;perhaps second best to Gloucester. She said that there has been an 83 per cent. improvement in the catching up of people who have benefited from reading recovery in her area.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/3">The hon. Member for Bristol, West made some interesting points, not least those on the economic enhancement of being able to read from an early age and the knock-on effect for the wider economy. I welcome this opportunity to discuss the literacy levels of children, particularly those from poorer backgrounds. The discussion ties into the debate on how to get the right support for children at the right time. I wish to set it in the context of our wider early years primary work on reading before turning to the distinct contribution of intervention programmes such as reading recovery. I shall also touch upon issues raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> on phonics.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/4">The ability to read underpins all educational achievement. It enables children to grow up equipped to take part in society, to have high expectations and to make the most of their learning. Being able to read is essential not merely because it is the foundation of all other learning but because of the joy that it brings to children and adults throughout their lives, not least in the case of Grace Allen, whom my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North mentioned. It is also true of Zac Dhanda, although for someone aged 10 months it is a matter of chewing the pages of a book rather than reading them.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/5">My hon. Friend is concerned about the high number of children who leave primary school with reading difficulties that cause them real frustration and isolation. Ensuring that children are fluent, enthusiastic readers is a vital part of our goal to give every child the chance to fulfil their potential. We cannot afford to overlook pupils or leave anyone behind. We all stand to share the benefits of an economy and society with less education failure, higher skills, reduced crime and better health. My hon. Friend mentioned the stark statistic of the costs involved when young people end up within the criminal justice system. I believe that the figure that he mentioned was about a quarter of a million pounds a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/6">The Government have overseen significant improvement in educational achievement, particularly in primary schools. In 1997 one third of children left primary school without having mastered the basics of English and maths; now, three quarters achieve that in maths and about four fifths in English. As the hon. Member for Basingstoke said, this is certainly not a time for complacency. The literacy and numeracy strategies, and now the primary national strategy, have proved successful. The 2006 key stage 2 results are the best primary results that we have ever had. More pupils from all socio-economic groups are getting better results, but the performance gap between those from more and less deprived areas is still big, although it has narrowed. A significant minority experience problems that could lead to poor outcomes in later life. That point has been made by several hon. Members in all parts of the Chamber. We need to identify those children early on and work to ensure that their needs are met with a variety of different strategies. Reading recovery is important, but there is a range of things that we can and should do.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/7">The reforms that are outlined in the schools White Paper set out our aim to provide an education that is tailored to meet each child's learning needs and abilities, and to narrow the achievement gaps. We shall support schools by providing resources and training to deliver personalised learning, with more catch-up lessons for children falling behind and more opportunities for schools to provide small group and one-to-one tuition for those children who need such extra help. We have made &pound;990 million available to fund personalised learning between 2005-06 and 2007-08. That money is particularly targeted at schools that face the greatest challenges, including those with pupils from deprived backgrounds or with low prior attainment. It will be for schools themselves to decide how to use the resources available to them to meet the individual needs of their pupils.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/8">The Gilbert review, led by Christine Gilbert, is looking at ways to ensure that personalised learning is a reality in every classroom. It will set out a vision for how teaching and learning should develop between now and 2020. The review will report back to us by the end of the year and I look forward to hearing its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/9">The renewed primary framework for literacy and mathematics was made available to schools at the beginning of this month and will help to raise attainment levels among all pupils. Through the framework, we have enhanced support to schools and early years settings, and drawn on latest classroom good practice and research. The literacy element of the framework draws on the findings of Jim Rose's independent review of the teaching of early reading, which has been well trailed in this debate. Rose advocates quality first teaching, which comprises a blend of well-judged whole-class, group and individual work, as the most effective way to raise standards. He confirms that high-quality phonic work should be an inherent part of quality first teaching. The framework underpins Jim Rose's recommendation that systematic phonic work set within a rich language curriculum is the best route for children in becoming skilled readers.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/10">I support the assertion that my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North made that prevention is better than cure. To that end we are developing the early years foundation stage, which is also informed by Jim Rose's findings. The early years foundation stage is about improving opportunities for all children from birth to the age of five, by giving them the best possible start in life and erasing the artificial divide between care and learning. Evidence shows that an integrated learning and care experience enables children to achieve the best possible outcomes. The early years foundation stage will provide children with the experiences and activities that they need to grow, learn and develop.</p>
	<p pid="b.45.2/11">It is quite a coincidence that earlier today I attended a conference that four children had arranged on the subject of extended schools. Extended schools, children's centres and Sure Start are the best possible demonstration of our long-term commitment to early years. Hon. Members will be aware that we have surpassed our target for extended schools, with more than 3,000 having been created, along with more than 1,000 children's centres, with a view to ensuring that every school is an extended school by the turn of the decade.</p>

	<p pid="b.48.0/1">With the change from Sure Start to children's centres and the consequent reduction per head in the amount of funding that will be available to them, how does the Minister feel the literacy programmes that Sure Start has successfully run to date will be affected?</p>

	<p pid="b.48.1/1">I shall come on to that, although I have seen a range of projects in children's centres, and it seems that more and more are being developed, so I do not agree entirely with the hon. Lady that we shall see a reduction. Rather, there will be a greater level of support through children's centres, but I shall come to that in a few moments.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/2">We know that early access to high-quality care and education has a positive effect on educational achievement. We shall focus on closing the achievement gap between those children and others. Repeated studies show that bright children from poorer households begin to fall behind less able children from more affluent backgrounds from as early an age as just 22 months. At that young age, such children have already become less likely to succeed at school and more likely to become unemployed, and therefore in wider need of support from society but, paradoxically, less able to access it.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/3">We have invested &pound;20 billion in early years and child care, so that there are now more than 1.25 million child care places. We have met our target early to open 1,000 Sure Start children's centres, providing vital support to the parents of 800,000 children throughout the country. There are now 3,000 extended schools, offering wrap-around child care from eight in the morning until six in the evening, and in some cases for longer periods. That is a pretty good demonstration of our commitment. That investment is being rolled out to an extent never seen before in this country, to every community. Every hon. Member here will have noted new children's centres opening in their constituencies, at an average rage of around six for every constituency by the end of the decade. We shall expand that to half of all primary schools by 2008, with the extended schools, and to all schools by 2010. That is quite a multi-billion pound commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/4">The literacy and numeracy strategies, the primary framework and the early years foundation stage are all about getting it right first time, from the earliest age. For some children, intervention will always be necessary. We recognise that we need systems in place that offer second and third chances, by identifying when a child is falling behind and stepping in with extra help to put them back on track for success. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North outlined, reading recovery is an early literacy intervention that offers another chance to those hardest-to-reach children. The programme is directed at those who are the lowest achievers in reading in their class, regardless of any other kind of problem. It aims to return them to the average for their age in a relatively short time.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/5">Reading recovery has been around for some time and we have supported it throughout that period. That is why we are pleased to support the &quot;Every child a reader&quot; project, which is expanding the availability of reading recovery and exploring the wider use of the skilled literacy experts who deliver it. &quot;Every child a reader&quot; is placing specialist literacy teachers who are trained in reading recovery into schools to support those children who are most at risk of not learning to read.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/6">The three-year project is supported and funded in partnership with charitable trusts and the business sector. We are contributing &pound;4.55 million to &quot;Every child a reader&quot; over three years. I heard what my hon. Friend said about his offer to contribute locally in Nottingham, which I am sure will be heard through the airwaves. Helping more children to learn to read is one of the surest ways of making a real difference to their lives. By re-engaging existing reading recovery teachers and training new ones, we are creating a powerful resource in our primary schools. Those teachers are providing invaluable support to children with significant literacy difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/7">Our involvement in &quot;Every child a reader&quot; offers us the opportunity to harness the expertise of reading recovery teachers. It will enable us to explore the potential for those teachers to support tailored literacy teaching more broadly within a school, with an impact beyond those children who receive intensive one-to-one support. &quot;Every child a reader&quot; will also provide us with valuable information about how intensive early literacy support can be provided in the future. If we want all children to succeed in life, we must ensure that they can all read well.</p>
	<p pid="b.48.1/8">An evaluation report of the first year of &quot;Every child a reader&quot; is published next week and I look forward to reading it, as I know my hon. Friend does too. In some respects it would perhaps have been nice to have this debate just after publication, but I look forward to reading it and taking the issue from there. My hon. Friend has invited Ministers along to that event next week, and I hope that the Department will consider the invitation favourably. I congratulate him on securing this worthwhile debate, which has helped to highlight some of the important work that is taking place out there.</p>

	Science in Higher Education
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.50.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="50"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0008.htm#06103157000553">
	<p pid="b.50.1/1">I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to introduce this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/2">The funding of science in higher education in England and Wales is becoming a subject of considerable concern to many, my constituents in particular. When, only a few weeks ago, Reading university staff and students heard that senior management at the university, which is in my constituency, proposed to close the physics department, naturally there was shock and dismay. The shock was all the greater given that many had felt that their future was secure, following a review that concluded six months earlier. The review had expressed the hope that, with the right investment, the physics department's &pound;500,000 per-year losses of the past six years could be turned around.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/3">Reading university has a small but very capable physics department, which has built a strong reputation for research on atomic and molecular physics. That is why the university wanted to save it, if at all possible. Since the review, however, the university has been stung by two financial double whammies that would knock the best-run university off course. The new lecturers' pay settlement and changes to pension arrangements are costly&mdash;there is an additional &pound;1 million per year in extra pension contribution alone, and big rises in energy costs and an ever-growing backlog of maintenance to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/4">Those financial blows have set back not only Reading university; many other universities around the United Kingdom are looking closely at where they could make significant savings. The Reading announcement will not be the last that we hear about a department closing this academic year. I would not criticise the vice-chancellor of any university for closing a department, just as I have not criticised the vice-chancellor at Reading. Reading university is extremely well run and is now among the world'stop 200.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/5">However, it is profoundly disturbing that the axe seems to fall fastest on the pure science subjects such as physics and chemistry. Since Labour came to power in 1997, about 19 physics and 10 chemistry departments have closed across England and Wales. About 80 science departments have closed during the past six years. The Royal Society of Chemistry believes that in 10 years' time, only 40 chemistry departments will be left in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/6">Anyone who has read the Institute of Physics report, which covers 10 physics departments in English universities and was published in July this year, will understand why physics is in the same boat. The IOP report found, first, that all 10 physics departments were in deficit, usually heavily; secondly, that they were very dependent on public funding and the metrics used to allocate it; and thirdly, that they had large, fixed costs and out-of-date lab equipment that required substantial additional investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/7">If universities are to commit substantial funds to physics, they need to be sure that large numbers of students who are attracted to studying the subject can be found. Despite a slight increase in science student numbers in the past two years, no university can base its physics department's medium-term future on potential big increases in physics students. Of course, when measuring a category called &quot;science students&quot;, the Government net can be spread fairly widely. However, if Reading university's experience is anything to go by, the number of physics enrolments has been dropping steadily since 2002, and probably before then, although I do not have the relevant figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/8">Indeed, this year Reading university is getting fewer than half the physics students that it had in 2002. I am told that this year, even in clearing, there were very few physics students wanting to find university places. However, the trend as measured by those taking A-levels is clear: there has been a big drop in those taking physics since 1997. Some 28,800 students took physics A-level in 1997, but only 24,094 did so in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/9">Many in the profession believe that the dropping numbers are due to two main factors. First, the continuing growth of what some describe as &quot;easier&quot; subjects on the curriculum&mdash;why would someone take pure physics, when they can take combined science or media studies? Some of the academics with whom I have discussed the issue believe that the overweening importance of league tables in schools has encouraged teachers to push students towards less challenging subjects.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/10">Secondly, there is a lack of properly qualified and skilled teachers. Now, 80 per cent. of physics teachers do not have a physics degree; their core skill is believed to be biology. One third of all science teachers have a third-class degree or lower. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has told me that the drop in pure science student numbers since 1997 has been a major concern. It also believes that the increasing numbers going to university without a comparative increase in funding has stretched resources to the limit, with a resultant decrease in the scope and breadth of practical science education.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/11">The association believes that the funding of undergraduate higher education must reflect the costof teaching each subject and recognise the importance of the subject to the economy. Many organisations also believe that the decrease in the funding qualifier weighting for laboratory science undergraduate courses, from 2.1 to 1.7, introduced by the Higher Education Funding Council for England in 2004, makes it more difficult for universities to justify further investment in laboratory courses or the refurbishment of facilities. That has amounted to a 20 per cent. cut in science teaching and has impacted dramatically on science departments in universities. If the truth be known, it has been extremely damaging.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/12">Furthermore, if a department is scored a four under the research assessment exercise, the stepped&mdash;or should I say cliff-edge&mdash;approach to funding means that many departments will lack research funding. That student and research funding double whammy, set up by this Government, has killed a number of university science departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/13">I have one final point on funding. Many universities are sick and tired of chasing the multitude of small pots of funding initiatives laid out by the HEFC and others. I was at Reading university only last Friday, and it just so happened that the vice-chancellor had had word of a funding initiative to widen participation for part-time students. That initiative was extremely laudable, but Reading's share of the pot was &pound;985. One is left wondering whether the impact that &pound;985 can make was worth all the effort of setting up the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.0/1">Both the hon. Gentleman and I are involved in the campaign to try to save the physics department at Reading university. He talked about funding, but does he accept that in 2005 Reading university was successful, with the Open university and Leicester university, in a joint bid to the HEFC for a &pound;2.4 million award to create a centre of excellence?</p>
	<p pid="b.52.0/2">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that represented a substantial investment of Government money in the teaching of physics and science? Would it not be a criminal waste of taxpayers' money if the physics department closed and that facility was no longer available in respect of physics teaching at Reading university?</p>

	<p pid="b.52.1/1">I always welcome the interest of the hon. Gentleman in my constituency. I know that the vice-chancellor of Reading university, who has been in post for a long time, is looking forward to meeting him. The key point is that both student numbers and research grants need to come together to fund physics departments. The issue is not just about one or the other; both need to work in concert.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/2">I turn back to funding. Funding schemes are often too complicated and long-winded and end up so diluted by the time they get to the university that they are not much help. There are too many schemes, all achieving too little. Let me provide an example of the dilution of funding meant to help solve recruitment to science, technology, engineering and mathematics, or STEM, subjects. It should be said that the funding to help recruitment in chemistry is much needed. However, one of the strands for the recent Royal Society of Chemistry programme&mdash;&quot;Chemistry for our future&quot;&mdash;has funded a regional co-ordinator simply to co-ordinate all the networks in the south-east aimed at increasing the uptake of chemistry degrees.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/3">Through another strand, Reading and the university of Southampton have been successful in attracting funding for a half-time post to introduce methods designed to accelerate and enhance the way in which new students taking chemistry settle into higher education after secondary school. That is particularly important as universities try to widen participation in chemistry, but it does not do enough to cover those parts of the south and east, especially Kent and Essex, which are under-represented in terms of providing students to do chemistry. Reading and Southampton will need to bid to Aimhigher South East for Kent, and a different Aimhigher for Essex. That is not an untypical example of the complexity of funding streams for improving STEM recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/4">This country needs to make some decisions about whether we wish to retain the traditionally strong science base in the UK. Can the Minister share with us, for example, how many physicists the UK wants or needs? How many institutions are required to provide them? Do the Government, the HEFC and Universities UK take any view about what is needed to retain our position in scientific research? How many university physics departments with how many students is acceptable? Or can the number of departments be allowed to wither to, say, 20 to 30, as some leading academics believe is the intention?</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/5">Those are big questions of great substance, andI am not sure whether the Minister or anybody in Government have the answers. If those questions have not been considered, why not? If they have been considered, let us have the answers, and let us have an honest public debate. Nobody at Reading university wants the physics department to close, as that would have knock-on effects for other departments with a strong physics base such as meteorology, chemistry and others. And before the Minister says it, I certainly do not want him to micro-manage Reading university, as it is extremely well run.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/6">It is without doubt true that the changes in Government policy and in HEFC funding have severely damaged the short to medium-term sustainability of science departments such as the physics department at Reading university. I ask the Minister to consider the changes in funding that his Department and the Government are proposing and to ask his officials to talk with me and Reading university to determine whether they will help to make physics at Reading sustainable. I hope that he will assist me in doing everything possible to ensure that physics at Reading and STEM subjects at other universities get a fair chance to survive. However, if he will not listen to me&mdash;a single voice from the Education and Skills Committee&mdash;perhaps he will consider the report of the Science and Technology Committee, which stated that</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/7" class="indent">&quot;it is reasonable to assume that there will be further closures. If this process continues unchecked, there is a very real possibility that the system will no longer be able to provide sufficient numbers of STEM graduates to meet the needs of the UK economy.&quot;</p>

I listened carefully to what he said; it was instructive.

	<p pid="b.54.5/1">I will address the hon. Gentleman's comments later. I do not think that there is any evidence anywhere in the advanced world that central Government Departments dictating to universities which subjects they should deliver is the way to a sustainable future. A significant debate is taking place in the European Union about why our higher education institutions are not competitive compared with those of the United States. In fact, we are in pole position. We have a much better record, and it is based largely on university autonomy and an ability to play to strengths. It puts our universities in a much stronger position competitively than some other universities elsewhere in the European Union. That consensus is widely accepted.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.5/2">However, the Government are concerned about the overall strategic position, which is why, in stark contrast to the comments of the hon. Member for Reading, East, we have increased funding for higher education by more than 20 per cent. in real terms since we took office. He spoke about bolts out of the blue that have hit universities&mdash;for example, the pay settlement. I remind him that the universities collectively negotiated the pay settlements. I do not see how they could have come as a bolt out of the blue.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.5/3">Nevertheless, we spend more than &pound;10 billion a year on higher education&mdash;or rather, that is the sum that we allocate to universities to be spent. After a generation of reductions in the units of resource, the vast majority of which took place under Conservative Governments, we are maintaining funding per student in real terms during a period when the number of students in the system has increased by well over 200,000. I ask the hon. Gentleman to compare and contrast that withthe last five years of the previous Conservative Administration, when funding per student fell by almost 20 per cent. in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.5/4">I am prepared to take constructive criticism on the Government's record&mdash;we can, and need, to do more&mdash;but I will not take lectures from the Conservative party about support and funding for our universities. Any vice-chancellor in this country will favourably compare the funding regime that exists today with the one that existed in the run-up to 1997.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.5/5">Let me pick up on some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1774" name="Martin Salter">the specific points. My hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West (Martin Salter)</phrase> raised some important questions. He has been pressing me strongly on these issues for a considerable time. I know that correspondence has gone directly from the university to him about the sustainability of some of the increases in investment and the fact that they will follow through. There is a responsibility on university authorities to explain that clearly. We are shortly to meet a delegation that he is bringing to the Department, and I understand that he has generously opened the meeting to the hon. Member for Reading, East.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.5/6">I was interested as well in the hon. Gentleman's website, on which he says that the decline in numbers is driven by the Government's desire to put easier subjects on what he describes as the school menu. I do not know where that comes from. There is no central Government directive on which subjects students should study. One of the problems that we face as a country and as a society is how we can enthuse and interest many more young people in the study and teaching of science. Yes, there are things that the Government can do, should do and, indeed, are doing, but we are discussing wider societal forces. We must collectively contribute to how science is depicted in our media and in our culture.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.5/7">The hon. Gentleman also talked about what he described as the scourge of league tables driving a decline in the study of science teaching. Unless my understanding is mistaken, I do not recall Conservative Front Benchers calling for the abolition of school league tables, and I am not sure about the purpose of that point.</p>

	<p pid="b.55.0/1">The point was not one that I or my Front Benchers were making, but something that was reported to me by a number of academics who are concerned about it. I thought I should report their concerns rather than just my own as part of the debate.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="55"  time="012:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0009.htm#06103157000564">
	<p pid="b.55.1/1">I do not accept that the proper publication of information about a school's performance leads to a reduction in the study of science subjects. As the hon. Gentleman has raised the point, I will give him the opportunity to make it clear whether he is calling for the abolition of school league tables. If he is not&mdash;I do not believe that he is&mdash;I do not see the point of reporting those comments in the way that he has.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/2">Let me talk about the extra 200,000 students who are in our system today as compared with nine and a half years ago. Some 130,000 of those are studying science-related degrees. Recently, the Royal Society criticised the Higher Education Statistics Agency's figures on science and maths graduates. I am always happy to talk to the Royal Society, but if we had wanted to present the best possible figures on the overall number of science students, we would have said that the increase was nearer to 190,000 since 1997. We used the figure of 130,000 to take account of the changes in methodology.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/3">The issue is what counts as science and the market share of some of the more traditional subjects. Science does not stand still and the fact that newer subjects, such as computer and biological sciences, have become more popular is not on its own something to be concerned about. There is no evidence that graduates in such subjects fail to get good, well-paid jobs or to contribute significantly to our overall science base.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/4">At the same time, we have acknowledged that we need to maintain national capacity in STEM subjects. I acknowledge that there have been several years of decline in those, but the figures for the past couple of years are encouraging. Last year we saw a significant increase in the figures for maths and chemistry, and that has been sustained this year. I want to see it increase further. It is in marked contrast to what went on previously, in major part because of some of the changes that we have made in the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.1/5">We have also&mdash;rightly in my view&mdash;made tough decisions to allow higher education providers to raise more money to support science and other subjects through variable fees. If the hon. Gentleman is calling for increased resources for universities, I will charitably remind him that the Conservative party opposed the introduction of variable fees, and it is that mechanism that will bring an additional net &pound;1.35 billion into our universities.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.0/1">If the Minister looks at my comments in detail, he will see that I am concerned about the way in which the spending is being directed with regard to the weighting for teaching, rather than the overall amount of funding going into science and education or into the higher education system. Perhaps he could address that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.56.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="56"  time="012:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0009.htm#06103157000566">
	<p pid="b.56.1/1">I will address it, although the point that I am trying to make is that the funding record, through both public and private resource, of the Government towards our universities is demonstrably better than the previous funding record. However, there is an issue about the funding weighting, and the hon. Gentleman will be aware that HEFC is considering that. However, it is not as simple as it might seem at first sight. If funding is redistributed towards a particular set of subjects, the money in the funding envelope will inevitably have to decrease, which raises challenges in itself. As I said, the matter is being considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/2">We need to get some of the debate about the closure of science departments into context. Physics is still taught as a major subject at some 50 UK higher education institutions, and chemistry is taught at 70. Universities are playing to their strengths in a competitive market. For example, Exeter university closed its chemistry department to strengthen physics while Newcastle university reduced its physics provision to strengthen chemistry. All the closures are reported and we hear much less about the areas that receive extra resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/3">The freedom of universities to decide the courses they teach and their pursuit of excellence help to make our higher education system the success that it is, but few universities can compete at a level that ensures that they are excellent in every subject. The increasingly global nature of higher education and the forces of competition will push them towards specialising in the areas where they are excellent.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/4">Although market forces are and will continue to be crucial in determining the success of the sector, the Government's policy is not simply to let the market rip. In accepting the advice from HEFC about how we might strengthen and secure higher education subjects and courses of strategic importance such as science, we stressed to universities that in return for not intervening in departmental closures we expected them to work in partnership with each other and HEFC to manage shifts in provision effectively and to ensure no loss of capacity overall. To take the example of Exeter university again, when it closed its chemistry department, which received a lot of publicity at the time, extra places were made available at other universities within the south-west so that the overall numbers did not decrease.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/5">We also need to do more to provide the right kind of provision within our universities to ensure as much access as possible. Developments such as foundation degrees, which are designed alongside employers' needs, are a helpful part of the way forward. We are also doing much more to try to stimulate demand for science subjects in our universities. Whatever we do at university level, it is the demands of young people, and the subjects that they study, get involved in and get enthused for in our schools that are the critical influencing factors. We are devoting more resources: extending the opportunity for young people to study triple science at GCSE, piloting 250 after-school science clubs, and improving careers information. We need to get it across to young people that the graduate earnings premium for a STEM subject in this country is about 25 per cent. more than for a non-STEM subject. That can shape young people's decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/6">We certainly need to do more to support the professional development of science teachers and lecturers.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.58.0/1">I want the Minister to deal with the points that I raised about whether he takes a view on how many physicists or departments we need in this country. Has any research been done on that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.58.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" colnum="58"  time="012:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0009.htm#06103157000568">
	<p pid="b.58.1/1">I am happy to follow that up in writing. We have certainly set out specific targets for the number of additional entrants for A-level qualifications that we wish to see by 2014. That will be a significant step change. I think that we can make progress on that target, and if we can achieve it we will see the numbers flowing through to universities.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/2">We also need to ensure that we continue with a supply of highly qualified school teachers and lecturers. That is of absolute importance. To incentivise and recruit a wider pool of excellent and good science teachers, we have increased the teacher training bursary and the &quot;golden hello&quot; payment for new science teachers. I made the point when I gave evidence to the Science and Technology Committee that the increased number of those who are going into teacher training to study science subjects and the increasing number of those who take that route with an upper second-class or first-class honours degree gives me confidence. Over time, we are seeing the quality increase.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/3">Finally, on research, the hon. Gentleman referred to the research funding base. We have just completed a consultation exercise on moving from the research assessment exercise to a metrics-based system. He talked about the cliff edge, and from the next RAE in 2008 we will replace the rating system with quality profiles that will give better recognition to pockets of excellence within otherwise good departments. That will go a long way to counter the cliff-edge effect of the award of a four rather than a five rating to one department.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.1/4">We have a strong record. We have invested significantly in our science and research base through our universities, but we all need to do much more to enthuse and inspire young people to take up the science subjects.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.1/1">I am grateful to have secured this debate, which is on a subject that is important for the people of Lancashire in general and particularly of east Lancashire. I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" name="Kitty Ussher">my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher)</phrase> is present; I hope that she is able to catch your eye, Mr. Bayley, and has the chance to contribute to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/2">I place on record my heartfelt thanks, and the thanks of my constituents, to the men and women of the Lancashire fire and rescue service. They do outstanding work on our behalf. It is said that in a fire we will flee the building but that the job of the fire and rescue service is to run into the building, but like many old sayings it has more than a grain of truth. I am grateful to them for the work that they do.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/3">I welcome the review of fire and rescue services. Lancashire has historical arrangements for the siting of fire stations that reflect the county of old rather than the modern one. If we look back to 50 years ago, Lancashire had thousands of cotton mills, much heavy industry and engineering works, and hundreds of thousands of terraced houses that were mostly heated by coal, all of which presented a serious fire hazard. Now the cotton has gone, as has the heavy engineering and the heavy industry; the terraced houses are still there but they are no longer heated by coal, so the nature of the fire threat has changed substantially. As an example of that change, 50 years ago Lancashire had no motorways; it now has the most extensive motorway network of any English county. That presents a changed threat for the fire and rescue service.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/4">I also commend the words of Lancashire's chief fire officer, Peter Holland, who does an excellent job. It is easy for the public services to shy away from the tough decisions that have to be taken, but Peter Holland should be commended for having the bravery and the vision to propose a review. When launching it, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/5" class="indent">&quot;This is very different to reviews conducted in previous years, as its primary focus is on protecting life as well as property. In the past we have based our reviews on a historical approach to preserving property but nowadays we need to move the focus to life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/6">That is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/7">I turn to the proposals as they affect my constituency of Hyndburn. We have six fire engines. Two are full-time and four are retained, and they are spread across three fire stations. Hyndburn's fire station in Accrington, which has two full-time engines and one retained, would lose the retained engine. Great Harwood fire station, which has two retained engines, would lose one of them. Haslingden fire station, which has one retained engine, would lose it, and the station would close. That would leave my constituency with three fire engines instead of six.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/8">I turn to the statistics on which the proposals are based, and to Great Harwood fire station. I should declare an interest, Mr. Bayley, in that I grew up around the corner from that fire station, and my dad was a firefighter there&mdash;probably about a million years ago. Last year, Great Harwood's two retained engines were mobilised 320 times; those incidents resulted in one fatality, and 68 people were rescued. It is worth bearing it in mind that 70 of those mobilisations were to areas covered by the Hyndburn fire station in Accrington, where it is proposed cutting one retained engine.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/9">At the Hyndburn fire station in Accrington, which has two full-time engines and one retained, the proposals would result in the loss of the retained engine. Last year, Hyndburn fire engines were mobilised just over 2,000 times; those incidents resulted in five fatalities, and just over 600 people were saved.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/10">On the figures published by Lancashire fire and rescue service, only 82 of those mobilisations were by the retained crew. However, I see a statistical flaw. The retained engine in Accrington was previously stationed at Oswaldtwistle fire station, which closed a few years ago. Most hon. Members will understand that a retained crew has a turn-out time to allow people to get from where they work or live to the fire station. Clearly, moving an engine from one station to another has an effect. There were difficulties in recruiting a retained crew in the year on which those statistics are based, which is why there were only 82 mobilisations by that engine.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/11">I visited the Hyndburn fire station in August, and I met the crew of engine E702&mdash;the retained one. The crew said that they had already taken part in 168 mobilisations this year. In the first eight months of the year, the retained crew at Accrington had therefore responded to more than twice as many incidents as in the previous year, the year on which the review statistics were based. Given that by the end of this year the retained crew in Accrington are bound to have responded to more than 200 incidents, I am not convinced that we can afford to lose it.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/12">The Haslingden fire station has one retained engine, and the review proposes that it be lost and that the station be closed. Last year, that engine and crew responded to 173 incidents, which resulted in five fatalities and 89 rescues. However, 23 of those incidents were out of the area&mdash;mainly in the area covered by the Rowtenstall fire station. I went to Haslingden fire station to meet the crew and to hear what they thought of the proposal to close their station. They met me with great courtesy and made me a cup of tea; they were about to explain how crucial they were to public safety in my constituency when the bell went. They had been called out to a fire. No matter what I say, nothing could be a more eloquent depiction of why that crew and that engine are needed. Sometimes, actions speak louder than words.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/13">I want to get across the fact that all those fire stations&mdash;the Haslingden station, the Hyndburn station in Accrington and the Great Harwood station&mdash;are interdependent. For instance, Padiham fire station in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley has two retained engines; the proposal would mean losing one. However, Padiham sometimes turns out to incidents in the Great Harwood area, which has two retained engines&mdash;the proposal is to lose one of them&mdash;and the Great Harwood engines sometimes turn out for incidents in Padiham. They back up each other. It seems far from certain that a proposal for both fire stations to have only half the number of engines would meet concerns about public safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/14">Lancashire fire and rescue service is absolutely right to hold a review. It is easy in public life to duck the tough decisions. It is right to face up to them. Councillor Bob Wilkinson, the chairman of the Lancashire combined fire authority, which also covers the unitary areas of Blackburn with Darwen and Blackpool, is right to face up to the challenge. We need a fire service that is fit for the 21st century, not one that looks back to the Lancashire of old.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/15">I commend what Councillor Wilkinson said when he launched the consultation. He said that he wanted genuine consultation, that no decisions had yet been made, that the proposals were up for discussion, and that the combined fire authority would listen to the representations of members of the public and Members of Parliament before making their decision in December. I welcome that. It is important that the consultation process is transparent and that it commands public support. I am grateful that the combined fire authority will be listening to our deliberations today.</p>
	<p pid="b.59.1/16">Last year, the four retained fire engines in my constituency turned out 600 times and rescued more than 100 people. I wish to say to the Minister, as I know he takes a great interest in these issues, and through him to the Lancashire fire and rescue service, that if there are 600 occasions on which the four retained engines turned out and 100 people were rescued, can we really afford to lose three of the four retained engines in my constituency? My view and the view of the overwhelming majority of my constituents is that we cannot.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1650" name="Greg Pope">my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope)</phrase> on securing this debate at such a critical time. I understand that the consultation closes the week after next so it is very useful to have this opportunity to make our concerns known at this time. Thank you, Mr. Bayley, for giving me the opportunity to contribute. My thanks go to my hon. Friend and the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/2">In the market town of Padiham in my constituency there are two retained fire engines and crews. The proposal is to halve that to one. I had the privilege of visiting Padiham fire station a few weeks ago and had not only a cup of tea, but a quick ride in the engine, which has always been a childhood fantasy, so it was very enjoyable. I listened to the concerns of the crew who are dedicated, hard-working people. They also have day jobs and volunteer practically all hours of the night and whenever they are available to keep my constituents safe. They explained to me their very real concerns about what is being proposed.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/3">On Sunday, I attended a public meeting for the residents of Padiham and, more widely, Burnley. It was the largest public meeting I have ever attended in Padiham&mdash;larger than the public meeting we had on proposed changes to the hospital, which people were pretty excited about. There were more than 150 people who were unanimous in their concerns about what is being proposed. The main concern is that the population of Padiham is growing; it is a great place to live and is expanding. It seems counter-intuitive to halve the fire cover at such a time. I have also been told that the two retained crews in Padiham are often asked to help in the much larger neighbouring town of Burnley. If they are pulled into Burnley, I am concerned about what happens if there is a fire locally in Padiham. Surely, that is not in the interests of Padihamers.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/4">The crews also cover rural areas outside my constituency, not just in the constituency of my hon. Friend, but in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the constituency of the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase> and indeed even further afield in the villages of Higham, Simonstone, Read, Sabden and, of course, Great Harwood. Those are a spattering of the villages in east Lancashire that are dependent on the two crews. Travel times are always longer in rural areas and we are concerned about the effect on populations where the coverage will halve.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/5">We have some potentially complex situations in nearby industrial estates, for example on the Shuttleworth Mead estate and across the border in Simonstone. I am optimistic that we will have even more manufacturing companies in my constituency now that we have, I hope, been successful in obtaining assisted area status for Padiham. That could lead to fires that need a large resource, not one that is declining.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/6">I congratulate the <i>Padiham Express </i>and its sister publication the <i>Burnley Express </i>on the way they have explained to people the threat that is facing them&mdash;I have had an enormous response. I have also heard that we have been in this situation in the past. When my predecessor Peter Pike was the MP it was proposed in a routine review of the configuration of services that the capacity at Padiham be halved and then in the cold light of day when the fire authority looked at the proposals, it realised it was not in the public interest and did not go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/7">This is another of those situations and I hope that the Minister will give us some reassurance that perhaps the fire authority will again decide not to halve the capacity at Padiham.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1650" name="Greg Pope">my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope)</phrase> on securing this debate. I particularly commend the way he has gone about it: the methodology he adopted is a template for how MPs should approach these Adjournment debates. He placed the issue in its historical context by explaining the background of his area in Lancashire and talked about the terraced houses, what the fire threat was and how many people he knows who have lost their lives as a result of that situation. He researched the facts, figures and finances, but more importantly, I imagine he visited the people affected. I congratulate him on his story of the bell going off at Haslingden fire station. That is, as he said, a telling piece of evidence for his case. My hon. Friend acknowledged the good intent of the Lancashire fire authority and its acceptance of its duty in facing up to the tough decisions that we all know it takes. He then coolly, logically and with passion put his argument in that context. I thank him for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/2">My hon. Friend might not thank me that in my research I looked at his website. It pointed out that,</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/3" class="indent">&quot;he is thought to be the only Member of Parliament to have invaded the stage during a gig by The Clash in 1978&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/4">In my mind that is a badge of honour and I commend him.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/5">I will write to Councillor Wilkinson and the chief fire officer, Peter Holland, and his deputy, Peter O'Brian, and enclose a copy of <i>Hansard</i> from this debate so that the argument that has been made is relayed to him through my office. I undertake to do that and in preparation for my research I will put on the record what I discovered about the context of where this comes from in relation to Government policy. I hope that will help the consultation and the process go forward both for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" name="Kitty Ussher">my hon. Friend and my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher)</phrase> who also did her research and visited the fire engine. I can tell her it is not the second time this has happened; it is about the fourth. I cannot agree to the last request, but I can pass that strong argument on.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/6">In the national context, the strategy that the Government are pursuing is to put the emphasis on prevention. There are many weapons that we have in that regard, for example: building regulations; the work of the fire and rescue authorities themselves; new equipment provided through the new dimension programme; and the on-going programmes for improvements in radio communications and regional controls centres. All those will make this country the best in the world for fire and rescue authorities at work. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn in congratulating and passing on thanks to the men and women of the fire service who risk their lives and tragically occasionally lose their lives through what they do.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/7">I strongly and passionately believe that the success of our fire and rescue strategy is one of the unsung successes of this Government. I acknowledge the work that was done by previous Governments, but the figures speak for themselves. We have had a decline year on year in the number of deaths from fire. We now have the lowest figures since 1959. I put that down to the intervention by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, who was responsible for the strategy over the past nine years.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/8">The matters that my hon. Friend raised today are included in a consultation document issued, as he said, by Lancashire fire and rescue service. It has the snappy title of &quot;Integrated Risk Management Plan Draft Year 4 Action Plan 2007-08&quot;. I think that &quot;Draft&quot; is the word to which he would most want me to draw attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/9">The debate is timely. It enables me to pass on information that my hon. Friend has given and to advise him on the best means by which to present his case. It also has a spin-off: it enables me to make a general point about the fact that the Government have devolved to local levels decision making in the fire and rescue service. I need to make the point that it is not the role of Ministers to agree the operational proposals in the plans of any local fire and rescue authority&mdash;of course, my hon. Friend did not ask me to do so. That is a matter for the elected members of the authority in question. They are best placed to act on the professional advice of chief officers. They balance the competing local demands placed on the resources available to them. They are the best judges of the balance that should be struck for the benefit of the communities that they serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/10">That arrangement is part of the Government's policy to devolve functions down the delivery chain whenever possible. We aim to move decisions away from central Government towards local areas, local people and their elected representatives. I urge my hon. Friend, therefore, to continue the work with his local fire authority. I have been able to establish that he has time available to do that&mdash;I will give more details of that&mdash;and that local officials are happy to meet him to discuss the points that he has put so cogently today. They have given me that assurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/11">My Department has been in touch with Lancashire fire and rescue service. It confirms that the status of the integrated risk management plan, or IRMP as it is known in the jargon of the trade, remains a consultation document. It went out for full public consultation for 12 weeks from <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-24">24 August</phrase>. As my hon. Friend said, that exercise has not yet finished. It ends on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase>, but the elected members of the combined fire authority will not consider the outcome of the exercise until <phrase class="date" code="">18 December</phrase>, so my hon. Friends have time on their side.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/12">The local basis for the integrated risk management plans is spelt out clearly in the Department's document entitled &quot;The Fire and Rescue National Framework&quot;. The latest edition was published last April and covers the years 2006 to 2008. It states:</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Since April 2003 every Fire and Rescue Authority has been required to produce a local IRMP that sets out the authority's strategy, in collaboration with other agencies&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/14">The departmental framework document sets out five issues that need to be addressed in the plan. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn will want to refer to those when he makes his representations. First, it seeks moves to reduce the number of fires, road traffic accidents and other emergency incidents. Secondly, it seeks moves to reduce the severity of injuries in each incident. Thirdly, it seeks moves to reduce the economic and social impact of fires and other emergency incidents. Fourthly, it seeks plans that will safeguard the environment. Finally, it seeks plans that provide value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/15">Lancashire, like every other authority, has to keep its plan under review and to revise it regularly. Those arrangements give my hon. Friend and all other hon. Members good opportunities to make representations on behalf of their constituents. Under the previous arrangements, such opportunities did not exist. National standards applied instead, which were dictated by Whitehall. Some of those were set as long ago as 1938, when population patterns, and certainly the situation in Lancashire, which my hon. Friend described, were very different. I have described how, today, IRMPs are based on risk to life. The old national standards were based only on types and location of property, so my hon. Friend's points about the changes in Lancashire are very pertinent.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/16">I hope that what I have said will prove to be of assistance to my hon. Friends the Members for Hyndburn and for Burnley in presenting their cases on behalf of their constituents. The debate has provided me with an opportunity to make a more general point about modernisation in the fire and rescue service. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said last week in the preface to the local government White Paper that we must</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/17" class="indent">&quot;show our confidence in local government, local communities and other public service providers by giving them more freedom and powers to bring about the changes they want to see.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/18">In the fire and rescue service, we have already seen evidence of that. I hope that I have helped my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn and that he will accept my thanks for helping me in his turn.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.66.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" speakername="Nigel Waterson" colnum="66"  time="013:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0011.htm#06103157000572">
	<p pid="b.66.1/1">I am most grateful for this slightly extended opportunity to discuss NHS reconfiguration in my part of the world and for another opportunity to register the very strong feelings locally on possible reductions in core services, not only at my local district general hospital in Eastbourne but at the Conquest hospital in Hastings, both of which are part of the East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust. It is important to place my remarks in context. Although they are directed mainly at the Eastbourne situation, they are broadly designed also to make the case for all the people in outlying areas who depend on and look to the Eastbourne DGH, and for people in Hastings, who, rightly, feel equally strongly about retaining services there, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/2">Not long ago we had a march&mdash;marches are becoming quite common along the south coast&mdash;with more than 5,000 people. That is quite an achievement in Eastbourne, which is not a place given to protest marches. There was a march of a similar size in Hastings. We have had some 30,000 signatures on a petition and some 20,000 visits to our campaign website. I receive daily letters, e-mails and telephone calls to my constituency office from local people who are concerned about what may happen to their local health service. With all due respect to the Minister, whom I am delighted to see in her place, we have also gone to the top of the food chain and had a meeting recently with the Prime Minister, who undertook to take on board our concerns and look into the matter. Perhaps the Minister can report today on whether prime ministerial interest has had an effect on subsequent developments.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/3">It is important to stress that this is a cross-party and cross-community campaign. It involves not only me as the local MP, but the local Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens and a range of Churches and other community organisations. It is also important to stress that although there has been speculation about services being moved from one site to the other, as between Eastbourne and Hastings, our attitude has not been one of &quot;beggar my neighbour&quot;. We believe that broadly the same core services should be available to the communities in both Eastbourne and Hastings, not least because there are 21 miles of indifferent road connections between the two. However, this is not a transport debate, so I shall not worry the Minister by going into that issue on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/4">I should like to say a few words about the process thus far. In my view, it has been thoroughly unsatisfactory, lacking transparency, worrying local people and sapping morale among NHS staff. It is high time that Ministers and NHS bosses came clean about who is really making the decisions, on what basis and even whether crucial decisions to downgrade services have in fact already been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/5">In addition, at the same time as the various discussions and meetings of what are called stakeholders in the NHS have been taking place, there has been a plethora of rumours, briefings and counter-briefings, mostly emanating from different parts of the NHS structure locally. All that is taking place against a background of turbulence and change in the organisation of the NHS itself. It might almost have been designed to occur now to ensure, first, new and inexperienced non-executive directors and, secondly, new chief executives who have no local roots&mdash;possibly hand-picked to deliver a particular agenda.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/6">Perhaps I can leap ahead and speculate on some of the things that the Minister will say in response to the debate. I am sure, for example, that she will say that no decisions have yet been taken. I attended yet another stakeholder meeting the other day, which got fairly rowdy as local people, as much as elected politicians such as me, expressed considerable disbelief in the suggestion that no decisions had been made and that everything was up for grabs. What seems to be happening, to use, again, the quaint language that seems to permeate the NHS nowadays&mdash;perhaps it always did; I do not know&mdash;is that what are called emerging scenarios are being presented. They seem to include reducing maternity services to one site rather than two; possibly downgrading accident and emergency at one or other, or both, sites; and changes affecting paediatrics.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/7">It is clear that several parallel processes are going on at the same time. From minutes of meetings that have been held at the local NHS hospitals trust, and various board meetings, it is clear that the scenario that has emerged is what is called a &quot;one-site solution&quot; to maternity services. There is thus considerable scepticism about the assertion, oft-repeated by local officials in the NHS, that no decisions have yet been taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/8">The second thing that I suspect the Minister will say is something to the effect that the south-east of England is living beyond its means&mdash;according to the Government's figures we have a deficit of about&pound;130 million or &pound;140 million across the south-east region&mdash;and that that more or less equates to our being overfunded compared with other parts of the country. I do not want to get too much into the funding formulae; however, I have two or three points to make. Even if the figures are taken as given, for the start of the discussion, the Minister will, I think, be the first to concede that in the hospitals trust and primary care trust in my area there have been manful attempts&mdash;mostly successful&mdash;to reduce the deficits, and that any that remain are dwarfed by some of the deficits further up country, particularly in places such as Surrey. Lumping us all together in the south-east as having a big deficit is an unfair approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/9">The so-called historic deficits also present an issue. It seems very unfair that new management teams and sets of non-executive directors are saddled with historic deficit figures. I put it to the Prime Minister when we met him that a system could surely be arrived at that would fairly reflect the deficits and the way in which they should be treated in the current situation. Perhaps if the management of a particular trust could, in a period of 12 months, show that it could run its services in balance according to the current formula, it could be allowed to turn the historic deficit into some sort of mortgage, repayable over 20 or 30 years. That is merely a suggestion, but it might be a fair way to deal with historic deficits and efficient local management. I also believe very strongly that the funding formula itself, which was, of course, changed in 1998, needs to be more transparent and more obviously fair. We have the highest proportion of over-85-year-olds in the country&mdash;indeed, one of my constituents recently celebrated his 110th birthday&mdash;and that is not fully reflected in the funding formulae.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/10">I am sure, thirdly, that the Minister will say that the changes are designed to improve patient care. Again, there is a great deal of scepticism about that. As recently as August 2004 a thorough clinical review by the trust concluded that maternity services should remain on both sites. What has changed in those two years? The local population has continued to grow. The birth rate has risen. Two respected consultants have said publicly that lives would be at risk if one site were shut down. The only thing that has changed is the financial position. It appears that Ministers want to save money and that the south-east is being singled out for cuts.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/11">The leading consultants in obstetrics and gynaecology whom I just mentioned have both now left the local trust. One of them told me the other day that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has a half-hour standard between the decision to perform a caesarean operation and carrying it out. There is no way that that half-hour standard could be met if the patient had to be taken from Eastbourne to Hastings or vice versa. There have been various attempts locally to call the royal college in aid in relation to a one-site solution for maternity, but it turns out that none of its visits or reports had anything to do with reconfiguration. Indeed, an interesting side product of one of its visits was some statistics, showing that contrary to what people had been assuming, which was that Hastings with its higher levels of social deprivation would have a higher level of difficult births, The reverse is true:</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Eastbourne has the higher induction of labour rate, caesarean rate and admission to SCBU rate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/13">That flies in the face of some of the assumptions that seem wrongly to have been made by those in authority. There is evidence, if anything, of greater need in Eastbourne.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/14">Fourthly, the Minister will no doubt say that the decisions will not be based on money. I say look at the 2004 report, and I ask again what has changed since then. We have also been hearing a lot about the European working time directive, as if it had been parachuted into the situation to everyone's shock and surprise. Whatever the implications of that directive and of related court cases, it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that there is a proper supply of junior doctors&mdash;and of consultants and midwives. If one were running a commercial organisation one would have to go out and recruit more people. In the end perhaps it all just comes back to money after all.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/15">Fifthly, the Minister will say&mdash;I have heard her say it before&mdash;that decisions will be made locally. With all respect to her, that beggars belief, because the financial envelope, as it is called, will be determined by Ministers. There seems to be some confusion about decision making. The Minister has said that she believes decisions will be made locally. The Prime Minister seems to think that they will be made by the strategic health authority. The chairman of my hospitals trust seems to think that decisions will be made by Ministers. I put the matter the other day, at a meeting that the Minister kindly organised, to Candy Morris, the chief executive of the strategic health authority. She made it very clear that decisions will be made by primary care trusts. I have already explained that we have new PCTs in our area, with new management, new chief executives and new non-executive directors. I am rather dubious about their ability, or their willingness, at such an early stage of their careers or lives, to make such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/16"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1622" name="Michael Jabez Foster">The hon. Member for Hastings and Rye (Michael Jabez Foster)</phrase> subsequently asked, at the same meeting, what would happen if the PCTs decided that they were quite happy with existing arrangements and were prepared to continue supporting and funding them. The answer was a bit vague, but the question throws into sharp relief the issue of how a strategic view of health provision and need will be arrived at if each individual PCT will be making the decisions. There seems to be some doubt as to whether they can and will be taken at that sort of level?</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/17">I am sure that the Minister will seek to reassure me that decisions will not be taken on any political grounds. I stress that we in the campaign are not luddites. We understand that health provision must change to reflect medical advances and patient need, but life and death decisions for local communities such as that in Eastbourne must be based on clinical evidence and community need, not party politics. If they are not, there will be no limit to the anger of my constituents. I reiterate that we have a growing population, both a rising birth rate and a high proportion of over-85s at the other end of the scale, and an increasing need for the very core services that seem to be under threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/18">We have heard a lot recently about so-called heat maps and meetings between Health Ministers and the chairman of the Labour party. Then, of course, we were reassured that the point of one such meeting was not what we thought and that it was simply a normal briefing. I am sure that the Minister will say something along those lines today. I hope that that is the case, but I shall leave the Chamber with one small anecdote. The other day, I was in the office of the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the hon. Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, having a constructive and productive meeting on osteoporosis and bone scanning. As my eyes wandered around his office, I noticed that over the desk where he sits there was a map of the country, which was broken down not by population, morbidity or death rates, but into blue, red and orange. I do not insinuate that that is one of the so-called heat maps that we have heard so much about; it may simply reflect his genuine interest in the psephological make-up of the United Kingdom. I really want to be reassured by the Minister, and to believe that these decisions will have nothing to do with politics, and so do my constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.69.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="69"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0011.htm#06103157000573">
	<p pid="b.69.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1564" name="Nigel Waterson">the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know that this matter is of great interest to him and his constituents, and is of wider interest to other hon. Members who represent constituencies in East Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/2">I take this opportunity to congratulate the staff in East Sussex for the hard work that they put into improving services. As in other parts of England, millions of people there are receiving high-quality and safe services every day, and are receiving treatment quicker than ever before. Also, there has been a willingness to consider what changes are needed to deal with the different demands on our health service compared with those 20 years ago. In East Sussex, for example, the community-based primary care trust's falls team is now running clinics and exercise classes in Seaford, and will soon be doing so in Amberstone. The team is also running a &quot;sloppy slipper&quot; programme, which I am interested in. The programme has been used in other parts of the country, and has found that older people's footwear contributes to unnecessary falls and, therefore, unnecessary discomfort, pain and admission to hospital. The programme involves going into residential care homes, in particular, and talking to staff and residents about their footwear. That rather common-sense approach contributes to people not having unnecessary falls.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/3">Also in Eastbourne, the Firwood rehabilitation unit offers patients the choice of being treated there or at home. It also offers a full multi-disciplinary one-stop shop for many clients, and is gradually increasing the sessions available for different groups, such as people with multiple sclerosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/4">The PCT also works with agencies such as social services, the local authority and voluntary agencies so that community initiatives can be delivered with a broader perspective. I understand that the William Daly centre, which is funded by health and social services and the local authority, provides day care and activities. There are also moves to involve the voluntary sector more widely. I am pleased that there is a willingness to discuss the different services that are needed for all the communities in East Sussex, including the hon. Gentleman's.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/5">Waiting times for in-patient treatment have fallen, and 98.8 per cent. of patients are now seen, diagnosed and treated within four hours of arriving at accident and emergency departments. In the hon. Gentleman's constituency, Eastbourne Downs PCT, which has become part of the newly formed Sussex Downs and Weald PCT, has achieved those targets. No doubt, it will now want to work toward the 18-week maximum waiting time, which we hope to achieve in the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/6">I am sure that it will interest the hon. Gentleman, as it does me, to know that although we are at record levels in terms of access to treatment, when the public are asked about what they would like to happen with waiting times, they certainly want them not to stay as they are, but to go down further. That is the public expectation, which fits with what the public was telling us through our White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, which committed the NHS to shifting more care into community settings and was based on what people were saying.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/7">As technology advances and the recognition of the value of prevention takes hold more in our NHS, we have an opportunity to provide the sort of services that simply could not have been provided 20 years ago, such as scans. For example, nurses are now able to perform procedures that they were not previously allowed to do and pharmacists play a role by providing services or working with others to provide necessary clinics. This summer, I worked with community matrons&mdash;I say worked, but really I was watching what they do in their expert fashion&mdash;and saw the difference that people in that sort of role can have in a community setting, through work with the hospitals in A and E clinics, and with respiratory nurses, social services and others to support people with long-term conditions. That sort of work helps such people to manage their conditions in their own homes, often with the support of their families, and to have better health.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/8">In June, we announced that up to &pound;750 million in capital will be available in the next five years to develop a range of different models for new community hospitals and services. We do not suggest that there is a one-size-fits-all approach, but think that every community has particular needs and challenges to address. What is appropriate in Eastbourne might be different from what is appropriate for other parts of Sussex or, for that matter, the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/9">We have already refurbished or replaced 3,000 general practitioners' premises, and will have built 750 new health centres by 2008. There will also be even more NHS one-stop centres and purpose-built facilities at which GP services are on the same site as pharmacies and social services. Providing that integrated approach is as important in urban settings as in rural areas, because it means that appropriate services can be provided and it brings together different health and other professionals, such as those in social services, to work in a more appropriate and accessible way to meet the needs of different communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/10">It is also important to make better use of new and improved surgical techniques. For certain operations that would, years ago, have required a stay in hospital of a week to 10 days, that is often no longer the case, thank goodness. New drugs and more effective treatments are driving the changes in the NHS, but clinical issues and patient safety are paramount. That provides a challenge, particularly for clinicians, who will often be engaged in challenging discussions, and who recognise the need for change. However, they do not necessarily always agree, as a group, about the shape of those changes or where services should be. That is nothing to do with politicians; it is to do with clinicians recognising what is in the interests of patient safety and the delivery of treatment. As with any group of people, they may have different views on where treatment should be provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/11">We are trying to address the changing shape of the NHS and how it can deliver. I shall give some examples of what is happening in East Sussex. I understand that the East Sussex trust has about 64 patients in acute beds who no longer need acute services but cannot be moved to other settings, presumably because they have not been developed. I am pleased to say that that figure has fallen from around 74 in May, although all parties involved accept that it is still too high. An active discussion is under way, and the then Surrey and Sussex SHA and the Commission for Social Care Inspection commissioned the Audit Commission in spring this year to review the problems with delayed discharges and create a joint action plan to address it and promote better services for older people in East Sussex. Again, therefore, there is a recognition that more needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/12">In addition, the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Service will provide and facilitate rapid response, prevention of admission, case management and pulmonary rehabilitation. That will help better to co-ordinate and manage community, primary and acute hospital care and improve the service to individuals. Yes, that will also reduce emergency admissions, but I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that it is far better to have a better prevention service than it is for someone to reach such a critical point that they must be admitted to hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/13">Heart failure services are also working in partnership with primary, community and acute hospital care and paralleling the work that is being done on respiratory disease, which means that people will be prevented from dying too soon. It is fair to say that people with such conditions have often ended up in such an acute state that hospital has been the only option. Many of them will, I hope, have had the treatment that they needed, and their lives will have been saved, but it is clear from clinicians that doing more to prevent the onset of acute episodes would contribute to such people's quality and length of life.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.0/14">Likewise, on ambulance services, paramedics are now being trained to act as emergency care practitioners&mdash;generic practitioners who respond as part of the ambulance service and who can diagnose and treat a person or refer them to an appropriate professional service. Although I accept the hon. Gentleman's point that timings for delivery to acute services by the ambulance service will have to be carefully considered, it is also important to recognise that emergency care practitioners can begin treatment at the point of contact, which will play an important part in giving people the best chance of survival.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.0/1">Does the Minister accept, however, that in my correspondence with her about reconfiguration, the chief executive of the ambulance service has expressed considerable concern about the extra strains that a so-called one-site solution to maternity, for example, would put on the service? Will she also comment on the royal college's half-hour standard for caesarean operations?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-31b.72.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="72"  time="013:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061031/halltext/61031h0011.htm#06103157000575">
	<p pid="b.72.1/1">I was coming to maternity services. The Government's vision&mdash;again, this is based on what women have been saying&mdash;is that women should have a choice about where their child is delivered. Our ambition over the next few years is that we will be able not only to support high-quality maternity services in a hospital setting, but to give women the opportunity to use birthing units and have home births. Women are saying that they want those choices available to them, and reconfiguration gives local managers the chance to see whether local services are fit and able to deliver those choices and the care that goes with them in different locations.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/2">I am not a clinician, so I have to listen to what clinicians are saying, but part of the clinical issue is that the number of births required to sustain 24-hour consultant cover depends on local circumstances. Decisions about the size of a maternity unit are most definitely a local matter, and neither the Department nor the royal colleges have issued guidance on specific unit sizes. However, there is general recognition that services in a particular location need a critical mass of deliveries so that staff remain clinically skilled. That is as important in this area of health provision as it is in others. About 12 whole-time equivalents are required to ensure a consultant presence on maternity units24 hours a day, seven days a week. At that staffing level, about 4,000 births per year can be safely managed. That will obviously provide the trustwith income and enable it to afford not only the12 consultants, but the associated levels of junior staff and midwives. Hospitals that manage that level of deliveries can, for example, also support a co-located, midwife-led unit. Certain antenatal and postnatal care features can also be provided in different settings, in addition to a hospital service for particularly complicated births that might need consultant intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/3">Last year, there were 1,589 deliveries at the Conquest hospital and 1,767 at Eastbourne district general hospital. Of those, 443 were moved to a special care baby unit for additional care following birth. There were also 341 births at the birthing centre at Crowborough and 140 deliveries at home. In looking at services, we must take account of the current figures, although the hon. Gentleman mentioned population changes, and it is important that those are also fed into any deliberations. However, it is important that low-volume units are considered in terms of what is necessary to produce good outcomes. The problem is that such units tend to have poorer outcomes. Even if they could afford 12 consultants, who would do, say, 2,000 births, they would be covering fewer than four births per week. The argument from those who skill up consultants is that that is insufficient to maintain consultants' skills. Therefore, it is a question not only of funding more consultants, but of ensuring that the throughput&mdash;to use the jargon&mdash;of women who give birth is sufficient to keep the skill base and clinical and patient safety at the optimum level.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/4">All those issues need to be discussed locally. They need to be discussed alongside issues such as introducing midwife-led birthing units that can operate in different locations and catering for the wishes and choices of women who might want more assisted births in their own homes. We must also take into account the number of multiple births that we are now seeing, partly as a result of in vitro fertilisation treatment. Furthermore, the average age of women who give birth for the first time has increased in the past years, and although that is not a problem in itself, there are risks connected with having children in one's late 30s, rather than one's late 20s. All such issues must inform our discussion of maternity services, and any views expressed by the ambulance service should also be considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/5">On NHS funding, the hon. Gentleman will be only too aware that the NHS as a whole is in receipt of record resources. I do not think that the current financial situation in East Sussex can be attributed to the lack of funding; in fact, the primary care trusts there collectively received allocations of &pound;669.5 million for this financial year, and the funding for East Sussex Downs and Weald PCT will increase by 18 per cent., or &pound;70 million, in the two years between 2006 and 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/6">NHS organisations have, however, always been expected to plan for and achieve financial balance in each and every year, and it is only right that we have exposed cases in which they have not been operating as transparently as they should. We are only too well aware that there are different deficits in different organisations, and organisations that have managed their finances well and kept them in balance contribute to dealing with imbalances in wider health economy. However, as a Member of Parliament and a Health Minister, I think that we will get through this only by bringing some rigour and accountability into the system to help us plan better for the future. It is not good for any service to be under the shadow of unresolved financial problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/7">I am assured by NHS South East Coast that any proposals that come out of the current process will meet three vital criteria: clinical safety and quality, improved access for patients and financial stability. Financial stability is important. When people are planning services, it is important to know that those services will not be knocked off balance by unresolved financial problems elsewhere in the health system.</p>
