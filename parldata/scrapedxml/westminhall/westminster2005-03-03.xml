	<p pid=".323.5/1">Select Committees play an important part in the work of the House of Commons, and the work done by the Clerks in the Committee offices makes all that possible.</p>
	<p pid=".323.5/2">I also thank Ben Kochan, the specialist assistant, who has worked hard on a series of reports on housing and planning for the Committee during the past 12 months. We are also grateful to the two specialist advisers, Peter Chapman and John Bryson, who have worked hard for the Committee. Specialist advisers are particularly important because they give up a great deal of their time to give personal tutorials to members of Committees.</p>
	<p pid=".323.5/3">Finally, I express my appreciation of the other members of the Committee. Sadly, not many of them are in the Chamber today, but I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/734" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts)</phrase> for being here, and for the contributions made by all members of the Committee to the report.</p>
	<p pid=".323.5/4">It is a little sad that although we have been bidding for a debate on the report since we published it on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-27">27 April 2004</phrase>, it has taken us some time to secure one. Sometimes when we produce a report, the Government are very enthusiastic about doing some of the things that we want. The kindest thing that I can say about the Government's response to this report, however, is that it was a very firm thumbs down. I am disappointed, but I understand the Minister's difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".323.5/5">Key to the report were the Committee's congratulations to the Government on setting the target for decent homes and for the very real prospects of achieving it by 2010 in the vast majority of cases. Such an achievement would be considerable. To live in homes that are inadequate saps individuals and families, children in particular.</p>
	<p pid=".323.5/6">There are a few caveats. We may achieve the target for most public sector rented accommodation, but I suspect that the Government have set a lower target for the private sector, and that only 70 per cent. of those homes will reach the decent standard met by the rest of the sector. That is a little disappointing, but we are making real progress. I have some sympathy for the Government in that, although it would be nice to install amenities such as a good bathroom, a good kitchen and other facilities in the private sector homes of elderly people, the disruption that that might cause them in the last few years of their lives may be disproportionate to the benefit that they would gain by having those facilities in their homes&mdash;facilities from which someone else will benefit.</p>
	<p pid=".323.5/7">One major disappointment is that the Government have encouraged local tenants to vote on whether they want their properties transferred to new housing associations&mdash;stock transfer companies&mdash;or arm's length management organisations, or to stay with the local authority. If people are asked to vote and, having heard all the arguments pressed unfairly to encourage them to transfer to an ALMO or a stock transfer company they still vote to stay with the local authority, it is mean and unfair for the Government to say, &quot;If you vote to stay with the local authority, you're not going to get a decent home because we're not going to let the local authority borrow the money against the future rent income that is necessary to do the work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".323.5/8">There was a glimmer of hope at the Labour party conference, when the Deputy Prime Minister made it clear that he recognised the problem and said that there would be a fourth way, allowing local authority tenants who opted to stay with the local authority to get their houses up to the decent homes standard. Since the Labour party conference, there has been no indication that the Government will put the Deputy Prime Minister's words into practice, and that is disappointing. We will end up with a situation in which people who voted to transfer will almost certainly get a decent home, whereas those who voted to stay with the local authority will be penalised because they had enthusiasm for locally elected, democratic councillor control rather than for the appointment of people on housing association boards.</p>

	<p pid=".328.0/1">As a member of the Select Committee that produced the report, may I begin by echoing the Chairman's thanks to the Clerks and specialist advisers who have served us very well on this and other inquiries? It is also an opportune moment, as it is probably my last chance to do so, to place on record my thanks and those of the other members of Committee to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/728" name="Andrew Bennett">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Bennett)</phrase> not merely for the way that he has chaired this inquiry, but for the way that he chairs the Committee in general.</p>
	<p pid=".328.0/2">All members of the Committee appreciate how his chairmanship is genuinely inclusive. We feel part of a Committee, not simply people who come along to sit in meetings and go through an agenda that has already been agreed. He shares with us the formulation of the agenda, the inquiries we should carry out and how we should go about them in a very open way. He involves all of us in the wash-down meetings that we have afterwards to discuss how inquiries are going. He makes us feel a genuine part of what is happening. My heartfelt appreciation and thanks go to him for the way he has chaired the Committee in this Session of Parliament. I know that those thanks would be echoed by other members of the Committee if they were in the Chamber; we all feel very strongly that he has done an excellent job.</p>
	<p pid=".328.0/3">I should also like to echo what my hon. Friend said about how much the Committee welcomed the fact that we had a decent home standard at all. When I first read it in the Labour party manifesto, I wondered whether we were really going to do it and whether it was perhaps a bit ambitious. The Government have set out, for the first time, the right of tenants to a decent home and the fact that resources will be made available to deliver those targets.</p>
	<p pid=".328.0/4">It is a long way from the dark days of the 1980s when some of us had the unfortunate pleasure&mdash;I am not sure that pleasure is the right word&mdash;to go to meetings with Ministers such as Nicholas Ridley to argue about whether the backlog of disrepair in local authority housing was &pound;16 billion, &pound;17 billion, &pound;18 billion, or whatever the latest surveys found it to be. That was disheartening, because we knew that not only were the backlog of disrepair and the level of poor standards enormous&mdash;that meant that tenants really suffered from bad housing&mdash;but that the problems were getting worse every year because the Government had no intention of doing anything about them. Some of us remember that as the time that the then Government's only housing policy was the right to buy and they focused on that to the exclusion of everything else.</p>
	<p pid=".328.0/5">The fact that we now have a target&mdash;I shall come on to discuss some concerns about elements of it&mdash;embodies a genuine general commitment by the Government to improve the standard of housing as a whole. We should not just be thinking about the issues that are specifically mentioned in the decent homes target, but the wider commitment to carry out repairs to deal with improvements and bring housing up to a better standard.</p>
	<p pid=".328.0/6">It has to be recognised that the Government have not merely set a target, but provided resources through the spending of capital receipts. We all know about the promises that the then Minister, Michael Heseltine, made when he said that capital receipts would be ploughed back into local authority housing; we suddenly found that they had been taken off the table and were used to pay off debt, and the houses&mdash;apart from 10 per cent. of them&mdash;never received any benefit in terms of improvements made to properties in the local authority sector.</p>
	<p pid=".328.0/7">We have seen capital receipts, money coming into ALMOs and stock transfer money as well. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/946" name="John Hayes">The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase> has temporarily&mdash;I hope&mdash;left his seat. It would be interesting to hear whether the Conservatives are prepared to commit themselves in the future, if by some mischance they were to win a general election, to keep on trying to deliver decent homes standards. What would their expenditure commitments be in order to do that? Although they have made commitments to carry on with the planned level of expenditure on education, health and the police, some of us suspect that in order to find their &pound;35 billion of cuts, housing would be one of the great losers in that exercise. The decent homes standards and other important investment in housing would go by the board.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-03.330.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/734" speakername="Clive Betts" colnum="330"  time="014:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050303/halltext/50303h01.htm#50303h01_spnew17">
	<p pid=".330.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. Although I do not always agree with the financial calculations of the Liberal Democrat party, I am happy to agree with them fully on this occasion. There would be a major problem not only for a Conservative Government, who would not be very interested in the consequences, but for tenants who found that the money they thought was going to be spent on their homes in the next few years to bring them up to a decent standard would be taken away by a back-door route that had not been spoken about openly and up front.</p>
	<p pid=".330.0/2">I shall go on to say a few words about the fourth way in moment&mdash;the Minister would probably expect me to do so&mdash;but I have to say that it is now very pleasant indeed, and a genuine pleasure, to go to meetings with tenants and tenants groups. In one meeting in my constituency a few weeks ago, the local area manager, Graham Bows, who previously worked for the council and now works for Sheffield Homes, was able to stand up and say, &quot;I've worked in housing in this city for 30 years&quot;&mdash;I have known him well for all that period&mdash;&quot;and I can actually get up at meetings now and say it is not whether you're going to get the work done, but when you're going to get it done. Because we have the commitment and the resources from central Government, we can actually talk about timetables for delivery projects, instead of saying 'perhaps if we get something in a few years' time, something might happen', knowing probably that it won't.&quot; That is a fundamental change, which also creates a much better relationship between landlords and tenants as they can sit down and plan ahead with the certainty that the Government will actually back what they are trying to do together to deliver improvements to housing.</p>
	<p pid=".330.0/3">I was pleased to help shape the policy in Sheffield, which was a novel one of its kind to begin with but has now probably been replicated elsewhere. There is a city-wide ALMO and the local authority still has its homeless responsibilities as well as taking responsibility for allocations, so we do not get competing allocations policies from different parts of the city, which is important. In each area, there has been genuine consultation and tenants have a right to opt in to the ALMO and bring about an area management arrangement for their particular part of the city. In most parts of the city, the tenants have voted by large majorities for that way forward, although, in some parts, stock transfer is favoured by a few estates.</p>
	<p pid=".330.0/4">I have to say&mdash;I do not know whether <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/840" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> will want to intervene on this occasion&mdash;that the development of the ALMO model and the fact that the houses remain in the ownership of the local authority was crucial in terms of getting tenants to accept that as a way forward. It was also crucial in helping Labour to win back control of Sheffield city council, because tenants absolutely rejected the idea of the Liberal Democrats that the whole city's housing stock would be put through the stock transfer route. So, there were political implications as well. My colleagues in the Labour group on Sheffield city council are to be commended for the way in which they have gone about the consultation, openly discussed things with tenants and created a model that the vast majority of tenants feel comfortable with. They might have preferred to remain with the council, but, if the model is a second-best option, it is a very good second-best option as far as most people are concerned.</p>

	<p pid=".333.0/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that one of the concerns of a number of us who represent London constituencies&mdash;a concern that applies to some other parts of the country as well&mdash;is that properties made up of flats, and estates with a very high concentration of flats, have a relative disadvantage because of the amount of money that needs to be spent on communal areas and security upgrades? Very welcome as the decent homes programme is&mdash;it is celebrated by tenants in my constituency&mdash;that relative disadvantage leads some of us with such city estates in our constituencies to face a struggle.</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-03.333.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-03a.333.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-03.333.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/734" speakername="Clive Betts" colnum="333"  time="014:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050303/halltext/50303h01.htm#50303h01_spnew21">
	<p pid=".333.1/1">I absolutely accept that, and there are such flats in my constituency. If there are security issues for those flats as well as issues of the general environment, the green environment and the roads, dealing with them will involve additional expenditure. If that is not spent, much of the other money spent on the internals of a property will almost be wasted. People would just give up. If an area is run-down and people do not feel secure, tenants will not feel great commitment to the properties. That is also true in the private sector. Estate agents use the phrase, &quot;Location, location, location&quot; to describe whether they can sell a house easily and whether it will be an attractive proposition to buy. The phrase is also true for rented property, and we ought to take the environment issue very seriously.</p>
	<p pid=".333.1/2">The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that when an ALMO is created, about 5 per cent. of the funds allocated can be spent on the environment. That is not sufficient in many cases. Stock transfer can raise an awful lot more money, but there is a real problem. I know that neighbourhood renewal and other sources of funding can be brought to bear to create sustainable communities, but the Government should look at the issue. Expenditure on the homes would be even better and more worth while if another 5 per cent.&mdash;or more in estates with flats&mdash;were allocated for the environment around the homes. That is a real issue, which has been raised with me by Sir Bob Kerslake, chief executive of Sheffield city council. He says that that is one of the downsides of the ALMO compared to stock transfer. That issue needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".333.1/3">I shall just say a few words about the private sector. We are still in an inadequate position, particularly as regards the private rented sector. I understand the differences with owner-occupied properties, but tenants in the private rented sector have as much right to a decent home as people in the local authority and socially rented sectors.</p>
	<p pid=".333.1/4">On the 70 per cent. target, if the Government had said, &quot;Well, it's 70 per cent. because we know it's much harder to get there in the private sector, but our aspiration is still to get to 100 per cent. and we'll get there by, say, 2015,&quot; we could understand that 70 per cent. was a stepping stone along the way. However, to have 70 per cent. as an absolute target, and then to have it for only 70 per cent. of the private homes occupied by the most vulnerable people on benefits is not as worth while as the target of 100 per cent. for the socially rented sector by 2010. I do not know whether we should have a target that a house may meet one day but not the next, because the circumstances of the person in the house change, or because the people themselves change, and so are no longer in a vulnerable group. I am not sure how meaningful it is to combine the circumstances of the individual tenant, in terms of their income, with a target related to the fabric of property. The mixing of the two creates a moveable target that is difficult to monitor.</p>
	<p pid=".333.1/5">If we are to be a bit braver about what we are doing with the private rented sector, we will need a few more enforcement mechanisms. It is quite right that there should be enforcement mechanisms in the private sector, but they do not cover all the issues covered by the decent homes standard; that is another issue that we raised in our report, and I was not absolutely convinced by the Government's response on it.</p>
	<p pid=".333.1/6">I hope that we have produced a good report for debate. We are very supportive of the Government's overall intentions, the extra money that has come into housing and the higher priority given to it. We have one or two concerns, and although we probably will not make progress on the fourth way after the arguments that we have had on it, at least matters such as decent homes-plus, how we address the environment and problems in the private rented sector are issues that the Government might care to reflect on further. I hope that we can make a little more progress on them.</p>

	<p pid=".335.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. She has raised one of the most important issues, which I will discuss in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".335.1/2">I was talking about the state of estates, which is reflected in the money available to spend on them. I am concerned that lift maintenance also falls outside the decent homes standard. The lives of people in Tower Hamlets are ruined, and pensioners and parents with young children are literally made prisoners in their homes when the lifts do not work, but that has not yet been taken into account. The cost for Tower Hamlets to service lifts on its estates between now and 2010, which is only five years away, is &pound;26 million. That reflects the fact that more than 12,000 properties&mdash;more than a quarter of all our housing stock&mdash;are in lifted blocks of at least six storeys. None of that money counts towards decent homes, yet it is pivotal to the creation of decent homes-plus, as we have heard. The Minister has been extremely helpful to many of us in arguing the case against deprivation, overcrowding and the social exclusion aspects of housing, and I ask him to consider what has been left out of the decent homes standard, particularly in relation to communal areas, security and lifted blocks.</p>
	<p pid=".335.1/3">As I said, the Minister been very helpful about overcrowding, but so far as I am aware&mdash;he will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;solving the problem of overcrowding is not part of the Government's decent homes agenda. In other words, a one-bedroom flat is perfectly decent if one person is put in it, but not if a family of eight is put in it. Tackling the problem of overcrowding is therefore fundamental to attaining the Government's decent homes standards.</p>

	<p pid=".336.0/1">Many of my constituents would also be grateful to hear from the Minister what further steps the Government are taking to tackle the problem of overcrowding, which blights the lives of so many families in Tower Hamlets. My hon. Friend makes a very important point about housing association stock. I will return to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".336.0/2">I said earlier that I would come back to the maintenance issue. The single biggest cause of poor quality housing is lack of maintenance. The communities plan includes &pound;2.8 billion to bring council homes up to a decent standard, and that is greatly to be welcomed. None the less, that must be set against the &pound;19 billion backlog that was inherited in 1997&mdash;a backlog of disrepair and underinvestment. The Government have said:</p>
	<p pid=".336.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Our new rates of funding improvements in the management and maintenance of the council stock will mean support will be &pound;500m higher in 2005&ndash;06 than would have been the case.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".336.0/4">However, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/762" name="Karen Buck">the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> pointed out, the overall changes to the management and maintenance allowance that have occurred mean that, although the average increase is about 13 per cent., some areas with the worst housing have received a lower percentage. In London, for example, which has the highest number of children living in poor quality housing, we have had a fraction of that amount. It is strange that the Government should not recognise the need in areas that have some of the lowest income families and some of the worst social housing&mdash;some are in London and some in the north. In my view, to simply ignore the situation in London seems absolutely desperate.</p>
	<p pid=".336.0/5">In Tower Hamlets, much of the new money that the Government have invested is making differences that people can see. People will not necessarily believe what politicians say, but they do believe their own eyes, and they are seeing new homes being built today in Tower Hamlets. In that context, I want to mention the quality of new build. Constituents have complained to me about the lack of noise insulation, and such issues seem to be storing up problems for the future. There are also issues related to energy efficiency. I cannot think of a worse way to save money than by not investing in energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid=".336.0/6">The last thing that I want to say brings me back to my first point&mdash;the quality of estates. In Tower Hamlets, a lot of money is being invested in improving the overall built environment, not only with bricks and mortar, but by putting in place local area partnerships involving all the organisations. That means working with local authorities; with the police on safer neighbourhood schemes; with the schools to get extended school areas; and with health authorities to set up new health facilities on estates near to the people who need them. Such measures are improving the quality of life in Tower Hamlets.</p>
	<p pid=".336.0/7">The Government must look at the omissions from the decent homes standard, however, which could reduce the effectiveness of their programmes in other areas. Can the Minister tell me what further measures the Government will take to improve the quantity of housing stock available in areas such as Tower Hamlets, particularly in relation to what we heard earlier about affordability and low-cost home ownership? We have heard the Government's proposal for a possible &pound;60,000 house for first-time buyers. In Tower Hamlets, the average house price is about &pound;250,000 and the average income is about &pound;12,000. That &pound;12,000 figure takes into account people in Canary Wharf, for example, many of whom earn a lot more. One can therefore imagine how low the incomes of many of those families are. Will he also consider increasing the number of people from lower income groups that have access to decent homes through some of the shared home ownership schemes?</p>

	<p pid=".341.2/1">In practice, I think that that is happening. If I gave the impression that the area manager I referred to was standing up to tenants and saying, &quot;This is what we will do to you, or for you,&quot; that is not right. He was saying that they now have the money to do things, but Sheffield has had a long history of tenant involvement in area committees and area budgets, and, uniquely, of a tenant levy that helps fund local tenant associations. The decent homes standards are a benchmark or framework, within which lots of important improvements&mdash;such as replacing windows, which is a top priority in my constituency&mdash;go ahead at the tenants' request.</p>

	<p pid=".342.0/1">I am sure that that is the case. We cannot generalise about housing. We all know that local authorities or housing associations undertake different projects using very different approaches. It happens even within our constituencies. Housing is very varied, and I am sure that there are councils and registered social landlords who are producing best practice.</p>
	<p pid=".342.0/2">In my constituency, two attempts have been made in the past 15 years to persuade tenants to vote for stock transfer in order to get a huge amount of money invested in social housing in Kingston. Both attempts have failed&mdash;most recently last year, and by quite a large majority. That leaves us in a dilemma, because the Government are not providing a big slug of money to local authorities to help council tenants such as those whom I represent. My tenants want to stay with their local authority because it is a good authority, but now it does not have sufficient cash. It is looking at a range of schemes&mdash;such as arm's length management organisations and private finance initiatives, or other smaller-scale stock transfer&mdash;to see if it can meet the decent homes standard, but it is in a real bind. Council tenants who come to my surgeries frequently say, &quot;We need this extension or adaptation, but the council says it does not have enough money.&quot; It is difficult to reply, &quot;Well, you voted no,&quot;. Just because they exercised their democratic right and voted no does not mean that they should be excluded from having a decent home.</p>
	<p pid=".342.0/3">The Minister must address that fundamental question. A few months ago, some disturbing rumours were going around that the Government intended to address it by deciding that tenants who voted against stock transfer would be outside the decent homes standard. I hope that he can put it on the record today that that is not the case, and that the fact that tenants vote no does not mean that they are not entitled to have a decent home, or that the Government will not help them have one by 2010. It would be extremely helpful if he were to put that on the record, because then I could say to my constituents who are council tenants, &quot;The Minister has today promised me that you will have a decent home by 2010.&quot; I look forward to his doing that and ensuring that the Chancellor and the Deputy Prime Minister provide that cash.</p>
	<p pid=".342.0/4">The Committee made an important point about the private sector in its report, and although it mentioned the Housing Act 2004 it did not say much about it. I was slightly surprised about that. However, the Act is a crucial lever. The report refers to the need for environmental health officers and to giving local authority departments the money to enforce the new standards. Will the Committee Chairman say how he thinks that the 2004 Act can help deal with that?</p>

	<p pid=".343.4/1">If the Government continue to return with more regulations, the hon. Gentleman may right. They should not do that. We should see how this completely revamped system beds down and how we can help landlords improve standards more generally.</p>
	<p pid=".343.4/2">I do not want to say much more. The decent homes standard has been a welcome programme, and the report shows how it can be improved. I only hope that the Government think again about their reaction to the report. Whether we are talking about the fourth option or the definition of the decent homes standards, their response was inadequate. In many ways, the Chairman of the Committee, while making some fierce criticisms, was understating his concern and the Committee's. Certainly I thought on reading the report that there was a real chance for the Government to make amends and to go forward. I hope that the Minister will tell us today that the Government's response to this very good report can be considered again.</p>

	<p pid=".344.0/1">As ever, I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests. Also, as this may be the last time that the Minister and I clash across the Chamber, let me say how much I have enjoyed our exchanges, discussions and debates. They have never really been arguments. As Oscar Wilde said, arguments are always vulgar and often persuasive. The arguments between the right hon. Gentleman and I are never vulgar, and mine are usually more persuasive than his, but it has been a pleasure. I hope that this is not the last occasion on which we cross swords, but it may be.</p>
	<p pid=".344.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1023" name="Oona King">The hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King)</phrase>&mdash;we must not forget Bow, certainly not with an election in the offing&mdash;made an important point about housing availability and affordability, and about house building. It would be wrong to debate decent homes outside that context, because one of the greatest indictments of the Government has been the collapse of social house building. That is a damning indictment of this Government and this Minister.</p>
	<p pid=".344.0/3">Hon. Members will be as acutely aware as I am of the facts. I have the table here that shows that in the mid-1990s we were building just under 40,000 new social houses a year, but in recent years we have built just under 20,000 each year, so there has been a collapse in social house building under Labour's stewardship. That has created a significant problem in the form of the number of people housed in temporary accommodation. I know that it is a cause of great distress to you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, as it is to me that the number of such people has reached a record 100,000, according to ODPM figures from December. That is the highest the number has ever been.</p>
	<p pid=".344.0/4">It is true that Governments have often inherited a rising trend when such figures have been announced. It is sometimes true that people make cheap political points because a figure has been reached when in fact the trend was established under a previous regime. However, the trend for people housed in temporary accommodation was falling until 1997. The Government have reversed a falling trend, and we now have that appalling figure, so there is a real problem with social house building to which the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow was right to draw attention. I shall deal with that issue and affordability before coming to the comments of the Chairman of the Committee and of the Committee itself.</p>

	<p pid=".345.0/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's remarks. I shall come to our position on the decent homes standards in the middle part of my extremely long and interesting speech. To deal with his other point, our position is crystal clear. I know that he takes to bed every night&mdash;as you do, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;the Conservative action on housing pamphlet, &quot;The Right to Own&quot;, which I published at the end of last year. That pamphlet makes it clear that if the Housing Corporation's approved development programme were divided 50:50 between houses to rent and low-cost homes, as the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow suggested, there would be about 12,500 more homes built each year&mdash;a combination of Housing Corporation homes to rent and new houses built under the low-cost home ownership scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".345.0/2">We know that 60,000 people apply for that scheme every year and that the vast majority of them are disappointed. Among the generality of the population, we know that, according to independent surveys, about 85 to 90 per cent. of people want to be home owners. Our target should be ambitious. We have changed the proportion of people who own their own home over the past 25 years from about 60 to 70 per cent., so why should we not aim, on a non-partisan basis, to change that proportion over the next 20 years from 70 to 80 per cent. by reconsidering shared equity?</p>
	<p pid=".345.0/3">The way to make home ownership accessible is not by building &quot;affordable houses&quot;, but by making the houses that best suit people's needs affordable to them as individuals and families. That requires a fresh look at equity. I echo the plea of the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow for real effort to be put into invigorating the mortgage market and for Government support for shared equity homes, so that people can take that first step on to the ladder; it is a question of bringing the ladder closer to them.</p>

	<p pid=".346.4/1">You are on impeccable form today, Mr. Deputy Speaker, if you do not mind me saying so. We are ranging widely from your preferred reading matter to the hon. Gentleman's life story.</p>
	<p pid=".346.4/2">The fact that the hon. Gentleman chose to buy his own home, as I suspect most Members here today have done, is perhaps indicative of a natural human desire to acquire a property and pass it on to the next generation. That is not unhealthy. Associated with the acquisition of property are many other good things such as security, responsibility and a stake in society, but he is right that that is not to say that we should either reject those who need to rent or neglect the quality of the properties that they rent.</p>
	<p pid=".346.4/3">My analysis has revealed that, unsurprisingly, most people's housing needs change in their lifetime. We start off single, we often&mdash;perhaps usually&mdash;get married or find a partner, to use the modern idiom. If we are fortunate, we have children, and we then get old and end up&mdash;I hope not too soon&mdash;rather dependent. I started off living in a council house on a high-quality council estate. It was an idyllic childhood&mdash;a golden age, one might say. I was a tenant in the private rented sector when I was a student, then a small private house, then a big private house, and now I have a very big private house. One day I will move into a bungalow, and perhaps I will end up dribbling while being fed in a supported home. That is not an unusual pattern. People's housing needs change, and the houses available to them must reflect those changing needs.</p>
	<p pid=".346.4/4">The hon. Gentleman is right: there is a proper role for the rented sector, both private and public, and it is necessary that property is available in sufficient quantity and quality. That is really the subject of our debate: there clearly is not sufficient quantity at the moment. The number of social houses being built is not adequate to meet demand. My point is that, over a very long period, by adopting policies such as looking again at equity, we may change demand by altering the proportion of the population who own and therefore the proportion who want and need to rent. That is a perfectly reasonable ambition, given that most people say that that is what they want to achieve. Why should we not help people achieve their aspirations?</p>
	<p pid=".346.4/5">The Government are on weak ground in this debate in terms of their record on social house building. That could be altered if we adjusted the way in which the Housing Corporation funds the construction of new homes and if, as I have said, that funding was weighted more heavily towards the development of shared equity homes under low-cost home ownership schemes. I am more than happy to make those figures available to the Minister&mdash;I am sure that he has them&mdash;and other hon. Members, so that they can share my disappointment with him and his record.</p>
	<p pid=".346.4/6">The Government have said that the reason why they have not built many social homes is that they have chosen to prioritise investment in existing stock. They have a fair argument: that we have the oldest housing stock in Europe and that some of our public sector housing is not of sufficient quality. That is the case for all kinds of reasons.</p>

	<p pid=".350.4/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that in respect of the 50:50 split, the issue depends on where the houses are being built and how much that costs. For example, there is a great difference in land prices and building costs between St. Helens and St. Albans. The Government did not build as many houses as they needed and as many of us would want, but they are building houses where they are most needed now&mdash;in the south-east and the London area&mdash;but that means that there are &quot;fewer houses per pound&quot; than if they were built more generally.</p>

	<p pid=".353.1/1">When the James review was being drawn up&mdash;and, as I imagine, when the Gershon review was drawn up&mdash;those involved in the process were in discussion with those in spending Departments to find a balance. Many of the savings outlined in the James review in respect of the ODPM will be reinvested in our area; that was made absolutely clear in those discussions. Where we choose to reinvest them and how we target them will be choice that I shall be forced to make in few weeks' time when I move into the Minister's office, but I am not going to reveal in detail how we will go about that. Some of it will depend on the circumstances that apply when we come to power. The hon. Gentleman is right that it would be wrong to assume that all the James money will leave the ODPM; a lot of it will be reinvested to support a range of important and worthwhile projects.</p>

	<p pid=".355.0/1">I thank the members of the Select Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and other colleagues for their contributions to today's debate.</p>
	<p pid=".355.0/2">I pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/728" name="Andrew Bennett">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Bennett)</phrase>, whose contribution today will have been his swansong, at least in this Chamber. I congratulate him on his work as Chairman of the Select Committee, and his long and distinguished parliamentary career. He has played a distinguished part in addressing housing issues, but I hope that he will forgive me when I say that the contribution I shall most remember him for is his wonderful achievement&mdash;the right to roam in our countryside. I heartily congratulate him.</p>
	<p pid=".355.0/3">We have had a wide-ranging debate from, if I may say so, a thrilling cast of characters. Even my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> made a fleeting appearance, and my hon. Friends <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1056" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> and for St. Albans (Mr. Pollard) also put in a late but welcome appearance. Old chums, one and all. Anyway, enough of this love-in.</p>
	<p pid=".355.0/4">The policy pickings from the dishes of the Opposition parties were a trifle meagre. I am genuinely very fond of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/946" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase>, but why do I always feel that he is making it up as he goes along? As I listened to the hon. Members for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey) and for South Holland and The Deepings, I was reminded of the survey of housing professionals carried out by that august journal, <i>Inside Housing</i>, in the new year. I am pleased to say that housing professionals subscribing to it exhibited extremely high levels of support for the Government's sustainable communities policies. When asked about how they intended to vote, 69 per cent. said Labour, 3 per cent. said Conservative, and 2 per cent. said Liberal Democrat. That is a ringing endorsement of our policies from the people who really know about housing.</p>
	<p pid=".355.0/5">Many important issues have been discussed in this debate, but I would hate us to lose sight of the big picture and of the Government's commitment to meeting the decent homes target. We have 4.1 million social homes in this country. That is a tremendous asset, which is worth about &pound;400 billion and is an immeasurable asset to the community.</p>
	<p pid=".355.0/6">The impact of decades of neglect and underinvestment under the Tories left us in 1997 with a &pound;19 billion backlog of repairs and 2.2 million homes that did not meet the decent homes standard. This Government responded to that challenge by radically changing our approach to housing policy, building in far greater flexibility and capacity for investment than ever before. Let me remind the Chamber of the results of that radical change. Since 1997, we have reduced the number of non-decent social homes by 1 million and we have increased the proportion of vulnerable households in the private sector living in decent homes to 63 per cent. We have increased investment massively. Local authorities have invested more than &pound;13 billion in bringing their homes up to a decent standard, and a further &pound;5.3 billion has been levered in from the private sector through transfer.</p>
	<p pid=".355.0/7">On top of that, local authorities' plans indicate that by 2008 they will invest a further &pound;11 billion in their stock. Indeed, between 1997 and 2005&ndash;06, the average investment per council home will have increased by 55 per cent. in real terms. We are on track to meet our target of providing a decent home to everyone living in social housing and to 70 per cent. of vulnerable households in private accommodation by 2010. By the time we meet our target, we expect that local authorities and housing associations will have spent about &pound;42 billion on ensuring that their tenants live in decent homes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-03.356.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" colnum="356"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050303/halltext/50303h01.htm#50303h01_spnew84">
	<p pid=".356.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman wants to go down that road, why should I not give him a few facts to reflect on? As usual, he drew attention to the levels of social home building in the early 1990s. However, he omitted to point out that in the year that he always selects&mdash;1992&ndash;93&mdash;there were higher levels of affordable housing than now because of mass unemployment and negative equity. At that time, there were historically low levels of new build in market housing. The wonderful year of 1997&ndash;98, when we came to power, is the most sensible point of comparison between what his Government and our Government have achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/2">Remember, the Tories halved investment in social housing between 1992 and 1997&mdash;that was the base line that we inherited. In 2003&ndash;04, we built more new market homes than in 1997, and we shall continue to do that from next year onwards. Yes, we shall not begin to exceed the levels of social homes that we inherited in 1997 until 2007&ndash;08, but, as my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans rightly said, we have been building more homes in the south-east, where they are most urgently needed, and where, since 2003&ndash;04, we have been exceeding the level that we inherited in terms of new social homes built.</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/3">Of course, building in the south is an expensive business. Land costs, labour costs and construction costs are at their highest there. That is why, although we shall double our investment in social housing over the period to 2008, we shall build 50 per cent. more social homes for renting than at present. That record is highly defensible, and I find it difficult to see how that fanciful notion&mdash;a Conservative Government&mdash;would build more affordable homes than this Government.</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/4">The hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings has tempted me to do this, and I shall go for it. The James review pledges to cut &pound;1 billion from the sustainable communities fund. That is in black and white on a document that I have drawn down from what I believe is known as the Conservative party website. It says, &quot;Less talk, more action&quot;, and it asks people to make a donation. It states in black and white that the &quot;sustainable communities plan&quot; would be scrapped, &quot;saving another &pound;1 billion.&quot; The document is absolutely irresistible, and I shall not resist it. It goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Conservatives will reverse the culture of Whitehall targets and central government control. Local decisions should be taken by local councillors and held to account by local people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/6">That from the party that passed more than 50 Acts of Parliament to destroy the power of local government. However, enough of that; I shall come back to my main theme.</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/7">I was saying that our target for decent homes is not merely about bricks and mortar but about individuals and their right to live in a secure and stable environment. Therefore, it is a vital part of the Government's commitment to creating safe, sustainable communities. Last month, as all present will be aware, the Deputy Prime Minister launched &quot;Homes for All&quot;, our five-year plan that sets out the way forward for housing. The decent homes target is an integral part of it, and I am confident that we are all agreed that the decent homes strategy is of tremendous importance to our communities and neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/8">I would like to address some specific, and often contentious, issues. The fourth option was highlighted by my hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish, and for Sheffield, Attercliffe (Mr. Betts) and by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton. I want to take this opportunity to assert again the Government's position on the so-called fourth option. The Select Committee was deeply concerned at what was referred to as a &quot;Catch-22&quot; situation. It recommended that there should be a &quot;level playing field&quot;, with local authorities that manage their own stock having access to direct investment.</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/9">It is the Government's contention that our decent homes programme is the best way forward. It provides three innovative and flexible ways to support local authorities that need additional funding to ensure that their stock meets the decent homes standard. Of course, some local authorities will be able to meet their target on decent homes using mainstream housing funds, their own resources and, perhaps, some prudential borrowing. However, our sustainable communities plan, which was published in February 2003, made it clear that where additional funding was needed, local authorities could not expect increased investment unless they engaged in the options appraisal process.</p>
	<p pid=".356.1/10">The fact is that it is not Government policy simply to throw money at a problem. That would be irresponsible and in the long term it would not work. We are under an obligation to ensure that where we provide extra resources, we also drive up performance, allow tenants to have their say about how those extra resources are spent and secure value for money. The truth is that authorities up and down the country are now telling us that the separation of management and strategic function is delivering better services to tenants and that they are now able to take a more strategic view of their wider housing responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid=".358.0/1">I will say two things to the hon. Gentleman. I think that I am right in saying that he is a former spokesman on Treasury matters. As such, he will know that these matters are strictly controlled by Treasury rules. We might want to debate those in a separate context, but the blunt truth is that they are the rules under which we operate. The prudential borrowing regime has given local authorities greater flexibility, out of which a number of them have now decided that they can go forward in meeting the decent homes target, while retaining the stock.</p>
	<p pid=".358.0/2">I also need to say to the hon. Gentleman&mdash;I put this to him very seriously&mdash;that it would be quite wrong for the Government simply to accede to a request for additional funding for decent homes from a local authority, without considering the quality of that authority and its capacity to deliver on decent homes. He knows very well that there are many local authorities whose performance in housing delivery, maintenance and services to tenants is not very impressive. Is he really saying that in such circumstances&mdash;which might involve a no-star or a one-star authority&mdash;the money should simply be made available, without the Government imposing any quality requirements?</p>

	<p pid=".360.3/1">Yes, I can give that assurance. We are confident that we are on target to meet the decent homes standard across the piece by 2010. I believe that in the course of my remarks I have demonstrated that there is no fourth option, that we do not need a fourth option and that we will not provide one. I fear that, as colleagues, we will have to agree to disagree on that subject for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/2">I shall now take up some of the other issues raised by hon. Members during the debate. My hon. Friends the Members for Denton and Reddish and for Sheffield, Attercliffe mentioned decent homes-plus. The Select Committee recommended that we should consider formalising a decent homes-plus standard. I can understand why people would want to do that, but I believe that it would be confusing to consider introducing a new standard at this stage, when we are only part way towards delivering on the current one.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/3">As I have said already, the problem that we faced in 1997 was massive and our target, to undo the damage caused by those years of neglect and under-investment, is challenging enough. To move the goalposts at this stage, when we are on track to meet our target in 2010, would be unfair and unreasonable.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/4">As the Committee recognised, and those in the House will know, the decent homes standard is not, and was never intended to be, an aspirational standard. It is the baseline below which action must be taken, not a standard to which work should be carried out. Naturally, many tenants aspire to higher standards, and we know that, where work is carried out on homes, a higher standard is often attained.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/5">I cite a couple of cities close to my heart&mdash;Bradford and Leicester&mdash;where I have visited projects in progress. Folk in those cities will proudly say that they are providing decent homes to the Bradford standard and&mdash;in the case of my birthplace&mdash;to the Leicester standard.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/6">However, tackling all the homes that remain in a state of non-decency, despite the tremendous progress we have made since 1997, is a major challenge within the limits of what is affordable. It would therefore be unjust to take on the refurbishment of more properties, which would be a consequence of raising the baseline, while over 1 million social tenants still have homes that do not meet the minimum standards of decency. Nevertheless, it is perfectly clear that we shall have to think beyond 2010. After all, stock currently identified as decent is likely to deteriorate, and aspirations are likely to rise. However, we have on our hands a hefty undertaking to meet the existing decent home standard; that task is sufficient for us to focus on now.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/7">Colleagues have raised the issue of the environment, particularly in relation to ALMOs, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1023" name="Oona King">the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Ms King)</phrase> referred to the issue of communal services. Certainly, the issue was brought home to me last week when I was in Sheffield, looking at the progress made in delivering decent homes. Colleagues who spoke on the subject conceded that allowance is now being made for the environment. The argument is that 5 per cent. of the budget is insufficient, but let me give the House an assurance that the Government will continue to think hard about those issues, although my hon. Friends have been correct to suggest that greater investment in the environmental circumstances of social housing is available under transfer and PFI.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/8">Let me also say a word about decent homes in the private sector&mdash;another issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe. We take non-decency in the private sector very seriously. It is only right to focus on vulnerable households. The target of providing a decent home to 70 per cent. of them by 2010 reflects the complexities of the target and the level of resources available to deal with it. We are trying to maximise the resources available by encouraging local authorities to develop new means of providing financial assistance, such as loans and equity release.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/9">The target that we have set for private sector decent homes is challenging but achievable, given the more complex picture of responsibilities in the private sector and the scale of the problem. We shall, of course, keep the target under review in the light of progress made towards meeting it. However, I must tell the House that we are well on course to achieving our target to make decent 70 per cent. of the homes of vulnerable households in the private sector by 2010, and to reach 75 per cent. by 2020. The 2001 baseline was 57 per cent. and the 2006 milestone was 65 per cent. The 2003 English house condition survey shows that the target percentage has increased to 63 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/10">Progress is being made through local partnerships to develop new ways of tackling the housing problems that they face. We have allocated &pound;60 million to kick-start funding to support the development of new loans schemes, such as those run by HouseProud in London, Art Homes in the west midlands, and the Wessex Reinvestment Trust in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/11">Let me now turn to the issue of overcrowding, which was raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow. I pay tribute to her diligence in these matters, not least because she went to the trouble of submitting evidence to the Select Committee on the decent homes inquiry. That is characteristic of her long-term, extraordinarily high and passionate commitment to housing issues. On overcrowding, we expect to consult on our thinking on the proposals shortly and on the amendments that I was pleased that we were able to make to the Housing Bill, very much at her instigation.</p>
	<p pid=".360.3/12">I draw my hon. Friend's attention and that of the Chamber to new draft PPG3 on housing, which requires local authorities to shift the focus of the new provision of housing from simple numbers of dwellings to the required mix of households. That new emphasis will allow local authorities to work with house builders and developers to deliver larger houses. My hon. Friend has spoken eloquently on many occasions about the need for them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-03.362.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" colnum="362"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050303/halltext/50303h01.htm#50303h01_spnew103">
	<p pid=".362.3/1">Let me make several points in response to the hon. Gentleman's intervention and on the issue of low-cost home ownership, which was also raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow. I remind the House that by 2008 we will have delivered 75,000 new homes for social renting. That is an increase of 50 per cent. on current figures, and it reflects a doubling of investment in housing in comparison with 1997. The truth is that, since 2001&ndash;02, we have been building homes for low-cost home ownership and intermediate renting at a higher level than we inherited. That is the simple reality of the situation.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/2">In response to my hon. Friend, I can say that via the key worker living scheme, social homebuy, the first-time buyer scheme and other low-cost home ownership initiatives we expect to have brought 80,000 people into low-cost home ownership by 2010. However, it is always a matter of resources. We do our best.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/3">There is no doubt that housing has risen to the top of the political agenda. We dispose of a massive &pound;38 billion budget for sustainable communities, which I believe will be maintained in the future. I hope that it will be possible in the long term to meet the aspirations for home ownership of those who are on lower incomes, and to meet the aspirations for social renting of as many as possible of our fellow citizens at various income levels. However, we must recognise that all those aspects of housing delivery demand resources. The House will be familiar with the Government's commitment in &quot;Homes for All&quot; to halve current levels of temporary accommodation by 2010.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/4">The hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton spoke about a menu of choices, which seems to be the main new element of the Liberal Democrats' policy on decent homes. It is an interesting proposition. Indeed, I would argue that it is largely implemented already.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/5">We must be clear that any decisions made by local communities should be applied across the board. This is perhaps the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish was getting at when he said that we had to think about future occupants. As a constituency MP, I am sick and tired of constituents coming to me and saying, &quot;Every other flat in the block has central heating. Why doesn't mine?&quot; Under some crazy decision-making process years ago people were allowed to choose whether to have central heating. We all know that it is now phenomenally expensive to introduce central heating into single blocks. Whichever direction we take, the solutions will have to apply across the board.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/6">I make no apology for the emphasis that the Government have placed on the provision of modernised kitchens, bathrooms and central heating where necessary in terms of the decent homes programme. People can be sniffy about the standard that decent homes offers, but if one visits the homes of tenants that have been modernised under the programme one finds a phenomenal gratitude for and delight at the improvements to their homes. I have observed and expressed more joy about more modernised bathrooms and kitchens than I have had hot dinners over the last two years since I became the Minister responsible for housing.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/7">To revert to the point made by the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton, I would argue that such choice is intrinsic to the stock option appraisal process. It is out of the process of discussion about the aspiration of tenants that decisions about retention, ALMOs, stock transfer and PFI are reached. If it is suggested that the options appraisal process, as it operates at present, does not allow tenants sufficient say in how their homes should be maintained and managed, I would point out that tenants are absolutely at the heart of the options appraisal process. The need to engage with them and to seek their views on the future management of their homes is vital to our policies.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/8">All local authorities are obliged to draw up communications strategies that set out in practical terms exactly how they intend to involve tenants and other stakeholders. However, we go further than that: we also ensure that tenants are properly equipped to make informed decisions about the options open to them. We recognise that it is fundamental to tenants' rights that they can access impartial information, without bias towards one option or another. This is why we encourage local authorities to use an independent tenant adviser to ensure that tenants have a clear picture of the process.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/9">Tenant engagement does not stop once a decision has been made. Tenants make up around one third of the governing bodies of transfer housing associations and ALMOs, broadening tenant participation to estate and neighbourhood level. The involvement of tenants at board level inevitably leads to a closer engagement in the management of their homes, but we expect ALMOs to continue increasing opportunities for tenants to get involved as part of the overall service they provide.</p>
	<p pid=".362.3/10">I can tell my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Attercliffe that tenant satisfaction is increasing. For example, a tenant satisfaction survey in 2000 found that 85 per cent. of transfer tenants were either very or fairly satisfied with their landlord. Fewer than one in 10 tenants surveyed felt that the service previously provided by their local authority was superior. As I draw my remarks to a conclusion, let me say that the Select Committee report provided a degree of challenge to our policies for delivering decent homes.</p>

	<p pid=".364.0/1">The Minister has not talked this afternoon about the infrastructure implications of the new build. The East of England Regional Assembly has suddenly announced that it does not support the extra house building because the infrastructure cost implications of the new build would not be met. Every secondary and primary school in my constituency is full. Our population is increasing. We want to build more houses but the infrastructure is not there. We need to balance the two.</p>

	<p pid=".364.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. I have not mentioned infrastructure today because it is not the subject of our debate, but he makes a fair point about the need for infrastructure in the growth areas. We recognise that new housing growth must go hand in hand with the provision of new hard and soft infrastructure. The hard infrastructure will be by way of transport provision, and I draw my hon. Friend's attention to the fact that, as a result of the multi-modal studies, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport last year announced a colossal &pound;3.1 billion of new investment in transport infrastructure in the growth areas in the south of England.</p>
	<p pid=".364.1/2">In addition, my hon. Friend will be aware that my Department, jointly with the Department for Transport, administers a committee infrastructure fund worth &pound;200 million. That is also devoted to providing key transport infrastructure in the growth areas. As we experience housing growth, health and education provision must not follow, but must be introduced simultaneously. The fact is that last year the Department of Health doubled investment in primary care trusts in the housing growth areas to &pound;40 million, precisely to meet the growth anticipated. The Department for Education and Skills is working closely with my Department to develop a programme of education and skills provision that will respond to housing growth in London and the wider south-east. That was a bit of a digression, but I hope that it was helpful to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".364.1/3">I was saying that the Select Committee's report provided a degree of challenge to our policy for delivering decent homes. We remain confident that the measures that we set in place provide local authorities with the innovative and flexible support that they need to bring all their homes up to a decent standard. It is important to consider the real human impact of this strategy. What ought to take priority in our minds are the enormous benefits that our policies are having on individuals, families and communities. As I said, I have had the opportunity to see the results of these policies on the ground, and the results for the tenants, in the homes that they want, need and deserve.</p>
