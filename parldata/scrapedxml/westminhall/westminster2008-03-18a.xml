<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.151.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="151"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0001.htm#08031853000470">
	<p pid="a.151.2/1">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to initiate this debate, although I would probably be more pleased if I had not initiated rather a lot of similar debates over the past 20-odd years. In a sense, this feels like a return to old ground, but as I speak I think that it will become clear that I am not looking simply to repeat what has been said before. There are some immediate issues to address, particularly given that Ofwat is in the middle of a consultation on its review of water charges and pricing&mdash;PR09&mdash;and that the Government have just released their strategy, &quot;Future Water&quot;. Over the next year, we will set the agenda for the future of the water industry, and that will not be just for the five years that Ofwat has traditionally considered in its reviews&mdash;potentially, we could be talking about a 20-year horizon. The debate is therefore extremely timely, and I hope that things will move on in a way that they have not always done in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">I am not sure whether I should declare an interest, but my wife has been very involved in the issue. She formerly ran Surfers Against Sewage and wrote a response for it on these matters, and she has done some work for South West Water. If that is an interest, then I have it&mdash;my wife is certainly interested in this debate, if I can put it like that.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/3">I have returned to the subject more often than any other during my career in the House of Commons. I warned the Conservative Government that their privatisation of the water industry would cut off the potential to secure the public and European moneys necessary to clean up our beaches and that people in the south-west, who are on some of the lowest incomes in the country, would be left to foot the bill. They proceeded regardless, and left only &pound;1.5 billion for a clean-up programme that actually cost &pound;6 billion&mdash;four times the amount that they had assumed. That is why South West Water customers continue to pick up the tab to this day.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/4">Much of what I have to say will be relevant in the national context, but I must first focus on the situation in the south-west. Households with water meters account for two thirds of users&mdash;there is a very high penetration of water meters in the south-west because of the high bills&mdash;and can expect to pay an average of &pound;397 in 2008-09, which is up 5.6 per cent. on last year. Many of the remaining, unmetered users are unable to switch to meters because their properties do not allow it. They do not necessarily use large amounts of water or choose to avoid installing a meter in the hope of saving money. Many of them are poor, and the problem has been of concern to the Minister, who has spoken about it publicly in the past few days. Such users face an even bigger rise of 8.7 per cent. and will pay &pound;686 on average. That figure will go up all the time because the more people switch to meters, the higher the charge for those who are still unmetered.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.1/1">My hon. Friend is spot on. To give an example, the average bill of a south-west pensioner on a meter suggests that they will spend almost 10 per cent. of their pension on water bills. For those who are unmetered, the average bill implies that they will spend 15 per cent. of their pension on water bills. People in my area have the lowest incomes in the country, so the impact is felt much more broadly. In London, where wages are much higher, bills are much lower&mdash;the average bill is &pound;304.</p>

	<p pid="a.154.1/1">If the cost were spread across the country the implication for water bills would be extremely small and the benefit for people in the south-west would be extremely large. When the Conservatives privatised water they promised that what I have been talking about would not happen. They said that they had put enough money in the pot from privatisation receipts to pay for the clean-up. That was a national receipt, which, it was implied, was a contribution from around the country. The Conservatives got it wrong: they calculated the money wrongly. They landed South West Water customers with higher charges and lost most of their seats in the south-west as a result. I think that the hon. Lady should apologise for the Conservative record, rather than complaining that someone is trying to get something done about it. Had they done something, they would have more seats now.</p>
	<p pid="a.154.1/2">There are various routes by which what I suggest could be done. One would be to make the benefits system responsive to the cost of water bills, as it is to other charges, such as council tax in particular, which people pay differentially in different parts of the country, so that people in high council tax areas get more benefit. No one complains about that principle and I do not think that the hon. Lady wants to change it. I see no reason why the same principle should not apply in the case that I am talking about. However, I also want to talk about ways of mitigating the cost, which would reduce the impact on everyone.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment, although I am not sure that I would use the word &quot;detail&quot; to describe the errors made in privatisation. In my part of the world, that detail is regarded as pretty fundamental. Apart from that, I agree with much of what he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/2">I do indeed want to turn to the discussion of practical measures, which I think the Minister is open to considering. Indeed, in last year's debate the Government confirmed that they were working with Ofwat, water companies and the Consumer Council for Water, to consider charging options and alternative tariffs, and that a working group including the Treasury, Ofwat, the water companies and the Consumer Council for Water representatives had been set up to advise on fairer charging for lower-income groups. The latest water strategy document makes a commitment to commissioning an independent review of metering and charging. The problem is that water customers everywhere will be wondering quite how many Government reviews it takes to change a water bill. It would be nice to move from reviewing to doing, and I shall make some suggestions along those lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/3">We have a charging system that needs a complete overhaul. That can be easily demonstrated with the examples that I have given from the south-west. Changes have taken place in the past few years in an attempt at mitigation. The vulnerable groups tariff, for example, means that people can apply to pay on a tariff that reflects average charges, or lower, if they are particularly vulnerable. However, it is too narrow in its reach. It excludes the many low-income households that have fewer than three children, or that live just above the income benefit threshold. Not only that: for those who qualify, bills are capped only to the average for the area, which in the south-west is still above what is affordable, when we consider that the families are by definition in very low-income groups and highly vulnerable. Some steps could be taken in that regard, if the Government were to work with Ofwat and the Consumer Council for Water to change views on cross-subsidy, to allow innovative tariffs to assist with affordability. For example, South West Water has argued that there would be a benefit from a national scheme funded through a levy on all bills, as happens in the energy sector, with the Warm Front scheme. Again, I do not understand why those national levies are regarded as acceptable in one sector but not in the water sector, where bills are similarly high and where the environmental issues and reduction of water use are of similar importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.5/4">Under Ofwat rules, it is very difficult to target specific groups, and the result is that the help that is available can help the multimillionaire in a penthouse as much as the single pensioner in a council house. That is to do with how the water regulation system was worked out, and also with the way Ofwat interprets it. I think that change is needed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.156.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="156"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0001.htm#08031853000486">
	<p pid="a.156.1/1">As it happens, that was exactly where I was about to turn in my remarks, but I wanted to outline the context to some of the targeted measures, because even for a rising block tariff it would probably be necessary for measures to address the needs of the most vulnerable, whether through the benefits system or specific changes in tariffs to affect individuals. Indeed, we know that that would be true for those with disabilities or large families, who may need to use relatively large amounts of water. We need a system sensitive to that. One option is a system that shares data so that water companies can adjust bills according to data from the benefits system, for example. If the Government believe that that is not possible, the regulator has suggested that such households should be able to apply for help. My concern with applying for help is that, as we know, means-tested and application-based systems such as help with council tax are not taken up by many of the most vulnerable. Frankly, though, anything would be better than the current circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/2">As the hon. Gentleman suggests, the possibilities of a rising block tariff are strong. There is a strong consensus about that among most south-west MPs and a lot of interest among MPs throughout the country. I know that the Government are considering it. It would mean that metered households pay an affordable amount for their first block of water. People would pay a set charge and get in return enough water for a normal household for the year, and if they used large amounts of water&mdash;if they have a swimming pool or leave their sprinklers on in the garden all through the summer&mdash;they would pay much higher charges. It is those later blocks, which would incur higher charges, that add so much to the cost for the water companies. They require a greater draw on reservoirs, higher system capacity and more purification and treatment and waste water.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/3">The rising block tariff makes sense from an environmental point of view, it makes sense for charging and, most of all, it makes sense for ordinary hard-pressed families in water bill areas, particularly in the highest-priced area, the south-west. Specific affordability tariffs will be needed for certain groups, and we must consider how best to put those in place. On a particularly bright note, from my point of view, it also means that we would get rid of the situation in which tens of thousands of second home owners in the south-west, realising that they are not at home very much to use water, have fitted water meters and pay next to nothing for their water bills, even though the reason why they are there is to use the beaches that have been so expensively cleaned up. Under rising block tariffs, people would have to pay for the year's water, and therefore for the clean-up of beaches, whether or not they reside there enough to use it. Although opinions may differ on that, it would be given a big thumbs up in our part of the world if the Minister did it.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/4">Rising block tariffs would also be extremely good for the environment. The World Wildlife Fund predicts that they could reduce demand by at least 10 per cent. and by up to 30 per cent. in summer. That would cut the cost of treatment, which would lower bills. WWF says:</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/5" class="indent">&quot;We need to move on the issue of water charging and we need to move quickly. There are plenty of ideas on the table, and we need to start making them work for the customer.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.158.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" speakername="Matthew Taylor" colnum="158"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0002.htm#08031853000492">
	<p pid="a.158.3/1">That is the right approach. The policy is supported by Government, but also by non-governmental organisations and, at least in theory, by the industry. The change in approach will mean a move away from expensive, energy-intensive, temporary end-of-pipe treatment measures and towards less intrusive catchment management, in which water companies will develop working relationships with landowners, farmers and other stakeholders to prevent the quality of water from being lowered before it enters the water companies' systems, so that we do not need to tackle issues such as nitrates afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/2">Adopting catchment management methodology, if it is delivered effectively, enables water companies to lower their expenditure on end-of-pipe treatment without the risk of compromising water quality or safety. Lower capital investment will then benefit the customer by lowering water bills in the long run. Furthermore, ending the need for end-of-pipe treatments will lower companies' carbon footprint and increase their environmental sustainability. It is a long-term solution, whereas capital investment needs constant renewal and expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/3">Page 51 of &quot;Future Water&quot; says:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/4" class="indent">&quot;We also encourage water companies to work with farmers to tackle pollution at source, for example where this is more cost effective than treating raw drinking water at the point of abstraction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/5">I could not agree more. Unfortunately&mdash;so far, at least&mdash;Ofwat could not agree less. That is a fundamental problem, and it is the reason for the debate. Ofwat said in its PR09 consultation:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Water companies may see opportunities to address drinking water issues by encouraging changes to land management in the catchments&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/7">which is good. However, it went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/8" class="indent">&quot;we would not wish water consumers to offer a cross-subsidy to address third party pollution issues&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/9">and, specifically, that any proposals for expenditure would be considered only if the company owned the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/10">Assuming that Ofwat does not want water companies to buy up agricultural land in every catchment and around every river, its fundamental criteria effectively block the very measures that the Government say are necessary, the water framework requires of water companies and many NGOs and water companies themselves accept are necessary. Ofwat is directly contradicting the Government view. That is clearly nonsensical, especially given that such measures are meant to reduce customer bills in the long run. I do not believe that customers in the south-west are saying, &quot;We want a worse environment and higher bills, please&quot;, so why is the water regulator, which is charged with protecting customers' interests, standing in the way of such measures? The answer is that it has a very narrow, old-fashioned approach to the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/11">The traditional means of dealing with such problems have been expensive, but the alternatives can be cheaper. The water industry estimates that, since 1990, it has spent &pound;1 billion on pesticide removal alone. Projects under way in the water supply areas of Bristol and Wessex Water show that working with farmers can reduce nitrate and pesticide pollution in ground-water. In northern England, upland moors and bogs are being restored over tens of thousands of acres to purify the water before it enters the system. South West Water is planning a number of such catchment management projects in PR09, with the support of organisations across the south-west, including national parks, the Environment Agency, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and a broad swathe of environmental organisations, but not, it seems, of Ofwat.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/12">Other countries are doing it. New York state experimented on the relative value between water treatment and forestry and found that the latter provided better treatment at a much lower cost. So why is the regulator here standing in the way? Natural England, which carried out work on the subject for the Government, concluded from its study on the options raised by them that agriculture requires regulation changes, advice and incentives. If the water companies are not acting, whose responsibility is it to drive things forward? Who is going to provide the incentive to stakeholders, such as landowners and farmers, to change their practices? If the Government or Ofwat have a better idea, they should tell us.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/13">There is no doubt that if we are successfully to adopt a more catchment-based approach to water resource management, we need to determine the payment mechanism and how to fund it in the long term. Water quality trading is one idea. However, those discussions need to take place now, while the Government and others are setting the agenda for the next five or 20 years. We cannot keep ducking the issue; it is time to make changes. The fundamental premise of any future water charging system should be that water companies can demonstrate to Ofwat that they are proposing the most efficient solution to deliver a specific outcome. It should be irrelevant whether that is a soft engineering solution, such as a wetland to improve water retention and remove pollutants, or a traditional capital intensive project. We should start from a level playing field.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/14">The Government, non-governmental organisations, such as Wildlife and Countryside Link, which covers all the major NGOs, and Natural England all appear, to differing degrees, to agree that such upstream thinking and working with the environment is the way to go. The water framework requires a solution, but so far Ofwat seems to be offering nothing but roadblocks, although it told me at the weekend that it is reviewing its position, which I hope is true. I hope that following this debate and ministerial discussions, Ofwat will change its negative position.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/15">The best reason to favour such schemes is that they are the cheapest way in which to achieve the required level of performance, which is entirely consistent with water sector regulatory incentives. To be fair to Ofwat, the PR09 consultation opens that possibility: it produced its 25-year strategic direction statement, to replace the five-year plans, which proved so inadequate; it is encouraging water companies to adopt a longer-term perspective; and it is offering water companies the ability to offer alternative strategies alongside their business plans to show how things could be done differently. The vast majority of water companies have published their SDSs&mdash;only a couple are still to come&mdash;and they all talk about such holistic approaches. However, it is up to the Government and the regulator to ensure that their words are translated into action.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.3/16">Most companies, frankly, are paying lip service to the issues and not offering practical solutions, although that is not the case with all of them. I am delighted that for once we can boast about water companies, rather than complain: Wessex Water and Anglian Water are planning catchment solutions. However, they still do not know if Ofwat will simply block them, and certainly most water companies are not yet committed to such new approaches. We must move beyond platitudes, warm words and ministerial reviews, and actually take action. Publication of the Government's strategy is helpful and the Ofwat review is the time to take action. Let us change things now before water customers suffer further unnecessary rises in bills and the environment continues to deteriorate.</p>

	<p pid="a.161.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this debate&mdash;there probably is no subject of greater interest to constituents in the south-west&mdash;and particularly on the way in which he discussed the long-term solutions and opportunities available at this critical point for dealing with an intractable problem. I welcome the line that the Minister has taken since taking up his post and, in particular, the very thorough and good report, &quot;Future Water&quot;. I agree with the hon. Gentleman on its quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/2">The debate has been given momentum, perhaps not by our problems in the south-west, but by the need to consider metering&mdash;perhaps mandatory metering&mdash;and specific charging tariffs, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, which can provide fairer bills generally and go a long way to protecting vulnerable customers. The move to metering and smart metering&mdash;the latter also needs to be on the agenda&mdash;is being given momentum by companies facing drought measures. Compulsory metering is being applied to water companies in the south-east owing to water scarcity, and some water companies will be following a full metering programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/3">In water company areas other than the south-west, where water scarcity has been a problem for a very long time, that will create issues of affordability, particularly for householders in low rateable value properties. They pay proportionately less for their water now, but will find that their bills increase under metering, although on nothing like the scale faced in the south-west, where bills are &pound;100 more than the average. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that they can be in the region of &pound;500 or &pound;600, but recently I have seen bills for &pound;700 and 800, which are not uncommon in low-income households. I would therefore welcome any action that can be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/4">I shall discuss the metering and charging review and set out three issues that I would like the Minister to take in, or at least focus on. He has set out five goals&mdash;for the sake of time, I shall not repeat them all, because I know that other hon. Members want to speak. The first goal is to assess the effectiveness and fairness of charging methods, which is essential, given current trends in water metering and for the reasons set out by the hon. Gentleman. As set out in the second goal, following trials, we must also consider the effectiveness of different types of social and block tariffs, paying particular attention to how they can affect vulnerable households. The remaining goals relate to pace of change, universal metering&mdash;we have heard how two thirds of people in the south-west are already on meters&mdash;and the cost of metering, including smart metering. Our metering policy must also take into account the social cost of carbon emissions, because climate change is, of course, a big issue, and any policy that takes account of it is a winner. We also need to look closely at the cost of different options. On the introduction of any such policy nationwide, the Minister must recognise that, through South West Water, twice as many customers in our region have meters already; otherwise we will yet again be on the losing side. The review will consider whether legislation is needed for charging or metering.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/5">The present list focuses on tariff types and metering, but it ignores the benefits of improving water efficiency inside the home, which Eaga did so much to explore in the south-west's affordability pilot. The pilot showed that one can reduce the amount of water used in the home by an average of 11 per cent., as the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs report on it sets out. The saving can make a difference to the bills that vulnerable households receive, and to the water company through reduced energy costs and less stress on water resources. Put another way, if the pilot measures were adopted throughout all homes in London, a further 200,000 homes could be built without any more demand on the water and sewerage resources&mdash;another win-win situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.2/1">I completely share the hon. Lady's view on that point, which is why if we go down the route of the rising block tariff, it is important that information be shared with the water companies so that support can be given as automatically as possible, rather than claimed, as Ofwat say it must be. All the evidence shows that when it must be claimed, the most vulnerable rarely get it.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.3/1">That is correct, and no doubt adopting a rising block tariff&mdash;I shall be brief because the hon. Gentleman has already dealt with it in detail&mdash;would reduce the number of households that were eligible for the vulnerable persons regulations. The tariff caps at a certain level people who are on a metered charge. The two measures would work hand-in-hand, but because it will be some years before we see the benefits of any new policy&mdash;apart from anything else, it would require the even wider introduction of meters&mdash;something should be done now to place upon the companies an obligation to increase drastically the uptake of the vulnerable persons regulations. That should be done by setting targets for uptake. I know that there are hon. Members&mdash;some probably in this Chamber&mdash;who object to targets, but that would be one very good target to introduce.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/2">As the Minister knows, the all-party group on water is conducting an inquiry at this critical time, for all the reasons that the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell set out in his speech. I understand that the Minister will attend the launch of our report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-02">2 April</phrase>, and I hope that everybody here today will also attend. During the course of the inquiry, our right hon. Friend Lord Whitty, who is one of the team, along with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> and the former Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase>, asked whether it would be possible</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/3" class="indent">&quot;to extend the definition of customer service&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/4">as a performance target in the price review to include</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/5" class="indent">&quot;looking after our most vulnerable customers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/6">That would be one way of ensuring that more was done.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/7">I also make a plea to set the vulnerable persons regulations cap not at the regional average, which still gives people in the south-west a cap that is &pound;100 higher than the average, but at the national average. Although compulsory metering can bring in tariffs, in the meantime we must do something about the vulnerable persons regulations, and in the long term we must also consider the situation of people who will not be helped by compulsory metering but will still have large bills. After all that is done, we must still examine the benefits system. I urge the Minister to consult Ministers in the Department for Work and Pensions on that issue, so that we do not still have a significant group of people whose problems have not been resolved, even when we have secured long-term solutions to this intractable problem. He must ensure that he talks to his colleagues and that they talk to him about the likely residual problem, so that it can be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.3/8">Overall, the water package enables us to see some light at the end of the tunnel. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is doing a great deal, that he has studied carefully the links with the programme for energy conservation in homes, and that he is a strong believer in the need to tackle both matters at the same time. That would be very helpful, because far too many of our constituents still pay not just 10 per cent. of their income for water, but 20 per cent., 25 per cent. and even occasionally more than that, for their utility bills, including fuel and water.</p>

	<p pid="a.163.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>. She has done a huge amount of work through her membership of the all-party group on water, as her remarks demonstrate, and she clearly has an in-depth understanding of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/2">I shall not repeat the arguments that we have heard, but I shall make a few brief remarks, because water is an issue that is rising up everyone's agenda. It will certainly rise up my constituents' agenda, because their council tax bills, energy bills and water bills will rise above inflation. Water is one factor that is contributing to a squeeze on people's income, and it must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/3">Water was the most significant issue that constituents raised with me before I was elected, and it has been since, just as it has been for my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>. It is fantastic that it has risen up the Government's agenda, too: they now have their &quot;Future Water&quot; strategy, which they published just a month ago, and Ofwat is conducting a review. I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate, because the worry is that the Government's primary concern is to deal with water-stressed areas. If one reads &quot;Future Water&quot;, one sees lots about improving environmental standards and dealing with water-stressed areas; however, in the south-west, the fundamental problem is not availability of water, but the cost owing to the fundamental structural problems that existed at the point of privatisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/4">My hon. Friend has done a great job of ensuring that water affordability is on the agenda. Although it is great that it has made it into the Government's &quot;Future Water&quot; strategy, it is tagged on to a few pages at the back, and there is a danger that now that is in the document, it will be overlooked. I hope that that will not be the case. Following the meeting with the Minister before Christmas, it was fantastic to see water affordability included in the Government' strategy, but as I said the key thing is to make sure that it does not slide off the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.0/5">There have been some other concessions in the past few years. The water affordability pilot has helped households across the whole of the South West Water area. Tribute must be paid to the way that South West Water has pushed that pilot forward: it has really driven forward the agenda by ensuring that as many households as possible are opened up to the scheme. It is continuing to roll the scheme out to make it available to as many people as possible, and the company has made every effort to be as helpful as it possibly can to individuals who come to me for help.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.164.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" colnum="164"  time="010:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0003.htm#08031853000500">
	<p pid="a.164.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady for making that point. I certainly try to emphasise to constituents who come to my advice surgeries expressing concern about the difficulty that they have in paying their bills the potential benefits that the pilot scheme could bring. It makes me wonder whether the scheme has ended up being a lot more expensive than the Government had planned, because not only is it helping to improve the efficiency of people's water use, but it has highlighted how many people are not claiming the benefits to which they are entitled. That goes back to one of the points made earlier in the debate about the need to ensure that data are shared: certainly, a large number of households are not benefiting from entitlements that they should be receiving.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/2">There has been some progress, but I am afraid that this feels a bit like &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; to me, because that this is probably the third or fourth debate that we have had on this issue since I was elected to Parliament in 2005. In many areas, it feels like one is stuck going round in circles, or perhaps stuck in one of those telephone systems where different menu options keep being presented, but every time an option is selected, one ends up going back to another menu option that directs one back to the start. I would like to give a couple of examples of that type of problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/3">In addition to debates in Westminster Hall, we have had the opportunity of meeting with both Ofwat and Ministers. Those meetings have always been conducted on a cross-party basis, because there is a real strength of feeling across the whole of the south-west on this issue. On several occasions, Ofwat has directed us to the Minister, saying, &quot;We are just operating the regulatory framework, you will have to speak to the Minister.&quot; We then speak to a Minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who says, &quot;Of course I can look at this, but ultimately it is the Treasury that decides.&quot; So then we try to meet a Treasury Minister, but we are directed back to DEFRA and back to where we started. That has been a cause of real frustration, and we are yet to secure a meeting with a representative from the Treasury. If the Minister can give us any kind of reassurance that that meeting might happen, many of us would be very happy.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/4">There is also frustration about the fact that water poverty is not recognised as being of equal importance to other poverty issues. Fuel poverty is the obvious example, and there are many clear parallels to be drawn with that in terms of the impact that water bills have on those with the lowest incomes and the benefits to the environment that could be achieved by improving water efficiency. I have concerns about how Warm Front operates as a national scheme and about its ability to identify isolated, vulnerable households.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/5">Fuel poverty is a problem that has been recognised; there is a winter fuel allowance. In 2004 the Government's &quot;Cross-Government Review of Water Affordability Report&quot; identified that by 2010:</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/6" class="indent">&quot;a single pensioner household living on the minimum Pension Credit and paying an average South West water and sewerage bill may be required to pay 7% of disposable income&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/7">So we knew four years ago that, for those pensioners, water bills will be at least as big an issue, if not a greater one, than their fuel bills, yet there is no comparable scheme to provide assistance to them. I am not entirely sure why water poverty is not being recognised by the Government in their actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/8">The Government are also trying to hit their own target on child poverty. Tackling water affordability in the south-west is one of the key measures needed to allow the Government to hit that target, but responses to the parliamentary questions that I have tabled do not make it clear whether water poverty has any input into the working of the child poverty unit. I found it difficult enough to understand how the unit works, given that the Treasury is responsible for targets on child poverty, yet the answering Department for questions on the unit is the Department for Children, Schools and Families, and the Department for Work and Pensions takes a lead in providing resources for the unit. Again, one feels like one is going round in a circle when trying to work out whom to ask to ensure that water poverty is included for consideration by the Child Poverty Unit. When I asked that question explicitly in November 2007, the answer that I received was that:</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The child poverty public service agreement (PSA) sets out the strategic priorities for Government in tackling child poverty including...reducing poverty through raising incomes, and tackling poor living conditions.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-11-26.56"><i>Official Report</i>, 26 November 2007; Vol. 468, c. 56-57W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/10">A variety of other measures are given, but water poverty is not explicitly mentioned. Will Minister reassure us today that water poverty is actively being considered by the child poverty unit, and that his Department is making representations to the unit to ensure that water poverty is firmly on its agenda?</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/11">I would like to give one other example from very recent experience of talking to people who have been affected by water quality problems and who are feeling real frustration about the way in which the operation of different Departments has made it very difficult to provide a joined-up approach to or even an understanding of the potential effect of the issue of water quality. On Friday, I spoke to some mussel farmers in my constituency who work on the River Fal. A series of areas that they work in have been downgraded by the Food Standards Agency because of the flesh samples that have been taken from the mussels, which means that the mussels must be moved somewhere else before they can be sold. That creates additional cost for the mussel farmers that threatens their livelihood. The FSA's analysis of the mussels clearly shows that the incidence of a harmful bacterium&mdash;E. coli, I think&mdash;is rising, which is affecting the water quality. However, the Environment Agency is saying that water quality standards in these areas are improving, so nothing is being done to try to tackle the underlying problem, even though it is manifesting in the quality of mussel flesh. Once again, there is frustration that different Departments and bodies are not working in a joined-up way, and people are finding themselves going round in circles.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/12">The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton and my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell have gone into some detail about the type of solutions that we need to deal with water problems. The type of environmental solutions that my hon. Friend mentioned&mdash;the use of capital-intensive resources to purify water&mdash;would help not only water bill payers, but the mussel farmers in the Fal. Such environmental solutions are long-term measures that need to be actively pursued, and it is great to see them included in the Government's strategy.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.1/1">The hon. Lady is correct. It is interesting to note that although the Conservatives are well represented in the south-west, both in the area covered by South West Water and in the Government region, not a single one of those Members is here to comment on this issue. That is disappointing.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell spoke about long-term solutions. Obviously, the only permanent solution will be some kind of equalisation measure that spreads the burden more fairly. As the hon. Lady and my hon. Friend have said, the take-up of the vulnerable groups tariff is higher in the south-west than in any other part of the country; however, there are still plenty of people who could benefit from it but are not taking it up. As the average cost used to calculate the tariff is an average of South West Water bills, which are the highest, people on the tariff still face high bills. We need a permanent solution to the problem, and we must recognise that more could be done to support vulnerable groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/3">The use of a rising block tariff would spread the burden more fairly, but, ultimately, it would not get around the structural problem that has left South West Water bill payers in their current situation. We need to be explicit about the fact that a rising block tariff should recognise different groups, so there would not be a continuation of the current situation in which second-home owners benefit from the infrastructure that is provided to their doors, but pay the lowest bills because they are not there to use resources. Any tariff system would have to take that into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.2/1">The mention of second homes has tempted me to intervene on my hon. Friend. Second home owners would no doubt comment, and I am sure that my hon. Friend would agree, that as they are not there all the time, they do not place the same demand on the water system as those who are. However, the problem is at times of peak demand. Despite all the investment by South West Water, the sewage processing system in some parts of the south-west is increasingly under strain at peak times. Even though people do not live in those second homes all the time, the infrastructure has to be able to cope at peak times, and a rising block tariff system would mean that second home owners make a fair contribution.</p>

	<p pid="a.170.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this debate. I also congratulate him on the expertise that he has built up over the years. Any Yorkshireman would be shocked that Cornwall could even begin to compete with the wealth of resources that we have on our beaches in North Yorkshire, let alone the whole of Yorkshire. I await what the Minister will say but hope that this does not turn into a war of the roses.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/2">Moving rapidly on, one thing that this debate has established is that the demand for household water has risen by 55 per cent. since 1980, and that the trend is set to increase. Water metering should be seen as part of an integrated approach to providing information and helping to adapt consumer behaviour. I do not see any reason why a rising block system could not be introduced without universal smart meters, and I hope that the introduction of smart meters does not require us to be too smart in using them. The concept of meters that are able to talk to each other so that households, whatever their income, will be able to see, particularly in the coldest months of the year, their consumption of all utilities is exciting.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/3">On affordability, I draw attention to the fact that there is currently a vulnerable groups tariff: metered households in receipt of certain state benefits who have three or more dependent children and people with certain medical conditions should pay no more than the average charge for their region. We should all draw attention to that. A vulnerable groups workshop in September 2006 produced recommendations that I find very persuasive: tariff and associated information should be given more positive branding, application forms and guidance should be simplified and standardised, and all relevant parties, including the Department for Work and Pensions, should collaborate in targeted publicity. The recommendations also stated that there is a strong argument for extending qualification to include pensioners. I should like to ask the Minister, having heard this debate, what discussions he has had with his opposite number in the DWP in the context of the 2009 review and the consultations on and reviews of the water strategy. It strikes me, particularly when talking about those on benefits and the plight of pensioners, that the recommendations bear some regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/4">The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell focused heavily on beaches, for reasons which are perfectly understandable. Perhaps I ought to declare an interest: I was an MEP for 10 years and probably dealt with the European Union bathing directive, drinking water directive and several other directives. In my time as the representative for the whole of the Essex coast, I handed out a blue flag to one of the beaches on behalf of the district council.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/5">I make a plea to the Minister and to all hon. Members who have taken part in the debate to consider the implications of the price review for sewerage and water supply generally. I have some sympathy with South West Water customers, but I am a Yorkshire Water customer. I have had a series of meetings with the company, and I pay tribute to the work that it did in the clean-up exercise, given the number of houses in one city alone&mdash;Hull&mdash;that were flooded last year. Our price change involves an increase of 7.5 per cent., which may dwarf even the South West Water price increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/6">Could the Minister say something about his adaptation agenda in the context of the price review and the water strategy generally? The Association of British Insurers has come up with its own adaptation agenda. It specifically asks for more investment in flood and coastal defences and in urban drainage and strengthened land-use planning.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/7">The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell and his colleagues spoke about land use. There is some idea that we could move forward with that, in the context of the Ofwat review. Would the Minister accept that water companies could play a role in slowing water down by co-operating with the landowners and farmers who work the land and allowing some water to be retained on that land? Is it possible or feasible for water companies to do that, or is it even appropriate for them to do so?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/8">The concept of storing water on land upstream to prevent flooding downstream is worth exploring. It is not something that we are looking at Yorkshire Water to do, but it is something that we are looking at in my constituency. As the Minister well knows, Thirsk was flooded twice within five years. One business there is now unable to get any insurance cover at all. There is a flood alleviation scheme&mdash;I know that this is not about the price review&mdash;but we felt a bit aggrieved when, having worked for five or six years to get Cod Beck enmained, we found that the Government changed the point system, so that it did not matter that it was enmained. A different point system applied, so that Cod Beck was still not due to get money. It is worth exploring whether Yorkshire Water and other water companies, as the hon. Gentleman suggested, could work with landowners for the greater good of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/9">As recently as <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-14">14 March</phrase>, the Minister responded to one of our great concerns, which was reflected in the Pitt review recommendation. At present, water companies are obliged to offer all new developments&mdash;I believe that this probably relates to substantial new developments&mdash;the right to connect to the public sewerage system under section 104 of the Water Industry Act 1991. As the Minister is aware, one of the interim recommendations of the Pitt review is that there should be an end to the automatic right to connection. The Minister will appreciate that we support that recommendation wholeheartedly. In his answer of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-14">14 March</phrase>, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/10" class="indent">&quot;It has not yet been determined how the money...will be allocated.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-03-14.709"><i>Official Report</i>, 14 March 2008; Vol. 473, c. 709W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/11">I believe that the Government have allocated &pound;34.5 million in respect of the Pitt review.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/12">Based on discussions that I have had with water companies, it strikes me that ending the automatic right to connection would be done for no other reason than to ask water companies to perform a similar role to that of the Environment Agency in determining whether there is indeed the capacity for any substantial new development of houses to feed waste water into drains. Missing from the debate was the concept of water companies dealing with surface water run-off, which caused flooding in substantial parts of the country last year, and the end to the automatic right to connection having cost implications for water companies. Has the Minister given some thought to who will pay, and how the water companies will raise the money to enable them to perform that duty?</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/13">Finally, just what should be the role of Ofwat, as the economic regulator? Obviously, it is there to protect the interests of consumers, to promote effective competition and to set the framework for new water supply licensing regimes. We note with some concern the increases in water bills, not just for those who are clearly not in a position to pay but for middle earners&mdash;those hard-pressed families who have probably been hit by other substantial, above-inflation increases in their energy bills.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mrs. Humble. I concur that the best beaches are in the north-west of England, particularly in your constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/2">I offer the traditional congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> on securing this debate and raising this issue. It is somewhat intimidating when the hon. Member who leads an Adjournment debate clearly knows much more about the subject than the Minister who responds. I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman. I am sure that the former hon. Member, Sir Percy Harris, would have been extremely proud of him. I send him my best wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/3">Let me answer the questions as best I can in the brief time available to me. It is best if I start by responding to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>. Our review of the charges is not about whether there should be change, but about how it should be brought about. Therefore, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase> can be reassured that this is part of a process to change policy and not a review about whether we should be changing policy. The decision and the direction of travel are clear; I put that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/4">I shall try to get through the policy points and answer the questions. Clearly, policy has to change because of the points that hon. Members have made about water supply in parts of the country, water affordability and the equity of water bills&mdash;given the modern circumstances that we are in&mdash;and because of the important point, made by a number of hon. Members, about the relationship between water use and energy efficiency in the home and in buildings. The lowest hanging fruit is energy efficiency, and the lowest hanging fruit in that regard is better use of hot water. We need to tie the relevant policies together, and my strategy does exactly that, as the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/5">Climate change is the issue that will force us to change. If we do not get our policies in place, we will suffer the consequences. So that is important as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/6">Hon. Members mentioned that 2008 is a critical year for water policy. That is so. The &quot;Future Water&quot; strategy, which a number of hon. Members mentioned, sets out our high-level vision for the water sector in England. The main goals of the policy are to improve the quality of our rivers and lakes and the wildlife that they support; to manage sustainably the risks from all types of flooding and coastal erosion; to ensure a sustainable use of water resources and fair, affordable and cost-reflective water charges; to cut the greenhouse gas emissions associated with water supply and use; and to make adaptation to climate change and other pressures part of the business-as-usual activity in water policy and management. That strategy is not a blueprint, but it sets out the priorities for water management and some of the steps that we need to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.2/7">On the Ofwat price review, I want to say a few words about the latest periodic review of water company price limits, or PRO9. The review process is explained in detail on Ofwat's website, as hon. Members know. Last year, I published a statement of obligations for companies and regulators to bring together and describe the environmental drinking water legislation that will apply to the water industry over the PRO9 period. Looking to the longer term, alongside &quot;Future Water&quot;, we published draft statutory social and environmental guidance to Ofwat. That answers the point made by the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell about what happens upstream. I concur on that point and will answer in more detail if I have time.</p>

	<p pid="a.176.1/1">It is a delight to speak in Westminster Hall under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble. I would appreciate it if you could convey my thanks to Mr. Speaker for selecting this subject for debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/2">On Saturday, firefighters, members of the public, MPs and councillors marched through the centre of Grimsby carrying banners stating, &quot;No Fire Cuts&quot; and &quot;Cuts Cost Lives&quot;. People were clapping and cheering as they marched past, and a flower shop had a sign in its window stating &quot;Florists Support The Firemen&quot;. It was a good-natured march, but the message was deadly serious. At the front, four firefighters were carrying a coffin because they believe that the proposed changes to Humberside fire and rescue service could endanger lives. We must remember that those are the very people who head towards burning buildings when the rest of us would instinctively want to get away. They constantly put their lives on the line, and I take it seriously when they tell me that the changes will put lives at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/3">To put the matter into context, it was 11 days before Christmas when East Riding of Yorkshire councillor Doreen Engall, who chairs the Humberside fire authority, made the following announcement:</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Today&mdash;Friday 14th December 2007&mdash;the Humberside Fire Authority has discussed Operational Resource Disposition across the Humberside Fire and Rescue area and...agreed to start the public consultation process on the following proposed changes:&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/5" class="indent">Sledmere Retained Fire Station Closed and taken out of service 2008/09</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/6" class="indent">Waltham Retained Fire Station&mdash;Closed &amp; taken out of service 2008/09</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/7" class="indent">Kirton Lindsey Retained Fire Station&mdash;Closed &amp; taken out of service 2008/09</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/8" class="indent">Immingham West Fire Station Reduction by one fire engine 2009/10</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/9" class="indent">Goole Fire Station Convert crewing of one fire engine from wholetime crewing to retained 2009/10</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/10" class="indent">Hull Central Fire Station Closed and taken out of service</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/11" class="indent">fire engines to be relocated...2010/11</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/12" class="indent">Hull North Fire Station Increase by one fire engine 2010/11</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/13" class="indent">Hull West Increase by one fire engine 2010/11&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/14">If those changes go ahead, they will be some of the most severe cuts ever experienced by the Humberside fire and rescue service.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/15">I want to give the Minister and others who do not know that part of the country a picture of the area that it serves. People often imagine that the east riding and Lincolnshire is bucolically rural, and in parts it is. However, it has a population of more than 900,000 and is dominated by a huge concentration of industry. The north and south banks of the Humber are home to most of England's oil refining, chemical and pharmaceuticals industries, and British Aerospace at Brough. The Humber ports of Immingham, Grimsby, Goole and Hull are some of the busiest in the country. It is estimated that 25 per cent. of the UK's freight goes in and out of Immingham. Associated with that, apart from road transport, is a huge rail freight depot. We also have Humberside airport and the Corus steelworks at Scunthorpe. Some 32 industrial sites are subject to the top level of control under the control of major accident hazards regulations, and it is the highest concentration of such sites in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/16">The area is very varied. As well as those industrial sites, Cleethorpes and Bridlington are busy resorts, with a huge influx of visitors in the summer. In Cleethorpes, apart from day visitors, there is a 4,000-strong caravan park. Other risk factors that we must consider include, sadly, the bad road traffic accident rate in parts of Lincolnshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/17">News of the changes broke in the local media on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-15">15 December</phrase> when the <i>Grimsby Telegraph</i> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/18" class="indent">&quot;The plan, by Humberside Fire Authority, is part of an effort to save an estimated &pound;4 million overspend and follows a round of cutbacks two years ago, which saw Immingham's service reduced from four fire appliances to three.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/19">It is important to focus on the</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/20" class="indent">&quot;effort to save an...overspend&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.1/21">In reality, that means that we will lose between 100 and 110 firefighters on top of similar cuts a couple of years ago. Most of those jobs&mdash;12 retained firefighters at Waltham and 53 whole-time firefighters at Immingham&mdash;are in my constituency, so Cleethorpes will bear the brunt of the cuts. The nine appliances covering north-east Lincolnshire will be reduced to seven if the cuts go ahead. Those will be the most savage cutbacks ever experienced by Humberside fire and rescue service.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">I agree with everything that the hon. Lady has said so far, but I do not want the debate to run away with one point&mdash;risk assessment. I have an interest because in the Howdenshire part of my constituency and in Goole, which is in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1452" name="Ian Cawsey">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey)</phrase>, the fire service emergency cover model&mdash;FSEC&mdash;which assesses risk in various areas, dramatically underestimates the individual risks applying to elderly constituents, who may use oil or container-based gas heating, and who have as much right to a fire service as anyone living in the middle of a town. I am worried that one of the calculations to justify the cuts underestimates the risk in rural areas. Does she agree?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.177.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1504" speakername="Shona McIsaac" colnum="177"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0005.htm#08031853000522">
	<p pid="a.177.1/1">I shall come to the FSEC computer programme. I agree that it has serious flaws and that it does not give a robust enough analysis. Fire and rescue services in some parts of the country do not use it because they know from local knowledge that it underestimates some risks and puts some areas at high risk when they are not. Waltham retained fire station covers the more rural and suburban southern part of north-east Lincolnshire. Many of the right hon. Gentleman's concerns&mdash;for example, about Howden&mdash;are also experienced in places such as Waltham.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/2">I raised the matter in the House in the Christmas recess Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-18">18 December</phrase>. Following that, I met firefighters to discuss their concerns and objections to the changes. What struck me as odd was that I had not received an official communication from the fire authority. In fact, I am not aware of any of the area's MPs receiving anything official from the fire authority about the proposals. On investigation, I found that other key stakeholders&mdash;for example, the port health authority&mdash;were not included in the discussions at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/3">However, to be fair, after Christmas I received a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-21">21 December</phrase> from the chief fire officer, Frank Duffield, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/4" class="indent">&quot;I write to inform you that in concluding a three and a half year study across Humberside, proposals were put before the Fire Authority as outlined on the attached press statement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/5">What I was given was the statement that was made on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-14">14 December</phrase>. Those dates are important, because there are time limits within which to raise objections. When key stakeholders were made aware of the plans is pertinent to the argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/6">Following the announcement, I kept checking the Humberside fire and rescue service's website. The proposals were not posted on it until about the second week of January&mdash;almost a month after the initial announcement. The printed document came out about the second or third week of January, which is fine if someone can see what the proposals are because they have access to the internet, but many residents do not. Those people have been denied a chance to have the full time to air their views on the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/7">I know that MPs met the chief fire officer, members of the Fire Brigades Union and others in the new year. However, at the same time news also broke that Humberside fire and rescue service will receive a 5.8 per cent. increase in its funding, which was much more than it expected and much more than neighbouring fire and rescue services. I refer hon. Members back to the comments made in the breaking news stories of <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-15">15 December</phrase>, which state that the cutbacks were part of an effort to save an overspend. At that stage, given the additional funding available, many of us hoped that there would be a rethink. Sadly, that did not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/8">I have concerns about the data&mdash;the FSEC issue. A lot of jargon and acronyms will be used in the debate, and FSEC is the computer programme used to predict risk. Before we received the official documents, I examined the background to how fire authorities make their decisions. I discovered that FSEC is not universally applied across the country. On the fire service emergency cover toolkit, a document from a neighbouring authority&mdash;West Yorkshire fire and rescue service&mdash;states that the</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/9" class="indent">&quot;outputs from the model do not accurately reflect the known risk to the community of West Yorkshire, therefore the Toolkit is deemed to be insufficiently robust to be utilised in the development of valid and reliable risk reduction and resource reallocation strategies&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/10">Despite a neighbouring authority saying that any decisions based on that programme will not be robust, an enormous emphasis has been placed on the programme in Humberside.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/11">I have compared the statistics on the previous round of cuts in 2005 with what has been presented to us, and the maps that were produced for both rounds of cuts vary enormously. Before FSEC was relied on so heavily, areas that were previously high risk are now deemed low risk. To someone with knowledge of those areas, that seems to be totally counter-intuitive, and therefore I am worried about the robustness of the data.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.1/12">In addition, FSEC is used only&mdash;or mainly&mdash;for predicting dwelling fatality rates. There seems little in the programme that considers, for example, road traffic collisions. We all know that we are far more likely to be involved in or lose our life in a road traffic accident than in a dwelling fire. Again, that leads me to worry about the proposed cuts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.179.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1504" speakername="Shona McIsaac" colnum="179"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0005.htm#08031853000524">
	<p pid="a.179.1/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I cannot consider that matter in too much detail because the debate is not entirely about FSEC. However, the analysis of West Yorkshire fire and rescue service states that</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/2" class="indent">&quot;the narrow indicators of risk...skew the output of the model as no account has been taken of the population groups within these areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/3">An example is given in relation to rented accommodation as that is one of the criteria used. In two areas with the same percentage of rented accommodation, one area may have detached houses and another may have terraced housing, which has a higher risk. However, FSEC would put those areas in the same category.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/4">As I said, the chief fire officer consulted the various councils in the area and people everywhere told him that they were opposed to the cuts. Prior to last Saturday's march, I conducted a survey of residents in the affected areas in my constituency. About 1,000 people said that they opposed the cuts, and such responses were not based simply on emotion&mdash;the chief fire office sometimes accuses us of being emotional about the matter. People were given very good statistical reasons for the cuts and facts about why they would put communities at risk. In fact, only 45 people in some way supported the plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/5">I find it worrying that I recently heard that a PR firm has been hired to run consultation forums on the proposals and that people are being paid &pound;25 to attend those meetings. The process is meant to be terribly independent and involve people selected at random, but when it was discovered that someone was the wife of a firefighter, she was rejected and not included in the discussion forums. Those involved are trying to stack the so-called independent forums in their favour and skew the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/6">As far as I am aware, apart from the meetings with local authorities and the forums, there have been no official public meetings to date. On behalf of my constituents, I want the plans to be rejected, and I am sure that other hon. Members feel the same. The entire process is flawed. There are concerns about the FSEC computer modelling programme and there have been serious delays in making details publicly available. A whole month passed before the supporting documentation was put into the public domain, and therefore the proposals should be thrown out. Key stakeholders were not involved in the discussions and the consultation document does not stand up to detailed scrutiny. For example, although we have heard that many proposals were made for cost reasons, there are no costings in the document. How can we compare and contrast the proposals, therefore, and ask whether a certain project can be brought in under budget so that we can invest more money in another area? My background is in local government and we certainly did not produce documents that did not have costings.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/7">Statistics in the document are given only for one year. There are no historic data or predictions. It is difficult to make a decision when there are no predictions of trends. I have obtained historic data for Waltham and Immingham. They show that the number of incidents has gone up rather than declined. Despite that, we are considering closing fire stations, which puts the FSEC model in question. For example, the incident data that I have for Waltham station state that the number of incidents in 2005 was 91. In 2006&mdash;the data used in the document&mdash;there were 116 incidents, and in 2007 there were 134. The number of incidents over the same three years at the Immingham West fire station were 147 in 2005, 158 in 2006, and 200 in 2007. Therefore, the risk is increasing.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/8">There is also a lack of information in the document about road traffic accidents. As I said, people are more likely to die in a road traffic accident than in a house fire. When I asked the chief fire officer about that, he said that Waltham station had covered only four road traffic incidents. The answer was slightly disingenuous because that figure relates only to cases in which specialist cutting equipment was used to free people. That figure, therefore, underplays the level of road traffic accidents. My information about road traffic accidents covers north-east Lincolnshire, north Lincoln and Hull. For those three areas, traffic accident rates are well above the regional and national average, according to data from the Humberside police collision unit. I am afraid that I do not have detailed information about the east riding of Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/9">The number of collisions in north east Lincolnshire resulting in death or serious injury in 2002 was 114, of which 21 involved young drivers, which equates to about 18 per cent. of the total. In 2006, there were 123 fatalities and serious injuries, of which 31 were young people, which is 25 per cent. of the total. Again, the trends show an increased risk. It is well recognised that our area has made poor progress towards achieving the 2010 target of a 40 per cent. reduction in road deaths and serious injuries. Any improvement was due to the reduction in child pedestrian casualties.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/10">The collision data also suggests that young drivers living in the more rural areas are at particularly high risk. They tend to come from the more leafy suburbs in which incomes tend to be higher. It is quite normal for a household to have two or three cars, especially in the newly built estates. Young people tend to have cars and use them to get around. Certainly, Waltham fits that bill. Also, because of the rural nature of such areas, it takes fire and rescue services longer to get there, and those minutes are vital if we are to save lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/11">I want to focus on how the proposals will impact on my constituents. I know that other hon. Members will focus on their own particular areas. The outcry over the closure at Waltham has been deafening. To date, there have been 18,000 signatures on a petition objecting to it. Some 12,000 letters of objection have been sent in as well. Yet the station costs just &pound;123,000 to run. That is why it was important for the consultation document to include financial information. That &pound;123,000 is partly paid by Lincolnshire county council because the station is on the border between the two authorities; Waltham's costs often go into that county. Therefore, the cost to Humberside fire and rescue is just over &pound;100,000 a year. The town of Waltham pays far more than that in its precept to the fire authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/12">I want to focus on an issue that appeared in the <i>Hull Daily Mail </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-04">4 January</phrase>. The article states:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Fire officials have announced a &pound;5 million plan to redevelop the Hull Fire Station. Humberside Fire Authority has given backing for the major redevelopment of North Hull Fire Station at Clough Road. Officials at HFRS say that the revamp of this site is necessary because it now serves part of the city which has seen large amounts of development since it first opened in 1959.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/14">Waltham was more or less a hamlet in 1959; now it is a suburb of Grimsby. It has seen very fast growth in recent decades and it has had a housing boom, yet those residents are being told that the growth in their area means that their fire station has to close. In Hull, on the other hand, residents are told that they are getting a &pound;5 million investment because of housing growth there. I am not complaining about that, but I want consistency across the board. If there is growth in an area, that should be recognised.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/15">The chief fire officer has told me that the Grimsby-based fire station of Peaks Lane will be able to take on the workload if Waltham closes. That is not what the firefighters at Peaks Lane tell me. Such a statement also assumes that the two engines at Peaks Lane will be there if an incident occurs in the area that Waltham covers. It is highly likely that they will be out somewhere else, which means that the time to reach that vast southern part of north-east Lincolnshire will increase, and that will put lives at risk. Also, Peaks Lane deals with chemical incidents that occur in the factories on the south bank of the Humber. Again, that leaves a huge gap in coverage in our area.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/16">A previous review of fire services moved Immingham's fire cover from the centre of the town to the outskirts. That was done because of the huge amount of industry that is located in Immingham. Immingham West and East fire stations were opened by me and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1452" name="Ian Cawsey">the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey)</phrase>. Four engines are based there because of the huge concentration of COMAH sites. Anyone who knows that part of the world just needs to look at the flare stacks of the two oil refineries to understand the risk that exists on the south bank of the Humber. We have to exercise a precautionary principle. The reason why we have a lot of fire stations is because if something happens it will be serious and we need to have firefighters in place. The risks are real.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/17">I am sure that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase> will confirm that there are people who remember the Flixborough explosion, which was not that far away from Immingham. A few years ago, there was a serious explosion at one of the refineries. Luckily, it was Easter and there were not many people on site and no loss of life. If people had been working, the incident could have been very serious. That is why I want to see the plans rejected. I want every member of the fire authority to receive copies of the debate to see the strength of feeling among the communities that we represent. If it is a genuine consultation, I hope that it will listen&mdash;I hope that it is not a foregone conclusion. However, I am worried about the verb tense in the original press release, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/18" class="indent">&quot;Closed and taken out of service&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/19">rather than &quot;a proposal to close and take out of service&quot;. I say to the fire authority and to its chief, &quot;Prove to us that the consultation has been genuine. Go away, look at the proposals and throw them out, because if you don't, lives will be lost.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.184.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1452" speakername="Ian Cawsey" colnum="184"  time="011:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0006.htm#08031853000529">
	<p pid="a.184.1/1">I agree entirely with the right hon. Gentleman. On local issues, I always think of him as a right hon. Friend, because they are important to both of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/2">Another matter to consider is what will happen if people are recruited in the first place, but the staffing cannot be maintained later. There was a time when Howden was properly staffed all day with retained crew, but now it cannot be. What will happen if Goole goes down that route and finds at some future point that it cannot keep the right number of retained firefighters? From that point on, everything would be connected to everything. If Goole fire station were not there, we would rely on Howden. If Howden could not act, we would rely on Snaith. In the other direction, Old Goole would have to rely on Crowle in North Lincolnshire. If Crowle had to cover Old Goole, Epworth would have to cover Crowle. There would be a knock-on effect, and what started off with a simple decision in Goole would affect fire cover all over the place. That can be avoided by the simple decision to keep both fire tenders in Goole full time.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/3">I have mentioned the fact that Goole is on the edge of the M62. There was debate earlier about what FSEC includes. It certainly does not include road traffic accidents, which is of great concern to me. There are any number of road traffic accidents on the M62 every year. I do not know whether right hon. and hon. Members listen out for reports in the same way as me and the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden, but I frequently hear the words, &quot;In the vicinity of junction 36&quot;, which is the Goole turn off. The Goole fire station is frequently called out. For that not to be thrown into the equation for calculating future risk is bizarre in the extreme, and local firefighters have told me that it is a big concern to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes mentioned Flixborough, which I now represent. People will not forget the impact of that incident. When we look at the south bank, we will see similar chemical industries to those that were based at Flixborough, which is another concern about the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/5">East Riding of Yorkshire council's scrutiny team is looking into the proposals and has set up a review panel to take evidence and to make recommendations to the council. I spoke to the panel at the Goole leisure centre. I hasten to add that there were only a small number of members of the scrutiny committee present, rather than the whole committee. Sadly, there are not that many Labour members of the council, and the panel was made up of Tories and Lib Dems&mdash;none of my Goole colleagues were on it. I thought that we had had a sympathetic hearing, so I was flabbergasted when the panel said that it supported the chief fire officer's proposals for Goole. However, I was pleased that the full scrutiny committee of the council threw that recommendation out. The council itself is supportive of everything that has been said here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/6">North Lincolnshire council, which is the other local authority in my constituency, is meeting tomorrow night to consider a motion from the ruling Labour group&mdash;that gives me some hope&mdash;to oppose the proposed fire service cuts. As far as I have seen, that is in step with the local response. The number of people who have responded is simply amazing. The Fire Brigades Union has shown me copies of its polling and the slips that it has sent to local people to fill in. There were thousands of responses, even after I had sifted through to find only those from my constituents. The <i>Goole</i><i>&mdash;Howden Courier</i> and the <i>Goole Times</i> have run articles and campaigns to try to change the Goole decision, and the <i>Scunthorpe Telegraph</i> has run a campaign for the Kirton fire station in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase>, which I am sure he will say something about later. The public are saying no. As I said, the more they hear, the less they like.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/7">When the chief spoke to me, he told me that his aspirations were for better kit for road traffic accidents and floods, and more fire prevention work. Nobody, including the FBU, disagrees with that agenda. The FBU told me simply, &quot;We can do those things without cuts,&quot; and said that it would work with the chief fire officer and the authority to advise them on how to do so. That being the case, there is no better reason why we should not go back to the drawing board and start again to ensure that we have the best protected and best equipped fire service for our communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.186.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" speakername="Austin Mitchell" colnum="186"  time="011:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0006.htm#08031853000530">
	<p pid="a.186.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak for the first time under your chairmanship, Mrs. Humble, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1504" name="Shona McIsaac">the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac)</phrase> on securing a debate on this important issue. She is a dogged fighter for her constituents' interests, and her contribution was another example of the fight that she puts up to protect them. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1452" name="Ian Cawsey">the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey)</phrase> brought a great deal of expertise on local government and its reactions to the proposals, but I should like to speak more generally about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/2">The essence of the union's case against the fire authority's strategic plan is that it would lead to 110 job losses for firefighters, some at Waltham and some at Immingham, and others scattered around the south Humberside area. We can see the serried ranks of south Humberside firefighters facing us in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/3">Cuts in personnel are always called efficiency savings. I deprecate such a mindless Gershon process&mdash;it drives on, even though in this instance it is cutting right to the bone rather than at flesh. This is the latest in a long salami-slicing process of cutting the numbers of firefighters in the area and it must stop, because the area has one of the highest risk levels in the country. It is a chemical production and oil refining centre. There are 32 industrial sites in the Humberside area that are at the highest risk level, as defined under Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/4">The motorways bring their problems. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole mentioned the M62, but the M180 and the A180 are in a disgraceful state of repair. We have made representations about the traffic pressures that are building on the A160 and about the A46, which is perhaps one of the most murderous roads in the country. The <i>Grimsby Telegraph</i> contains a litany of reports of crashes and cases in which the fire brigade is called out for rescue work.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/5">There are two sets of docks in the area: at Immingham, which has the busiest docks in the country, and Grimsby, and a busy estuary, around which huge traffic and shipping pressures are building. We have had floods&mdash;they were worse on the north bank than on the south bank&mdash;that were a problem for the fire brigade, and we have now had an earthquake. I always wanted Grimsby to be the epicentre of something, but I did not envisage that it would be the epicentre of an earthquake. Nevertheless, that is another hazard to add to the litany.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/6">Most importantly, we have a legacy of old houses and some of the poorest super output areas&mdash;I do not know why they are called that when the statistics are so depressing. The area has some of the worst statistics on the decline of housing and on poverty in the country. In 1980, I lectured in America for the English-Speaking Union, which provided me with a driver to take me around Harlem. He would not let me get out of the car to take photographs, fearing an assault, but the burnt-out houses that I saw paralleled, to a degree, to what can be seen in the East Marsh area. There is much less of a problem than in Harlem, but burnt-out houses in older areas are a problem, and it is the result of houses getting older and inadequate landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/7">The development of the strategic plan, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes said, is in many ways an excellent exercise, certainly for what it proposes on fire prevention work, training, new gear for flooding and rescue and new platforms. The fire brigade in my area has also done an enormous and successful job in providing free smoke detectors. It no longer gets money from the Government to do that work&mdash;it must do so through alternative means&mdash;but the work could not be done through cuts, and it must go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/8">The strategic plan, which was launched suddenly in December, as other right hon. and hon. Members said, has its virtues. However, there are several reservations. First, the unions, the firemen and local authorities were not involved in its development, which has been going on for more than three years, so it should have been possible to involve the people who deal with fires and the councils that face the problems. Secondly, the proposals are based on risk and the arrival time of the first engine. However, the arrival time of the second engine is crucial, without which firemen would plunge into situations in which they must either wait until a safe number of firefighters arrive, thus risking the lives of the public, or act without waiting for the second engine. The more stations we close, the longer it will take the second engine to arrive, particularly when numerous call-outs are putting a strain on Peaks Lane, but the strategic plan neglects that problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/9">The strategic plan was done over three years, but the financial implications and the impact on the number of jobs are not spelled out. It is striking that there are no costings, given that the area got a better settlement than most, as my colleagues have said. We got a 5 per cent. increase in our allocation, and the national average was 3.3 per cent., as my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole said. We got the fifth-highest settlement for a combined fire authority, so the need to make cuts on such a scale has been undercut. The fire authority cannot justify making the cuts in the strategic plan, given the settlement that it received.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/10">The proposed cuts are not paralleled elsewhere. The only station closure I know of is in Cleveland, and two of the proposed closures in Cornwall have actually been reversed. We do not see the justification for making cuts now when Humberside has done better than most. It is a shame that the proportion of Government funding is falling&mdash;it has fallen from 80 to 70 per cent. since 1997&mdash;and that local authority support is falling as a proportion of local authority spending. That is unfortunate, but we are talking today about a local issue, and my point is that the problem is not as serious in our area, which again undermines the case made in the document.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/11">The proposals increase insecurity in all the areas that we are concerned about, not just Waltham. Clearly, given the demonstration on Saturday, people there feel insecure about the closure of their station, even though it is a retained fire station. However, the closure will have an impact on the whole area, because it will affect the arrival time of the second appliance and increase the strain on the Peaks Lane station in Grimsby.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/12">The result of the proposals is a feeling of insecurity, which is now stirring people to action. The consultation ends on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase>, and as will be clear from the debate, my colleagues and I will be making very strong representations. My plea to the fire authority is, &quot;Now that you've got more money than you expected, please think again.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.188.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="188"  time="011:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0006.htm#08031853000531">
	<p pid="a.188.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1504" name="Shona McIsaac">the Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac)</phrase> on obtaining the debate. As you can see, Mrs. Humble, all the MPs from the south bank are here as part of a united front, which illustrates how strongly people feel about this issue and how important it is for us to reflect our constituents' concerns. I want to focus particularly on the threat to Kirton in Lindsey fire station, which, as my hon. Friend said, is one of the stations earmarked for complete closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/2">As my hon. Friend has said, we have heard about this issue in various ways. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1452" name="Ian Cawsey">the Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey)</phrase> said that he heard about it on Radio Humberside, and I heard about it from a constituent who engaged me in conversation on the train back to my constituency, as constituents often do. He was a firefighter, which was helpful because he was very knowledgeable about the issue, and we discussed the ins and outs and the impacts of the proposed closure. I immediately arranged a meeting with the chief fire officer of the Humberside fire authority to express my concerns and to talk to him personally about the justification for the closure of the Kirton in Lindsey fire station.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/3">This is not just about the increased risk to the people of Kirton in Lindsey, although that is, of course, an issue because, whatever changes are introduced, response times will be slower if the community loses its fire station. However, the closure is also an issue for both urban and rural areas in the whole of my constituency. As my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes said, the number of pumps on the south bank will be reduced from nine to seven, which means a slower response, particularly in terms of back-up from a second pump. That must be taken into account, because the Kirton pump provides back-up in other parts of my constituency and north Lincolnshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/4">When I met the chief fire officer, he was at great pains to stress that the proposals were not about cutting the budget, but about responding to independent reports on providing good fire cover for the whole area. He said, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> noted, that the savings will be ploughed back into the fire service in the form of equipment for dealing with floods, for example. I am sure that such things are desirable, but we must take into account the overall impact of removing these machines.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/5">[Mr. Greg Pope <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/6">I am concerned about the maximum 20-minute response time that the fire authority recommends for low-risk areas, because Kirton in Lindsey is on the very edge of the area covered by that response time. I am also concerned about the figures that have been used to justify the closure of the Kirton in Lindsey fire station. We have heard about road traffic accidents, and I would add the A15 to the litany of roads that are regarded as very high risk. The A15 has been classified as one of the most dangerous roads in Britain, because of its accident rate. I raised the issue with the chief fire officer, who said that Scunthorpe has a dedicated machine to deal with road traffic accidents, which can get out in an average of 15 minutes. That is fine, if it is correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/7">Although there are arguments about availability and about how busy individual fire stations in the Humberside fire authority are, there is no argument about the fact that Scunthorpe is one of the busiest in the whole fire authority area. I therefore return to the point that we must look at the role of the Kirton in Lindsey fire station not only in terms of Kirton in Lindsey, but strategically, in terms of the back-up that the machine there provides as part of overall availability in an area that is full of COMAH sites, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes said. In Scunthorpe, for example, we have the steelworks and a range of other high-risk industries, and that needs to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/8">A number of issues of detail have been raised with me. What, for example, would be the net savings from closing the Kirton in Lindsey fire station? There is quite a large gulf between the FBU's calculations and those of the fire authority. I have written to the chief fire officer to take up a range of issues that relate to the calculation of costs and times. There are arguments about the availability of the Kirton in Lindsey fire station. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole said, it is not unusual for machines at retained fire stations to be unavailable for parts of the day, which is not surprising given the nature of such fire stations. However, there are arguments about the length of such periods at the Kirton in Lindsey station, and we must compare what the fire authority says about them with what the firefighters say. Those issues require answers, and I have some very serious concerns about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/9">My major concern is about the level of risk and fire cover, and the fire authority needs to answer some legitimate points. I share my hon. Friends' concerns about the overall recommendations on the level of fire cover, and I can certainly confirm the level of concern among members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/10">The <i>Scunthorpe Telegraph</i> has been running a campaign that has had thousands of responses from people expressing concern about the proposals. As for the consultation, I appreciate the fact that the fire authority has met representatives of North Lincolnshire council and that, at my request, it also sent representatives to hear at first hand the concerns of Kirton in Lindsey town council. That is nature of consultation: but the consultation has clearly thrown up serious issues in relation to the proposals, which call them into question.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.1/1">I continue to learn about firefighting expertise in the hon. Lady's area. Of course the cuts are not just to bricks and mortar&mdash;fire stations&mdash;but to the number of firefighters. That has been shown to be a matter of great concern to her constituents. She also discussed additional funding, to which I may return when I respond briefly to the remarks made by hon. Members during the debate, and risk assessment. Her detailed analysis of the facts and figures relating to incidents in her constituency was useful and illuminating.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/2">As well as briefing us on the highlights of the social calendar in the run-up to Christmas in his constituency, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1452" name="Ian Cawsey">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey)</phrase> talked about how significant the consultation has been. That is to be welcomed. Hon. Members in all parties are in favour of local decision making and of locally elected representatives having the power to examine issues in detail and act accordingly. If that is to happen, proper consultation is crucial and those responsible should show how they will take comments on board. Given the time allowed for the consultation and the engagement with the public, I am reassured that that is happening, and I am glad to hear of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> discussed the impact of the cuts in terms of job losses. Of course that is a matter of concern, and the FBU has been vocal in fighting for its members in the light of the contribution that they make, and of professional concerns about changes to fire and rescue cover throughout the country. The hon. Gentleman also raised the issue of pressure from above&mdash;efficiency targets, the general culture in which people are working at all levels in local authorities, and the pressure to modernise, to use a word that is probably over-used. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">The right hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase> talked about the wider role of every station and the knock-on impact of what is happening. Again, he referred to the operation of the retained service.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/4">I shall focus on some of the factors influencing the decision to make changes in the Humberside area. It seems to me that there is relevance to the wider debate about efficiency, to which the hon. Member for Great Grimsby alluded&mdash;the question of a culture that requires every local authority, or, indeed, fire and rescue authority, to show that it is changing all the time. That process is not necessarily always helpful. It must be based on evidence. Rather than involving purely local decisions taken in a vacuum, the process takes place within a culture of messages about what Whitehall wants local authorities to do. I hope that the Minister will talk about the statements and policies that the Government are putting into practice, which are leading to some of the changes that local authorities must make.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/5">As for the Government's contribution, although I am sure it is true that there has been some increase in funding and that it compares favourably with the national average for central funding for fire and rescue, local government overall is struggling to deliver the services that it is asked to provide, given the tight financial constraints. It may be that in the case that we are discussing the precept has not been set as high as it could have been, but I suppose that one eye must be kept on the future. Perhaps the present changes are being made on the basis of efficiency savings that may be asked for in future and are intended as an early attempt to allow for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/6">It is interesting that other fire authorities elsewhere are having to act in a similar way. If the decision is purely local, why is that happening? The hon. Member for Great Grimsby referred in his speech to my area, Cornwall, where there consultation is taking place on the number of whole-time fire stations that are to be in operation. Indeed, I went with some of my hon. Friends to discuss with the Minister both that issue and the funding pressures on Cornwall county council. I know that the situation is the same for the new neighbouring Devon and Somerset fire and rescue authority and for authorities in many other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/7">The Government are also pushing through regional control centres, which will have a cost overall. There will certainly be an up-front cost, although it remains to be seen whether efficiencies will be demonstrated in the longer term. The FBU in particular has been vocal about that change, and it is important to put it in context. I understand that one of the aspirations for the process was to help to fund more technology, particularly for retained firefighters. The aim was to provide them with better technology, such as satnav, with which to respond to incidents. I hope that that materialises as part of the Government's leadership in bringing about change.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/8">I hope that as the Minister considers the issues that are local to Humberside, he will also consider the issues for the whole country. I also hope that he will see that Humberside's review of cover and of the number of whole-time and retained firefighters is not an isolated incident; and that he will consider the effect of messages from Whitehall and Westminster, through discussions with local authorities of the reasons for their decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/9">One of the downsides of debates such as this, emerges when a case of a station changing from whole-time status to retained status is raised in the media. I completely understand why people want to discuss whether that is right for their area, but sometimes a negative message goes out about the retained service, suggesting that it is in some way second class. I do not say that the Labour Members who have spoken meant to make that point, merely that it is sometimes the mood music in the background because of people's concern about how the retained service operates. I represent an area where the vast majority of cover is provided by retained firefighters, and they provide an excellent service. I should hate it if the message were to go out from this or any debate that we in Westminster do not appreciate the job that they do, or that we are unaware that they display just as much professionalism as whole-time firefighters. The two groups working together usually provide an excellent team in every area.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/10">I hope that the Minister will examine ways of modernising retained firefighting systems, to ensure that response to call-out is more effective. Given that patterns of working have changed, and that people often no longer work close to the fire station where they are on call, but further afield, perhaps more resources can be put in by the Government to support local authorities in pursuing new ways of operation, including pilot schemes, for the retained fire service, at least in the short term. In that way, we can ensure that retained as well as whole-time fire services change with the times.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/11">To return to local services in Humberside in particular, what we want ultimately is to know that the consultation, which has attracted a huge number of responses from local people, will be taken into account by the local fire authority, and that the authority will re-examine everything that it proposes to do in view of the additional points that will undoubtedly have come to light in the consultation, so that the final decision, when it is reached, will be a local decision that takes into account all the factors. However, we must recognise that the local fire authority operates within a climate set by the Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.192.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" speakername="Stewart Jackson" colnum="192"  time="012:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0007.htm#08031853000535">
	<p pid="a.192.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve for the first time under your chairmanship, Mr. Pope. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1504" name="Shona McIsaac">the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac)</phrase> on securing this debate, as well as her fellow local Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/2">The proposals have generated considerable concern locally, not least because of allegations that they are all about saving &pound;4 million over three years and because they will involve more than 100 job losses and affect four stations. However, we should not forget that the campaign is an all-party effort&mdash;it is not just a campaign by Labour councillors and Members of Parliament but by people across the party spectrum. It is timely to pay tribute to local newspapers such as the <i>Scunthorpe Telegraph</i>, whose &quot;stop the fire cuts&quot; campaign has been very helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/3">Members have covered the issues comprehensively, so I shall try not to repeat what they have said, but one of the specific issues that I shall address is the efficacy of spending &pound;36,000 of public money on a consultation undertaken by a Swansea-based public research company. The fire service prays in aid Cabinet Office guidelines. I do not think that that is necessarily an excuse for spending so much money while considering service reductions. Perhaps I am old fashioned, but I take the view that elected officials should take executive decisions rather than trying to offload responsibility through consultation processes, which are not always as genuine as they might seem.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/4">The fire service has claimed that the planned reductions are not financially driven. Hon. Members have made the point clearly that the service has been given a generous 5.8 per cent. increase in the grant allocation for 2008-09&mdash;although the percentage increase will be reduced provisionally over the next two financial years&mdash;despite a 2005 Audit Commission comprehensive performance assessment rating of only fair and a declining direction of travel rating between 2006 and 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/5">There are other areas of specific concern. As hon. Members have mentioned, an inconsistent approach has been taken to development. In a recent presentation to Hull city council, the fire service conceded that development patterns in Hull had informed its decision, particularly with respect to Hull central station, but that factor has been disregarded in respect of north Lincolnshire and north-east Lincolnshire, where future development is not considered an appropriate issue. Significant industrial development is occurring in the Goole area, particularly in Centreport and Capitol Park, and proposals are in the offing to build a straw-burning power station there.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/6">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1452" name="Ian Cawsey">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Mr. Cawsey)</phrase> said, there seems to be no recognition of the proximity of transport infrastructure. Goole is the busiest inland port in England. It receives a huge amount of timber, for example, through its docks, and is adjacent to the busy M18 and M62 motorways. As I understand it, the service conveniently focuses on road traffic accidents only in the Goole area, rather than in the wider area, which would include those major roads. Mention has also been made of the level crossing and traffic in Goole. In Kirton in Lindsey, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" name="Elliot Morley">the right hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley)</phrase> mentioned, road traffic accidents on the A15 are increasing, and that must be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/7">There is also the question of the methodology used in the fire service emergency cover risk assessment, which was mentioned by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1608" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (David Davis)</phrase> and the hon. Member for Cleethorpes. The East Riding of Yorkshire and north Lincolnshire seem to be dismissed as a low-risk area by reducing the standard response time to 20 minutes. In my opinion, that is based on a narrow interpretation of urban deprivation indices. As my right hon. Friend said, it ignores the growing elderly population, particularly in the East Riding.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/8">The proposals also disregard the consequential changes to other fire stations in the area. As we have heard, the changes to Goole will have an impact on Howden, which already has problems recruiting retained firefighters, as well as on Crowle, Snaith and other stations. The downgrading proposals will therefore mean that a significant rural proportion of the East Riding of Yorkshire and north Lincolnshire will be covered by just one pump for much of the day. Similarly, the proposal to close the Kirton in Lindsey station will affect the retained pump in Brigg, necessitating cover overstretch in Barnetby, Brigg and other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/9">However, that is where the consensus must end. Hon. Members cannot expect me not to mention that every action has a reaction. Each hon. Member who has spoken supported the Fire and Rescue Services Bill in 2004, which forced on local authorities a local integrated risk management plan. Hon. Members have prayed in aid the Fire Brigades Union, but the FBU said in a press release in 2004 that the Bill and its proposals would</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/10" class="indent">&quot;downgrade the rescue role of the fire service and produce cuts across the service under the guise of local Integrated Risk Management Plans.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/11">My right hon. Friend the Member for Haltemprice and Howden, who at that time was shadowing the Deputy Prime Minister, challenged <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1646" name="John Prescott">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull, East (Mr. Prescott)</phrase>, asking</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Will the Deputy Prime Minister also pledge that rural communities...will not be penalised as a result of the integrated risk management approach?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-06-30.24"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 June 2003; Vol. 408, c. 24</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/13">Hon. Members must also admit that it is inconceivable that the Government's regionalisation programme for the fire and rescue service, which is three years late and perhaps as much as 14 times over the budget in the outline business plan of October 2005, has had no impact on the proposals. The hon. Member for Brigg and Goole, for whom I have a great deal of respect, has publicly defended the decision to relocate control facilities to Wakefield in west Yorkshire. In that respect, he is out of step with the FBU. Surely all Members must now see a causal link between the Government's flawed reorganisation agenda and service reductions in their constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.3/1">I take the hon. Gentleman's comments on board, but I must press on in order to allow the Minister to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/2">The Humberside fire and rescue service is about to receive an above-inflation grant increase, so the reasons for the reductions must be non-financial. They are being contemplated&mdash;I address this to the Minister&mdash;only because the Government refuse, even when faced with a significant risk of flooding like last year's, to reconsider resilience funding for uniforms and equipment for the Humberside fire service or, as hon. Members will know, for proactive work on smoke alarms, at a cost of &pound;180,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.3/3">Even after three years of study and research, the proposals have not been thought out fully; they are incoherent, opaque and, potentially, a threat to life and property. They have arisen out of the centralising agenda of this Labour Government. To blame the fire service alone is disingenuous and wrong. I trust that the Minister will accept some of the blame for the situation and reassure the Chamber that he is aware of that fact and intends to do something about it.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.2/1">My right hon. Friend is correct. That is one of reasons why the number of fire deaths has been reduced to the lowest figure since the 1950s, including in my hon. Friends' region. That is also in part the result of legislation and changes in the fire service introduced in the past five years by this Labour Government, such as the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005 and the local integrated risk management plans. We should congratulate the fire and rescue service on the way in which it has remodelled and changed itself in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/2">My right hon. and hon. Friends made cogent points about the dangers at local level if people are not consulted adequately on the detail of the changes. I do not think that they expect me to enter into the detail of those local decisions, because the whole point of IRMPs and the RRO is to allow local communities, authorities and fire and rescue services to make the decisions. From what the hon. Member for Peterborough said, it struck me that the Conservative party is not in favour of IRMPs and the RRO&mdash;measures that have reduced the number of fire deaths, ensured that the fire service has had far more time to carry out preventive work in local communities and, with funding from my Department, enabled more than one million smoke alarms to be placed in people's homes. I am therefore surprised by his apparent stance.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/3">My right hon. and hon. Friends made points about local changes proposed by the local fire and rescue authority, which has a different opinion, as would be expected. As my right hon. Friend explained, the chief fire officer told him that he feels, based on independent reports, that the changes would result in better local provision. It is not my duty to make the case for the local fire and rescue authority; it must do that in order to convince local people. I appreciate that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole said, it has extended its consultation period to the end of this month. The fact that local Members of Parliament have been engaged with that process, and have had an opportunity to raise their concerns, is important. I hope that all factors are taken into consideration when those local decisions are made in the coming weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/4">My right hon. and hon. Friends and the right hon. Member for Haltemprice and Howden mentioned FSEC and the criteria used. It is important to get across the fact that FSEC is merely a tool created in 2004 and is not binding on local authorities, which can find their own methodologies, if they have their own views on how decisions should be made locally. I hope that I have made that clear. Furthermore, I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase>, who made comments with which I agree about the retained duty service, that our retained firefighters provide a very valuable service to our country. However, the Government need to do more to support their recruitment and I am very keen to do more with their employers to ensure that they feel valued for allowing retained duty staff to serve their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.2/5">The hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Peterborough also mentioned&mdash;this was a slight distraction&mdash;the FiReControl project, which will deliver further savings for fire and rescue authorities on their control rooms to the tune of about 25 per cent. It will also provide the best technological solution that this country has ever had. Last week, I visited a similar version up and running in Sweden. Ours will provide an even better technological solution and service, ensuring that it protects and saves people's lives and provides our firefighters with the best system that we have ever had. That is probably part of the reason why colleagues of the hon. Member for Peterborough, such as Conservative Councillors Jerry Wilmott and Pete Roffey, and the chair of the Local Government Association's fire committee, Councillor Les Byron, are doing such sterling work in helping to support the project and to deliver it across the country. They are mature enough to accept that that will make a real difference and save people's lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on obtaining the debate. The farms in my Gloucestershire constituency are in one of the worst affected areas. Does my hon. Friend agree that not only should the Government stop dithering and announce a cull in hard boundary areas as the report recommends, but that owing to the figure that he gave of &pound;1 billion in possible costs by 2013, it would be absolute folly for DEFRA to reduce in any way its research into a vaccine? As the report makes clear, a vaccine is likely to be the best long-term solution to the disease.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.0/1">I totally agree, and I look forward to the Minister's reply to my hon. Friends' comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/2">I realise that for the Minister, the situation is difficult. Interestingly, the largest group in Shropshire is the Shropshire Wildlife Trust, which has almost 8,000 members, and its symbol is a badger. I went to see the trust, whose representatives said to me, &quot;Mr. Kawczynski, why do you want to kill badgers? Why do you want a cull of badgers?&quot; I spoke last night to the trust's development manager, Mr. John Hughes, who made very much the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> just made. Mr. Hughes said that even the trust looks to the Government for a rapid decision. The trust realises that the badgers are suffering terribly as a result of this appalling disease, and it also realises that the damage being done to our agricultural sector is of such a magnitude that ultimately it will affect wildlife groups such as the trust, wildlife itself, and the stability of our countryside, both in Shropshire and throughout the country. If the Minister spoke to Mr. Hughes, he would say that he feels as frustrated as I do at the lack of action by the Government on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/3">I would like to make a point on behalf of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase>, who is not able to be here because of the arrival of a baby girl, on which I congratulate him. He has asked me to say that he has been fighting hard for his constituents Daphne and Pat Saunders and their son, Miles. The Saunders own an organic farm near Faringdon, which was one of the first organic farms in the country. Last year, many of their pedigree cattle were culled after testing positive under the new test. Quite apart from the fact that many more cattle were culled than was necessary, the further huge injustice is that the compensation that they have received has been so low. They have lost top-grade pedigree cattle but they have only been compensated for ordinary cattle. As my hon. Friend put it to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/4" class="indent">&quot;It is like seeing your Ferrari go into the crusher and only getting compensation for a Skoda.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/5">The Government have promised to look at the compensation scheme, but nothing has happened. I would not use quite the same phrase as my hon. Friend did, but he is far more extrovert and colourful than I am. None the less, he makes a very important point: certain cattle&mdash;high pedigree cattle&mdash;are being slaughtered, but farmers are only receiving compensation for ordinary cattle. I would very much like the Minister to respond to that point as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/6">I would like to say just one last thing, because I want to give the Minister as much time as possible to answer the questions that I have put to her. In my estimation, the long-term success of a Government stems from their ability and determination to help all sections of society, no matter how distant they are from their immediate priorities. We hear very little from the Labour Government about their priorities for farmers and the countryside. There is a great deal of talk about the inner cities, education and the national health service, which are all very important issues. However, I, for one, feel very passionately about agriculture, because I represent a very agricultural constituency. It frustrates me greatly that the Government spend so little time talking about the huge damage&mdash;the crisis&mdash;that farming communities such as those in the Shrewsbury area are facing.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.0/7">I want to look the Minister in the eyes and say to her that I met Chris Balmer, the farmer from Snailbeach I mentioned earlier, when I had to intervene on his behalf to get his single farm payments on no less than seven occasions last year, and one of those occasions was the first time that I have seen a grown man cry, because of the situation that he has been put in with bovine TB. He is one of the most honourable people that I have ever come across. He works very hard to make a living and shows immense fortitude and courage, no matter what is thrown at him. I want the Minister to assure me that Mr. Balmer will receive his payments on time next year and, more importantly, that she is going to do something that shows that she really understands the terrible suffering of my community, which is so dependent on the vibrancy of the agricultural sector. Furthermore, I want her to assure me that she will take on board the recommendations of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and use her many talents and skills to convince the Treasury that the time has come for the extra investment that is needed to sort out bovine TB in this country once and for all, so that we can save the hundreds of millions of pounds that we will otherwise have to spend if the crisis is not dealt with.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.0/1">First of all, I want to apologise for the fact that the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" name="Jonathan R Shaw">the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw)</phrase>, who has the topic of bovine TB in his brief, is unable to be here today and that I am therefore addressing hon. Members instead of him.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on securing this debate on what is clearly a very important matter. I also congratulate his hon. Friends the Members for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray) and for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) on their interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/3">Bovine TB is a very difficult issue. As the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham says, it is ever present in the minds of farmers and vets, but I must tell him that it is also ever present in the minds of Ministers. It is also never far from the headlines. The hon. Gentleman has today described the terrible suffering, as he put it, of some of his constituents. I say to him that we recognise the difficulties, stress and financial hardship that individual farmers have faced and still face as a result of bovine TB. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recently held meetings with farmers, wildlife and conservation groups and vets to ensure that he understands the views of all those who are affected in one way or another by bovine TB.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/4">The hon. Gentleman said that we have spent too little time on bovine TB, but I must tell him that, sadly, because of the raft of animal diseases that have affected this country in the past year, a huge amount of time has been spent and many visits have been made by my colleagues to farms across the country. I may be an &quot;inner-city&quot; Member, as I represent the constituency of Lewisham, Deptford, but I was the first person to bring the Organic Food and Farming Targets Bill to this House, so I think that he should realise that I have some personal interest, if not a constituency interest, in agricultural issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/5">The hon. Gentleman charged the Government with a lack of action on bovine TB. I am delighted to have the opportunity to refute that charge absolutely. Not only do we recognise that the incidence of the disease is unacceptably high, but we recognise that it is particularly high in areas such as those represented by the hon. Members here today. As the hon. Gentleman said, Shropshire has seen a rise in the number of animals slaughtered because of bovine TB from 45 to 915 and is therefore a severe case in point. However, I remind the House that 91 per cent. of GB cattle herds are TB-free. We must remember that statistic when it is suggested that bovine TB is a scourge that is affecting the whole of the farming community. Bovine TB is definitively not affecting the whole of the farming community. That is why we have the strategic framework for the sustainable control of TB, why we emphasise that we should keep the clean areas clean and why we have introduced measures to help us to achieve that aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/6">Let me describe some of those measures. We have spent more than &pound;110 million on TB research in the past 10 years and about &pound;8.5 million in the last financial year alone. We have spent about &pound;17.8 million over the last 10 years on vaccine research. Since the 1950s, there has been in place an extensive system of TB testing and surveillance. Last year, the Government paid for 5.9 million tests on 51,000 cattle herds in Britain. We have also introduced new cattle controls, which are helping to prevent new cases of the disease. Between March 2006 and January 2008, there was pre-movement testing of cattle more than 42 days old moving out of high-risk herds, which detected 664 reactors in 363 herds in England. Those reactors might otherwise have spread disease within buyers' herds.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/7">We have also introduced the gamma interferon test, which is being used to improve the sensitivity of the testing regime that has been in place for many years. The gamma interferon test identifies animals that are missed by the skin test and it is part of our efforts to clean up disease in herds more quickly. It is also designed to prevent the disease becoming established in otherwise clean areas. 3,590 animals of 37,604 animals that were sampled between October 2006 and the end of January 2008 tested positive. Most of those animals were not being identified through the standard testing approach. Although the hon. Gentleman accuses the Government of taking little action, it is obvious that we are taking new actions and getting new results that are extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/8">The number of reactors identified by pre-movement and gamma interferon tests shows the worth of these tests, and we are grateful to the farming community for the commitment and responsibility that it has shown in relation to the TB testing programme. We have worked hard with many stakeholders, including the Wildlife Trusts group, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, to raise awareness about the simple biosecurity measures that can be employed to keep cattle and badgers apart.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/9">The hon. Gentleman asked about compensation, particularly in relation to constituents who are organic farmers. There is extensive evidence of significant overvaluation under the previous scheme, which used individual valuations rather than the table valuations used today. The Government must be conscious of the need to protect the taxpayer as well as the farmer. The hon. Gentleman's party usually trumpets the protection of the taxpayer, so perhaps he should bear that in mind. We have not ruled out changing the current compensation system, but any changes would have to be justified and to take into account the needs and protection of all the parties concerned, and that will always include the taxpayer. We are confident that table valuations generally provide a fair balance between the costs that taxpayers and farmers are expected to carry. That is not a new idea; it is used in other parts of the world where TB affects cattle, and it has been used in Britain in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.0/10">The role that culling badgers could play in tackling TB has been a matter of continuous debate since the 1970s, and the issue is undoubtedly complex and controversial. The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB showed in its report, which took 10 years to complete, that there is a cycle of disease between cattle and badgers. It also concluded that culling badgers is unlikely to make a significant contribution to tackling the disease. Indeed, the study showed that there was a risk that it might make the situation worse. We must have regard to that report.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">That was the report's conclusion, but that was drawn up within the constraints set by the Government and it involved a very small cull. How does the Minister explain the fact that the Government's chief scientific adviser, Sir David King, overturned that report and said that there was a place for culling badgers?</p>

	<p pid="a.203.1/1">I was about to say that we referred the matter to the Government's chief scientific adviser, who then expressed his view. I wanted to put on the record that that work took 10 years to complete, and that we cannot simply set it aside. We have not yet made a decision on culling. We must make a sensible and informed decision, and it must be the right decision rather than the quick one that the hon. Gentleman would have me make.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.3/1">No, the study took 10 years, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no question of the decision taking that long.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/2">We have the report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB following those 10 years of research, and we have the assessment of the evidence on badger culling provided by the former chief scientific adviser, Sir David King. As the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said, we also have the report of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee following its inquiry into the issue. He quoted the Select Committee, which did not make any outright damning criticism of the Government and their actions. It produced an extremely considered report and made many important points, some of which he referred to. He said that there is no simple solution and that a multifaceted approach must be adopted. That underpins what the Government are doing: the issue is multifaceted and we acknowledge that there is no simple solution. We are trying to work across several fronts to tackle this serious problem. That the Badger Trust and the National Farmers Union both applauded the report is probably unique in the experience of those who have dealt with this controversial topic, and he is right to point out the significance of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.3/3">The report made recommendations on frequent testing, biosecurity, work on vaccines and the consideration of a limited cull. All those recommendations are either already being pursued by the Government or are under consideration. As the hon. Gentleman is undoubtedly aware, it is not appropriate for a Minister to respond to that report in this debate. There is a proper procedure to follow in which the Government consider in depth what the report says. We will make an appropriate written response in the allotted time.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.3/1">I am not going to guess when. I am not one of the Ministers studying the report, so that would be inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.3/2">There will be three key aspects to the Secretary of State's decision: what impact the proposed measure would have on the disease, what the science tells us and how practical the solution is. We must also consider public acceptability. We need to proceed carefully. We have already given some information in response to questions that have been asked. For example, we have been asked how culling would be carried out, if it were used. We have ruled out gassing and snaring&mdash;it is important to put that on the record. Research on methods of culling will be published when the reports have been peer reviewed and when we have decided whether badger culling should take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.3/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about the TB vaccine and whether its use should continue. I assure him that work on that continues, although unfortunately it is some years off it being a final solution. We think that an oral badger vaccine will be ready by 2014 and that an injectable badger vaccine will be ready by 2010, although we would not expect that to be widely used. The best estimate for cattle vaccines is 2015. The test must allow differentiation of vaccinated cattle and those infected with disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.3/4">Our ultimate aim has to be the eradication of bovine TB, but that cannot be a realistic short-term goal, given the current incidence of the disease. Our first priority is therefore to focus on the GB strategic framework on TB to control the disease and prevent further spread. Once the disease is under control&mdash;that must be our hope for the future&mdash;the aim will become eradication. TB is a scourge; it has caused enormous hardship and places a huge financial burden on both the farming community and the taxpayer. We share the hon. Gentleman's desire to end the problem and to increase the comfort of his farming community.</p>

	<p pid="a.206.1/1">I believe that hon. Members on both sides of the House will agree that the Government have a good record on promoting the interests of the developing world. Under the comprehensive spending review settlement published in October, the aid budget will have increased by more than three times in real terms between 1997 and 2010. In that time, the UK will have more than doubled the proportion of gross national income spent on overseas development assistance, and we are on track to meet the United Nations gold standard of 0.7 per cent. by 2013. Hon. Members will be aware that what I call the gold standard has existed for 30-odd years. When Labour was in power before, UK expenditure was lifted virtually right up to 0.7 per cent., but, of course, it fell and fell under the Conservatives. To our credit, we are raising it again to the 0.7 per cent. target, which the whole House should support.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/2">However, all the evidence shows that the fight against HIV and AIDS is crucial to the prospects for any significant economic advance in the developing world. Unlike many of the diseases that claim lives in our country, AIDS is largely a young person's disease. That means that it has robbed developing countries of many of the people to whom we would normally look to contribute to the economy and to raise living standards. As the World Health Organisation pointed out in 1999, in the worst affected countries of southern Africa, the development gains of the past 50 years are being reversed by the epidemic. We will not see advancement of any significance in those countries until serious progress is made to end the AIDS epidemic in them.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/3">The latest estimate by UNAIDS is that 33 million people now live with HIV, including 2.5 million children. Two and a half million people were newly infected last year, and 2.1 million people died, including 290,000 children. The developing world is hardest hit: 68 per cent. of the new infections and 76 per cent. of the deaths last year were in sub-Saharan Africa, where AIDS is the primary cause of death. Estimated HIV prevalence has more than doubled in eastern Europe and central Asia since 2001, and the declining trends in some countries such as Burundi are reversing.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/4">In the past eight years, the international community has made a series of commitments to address HIV/AIDS. In September 2000, Heads of State and Government at the UN millennium summit issued the millennium declaration&mdash;a powerful statement of pledges to address the major challenges facing humanity. Under its provisions, the international community is committed to halting and beginning to reverse the spread of HIV/AIDS by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/5">Further progress was made in 2005, and the UK Government can take pride in the Gleneagles commitment by G8 Governments to ensuring universal access to treatment by 2010. Many hon. Members will remember the Gleneagles summit. I well remember the run-up to it, all the work that was done by non-governmental organisations to build it up, and the huge march and demonstration in Edinburgh&mdash;colossal!&mdash;as part of the build-up to what was achieved by our Government. A climate was created at the summit for getting some real decisions on targets. That pledge was broadened at the UN world summit later that year and became an international commitment to ensure, as nearly as possible, universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/6">As the world has belatedly come round to the urgency of the HIV/AIDS crisis, there has been some progress on the ground. In 2001, the world spent just $1.6 billion on fighting AIDS. In 2007, total available resources reached $10 billion. The number of people in low and middle-income countries receiving antiretroviral treatment increased fivefold between 2003 and 2006, reaching 2 million by the end of that year. There has been a reduction in HIV-associated deaths, which is thought to be partly attributable to the recent improvement in access to treatment. In addition, preliminary data suggest that there has been a reduction in risky sexual behaviour in a number of countries including Cameroon, Haiti and Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/7">As I have outlined, the international community has geared up its response to HIV/AIDS in terms of both political and financial commitment, but the global effort is still nowhere near the scale that is needed if we are to get to grips with the AIDS crisis. We are still falling far behind on treatment and prevention. Despite recent increases, the WHO estimated last April that only 28 per cent. of people needing antiretrovirals get them and only 11 per cent. of HIV-positive pregnant women in Africa are getting drugs to prevent transmission to their unborn children. My hon. Friend the Minister will be well aware of the efficacy of that treatment, which is available in hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/8">The effort to increase access to treatment has not been matched in the field of prevention. Just one in five people have access to basic prevention services, and surveys indicate that just 12 per cent. of men and 10 per cent. of women in sub-Saharan Africa had been tested for HIV and received the results. Moreover, all those efforts continue to be hampered by stigma and discrimination.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.1/2">It is clear that a far greater acceleration of financing is required. UNAIDS estimates that even last year's resources were more than $8 billion short of what should have been spent if the world were on track to meet its commitments. Even if donor countries continue to increase spending at the current pace, the funding gap will widen, we will not achieve universal access by 2010, and our 2015 commitments will be jeopardised.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/3">I am sure that the Minister will agree that we should not be starting from this point. Had the world responded to the emerging AIDS crisis on the scale required 20 years or so ago, the scale of today's problem and the cost of the necessary action to address it would be far smaller. We face the same choice today. For every patient who began antiretroviral therapy in 2006, six other individuals became infected with HIV. Failure to act on a proper scale now will mean still greater expense in the decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/4">To meet the goal of universal access around the globe by 2010, UNAIDS estimates that we must spend some $92 billion over the next three years, more than quadrupling the annual funding available to more than $42 billion by 2010. Obviously, that makes assumptions about the build-up in inflation during the time needed to achieve that, but those are the sums.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/5">My hon. Friend will be aware of the Stop AIDS Campaign, which brings together many of the United Kingdom's leading groups in this field. Stop AIDS has calculated the UK's fair share of that $92 billion, in line with our relative wealth and population. On that basis, it suggests that its fair share of the world's HIV/AIDS expenditure is just over $5 billion, or &pound;2.5 billion sterling, over the next three years. We should seek to achieve that target.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/6">The establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2001 was a landmark in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Resources available to the global fund are now considerably better than they have been. When I initiated a debate in November 2004, there was real concern that the fund could become an irrelevance. The eighth round of proposals, which was launched this month, is well financed compared to previous rounds, and the global fund already has $9.7 billion in pledges for the three years from 2008-10. However, my hon. Friend will be aware that the fund needs between $6 billion and $8 billion every year to meet its objectives, and the UK Government back that figure, for which we are grateful. There is still a shortfall of between $5 billion and $8 billion for the 2008-10 period. I hope that the Government will continue to push for global fund resources to reach the levels that we need to see if the organisation is to fulfil its remit. We are all agreed on that. The global fund is working well and bringing in more resources, and we must do all that we can in terms of cash and by using the influence that my hon. Friend, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development and others bring to bear, to make the global fund one of the great landmarks in the history of this century.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/7">As I have mentioned, progress has been made in getting treatment to people who need it. A significant reason for that is the fall in the price of first-line drugs from around $10,000 per patient per year to $130. However, still more people are needing second and third-line therapies as their first-line treatments cease to be effective. Patenting restrictions are tighter on these newer drugs. The WHO has found that the prices paid for such treatments are often unaffordably high in countries lacking generic alternatives. As my hon. Friend's ministerial colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" name="Gareth Thomas">the hon. Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> advised last year, second-line treatments can cost as much as 10 times more than other treatments.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/8">We know that the Government support the right of developing countries to use the flexibilities in respect of trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights to ensure affordable access to drugs, including the use of compulsory licensing provisions. In addition, they have expressed interest in patent pooling. I would be grateful if the Minister could give an indication of the progress that has been made. Clearly, we will be looking to the new strategy on HIV/AIDS to bring forward action to help developing countries to make affordable medicines available.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/9">Of course, the affordability of drugs is only part of the picture. Efforts to secure universal access by 2010 can only succeed where there is a supporting infrastructure accessible to people in need. As my hon. Friend knows, average health spending in sub-Saharan Africa is just &pound;5 per person per year&mdash;less than a third of the WHO's recommended minimum of &pound;17.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/10">As the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West told the House, there is an estimated shortage of more than 4 million health care workers worldwide. Last May, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res reported that the rate at which people could start treatment was slowing and treatment waiting lists were growing due to a shortage of health care workers in southern Africa. In this context, my hon. Friend who is responding to the debate may want to mention the UK's involvement in the new international health partnership, which aims to improve co-ordination among donors to deliver improved health systems. I know that he takes a considerable interest in that and recognises what a challenge it is for our Government and his Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/11">In many countries, we look to the state to provide the necessary infrastructure, through state-run services such as health and education. However, we should not lose sight of the fact that it is not just the state that has an important role to play. The voluntary sector, including faith groups, does vital work. It is also in the interests of the private sector, such as mining companies in South Africa, to ensure that their work force, with their families, have access to the prevention and treatment services that they need. Every effort should be made to encourage those companies&mdash;and some of those big, major companies have British head offices&mdash;to do all they can for their employees and their employees' families, and for the wider population.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/12">On the point raised by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1557" name="Hilary Armstrong">the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong)</phrase>, gender inequalities continue to leave women and girls in developing countries disproportionately vulnerable to HIV and AIDS. The Department for International Development is recognised for its groundbreaking work on HIV and gender. I understand that a commitment has been made to put women's rights at the heart of the new strategy. All hon. Members welcome and support that. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that organisations working in this field will be keen to see that commitment reflected in a range of targets and indicators in the strategy. Both he and my right hon. Friend have experience in this area and I do not doubt their determination and the importance that they attach to making progress for women and children. We know about the gender issue. My hon. Friend also knows that there is concern about the position of children. The availability of paediatric treatment remains low.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/13">The international community has some notable opportunities in the coming months to accelerate efforts to tackle HIV/AIDS. My hon. Friend will be aware of meetings in Japan of G8 Development Ministers and Finance Ministers and that the G8 summit will be held in July. As I said, it was the G8 at Gleneagles that initiated the commitment to universal access by 2010. That is worth repeating: universal access by 2010. With just two years to go until 2010, HIV/AIDS must not be allowed to lose its priority. I hope that he will do all he can to ensure that delivery of universal access is again on the agenda and that we secure concrete, timed pledges from the G8.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/14">In addition, the United Nations will be conducting a comprehensive review of the progress achieved in realising the 2001 declaration of commitment and the 2006 political declaration. To undertake that review, the UN will hold a high-level meeting on 10 to <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-11">11 June</phrase>. Again, we look to my hon. Friend and his colleagues to secure from their international counterparts the level of political and financial commitment that will be necessary to meet their pledge to universal access by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.1/15">I am very grateful to have had the opportunity to raise this important issue. Last May, when I initiated a debate on HIV/AIDS in the developing world, we were anticipating the publication of the interim evaluation of DFID's &quot;Taking Action&quot; strategy. Now we await the publication of the Department's new strategy. It is clear that the world needs to amplify greatly its efforts to tackle the global HIV/AIDS crisis. I look forward to hearing what my hon. Friend has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.211.0/1">It is a pleasure to engage in this debate under your stewardship, Mr. Pope.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/2">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1978" name="Gavin Strang">the Member for Edinburgh, East (Dr. Strang)</phrase>, who has an admirable track record of raising the issue of HIV/AIDS in the developing world, for raising this important issue and for his concern about the impact of HIV/AIDS in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/3">My right hon. Friend will be aware that UNAIDS, the joint UN programme on HIV/AIDS, recently announced that global HIV prevalence&mdash;the percentage of people living with HIV&mdash;has levelled off and that the number of new infections has fallen. However, we must not be complacent. Globally, an estimated 33.2 million people are living with HIV. Every day, more than 6,800, people are newly infected with HIV. For each person who starts on a much-needed course of treatment for AIDS, another three or four people are newly infected with HIV. That is the size of the challenge, and there is much more to do before we can say that we have tackled AIDS.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/4">Tackling the needs and rights of children affected by AIDS remains at the heart of DFID's response. DFID is committed to spending &pound;150 million to meet the needs of such children over three years to 2008. Achievements so far include work in 13 African countries with UNICEF to support national plans for orphans and vulnerable children. Those plans will ensure that vulnerable children have access to basic services and are protected from abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/5">The UK has played a leading role in the adoption of the universal access targets, both at the G8 Gleneagles summit and in subsequent years. Achieving universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support will be a huge challenge, but we remain committed to that target. In the last few years, unprecedented amounts of money have been pledged to finance programmes to tackle HIV and AIDS. The UK is now the second largest Government funder for AIDS programmes, and we have called upon other funding agencies to move forward and to turn funding pledges into reality. I know that my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East subscribes to that sentiment.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/6">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1557" name="Hilary Armstrong">the Member for North-West Durham (Hilary Armstrong)</phrase> made a powerful intervention when she spoke about the feminisation of the AIDS epidemic and the inherent inequality that arises from that. She is aware that there is increasing concern about that feminisation, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where women account for 61 per cent. of all adults living with HIV and young women aged 15 to 24 are more than three times more likely to be infected than young men. That speaks for itself. There are many reasons for that, but a key issue is gender inequality. In many cultures, many young women face difficulties in negotiating whether to have sex. They have limited control of the circumstances in which they have sex, and they lack the means to protect themselves from infection.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/7">Gender violence is another major issue to which my right hon. Friends alluded. For example, one in six women in rural Ethiopia report that their first sexual experience was coerced. That is why the UK Government have a strong focus on promoting sexual and reproductive health and rights, as an integral part of programmes to prevent HIV. In countries where the epidemic is concentrated among known high-risk groups, it is vital to ensure that prevention and treatment services are accessible to those that most need them.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/8">Sex workers, injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, and prisoners cannot be reached through normal health services, because they are excluded or feel uncomfortable in such settings. The Government have played a leading role in developing innovative ways to provide services for those groups and helped to design programmes to reduce stigma and discrimination. That is important, difficult and sometimes controversial work, but we must support our partners in developing those innovative services if they are to have an impact on the epidemic in their countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/9">When HIV and AIDS funding is provided in a way that actively strengthens health systems, there are benefits all round, particularly because long-term and sustainable AIDS programmes need a functioning and effective health service. However, providing AIDS funding in an entirely separate or vertical way can undermine the health system and even take away scarce health personnel from other important areas of work. We must work with all our partners to develop joined-up approaches that effectively build up the health service's capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/10">Two initiatives demonstrate the importance of supporting countries to improve their health systems. In Malawi, DFID has committed some &pound;100 million to support the health sector over a six-year period to 2011. That will enable better HIV and AIDS services to be delivered, and the aim is to double the number of nurses and triple the number of doctors that Malawi is able to recruit and, importantly, retain.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/11">My right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East mentioned antiretroviral therapy. In Malawi in 2003, some 3,000 individuals had started on that treatment, and some four to five years later, 130,000 people have started on it. That indicates what can be done if there is vision and a real commitment to ensuring that things happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/12">The international health partnership was also mentioned. It was launched recently, and only today, I met the High Commissioner of Nepal who told me that user fees in health services in Nepal have been lifted as part of that partnership. Some eight countries are engaged in the partnership, which was launched by the Prime Minister in September and is a joint initiative with eight major funding agencies in the health sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/13">In the time available, I shall not be able to get through all that I want to say. We will encourage programmes that work collaboratively in line with donor harmonisation principles and focus on the needs of those who are excluded and vulnerable, especially the high-risk groups. It is important to support the work of multilateral agencies and particularly a joined-up approach by United Nations agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/14">The UK Government have already pledged &pound;1 billion to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria from 2008 to 2015. My right hon. Friend raised that issue, and at the replenishment round for the global fund conference in September 2007, we raised more than $6 billion, and a further pledge of $9 billion allowed the global fund board to fund all projects deemed suitable for funding. New spending will be required, but we must all make greater efforts to make existing money work more effectively. We must also encourage those who have pledged funding for HIV and AIDS, but not yet moved forward, to allocate that funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.211.0/15">This has been an important opportunity to discuss these issues. A number of questions remain outstanding, and I will write to my right hon. Friends and the hon. Gentleman about them. I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, East for raising the matter. It is a timely debate, and I fear that it will remain timely for the foreseeable future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-18a.214.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="214"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080318/halltext/80318h0010.htm#08031853000566">
	<p pid="a.214.1/1">I am grateful to the Speaker for selecting this subject for debate, particularly because it is only a week since the Post Office announced its final proposals for post office closures in the highland area, under the euphemistically entitled &quot;network change&quot; programme. Across the highlands as a whole, the Post Office plans to close 28 post office branches, 11 of which will be replaced with new outreach services. That means a net loss of 17 branches, although obviously in many cases outreach services will result in a significant reduction in hours. Of course, there will also be additional closures in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/2">I wish to draw attention to three points. First, there were flaws in the consultation process. Secondly, there is a matter on which I still have not had a clear answer: the status of branches that were temporarily closed and ignored in the consultation process, which is effectively additional closures by stealth. Thirdly, what are the Government's plans for the future of the network? How will they ensure that we are not back in four or five years' time debating yet another round of closures?</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/3">In my constituency, three post offices will be completely closed, and five will be closed and replaced with more limited outreach services. In addition, two areas that had post offices which were temporarily closed will now have limited outreach services. Given the strong public feeling in the communities involved, there are a number of particularly unfortunate examples in my constituency. I wish to draw attention to the fate of the Harbour street branch in Nairn, which is a very well used post office that serves a distinct part of the Nairn community&mdash;the harbour and Fishertown area. It also serves the part of Nairn most likely to be exposed to future growth. As my right hon. and hon. Friends who represent constituencies in the highlands and islands will know, the Inverness-Nairn corridor is likely to experience significant population growth. Over the next few years, the town of Nairn itself is also likely to experience significant population growth, as has happened in recent years. That forecast for growth was not taken into account either in relation to the closure of the branch in Nairn or in relation to the other branches in the Inverness-Nairn corridor affected by the programme&mdash;Farr, Croy, Cawdor, Ardersier and Balloch. Branches in all of those places have been either downgraded or closed. In the case of Balloch, to which I will return, there has been a failure to reopen the branch.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/4">To the north of Inverness in Kirkhill there is a strong desire in the community to retain the existing post office. The Post Office has proposed that an outreach service should operate in that community for six hours a week. Strong representations were made by members of the community about the post office in Kirkhill, but again no change was made to the proposal as a result of the consultation. Anyone who has read the Post Office Ltd network change programme area plan decision booklet for the highlands and islands&mdash;I have a copy here if anyone is interested&mdash;will know that the public consultation on the initial closure programme in the highlands had 1,900 responses. Despite the consultation being conducted in the depths of winter in January and February, which many in the highlands would regard as the least propitious time for a consultation, there was a significant response from communities across the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/5">In addition, several hundred people took to the streets of Nairn to protest against the closure of the Harbour street branch in a demonstration organised by the local community council. Yet the only decision changed in the programme was that relating the Pulteneytown branch in Wick. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> on his work on that and congratulate the community on having successfully saved its post office. However, there is no difference between the strength of feeling and power of representation made in that community and that made in the other communities I have mentioned. I am delighted that that branch has been saved, but the closures that will go ahead could have been reversed if the same account had been taken of the views of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/6">In the city of Inverness, innovative ideas for extending the outreach model to an urban setting were made to replace the proposed closure of the Kingsmills branch in the Crown area. Again, the fact that outreach was proposed is mentioned in the booklet, but no reason is given by the Post Office for why it was rejected. I would be interested to hear whether the Minister thinks that the idea of the outreach model, which has largely been confined to rural areas, could be used in an urban setting if appropriate. Although geographically that community is within a mile or so of the city centre, there is a steep hill people must go up to get to the city centre and back, which is where people would be expected to go instead. Many elderly people live in a close vicinity to that post office and feel strongly that it should be retained. The ideas put forward were not even responded to.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/7">A concern expressed strongly by constituents who made representations is whether there was any point to the consultation. Except in the case of Wick, was it a real consultation? Was there a point to the huge effort that people went to not just to make representations, but to think through alternatives for the communities affected? What was the point in people doing all that when to all intents and purposes those views have been ignored? That also relates to a separate point about Postwatch because if it wished to it could have conducted a further review of some of the decisions. Given that 1,900 people in the highlands responded to the consultation process, I would have hoped that Postwatch at least sought to review some parts of the decision on the basis of the strength of feeling and the alternative ideas proposed. Postwatch will be abolished in October and replaced by a larger regulator that will cover a range of issues. At this stage, perhaps members of Postwatch have more of an eye to the new body than to carrying out their responsibilities to the full.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/8">The experience in the highlands serves only to illustrate the entirely arbitrary nature of the consultation process under the closure programme. The Government picked the figure of 2,500 closures out of the air. It does not seem to have been based on an assessment of the needs of communities across the country, but on financial demands from the Treasury that Post Office Ltd is then forced to meet. To that extent, one must have some sympathy for the process that the Post Office is going through as it is forced to ignore many of the strongly held views and needs at community level. It is a disgraceful situation, for which Ministers will have to take the blame in the end.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/9">The process in the highlands raises a major new issue that has not been debated and is of wider significance. In my constituency, over the 12 months before the closure programme started, five post offices were subjected to temporary closures: those in Tomatin and Laggan, which because of the postcode criterion will have outreach services, and those in Cromdale, Glenurquhart, and Balloch. A large number of similar cases exist in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2011" name="Charles Kennedy">the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr. Kennedy)</phrase>. Four of the temporary closures were outstanding at the beginning of the consultation period. In most cases, those branches had not been through the permanent closure procedure as they should have and were not included in the consultation process. Effectively, those branches have been airbrushed from history.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/10">When I first raised that matter, the confused responses from both the Post Office and Postwatch would have been laughable had the issue not been so serious. First, a spokesman for the Post Office told <i>The Press and Journal</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/11" class="indent">&quot;It is not true that these three branches were closed without public consultation. Each was subject to a public consultation when they closed temporarily and&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/12">this is the crucial point&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/13" class="indent">&quot;also at the end of the 12-month period, before being designated as permanently closed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/14">As someone who should have been consulted, I was able to explain that that had not happened. I also provided evidence that no consultation on a permanent closure had taken place in those cases. Community councils had also not received any consultation on the permanent closure. To clarify the matter for the House, there are supposed to be two stages&mdash;temporary and permanent closure&mdash;both of which are consulted on separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/15">Next I was told that perhaps all the procedures had not been taken into account and that any representations would be considered in the consultation. I have read the report, and there is no mention of any of the branches to which I referred, despite receiving a large number of public submissions regarding them during the public consultation process. My right hon. Friend and I took up the matter with Postwatch. We were told&mdash;this was the third line in a matter of weeks&mdash;that Post Office Ltd</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/16" class="indent">&quot;agreed a Memorandum of Understanding with Postwatch which governs the process for shaping the Network Change Programme including closures...The approach agreed with Postwatch at the beginning of the Programme to reflect the reality of the situation was that the starting point should be the 'open and trading' network as it stood at the end of March 2007.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/17">The reality of the situation was quite different. The affected communities had been told that Post Office Ltd was actively seeking new people to run those post offices and were given no notification of the change in policy. The matter was taken up with Post Office Ltd, Postwatch and the Government and all three replied in identical terms, suggesting that a formal agreement was made behind closed doors to remove all temporarily closed branches at an arbitrary date in 2007 without telling the affected communities and without any regard to the assurances that had been made to those communities. Will the Minister confirm whether that was the case?</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/18">There is more than a suggestion of collusion in the fact that the Post Office's supposedly independent regulator and the Government now use the same words to describe a position that had not previously been made public. Neither of them has produced any evidence to suggest that the agreement referred to was reached or publicised at the time. It was certainly not mentioned in any of the debates that we had in the House. That is a clear breach of the Post Office code of practice. Parliament was never told that more than 2,500 branches were to be closed under the heading of the network change programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/19">In some correspondence, Post Office Ltd has suggested that the code of practice no longer applies. However, it seems clear that the code of practice does apply. Perhaps the Minister can also confirm that. It is referred to on page 41 of the Government's consultation document. Thanks to this agreement to close extra post offices, seemingly by stealth, an extra three closures have taken place in my constituency and an extra four in my right hon. Friend's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/20">I do not know what the position is across the country. It seems reasonable to conclude that hundreds of other communities may well be in the same position. I cannot give the exact figure. I have asked Post Office Ltd for the figure, and it says that it does not hold information on temporary closures. It has given me some figures&mdash;although it did not explain how they were calculated&mdash;that suggested that about 250 branches had been closed between March 2006 and September 2007. However, it is not clear whether those relate to temporary closures or not. The way in which requests for information on this matter have been dealt with has been a model of obfuscation. A modest estimate, based on the highland experience, suggests that, in addition to the 2,500 closures, an extra 100, 200 or even up to 500 temporarily closed post offices have been airbrushed from history under this process. Clearly, we are getting a good deal more than the 2,500 closures that were proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/21">I ask the Minister to reconsider the temporary closures and instruct the Post Office to reconsider its closure programme. I specifically include those branches that have been temporarily closed on the basis that communities were given to understand that if a branch is temporarily closed, the Post Office will actively seek someone to take over that branch and continue with it. I wish to press the case strongly for the restoration of the post office in Balloch, outside Inverness. The post office is desperately needed in a growing community. The previous one closed not because of lack of interest or support from the community, but because the Somerfield supermarket, in which the post office was housed, closed. After a long delay, the premises have been taken on by another supermarket, which I understand is enthusiastic about reopening the post office. It would be truly astonishing if the closure programme forced Post Office Ltd to look that particular gift horse in the mouth. It would be a huge let down for a community that wants and needs that service. I hope that the Minister will take on board that point in relation to that particular community and undertake to go away and consider the matter further. I hope that the Post Office will reconsider its decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/22">In addition to those specific points about the closure programme in the highlands, there are wider points that directly affect the highlands, including the way in which the future health of the network is to be guaranteed. I do not wish to be back here in four or five years' time having a similar debate if there is another round of closures. To prevent that from happening, the Government must set out what they will do to turn the tide in the Post Office. I am not talking about a guaranteed programme of keeping post offices open&mdash;I know what the Minister will say about that in relation to the funding that has been provided&mdash;but about extending the range of services that post offices are able to offer, such as Government and banking services. I know that the Post Office is continually trying to join the Link network to enable a greater range of banking services to be provided by post offices. The question of the Post Office card account is still unresolved. Post offices derive a great deal of business from people using them to collect their pensions, benefits and so on. Yet it is still not clear from the Department for Work and Pensions whether that new contract for the Post Office card account will even be awarded to the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/23">Constituents report to me changes in the practices of some commercial organisations in using post offices. For example, electricity companies use post offices for the sale of tokens for pre-payment electricity meters. That has been of some interest to the House under another guise. Yet it seems that some of those companies are withdrawing the sale of those products in some post offices, which will have an impact on the post offices' ability to be sustainable in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.1/24">Post offices provide an essential outlet for the sustainability of communities. Post offices and shops go together. In rural areas especially, vulnerable groups, pensioners and people without access to transport need the post office for access to cash and to services. It is often the only way in which people in such communities can get a face-to-face service. The Government should see all those attributes as a huge opportunity. We have seen the state increasingly withdraw from the provision of face-to-face services. Post offices offer a huge opportunity for the Government to return to that way of delivering policy. I hope that the new Minister&mdash;I think that this is the first time we have debated matters relating to post offices since he took office&mdash;will have a more innovative approach to developing and supporting new services to go through post offices so that the network in the highlands and elsewhere has a sustainable future for many years to come.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing the debate on this important subject in the highlands and islands and on presenting the case so well and thoroughly.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/2">I want to raise a couple of points. In their response to the consultation, the Government said that they wanted to encourage more community-run post offices. In my constituency a local environment group, EnviroKirn, approached the post office about taking over Kirn post office, which was threatened with closure. The group was given three months by the post office to come up with a business plan, but it has not been offered any encouragement. Three months is not long enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/3">The Essex county council initiative in which councils participate and take over post offices is certainly a welcome opportunity to save more post offices. The Government should give local councils and community groups more time, encouragement and back-up when they show an interest in taking over their local post offices. I appeal to the Government to suspend the closure programme for post offices, such as the one in Kirn, when a local community group or a council are interested in taking it over, and to give time and back-up for such a takeover to be achieved. Kirn is due to close on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-09">9 April</phrase>, so I hope that the Government will move quite quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/4">Another concern that was raised by my hon. Friend is the long-term viability of post offices that have escaped the axe, particularly those in the many small communities throughout the highlands and islands. A post office at St. Catherines was temporarily closed a few weeks ago. The Post Office says that it is actively seeking someone to take it over, but in view of the revelation by my hon. Friend about other post offices throughout the highlands and islands being in a similar position for a long time, I am very concerned about the future of the post office at St. Catherines.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.0/5">I ask the Minister to give us an assurance that the post offices that have escaped the axe this time will have a secure future and that they will be given enough Government business and support to ensure that they remain open in the long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing the debate. Whatever else may come between us, he certainly has one of the most beautiful constituency names in the House, although his highland colleagues might disagree.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/2">The hon. Gentleman said that this was the first time that we have debated the matter. It might be the first time for him, but I assure the House that it is certainly not for me. He mentioned several post offices in his constituency, and I shall try to respond. However, I start by saying, as I do frequently, that, as a Minister, I do not play a role in decisions about whether to close individual post offices. Quite rightly, that is a matter for Post Office Ltd, following a local process involving Postwatch, which is the consumer voice, MPs and other local representatives. I am sure that Post Office Ltd will have heard what the hon. Gentleman said.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/3">The hon. Gentleman spoke about how unpopular the current process is and the concern in his constituency and others in the highlands. That is natural, and I understand it. He did not touch on why it is happening or the challenges that the Post Office faces, the extent of which we should not underestimate. It is going through the difficult process of reducing the size of the network by just under a fifth. I understand that that is an unpopular process even though, as I shall explain, we as a society use the Post Office a lot less than we did because of a number of lifestyle changes. It operates today in a technological and competitive environment very different from that which once existed.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/4">The hon. Gentleman did not mention competition at all. To take one example, the BBC licensing contract was lost partly because a competitor bid for it and won. I am afraid that that is the environment in which the Post Office operates, and it cannot be wished away. Difficult and unpopular though the current process is, there is a context to it. The Government's response has not been to stand back and leave the network to stand or fall on its own devices. Before the Government came to power, there used to be no subsidy for the Post Office, but that is not the case today. In fact, we are in the midst of a programme of support for the Post Office that will be worth up to &pound;1.7 billion by 2011. It contains a number of measures, including an annual subsidy of &pound;150 million, which never existed under the previous Government and without which thousands more post offices would be under threat. There is talk of a Government-inspired closure programme, but greater Government support on behalf of the taxpayer than has ever existed in the past should be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/5">We do not view the Post Office as a purely commercial network, which is why we give it such support. In fact, there are currently just over 14,000 branches in the network. If it were run as a purely commercial concern, the number would be about 4,000. That gives some idea of the importance of the subsidy and the number of branches that are being prevented from closing by the Government's action to support the network.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/6">Even with such public subsidy and with other funds in that &pound;1.7 billion to cover losses over and above what the subsidy can bear and to invest in the modernisation of the Crown network and so on, the network is not sustainable at its current size. It simply does not have the customers that it used to. Some 4 million fewer customers go through the doors of our post offices each week than just a few years ago. That has been accepted, although reluctantly, by the National Federation of SubPostmasters, whose general secretary recently said:</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Although regrettable we believe that closures are necessary to ensure the remaining Post Offices are able to thrive in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/8">Across the country, that means a reduction of about 18 per cent. in the size of the network. Precisely because we recognise the important social and community role of post offices, however, and because we have access criteria to ensure a coherent network in both rural and urban areas, the reduction in the size of the network in the highlands is significantly smaller, at about 9 per cent. Of course, the situation is still difficult for those who are affected by the closures. I accept that, but the reduction is smaller than elsewhere in the UK. That reflects the nature of such a large, sparsely populated area with significant distances involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/9">Some parts of the highlands and islands are also affected by one of the requirements of the access criteria, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned: to ensure post office provision in postal districts where none previously existed. In addition, alongside the current closure programme, some 500 new outreach services are being introduced, many of which were pioneered in rural Scotland. They include part-time services hosted by local shops for a set number of hours a week and mobile vans that visit particular locations at set times. In the hon. Gentleman's constituency, as he said, three of the 38 post offices that currently exist are scheduled to close. There will be five new outreach services, and two new branches will be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/10">The hon. Gentleman asked about temporary closures, closures by stealth and so on. One of the post offices that he mentioned closed in August 2006&mdash;more than a year before the current programme began. As I understand it, Post Office Ltd has made significant efforts to find a sub-postmaster to run it. The hon. Gentleman will know that, following the announcement by the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform last May, Post Office Ltd agreed a position with Postwatch that meant that post offices temporary closed would not be considered in the new plan unless they were about to be reopened and that those temporarily closed after March 2007 would be reviewed against the access criteria and considered on a case-by-case basis. I understand that Post Office Ltd has written to the hon. Gentleman setting out that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/11">Even somewhere as sparsely populated as the highlands, after the completion of the programme, more than 99 per cent. of the population will have seen no change to their local post office or will remain within one mile by road of an alternative branch. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> talked about post offices that escape the axe, but we need to bear that figure in mind even though we accept the difficulty of the current process.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/12">I turn to some of the challenges that have led to the current process. The Post Office is losing some &pound;3.5 million a week&mdash;half a million pounds for every day that it is open. In some of the least used post offices, which might include some in the highlands, the subsidy per transaction has risen to &pound;17. In others, some of which have fewer than 20 customers a day&mdash;those are not just a few that are used the least, but the 1,600 least used&mdash;the average subsidy is &pound;8 a transaction. A significant subsidy helps to keep those post offices open in the smallest and most sparsely populated communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/13">There have been significant lifestyle changes, such as benefits being paid directly into bank accounts. Eight out of 10 pensioners and nine out of 10 new retirees now choose that as their preferred method of payment. I suspect that those figures will not change.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> asked me about the Post Office card account and its successor, and I understand how important it is to the network's future. I understand that he has tabled questions on the matter to my colleagues at the Department for Work and Pensions. He will know that there is a competitive tendering process, and tenders have to be judged against proper criteria. That is legally necessary, and I am sure that he would not want me to say anything that would prejudice the Post Office's chances of winning the contract. Perhaps he will understand if I leave it at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/15">The current process is difficult, and I understand the points that hon. Gentleman made. However, the highlands have been less affected than other parts of the country, precisely because of the special nature of that part of the UK. In future, we want a viable and sustainable network that is supported by the subsidies that I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/16" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.0/17" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Two o'clock.</p>
