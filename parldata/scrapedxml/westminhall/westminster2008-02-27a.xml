<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.249.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="249"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0001.htm#08022767000565">
	<p pid="a.249.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow, and to have the opportunity to address this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/2">It is perhaps appropriate to remind the House of my entry in the Register of Members' Interests, which discloses that in September last year, I was sponsored to visit the Palestinian territories in the west bank and Gaza strip by the Welfare Association UK. It was an eye-opening visit. I have taken an interest in the issue for almost all of my adult life, but I had never been to the area before and the visit made real many of the issues in which I had previously taken only a theoretical interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/3">I pay tribute to a few of the people that I encountered on my visit. I am lost in admiration for the work of Betselm, the Israeli human rights organisation; those working in the field for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency; and the United Nations Office of the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The latter's work on closures in the west bank in particular is essential in providing us with an authoritative and objective analysis of the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/4">I also place on record my appreciation of the various interest groups within the Liberal Democrats. Like all parties, we have both a friends of Palestine and a friends of Israel group. My own thinking is influenced by many such groups. I pay tribute to Councillor Monroe Palmer, the chairman of Liberal Democrat friends of Israel. His engagement with the issue and with me is an example from which many in that organisation should take a lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/5">I have sought to draw the terms of the debate fairly tightly to the question of settlements within the occupied Palestinian territory and the related question of closures in the area. Obviously and inevitably, the focus of my remarks will be on the application of Israeli Government policy. That lays me open to the accusation that I am not being even-handed in my treatment of the issue, but I ask people not to read into my comments on Israeli policy in this tightly defined debate any significance beyond the generality.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.2/6">The question of settlement development as an instrument of Israeli Government policy has massive and perhaps fundamental long-term implications for the two-state solution. By its nature, the permanence of the settlements creates that significance.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.4/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that rather than putting forward a counsel of despair he should give full backing to the Palestinian President in his negotiations with the Israeli Prime Minister, which have the backing of the Quartet envoy and the potential financial support for major investment in the Palestinian state being planned by our Government and other European countries?</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.252.5" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27b.252.5" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.252.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="252"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0001.htm#08022767000581">
	<p pid="a.252.5/1">I hope that what I have said so far is not a counsel of despair, although I accept that matters are fairly bleak. From the general situation, I take a degree of hope for this simple reason: the ordinary Palestinian and Israeli citizens that I met have a will for peace and for a settlement. It comes down to the question of political will to which I referred earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/2">My frustration is that at present neither community has effective political leadership. I am quite happy to support the President of the Palestinian Authority; indeed, I am quite happy to give support to Ehud Olmert as the democratically elected Prime Minister of Israel, but my support does not mean an awful lot. It is necessary for both of them to engage with their own communities and give them leadership to bring about some sort of solution. Frankly, my despair is that I do not see that happening, and my support will not make a great deal of difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/3">I turn to the point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase>. According to a report published last week by Peace Now, the Israeli human rights organisation, since the Annapolis conference there has been a dramatic expansion in the amount of building in the settlements on the west bank. In 2002, 315 units were built, and 728 in 2005, and there has been a significant increase since November last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/4">The question that comes to mind is whether Ehud Olmert is able, with his Government, to follow through the good intentions that he expresses on the international stage. Does he have the authority to make them work? He says that there is a freeze on Israeli construction in East Jerusalem, yet it is reported in <i>Ha'aretz</i> that the Housing Minister says there is no freeze, which was corroborated by the mayor of Jerusalem, who said that he would not see Jerusalem turned into an illegal outpost.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/5">The Peace Now report to which I referred earlier also deals with demolitions. Settlement construction is only half the story; settlement demolition is the other side. It is apparent from figures published by Peace Now that construction applications from Palestinians to the Israeli authorities result in a 94 per cent. refusal rate, but that 33 per cent. of all demolition orders against Palestinian structures are carried out and only 7 per cent. against Israeli settlements. According to the Israeli central bureau for statistics, only 91 construction permits were granted to Palestinians, yet in the same period 18,472 housing units were constructed in the settlements.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/6">I commend to hon. Members the work of Peace Now and its report, which is thorough and based on the Israeli Government's own figures. I would have liked to say more about the subject, particularly about the impact of the policy on Palestinian communities, but because of the pressure of time I do not feel able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/7">I turn&mdash;regrettably only briefly&mdash;to the issue of closures. Again, I commend to the House the work of UNOCHA in the region, and I share with Members a couple of paragraphs from the report of the special rapporteur, John Dugard, on the state of human rights in the Palestinian territories, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-21">21 January</phrase>. In paragraphs 34 and 35 of the report, Mr. Dugard says:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/8" class="indent">&quot;Checkpoints and roadblocks seriously obstruct the freedom of movement of Palestinians in the West Bank, with disastrous consequences for both personal life and the economy. There are 561 such obstacles to freedom of movement, comprising over 80 manned checkpoints and some 476 unmanned locked gates, earth mounds, concrete blocks and ditches.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/9">I saw such checkpoints and roadblocks for myself while I was in the west bank. The report continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/10" class="indent">&quot;In addition, thousands of temporary checkpoints, known as flying checkpoints, are set up every year by Israeli army patrols on roads throughout the West Bank for limited periods, ranging from half an hour to several hours. In November 2007 there were 429 flying checkpoints. Palestinians are subjected to numerous prohibitions on travel and to requirements for permits for travel within the West Bank and to East Jerusalem. Checkpoints ensure compliance with the permit regime. These restrictions violate article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which has been held to be binding on Israel in the OPT&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.5/11">the occupied Palestinian territories&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.254.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" speakername="Alistair Carmichael" colnum="254"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0001.htm#08022767000583">
	<p pid="a.254.0/1">Of course, Israel has a right to protect its citizens. Equally, however, Israel should not be in the west bank in the first place, because that, of course, is an illegal occupation under international law. The hon. Gentleman will also be aware&mdash;if he is not, I again commend him to the UNOCHA website and its maps&mdash;that a vast number of the checkpoints are well distant from the Israeli border.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/2">There is a question of proportionality. Of course, I recognise that there is a threat to Israeli citizens from suicide bombers and of course Israel is entitled to enforce defence against that type of attack. However, the hon. Gentleman must not forget that it is not just Israelis who have been killed since 2000; a substantial number of Palestinians have been killed, too. I do not even know if data on the number are gathered centrally.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/3">Furthermore, the disproportionate effect of the wall, the checkpoints and all the rest of the defences on the daily life of Palestinians living in the west bank really shows, quite graphically, that it is not an even-handed situation. If Israel is serious about achieving a long-term solution, it will have to accept that it will have to live side by side with Palestinians and that oppression of that type will never bring any such long-term solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/4">There is a lack of proportionality, particularly in the way that the Israeli defence force operates, as I have seen for myself. I saw how our Palestinian driver, who was in a badged United Nations vehicle, was treated by what looked like a 19-year-old Israeli conscript from the IDF. For me, sitting there with my British passport and all the rest of my identification, it was an intensely frightening and disturbing experience. Goodness alone knows what it must be like for an ordinary Palestinian citizen with none of the protections or the UN badged vehicles that I was privileged to enjoy.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/5">Mr. Bercow, I have taken rather longer than I intended, but I hope that I have been able to address the issues raised by other hon. Members. There is much more that I would love to say and doubtless I will on other occasions, but in the interests of allowing a wider debate I conclude my remarks at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.1/1">We do not have to know much about Welsh history to know that the Welsh would fight tooth and nail to protect the remaining 23 per cent. of their territory if they were put in the position that I described. They would fight even more bitterly if the settlements gradually expanded until the Welsh were left with only half their original land. That is what is happening in the west bank, and the Palestinian west bank state as it now exists is only 12 per cent. of the original area of the Palestine mandate.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/2">We must face the fact and make people in this country understand that all settlements in the west bank are illegal under the fourth Geneva convention. On top of that, the Israeli Government have accepted the road map, under which they should&mdash;this is a quote from the road map&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/3" class="indent">&quot;freeze all settlement activity, including the 'natural growth' of existing settlements.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/4">What has actually happened is that the number of settlers in the west bank has doubled since the Oslo agreement from 125,000 to 250,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/5">This month's report from the Israeli organisation Peace Now, which the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland quoted, shows that settlement activity has intensified around East Jerusalem even since the Annapolis conference in November, when the Israeli Prime Minister promised to stop expansion; indeed, activity has increased exponentially, compared with the previous five years. A ring of new Israeli settlements is planned in East Jerusalem, in another clear attempt to change the geographical facts on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside is right that 8,000 settlers were withdrawn from Gaza, but that number pales into insignificance compared with the 30,000 settlers who have been put into the single settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim in the west bank, and there is room for as many again. That is the litmus test for the Israeli Government. They can defend themselves against most of the accusations thrown at them by talking about security: they need a wall for security, they need checkpoints for security, they need to prevent Palestinians from coming into Israel for security and they need to keep Palestinian cars off the settlers' roads for security. We may not always accept the argument, but I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1685" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> that no one can deny the Israeli Government's right to put Israeli citizens' security first, at least in their own country, and we would do exactly the same. However, the expansion of settlements has nothing do with the issue of security: building more houses in the west bank does not make Israel more secure and nor does putting Israeli settlers in the centre of a Palestinian city such as Hebron.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.1/7">So why do the Israelis do it? The BBC &quot;Today&quot; programme asked that very question of the Israeli ambassador last month, and I have a transcript of the conversation. It is an absolute master-class&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.258.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Bercow. I will do my best to draw my remarks to a close.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.1/2">The transcript of the BBC interview is an absolute master-class in avoiding questions and it should be used as training material for Cabinet Ministers. The point is that there is no answer to why the Israelis continue to expand the settlements, and although they remain committed to the road map on paper, it is difficult to believe, looking at the size and number of the settlements and the infrastructure that has been put in place, that they will ever give them all up in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.1/3">The best thing that I can do in drawing my remarks to a close is to answer the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside about terrorism. Terrorism is a very real threat. We visited Sderot, which is the one town within striking distance of Gaza and which has been suffering a rain of rockets ever since the Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. The Israelis have a perfectly legitimate point when they say that their fear, if they pulled out of the west bank, would be that they would get even more rockets from even closer to main population settlements such as Tel Aviv. I can understand that logic, but I would put another logic against it. They have allowed Gaza to become impoverished, with 80 per cent. unemployment and 80 per cent. reliance on United Nations food rations. That is why the rockets have kept coming. It is not an excuse, but it is an explanation.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.1/4">If the same policy of impoverishment is followed, by the strangling of the economy of the west bank through the closures, which is what is happening at the moment, the same thing will happen in Gaza, and Hamas will be elected there, as well. There are already terrible levels of unemployment among Palestinians in the west bank, and the same process is going on. It is vital that people in this country should understand, and that our Government should make it clear to the Israeli Government, how important it is&mdash;I look forward to the Minister's response on this&mdash;that they should stop expanding the settlements, in their and everyone's interests, as the first step toward removing them.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.4/1">I am not a great fan of that institution. As for the idea that remote international judges should make the decisions for a democracy, I think that it is democratic Governments and national judiciaries that should make decisions, and should be accountable to the people. When Hamas abides by all the decisions of international bodies I shall be happy to put pressure on democratic Governments to abide by them, but it is slightly unfair to expect one side to conform to international law when another so clearly violates its principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.4/2">When I hear people posturing against Israel, I sometimes wonder if it tells us more about the person doing the posturing than about the reality in the middle east. It is nice, particularly for politicians, to find a righteous cause, or a bee in their bonnet, to go on about, but Israeli-bashing is no righteous cause. Israel is a liberal democracy. The UK Government's policy should be to support it against those who want to destroy it. We should stop believing the fallacy that a small country the size of Wales is somehow responsible, and is somehow the big obstacle to peace in the middle east. We should seek peace and should note that Israel has made peace with every neighbour&mdash;Egypt and Jordan&mdash;that has been willing to do so. Where there are stable and responsible Governments, Israel has made peace. Israel is unable yet to find a lasting peace in the west bank, or with Gaza or south Lebanon. That tells us more about the tyrants who run those territories.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.0/1">I am utterly astonished by the contribution that we have just heard: it seems that if we are not fans of international institutions and treaties we are free to break those treaties. The reality is that Israel is in breach of international law by the construction of the wall. As for the idea that it is a poor benighted country, I remind <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the hon. Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> that it is the world's fourth largest arms exporter; it is in possession of 200 nuclear warheads; it is quite capable of taking part in&mdash;and frequently does take part in&mdash;military attacks on Palestinian places; and, tragic as every death is, including those of Israelis who die in rocket attacks, the death rate is far higher for Palestinians than for Israelis. This is not a struggle of equals, but a war of occupation by Israel of the Palestinian territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/2">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> for securing the debate, for going on the visit that he went on last year, and for choosing the subject of settlements. Those settlements are not an aberration by a few people in Israel who have chosen to live in the west bank or, in the past, in Gaza. They are part of a long-term strategy. Ariel Sharon, who has been around for a very long time, said in a letter written in 1973:</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We'll make a pastrami sandwich of them. We'll insert a strip of Jewish settlements in between the Palestinians, and then another strip of Jewish settlements right across the West Bank, so that in 25 years, neither the United Nations, nor the USA, nobody, will be able to tear it apart.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.0/4">I have visited Gaza and the west bank many times, and have visited many towns in Israel on many occasions. Is it right that those settlements, with their red roofs and red buildings, with walls around them and special settler roads that Palestinians cannot travel on, should increasingly be dotted all over the west bank? Is it right that the Jordan valley near Jericho has now been occupied and taken over by Israeli agricultural settlements? Is it right that Palestinians simply cannot travel from their homes to a place of work without being stopped? Is it right that an army should come in and stop people going about their legitimate business, and hold up farmers for days on end with their produce, so that it rots in the sun and is therefore of no marketable value? That is the reality of the occupation. That is what the settlement policy is about. I hope that every hon. Member of this House would begin to have some sympathy with an ordinary Palestinian who had to endure that humiliation every hour of every day.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.1/1">Absolutely; that is a very good point. The settlements are situated in places with water; that is why they are put there. The water supply is then taken over, preventing neighbouring Palestinian farmers from getting it. The situation in the Jordan valley is disastrous. The massive rate of abstraction of water from the River Jordan&mdash;partly by Jordan, but also in large measure by the Israeli settlements&mdash;means that the Dead sea is disappearing at the rate of 1m to 2m a year. That is the reality of the question of water in the Jordan valley. On the west bank itself, nearer to Jerusalem, the situation is the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/2">I shall be brief, Mr. Bercow, as I can see you nervously looking at your watch and looking around, and I should not want you to be any more stressed than you are now. I just want to make one point to conclude. From a point when we could have achieved a settlement on a two-state basis, the Israeli settlements in the west bank have grown apace.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/3">As the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland pointed out, the increase in the number of settlements in the west bank is far greater than the number withdrawn from Gaza. Bit by bit, day by day, hour by hour, east Jerusalem is being annexed by Israel, so that in a very few year's time it will no longer be recognisably part of Palestine or a Palestinian city, but an extension of Israel. It is an occupation. Surely to God, everybody can understand that an occupation is wrong and illegal. If a state wants peace, it does not occupy, encircle, impoverish and imprison its neighbours, but talks to and respects them. However, the former is exactly what is happening.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.4/1">I hope that you shall indulge me a little, Mr. Bercow, but I shall try to abide by your wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on securing this important debate, which it definitely is. He made a passionate case based, in part, on his own experience of Israel and the occupied territories. I last visited Israel and the west bank in November last year&mdash;a month or so after his visit&mdash;and I hope that I too hold an informed view of the situation. Nevertheless, this debate is notorious for often generating more heat than light&mdash;to use a hackneyed phrase. It is difficult to judge the point at which passion gives way to something less edifying, but it is probably true that, in any debate involving Israel's settlement and security policies, the more heated the argument becomes, the less enlightened its outcome is likely to be, which is why I found my most recent visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories, organised, but not paid for&mdash;I hasten to add&mdash;by the Portland Trust, to be a valuable experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/3">The Portland Trust's remit is to promote peace and stability between Palestinians and Israelis through economic co-operation and development. That strikes me as a laudable and pragmatic aim, and one that is well equipped to avoid the worst excesses of both religious ideology and inflammatory rhetoric. The trust employs staff from both the Israeli and Palestinian communities who are able to work together to their mutual benefit, because they believe that building metaphorical bridges is a better alternative to building territorial barriers.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/4">Israel faces a Hobson's choice. It knows that, whatever policies it pursues in order to guarantee short-term security, the only long-term solution is a viable two-state one. There should be no mistaking that Israel is prepared to live in peace with its neighbours and to go the extra mile to achieve that peace. The Palestinian people face a similar choice, as they have all along&mdash;whatever else they do, they must first renounce terrorism in order to secure peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/5">Regardless of who holds elected political office, the choices before the Palestinian people can no longer be dictated by article 13 of the Hamas charter, which states that</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/6" class="indent">&quot;there is no solution to the Palestinian problem except by Jihad.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/7">In the meantime, it is not helpful for hon. Members, or indeed anyone else, to huff and puff about apartheid, or to use similar analogies, which are neither accurate nor warranted, given that 20 per cent. of full Israeli citizens are Arabs and that the country has the benefit of both a free press and an independent judiciary.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/8">Even in an age of ethical relativism, however, some moral certainties are still in play in this debate. One of them is that the state of Israel has the right to peaceful existence within secure borders. It is regrettable that Israel has needed to construct a barrier to control movement across the west bank border, but there can be little doubt that the need was real and that the policy has been a striking success in improving the immediate security situation. Israel has a proven track record in dismantling settlements in the occupied territories, but, as we heard earlier, the withdrawal from Gaza has been repaid with renewed terrorist atrocities. At the current rate of fire, by the end of 2008, 4,500 rockets and mortar shells will have been fired by terrorist organisations from Gaza alone. Given those statistics, it is hardly surprising that Israel's current guiding principle in deciding upon further withdrawals is &quot;once bitten, twice shy&quot;. Another certainty is that Israeli citizens have the right to live without fear of attack. Already this year, 31 Israelis have been killed or wounded and the daily strike rate reached its highest ever level in January.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/9">If we are to achieve peace, we must do it through building economic bridges. I conclude on this point, therefore. The Palestinian reform and development plan was presented to the international community in December last year and will offer both institutional reform and economic and social development, with the support of the World Bank and thanks, in part, to a pledge of $500 million from the British Government. There is an acute lack of affordable housing for Palestinians in the west bank, exacerbated by high levels of unemployment and high construction costs. Some 200,000 housing units are needed in total, with 25,000 needed in the Ramallah region this year alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/10">Another significant challenge is the prohibition of new Palestinian building on land designated as area C under the Oslo agreement because such land remains under full Israeli civil and military control. One consequence of that restriction is that in the third quarter of 2007 licences for just 2,109 new dwellings were granted, which is itself a 31 per cent. decrease on the third quarter of 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.4/11">I appreciate the reasons that the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland called for this debate, but it would be progress indeed if settlements on the west bank included the need for further affordable homes for Palestinian families. I hope that the Minister will join me in recognising that the Palestinian people need more than just the removal of Israeli settlements from the west bank and an easing of travel restrictions. They also need more fresh investment in their own communities and they deserve the support of the British Government in securing it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.263.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" speakername="Louise Ellman" colnum="263"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0003.htm#08022767000608">
	<p pid="a.263.2/1">It is certainly the case that this debate is on a very unpalatable and unpleasant situation. However, it is very important to understand the context, which is the outcome of the defensive war that Israel fought in 1967 when the Arabs threatened to throw the Jews into the sea. At the end of that war, the Khartoum conference was held by the Arab states at which the three &quot;nos&quot;&mdash;no recognition, no negotiation and no peace&mdash;led to the beginning of the settler movement, which I have always opposed and which has had negative consequences. It is important to accept, however, that since then Palestinians and other Arab states have mainly been unwilling to accept Israel's existence. Terrorism has deliberately set out to ruin the various attempts to reach a negotiated peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/2">Israel has shown itself willing to withdraw from occupied territories: it withdrew from Egypt in 1979 when it dismantled its settlements in Sinai, from west bank towns, such as Jenin, Nablus and Jericho, before the Oslo peace accords were ruined by terrorist attacks, and from Gaza. It is important to recognise that the former representative of Yasser Arafat in Jerusalem, Sari Nusseibeh, stated in his recently published book that the former &quot;blew it&quot; at Taba when the 2000 peace negotiations failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/3">It is also important to recognise that there are genuine security concerns. More than 1,100 Israelis have been killed since 2000, many of them through deliberately targeted suicide attacks. The much maligned security barrier&mdash;a regrettable necessity&mdash;has resulted in a 90 per cent. reduction in the number of people killed by suicide attacks. Incidents such as that at Soroka must be remembered. I refer to a Palestinian woman and her children who were treated for weeks on end at the Soroka hospital in Beersheba. She was stopped at a checkpoint and found to have explosives attached to her. She was on her way to the hospital to blow up the very people who saved her life and those of her children.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/4">We know of many instances in which explosives have been smuggled into the occupied territories. There is the recent example of 6.5 tonnes of potassium nitrate being stopped, disguised as European aid in sugar bags. All those things show that there are genuine security concerns about people who still do not accept the existence of Israel and want simply to kill Israelis. I was pleased that as a good-will gesture, the Israeli Government dismantled a number of checkpoints and barriers prior to the Annapolis negotiations, and I hope that more can be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/5">What should happen now? Both sides should honour their commitments. The Palestinians should honour their commitments to cease violence and the Israelis should stop the expansion of settlements and pull down the illegal outposts. The checks required at checkpoints should be commensurate with security and no more should be put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/6">The teaching of hatred by Palestinians towards Jews should end. Particularly disgraceful is the current teaching of hatred to children on Palestinian television stations, where Farfour, the Mickey Mouse figure, advocates martyrdom. Recently, on a young children's programme, Assud the Bunny stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/7" class="indent">&quot;We are all martyrs. We will get rid of the Jews. I will eat them up.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/8">A child presenter on the Palestinian TV station al-Aqsa stated that they will liberate the viewers from the &quot;filth of those Zionists&quot;. As long as the Palestinians teach young children such hatred, there cannot be a great deal of hope for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.2/9">It is essential that the Annapolis negotiations continue and that two states live side by side in peace and security. There must be a political settlement that involves the withdrawal from territories in exchange for peace, a sharing of Jerusalem and the resolution of the refugee issue. It must involve massive economic investment, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">the hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> stated. I agree with all that he said. To save people's lives, it is essential that everybody recognises that the only valid way forward is a negotiated peace on the basis of two states. I am sorry that it has been so long in coming, but I sincerely hope that the Annapolis negotiations lead to an end that should have been achieved long ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.1/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> quoted Ariel Sharon from 1973. At that time Ariel Sharon was a general, and it was immediately after a successful invasion by Egypt of the Sinai. At one point, it was thought that the Israeli army would collapse. Yes, what he said was wrong. Yes, it was extreme. However, to apply the comments of Ariel Sharon in the context of the events of 1973 to the present day is ridiculous, extraordinary and completely irrelevant. The point is that the Palestinians need justice. They need to be assured that they will live in peace and security. However, the point that many hon. Members have made today is that Israel equally deserves that assurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">The hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, who initiated the debate, called in aid a quotation from the newspaper <i>Ha'aretz</i>. He is able to quote from that newspaper because Israel is a free, liberal democracy that has a free press. It is interesting that different things are said by different Ministers, but we see that in this country. Is that not a good thing? Perhaps not for the Government, but it is a good thing, because this country, too, enjoys a liberal press.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">The hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> drew a strange analogy with the English and the Welsh, but that it is not the same situation. Talk has been made of a Palestinian mandate. That mandate was created in 1948. It was a very difficult situation then and it has become even worse. There will be peace only when both sides recognise the right to live. That means the prevention and cessation of the Qassam rocket firing and the suicide bombings.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.3/1">I see that you are getting more agitated as the debate progresses, Mr. Bercow. You have had to bring your calculator into the debate so that hon. Members know what time limits are required. Leaving them to make their own calculations in the first place was the initial mistake, but I am sure that you will not make it again.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on the way that he introduced the debate. Despite the taunting on numerous occasions, he has managed to de-escalate the debate. As we have seen this morning, passions are very strong on both sides of the argument. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">The hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> said that it is not mutually exclusive to be a friend of Israel and a friend of Palestine. That is important for us all to remember, because if we are to seek a solution to this problem, which has been protracted over many decades, we will have to be the friend of both.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> said that the more heated the debate becomes, the less enlightened it becomes. That, too, is true. We need to de-escalate, as my hon. Friend did on numerous occasions when introducing the debate. He told us about his first visit to Palestine, which was only last September, despite a lifelong commitment to the cause. He set out his case extremely well and said that the visit was not a counsel of despair: it was bleak, but there was a degree of hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/4">There have been excellent contributions from the hon. Members for Harwich (Mr. Carswell), for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn), for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman) and for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant). The contributions shortened as time went on. My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland alluded to the Palestinians' difficulties with the 563 physical obstacles that are in place, which include checkpoints, roadblocks, earth mounds, trenches, fences and gates on the roads in the west bank. There are also external closures with 13 designated barrier crossing points, 11 of which are for people.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/5">I found the permits system extremely bizarre. Under it, permits are allowed only for over-35s who are married with at least one child. They must have no security record and they must have an employer within Israel. Each permit lasts for only three months. When people with permits do try to cross the external closure, they have to wait for a very long time. There is also the back-to-back system of passing goods from one side to the other. All those things make it difficult for business and the economy to thrive. In 2006, the crossing points were closed for 91 days, and many are not operational for long periods. That has had a dramatic effect on the number of Palestinians who are able to work in Israel. It has dropped from 140,000 in 1999, to 64,000 in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/6">We need to ensure that this is a balanced argument and that we also understand the difficulties that people in Israel face. There have been in Israel many rocket attacks and deaths, particularly of children, over a protracted period. Israeli politics is a fluid politics. One coalition partner recently left the coalition, making the whole situation extremely fragile. The Government now have only 67 of 127 seats in the Knesset, so they always have to watch their backs in the politics of their own country. We must be cognisant of both sides' difficulties in this affair and of the insecurity and fear within the populations on both sides.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/7">We have missed numerous opportunities with the various ceasefires and treaties that have been in place. The fact that there is now a unity Government between Hamas and Fatah does not seem to have delivered any results in terms of a return to peace. The road map was allowed to slip in a hopeless way, and the fact that it took President Bush seven years to consider this issue a priority for his term in office was a disgrace. There has also been a host of initiatives over the years: the Annapolis conference, the Oslo accords, the road map, various UN resolutions, the Quartet and the involvement of our former Prime Minister. However, that never seems to result in much progress, or it is a case of one step forward, two steps back. The Palestinian-Israeli issue is a festering sore in the whole middle east, and we need to prioritise it to ensure that all sides give it the weight that it deserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/8">The rhetoric is easy, and we all know the elements that need to be in place: the two-state solution, the ceasefire on both sides, the building up of security and a growing economy and the public sector. Those things are easy to say, and there is no point in trading the number of casualties on either side, which does not get us much further toward finding a solution. We need the Arab League to be more involved, and we need to ensure that the security barrier is not constructed any further and that the number of Israeli settlements is reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/9">In what order those things should happen is a matter for debate&mdash;the question is how we implement the policy proposals that the rhetoric is about. No matter in what order we put them, somebody will always say, &quot;They have to do this first before we do this.&quot; There must be common agreement about how to proceed. It is easy to say those things from this Chamber, but much more difficult to implement them in practice.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.267.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="267"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0004.htm#08022767000615">
	<p pid="a.267.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Bercow, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> on securing the debate. I refer the House to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests regarding my visit to Israel and the west bank last December.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/2">The House has been divided on many issues today, but underlying the speeches made has been agreement from practically everybody that as part of an overall peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians, the settlements, roadblocks and road closures need to go. I agree with that for three reasons. First, as a matter of principle, the settlements are unlawful under international law. The relevant United Nations resolutions and the various attempted peace agreements, most notably the road map, have always envisaged that, subject to any agreement between the two parties to vary the complete dismantling of settlements, they should be removed as part of an overall peace agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">Secondly, there is a running political sore. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">The hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> was slightly unfair and underplayed the genuine fears in Israel about security and continuing terrorism. However, he was accurate in his description of how ordinary Palestinians experience roadblocks, the barrier, settlements, closed roads and so on. When I have been to the west bank, I have talked to people whom we would regard as respectable, educated, professional Palestinians, who have described their resentment and humiliation at being bossed around by some 19-year-old conscript who does not want to be on duty at a roadblock, but who makes his or her day a little less tedious by making life miserable for the people coming through it. If that is the reaction of educated professional Palestinians, it must be far worse among resentful, unemployed young men, of whom there are a great many in the occupied territories. Even moderate Palestinians see the expansion of some settlements since Annapolis as evidence of bad faith on Israel's part.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/4">Thirdly, the existence of the settlements, barriers, roadblocks and so on constricts hopes of economic development. People cannot move goods freely if, every time a lorry gets to a roadblock, it has to be unloaded and its cargo put on to pallets and checked carefully. If people are prevented from travelling and commuting to work, as they are by the barrier and roadblocks, hopes of economic growth in the Palestinian territories are hindered. All the hopes of Tony Blair and those that came from the donors' conference in Paris will be set at nought if we cannot find a way urgently to tackle the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/5">At the same time, we must address the reality of Israeli fears about security. It is not just a bunch of political leaders who are resisting the dismantling of settlements and roadblocks for their own reasons. Israel's electorate yearn for peace&mdash;every test of opinion shows that&mdash;but still have real fears. They observe that although Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza and dismantled settlements there, it was rewarded, in their eyes, with Qassam rockets on Sderot and further attempts at suicide bombing. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1621" name="Douglas Carswell">the Member for Harwich (Mr. Carswell)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> said, the ending of the settlement has always been seen as part of the final peace agreement, rather than as something to be offered up in advance.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/6">I would challenge the Government of Israel on this point: in every conversation that I have had with officials and politicians, they have been sincere in saying that they want to work with President Abbas and Prime Minister Fayyad to bring about a move towards a comprehensive peace agreement following the Annapolis conference. The trouble is that Mr. Abbas and Mr. Fayyad need to be able to demonstrate quickly to their population that there will be real material and political gains for the Palestinian people as a consequence of engagement and negotiation with Israel. I fear that some of what has happened since Annapolis, particularly the announcements on Har Homa, is sending a different message to the Palestinians and undermining those whom Israelis rightly want to be their partners in the search for a lasting and just peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/7">What, then, can a British Government do? I have two suggestions for the Minister. I shall not pretend that he, or whichever Minister or Foreign Secretary is in office, will be able to wave a magic wand and sort out the problem quickly, but our influence could be exercised in a couple of ways. First, one of the keys to progress is sorting out security along with economic development. Can the United Kingdom, together with its Quartet and EU partners, work on a plan to open up particular highways and help train Palestinian police officers and security officials, so that checks can be provided to a standard that will satisfy the Israelis and persuade them to relax the controls, without feeling that it will endanger their own population, thereby allowing economic development? Helping to build the capacity of the Palestinian Authority in that way is something positive that we could do.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/8">Secondly, one of Israel's great fears is that the Arab world in general is not committed to peace. The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside mentioned the Khartoum conference, held many years ago, but since then we have had the Arab peace plan and the attendance of virtually every significant Arab country at Annapolis. Just the other day, a speech by Prince Turki al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia held out a vision of a middle east region co-operating harmoniously and building mutual prosperity&mdash;Arab and Israeli together&mdash;if a settlement on Palestine can be attained. Anything that the British Government can do to encourage our traditional friends in the Arab world to speak out more, along lines similar to Prince Turki's, would help to provide the reassurance that the Israelis need, so that we can start to take forward the hopes that were built at Annapolis and not let them crumble to dust, as has happened too often in the past.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.272.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" speakername="Roger Gale" colnum="272"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0004.htm#08022767000618">
	<p pid="a.272.1/1">Good morning, Mr. Bercow. It is a genuine pleasure to be permitted the opportunity to speak under your chairmanship.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/2">In sharp contrast with that sentiment, I take no pleasure at all in having to discuss this morning a matter of considerable concern that arises from my failure to protect the interests of two of my constituents, Mrs. Sarah Hermitage and her husband, Mr. Stewart Middleton, who made the mistake of investing in Tanzania. I know and respect the Minister well enough to say that if she has prepared a speech extolling the virtues of Tanzania as an example of a developing African country that is making progress, and the importance of British investment and overseas aid to that country, I would be grateful if she would do me the courtesy of tearing it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/3">I have heard the arguments from Lord Triesman and Lord Malloch-Brown. I shall read their comments into the record and, in the limited time available, I shall explain why I believe that they and the Government of the United Kingdom are misguided in their naive faith. If the Minister does not have enough time or the briefing to respond in full to my observations, I shall completely understand, because I have a great deal to say. I do not seriously expect her to be able to reply to some of the things that I am afraid I need to say this morning, but I would welcome a written response in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/4">I record my appreciation of the assistance of two people: the Tanzanian high commissioner to the United Kingdom, Mrs. Mwanaidi Maajar, and the British high commissioner in Tanzania, Mr. Philip Parham. Mrs. Maajar received me with great courtesy at a time that, following bereavement, was difficult for her family. I believe that she has exhausted her powers as a diplomat, which, of course, are not the same as ministerial powers, in trying to bring about a fair resolution to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/5">Mr. Philip Parham has proved an exemplary UK representative. He has gone far beyond anything that might reasonably have been expected in seeking to protect the interests of my constituents and of British overseas investors.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/6">Sadly, all that help and my own meagre efforts have been to no avail. My constituents have lost their investment, lives have been placed in danger and, most important of all, innocent people have been imprisoned. I have a file on the matter that is about a foot thick. The case is complex and interwoven with legal contortions. It is inevitable, therefore, that in 20 minutes I shall skate over some facts in a way that will lay me open to charges of being selective and superficial, but I will do my best to state the case simply.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/7">Between 2000 and 2004, the Silverdale farm in Moshi, Tanzania, was owned by Benjamin Mengi, whose brother&mdash;this is relevant&mdash;is the Tanzanian media magnate Reginald Mengi. Benjamin Mengi received from Vector US $150,000 and a Toyota Land Cruiser in exchange for the use of 10 acres of land leased for genetically modified organism trials for the production of zero-nicotine tobacco.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-20">20 May 2004</phrase>, the lease to the Silverdale and Mbono farms was assigned by Mengi's company&mdash;Fiona (Tanzania) Ltd.&mdash;to Silverdale Tanzania for a consideration of $112,000. The money was paid in agreed instalments and formally receipted. Mengi retained a 30 per cent. shareholding and my constituent Stewart Middleton acquired 70 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/9">Mr. Middleton is a farmer with years of experience in Africa. He embarked on the production of vegetables for export and employed local labour. The African co-operatives that owned the freehold of the land passed a resolution accepting the transfer on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-10">10 May 2004</phrase>, and they also accepted the rental paid to them at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/10">In January 2005, Benjamin Mengi, having sold the lease once, sought to sell it for a second time to a neighbouring farmer, Konrad Legg. In April 2005, Mengi applied to the courts to have the investors, Stewart Middleton and Sarah Hermitage, evicted. Simultaneously, it would appear that a contract was to be taken out on Middleton's life. He was to be shot in the head, his body placed in the Kikafu river and his car abandoned at the airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/11">In June 2005, Stewart Middleton opened police charges against Mengi for forgery and conspiracy to murder. The Deputy Minister of Home Affairs was informed but the allegations were never investigated. In August 2005, Stewart Middleton and his Tanzanian manager were arrested on the streets of Moshi by armed police and taken before magistrates on complaints made by Mengi. The charges, which do not exist under the penal code of Tanzania, were dropped, and Mr. Middleton was released. No apology was ever offered by the Tanzanian Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/12">In November 2005, Mengi declared publicly in front of the Moshi regional crime officer that he would drive the investors out of Tanzania &quot;by any means necessary&quot;. To cut a long story short, he succeeded.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/13">Representations were made to President Jakaya Kikwete in January 2007 by the then Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1533" name="Margaret Beckett">the right hon. Member for Derby, South (Margaret Beckett)</phrase>, and an intervention was made by Mrs. Cherie Booth, QC, the wife of the former Prime Minister. She raised the issue with Justice Minister Mary Nagu in February 2007. Those approaches were recorded in <i>Africa Confidential</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May 2007</phrase> in an article that added:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Praising the government's Private Growth Initiative earlier this year at the prestigious United States Yale University, East Africa Tycoon Reginald Mengi stressed the need to be 'careful' when choosing a partner.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/15">How right.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/16" class="indent">&quot;His younger brother, Benjamin Mengi, is trying to obtain the lease to the lucrative Silverdale and Mbono farms in the Kilimanjaro region which in May 2004 he assigned to Silverdale Tanzania owned by British Investors Sarah Hermitage and Stewart Middleton.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/17" class="indent">Official pledges of support notwithstanding the Moshe district police have twice arrested Middleton after Mengi claimed he had not been paid the full price agreed&mdash;despite Mengi signing a receipt to the contrary which Africa Confidential has seen.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/18">It clearly helps to have a brother who owns newspapers and television stations that are relied upon by the President and the Government for support.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/19">In spite of the Herculean efforts of the British high commissioner, Philip Parham, a three-year campaign of threats and harassment has been waged by a small-time crook. Backed by local police officials, Mengi has been allowed to drive lawful investors from Tanzania in fear for their lives and for the lives of the honest, decent and hard-working Tanzanians whose livelihoods they have fought to protect.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/20">In November 2005, the then British high commissioner, Mr. Andrew Pocock, who is distinguished in his own right, wrote to the director of criminal investigation in Dar es Salaam:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/21" class="indent">&quot;You will no doubt be concerned, as I am, by what appears to be continuing intimidation of a bona fide investor in Tanzania. Part of this intimidation seems to be coming from the local police force. Mr. Middleton is not a criminal. There is no evidence that he has broken Tanzanian law in any way. Yet he is arrested without charge and taken by armed guard before a magistrate...I am particularly mindful of the efforts of the Government of Tanzania to encourage legitimate investment and concerned that a British National who is the source of such investment&mdash;and of local employment and exports&mdash;should be subjected to harassment that does not reflect Tanzania's hospitality.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/22">Those comments were copied to the Deputy Minister of Home Affairs, Captain John Chiligati, who took no action.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/23">In June 2006, Stewart Middleton found it necessary to write to the Minister for Planning, Economics and Empowerment following the imprisonment, on trumped up charges, of one of his staff. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/24" class="indent">&quot;The entire judiciary here in Moshi is openly against me because of Mengi manipulating the situation by bribery and by telling key people in the judiciary that their jobs are in jeopardy as I have reported these matters to the Ministers concerned. The worst aspect of all of this is that people who are working with me are now suffering the consequences of doing so. Abel&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/25">an employee&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/26" class="indent">&quot;was arrested on the Tuesday and then Mzee Mtenga is attacked in the night of the Wednesday. There can be no doubt that this is a deliberate attempt to eliminate my support and also to have me suffer the guilt that I am responsible for the plight of these two outstanding Tanzanians.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/27">More was to follow. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October 2006</phrase>, freelance writer Linda Garner recorded:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/28" class="indent">&quot;The Republic of Tanzania threatened Stewart Middleton, a British investor living in Moshi in the Kilimanjaro region, with arrest for the third time in nine months. The hearing involved the case surrounding Mr. Middleton's arrest and committal to prison for fourteen days on 22nd July 2006.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/29">The article states that three months after that imprisonment, the republic had still not produced prosecution statements and no charges had been laid.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/30">In August 2006, following my representations to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on these matters, in which I called for a suspension of aid to Tanzania, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, the relevant Minister, replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/31" class="indent">&quot;Tanzania is an increasingly effective State. It has a stable Government committed to reducing poverty and promoting economic growth...To suspend aid would undermine the progress towards improving governance and cause unnecessary hardship for millions of Tanzanians living in extreme poverty&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/32">I will return to the &quot;extreme poverty&quot; issue later. Lord Triesman had the grace to acknowledge:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/33" class="indent">&quot;We agree that corruption does remain a problem in Tanzania as it does with many countries in the region.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/34">He added that</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/35" class="indent">&quot;President Kikwete has emphasised the importance of tackling corruption and addressing its root causes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/36">I am not sure that Lord Triesman would have written the same letter after the hour-long meeting that Sarah Hermitage and I subsequently held with him and his officials or after receiving the personal letter, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-20">20 March 2007</phrase>, sent to him by Stewart Middleton's Tanzanian farm manager, technical manager and field operations manager, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/37" class="indent">&quot;We have been imprisoned. We have had false accusations made against us which would have resulted in us being in jail again if it had not been for the efforts of the British High Commissioner, Philip Parham...The rule of law is not being applied in any matter concerning ourselves or our employer and we are very worried for our future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/38">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November 2007</phrase>, I wrote again to the Tanzanian high commissioner, Mwanaidi Maajar to inform her of my disappointment at the lack of progress towards a peaceful resolution of the case and of my intention, if necessary, to seek this debate. The letter was copied to our Foreign Secretary and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-02">2 December</phrase> the Minister of State, Lord Malloch-Brown, replied on his behalf:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/39" class="indent">&quot;We believe we should maintain our efforts to support economic growth and poverty reduction in Tanzania. Those efforts are making a real difference to the lives of poor people...Tanzanian budget procedures are better than in many other countries at similar stages of development. But public financial management including corruption certainly remains a challenge. President Kikwete has spoken strongly about the need to tackle it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/40">The &quot;it&quot; presumably relates to what another UK Minister had described in a parliamentary written answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July 2007</phrase> as</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/41" class="indent">&quot;potential irregularities with the Bank of Tanzania external payment arrears account for 2005-06.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-25.1121"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 July 2007; Vol. 463, c. 1121W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/42">At that time, the Department for International Development revealed that it had already given &pound;345 million in &quot;budget support&quot;, with a further &pound;105 million disbursed in July 2007 in support for 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/43">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-15">15 January 2008</phrase>, Sarah Hermitage wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/44" class="indent">&quot;All I know is that for now we have to escape the filth that surrounds us. I feel unclean with what they are doing to us and very, very upset that by omission my own Government is condoning it...I am not being melodramatic and I promise I am not in 'fishwife mode' but we are truly out of our depth now unless we get back up from Miliband&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/45">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-26">26 January</phrase>, she e-mailed:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/46" class="indent">&quot;There is no doubt that we are in extreme danger. Our four key Tanzanian staff were arrested and imprisoned for six months yesterday and the remaining two key workers were told they were going to be beheaded...One of the key workers stated as he was being sent off to prison, 'We will die for this European'. However dangerous it is for us we feel that we cannot go until we have set the appeal for the men in place.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/47">Following further threats of ambush and violence, Sarah wrote on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-29">29 January</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/48" class="indent">&quot;We are being sensible but I have to say I am scared now. It is not safe to walk on the farm. We will be out as soon as the appeal is filed&mdash;before if we need to be...There is nothing left of our operation. Everything has been stolen from the farm including the tin roofs from the field toilets...Incredibly, we were granted a right to see our men in prison. To see these fine Tanzanians walking in filth and mud and crouching before us like criminals was enough to break the strongest of spirits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/49">By that time, our high commissioner, Philip Parham, had persuaded the Chief Justice of Tanzania to meet Stewart Middleton personally. It was too late. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-07">7 February</phrase>, I received a message from Stewart and Sarah via a friend saying that they were fleeing to avoid further arrest. And then:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/50" class="indent">&quot;We have lost the farm. In the end the threats to our lives, the imprisonment of our staff, was placing everyone at risk...the farm is destroyed and now invaded by Mengi...the British Government was told two weeks ago that the Chief Justice had pulled all the civil cases, then he changed his mind...The British Government is taking the arrest and imprisonment of our management team as a direct threat on British investment...Our aim now is for the release of our men. We accept that we have lost everything&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/51">They have now fled the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/52">It would be convenient for those sitting in comfortable ministerial chairs in the Foreign and Commonwealth office, to be able to claim, in the interests of diplomacy and covering their own backsides, that this is an isolated case. It is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/53">Biwater is a water and sanitation company that operates and manages successful projects worldwide. Anyone who knows anything about developing countries&mdash;you do, Mr. Bercow, and I believe that I have a right to claim that I do, too&mdash;knows how important water and sanitation are to the development of a nation and the promotion of good health, so it is reasonable to suggest that the Biwater projects are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/54">In February 2003, a local joint venture company, City Water, was set up by a Biwater subsidiary in Tanzania. It was awarded a 10-year lease contract to manage the water and sewerage contract for the Dar es Salaam area, providing technical and commercial services for a $143.5 million donor-funded investment programme designed to transform water and sewerage services for the people of Dar es Salaam.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/55">In the run-up to <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-01">1 June 2005</phrase>, City Water's assets were seized and on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-01">1 June</phrase> three Biwater executives of City Water were summarily deported by the Government of Tanzania. At the time, Edward Lowassa was the Minister responsible as Minister for Water and Livestock Development. He subsequently became Prime Minister of Tanzania and was then forced into resignation following another corruption scandal relating to an energy deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/56">The British Government are pouring millions of pounds of aid into Tanzania and they continue to maintain the pretence that the money is helping the poor. It would seem that the people described by Lord Triesman as &quot;living in extreme poverty&quot; are benefiting little from our aid programme while corrupt Ministers and business men are doing very nicely out of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/57">Members do not need to take only my word. I leave the final say to &quot;Joe&quot; who, writing in January this year, adopted an alias to protect friends and associates still working in Tanzania. Joe, who has lost</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/58" class="indent">&quot;only a few thousand pounds&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/59">as a result of corruption in Tanzania, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/60" class="indent">&quot;It's important to realise...that Tanzania is, in effect, a totalitarian regime. The idea that the system is democratic is a sham&mdash;the CCM have been in power since independence and it's very unlikely that any other party could win an election. This means that all power&mdash;including power over the courts and the legal system&mdash;is concentrated in the hands of a few, highly corrupt people. There is no doubt that corruption starts at the very top. Although current and past Presidents say the right words in public in an attempt to mollify donors, they are totally responsible for the industrial levels of corruption in Tanzania...I expect you've been following the Bank of Tanzania case. My friends in Dar Es Salaam say that the vast sums involved in the fraudulent payments to shell companies are just the tip of the iceberg: vast sums are disappearing from both the Bank of Tanzania and the Tanzania Revenue Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/61" class="indent">The country is, effectively, being run by gangsters. It's worth remembering that some of the donors...have, at least until very recently, held Tanzania up as a shining example of what can be achieved in Africa. Our...own Department for International Development has been at the forefront of such organisations...In fact DFID pioneered a dreadful policy called 'budget support' in Tanzania&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/62">That is the programme into which we appear to have pumped &pound;450 million. Joe says:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/63" class="indent">&quot;The only slight flaw in 'budget support' is that it takes no account...of corruption...The result is appalling. DFID have been throwing petrol on the fire of corruption and making a bad problem much, much worse. Things were bad enough under Mkapa but since President Kikwete came to power they have, I think, become a lot worse. Some experienced diplomats from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have, incidentally, been saying for some time that DFID are very naive and have been causing rather than solving problems.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/64">In an article in <i>Mwananchi</i>, the Swahili version of <i>The Citizen</i> newspaper, under the heading, &quot;British MP calls for suspension of aid to Tanzania&quot;, the writer says:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/65" class="indent">&quot;Many a time issues raised by MPs in the House of Commons lead to problems in African countries. That is what happened in Zimbabwe after several MPs in London pressed their Government to act against Robert Mugabe due to what they considered to be human right violations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/66">When the &quot;ill treatment&quot; of Robert Mugabe is prayed in aid of a cause I hope we might agree that we have hit rock bottom.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/67">I do not think that the Minister can any longer defend either the promotion of private investment of funds in Tanzania or, under the present regime, the continuation of our aid programme to that country. I rest my case.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.0/1">I apologise to you, Mr. Bercow, and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1873" name="Roger Gale">the hon. Member for North Thanet (Mr. Gale)</phrase> for the quality of voice, but I hope that it will get me through my response.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. His constituents have suffered a grievous experience from investing in Tanzania. We are all aware that the topic is of particular importance to him, and he set out his case clearly. I shall talk first about the general situation in Tanzania, before coming to the specifics of his case.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/3">Tanzania remains one of the poorest countries in Africa. More than 12 million people live below the national poverty line from a total population of about 38 million. Maternal mortality and chronic malnutrition remain stubbornly high, HIV/AIDS remains a major cause of premature death, and life expectancy is 48 years. With UK assistance, Tanzania is trying to tackle poverty, and over the past few years Tanzania has made significant progress in some areas&mdash;for example, by increasing primary school enrolment from less than 60 per cent. to 97 per cent., and reducing child mortality by a third, largely by making major progress in the fight against measles and malaria.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/4">In many other respects, Tanzania is a good performer. The country remains politically, socially and macro-economically stable, and both domestic revenue and aid have increased significantly over the past five years. Donors recognise Tanzania's achievements in improving economic growth and infrastructure. The Tanzanian Government have made budget management more transparent, increased tax collection, and continued programmes to reform public service and public financial management.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/5">The hon. Gentleman referred to the Department for International Development, which is closely involved in that work in the form of the business environment support in Tanzania programme and the Financial Sector Deepening Trust, which it has supported to the tune of &pound;10 million over the past five years. That is in addition to support of more than &pound;50 million for core public sector reforms in Tanzania over the past five years, which strengthen accountability and the state's capacity to deliver services to the poorest people. That is why the British Government are committed to continue to help the Tanzanian Government to reduce poverty in the country. Aid flows are a significant part of the economy, and equivalent to more than 40 per cent. of the Tanzanian Government's total spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/6">As with all aid programmes, we regularly review our development partnership with Tanzania. The most important criteria must be whether our aid will help to reduce poverty, and to improve the lives of some of the poorest people in the world. However, when reviewing our aid programme, we take several factors into account, one of which is the quality of governance. Unfortunately, as the hon. Gentleman outlined, corruption remains a major issue in Tanzania, as in many other countries. Several cases of grand corruption are being investigated by the Tanzanian authorities, and the hon. Gentleman referred to the Bank of Tanzania. The recent special audit confirmed that more than $100 million was improperly paid from an account operated by the country's central bank. The initial steps taken by President Kikwete are highly commendable, and show that the Government are committed to fighting such cases when they are uncovered. The bank's former governor has been sacked, and a criminal investigation has been ordered to help to recover the money. The Tanzanian Government have made a commitment to produce an action plan, to take forward the recommendations of the special audit, and to strengthen wider public financial management measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/7">Budget support donors, including the UK, have delayed confirmation of their aid for the 2008-09 financial year, pending more information from the Government about the way in which the Tanzanian authorities intend to respond to the recommendations of the special audit to strengthen measures to address corruption, and to improve public financial management.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/8">Earlier this month the Tanzanian Prime Minister resigned because of another case of poor governance, as the hon. Gentleman outlined. That resignation led to a Cabinet reshuffle. That suggests that, although corruption remains, perpetrators of corruption or other malfeasance, even at the highest levels, are being held to account for their actions. Those steps towards improved governance should help to rebuild the confidence of budget support donors. Improved governance, and within that an improved judiciary service, is needed in Tanzania to help to promote and protect the interests of foreign and local investment, which is desperately needed to help Tanzania to lift itself out of poverty. Cases such as Silverdale farm are proof that Tanzania still has a long way to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/9">Turning to the specific case of Silverdale farm, I share the hon. Gentleman's deep concern about the events that have unfolded there during the past three years or so. Stewart Middleton and Sarah Hermitage invested in the farm in good faith, and they have suffered from serious harassment in various ways. Since their initial investment in 2004, they and their staff, as the hon. Gentleman rightly emphasised, have been forced to defend themselves from many criminal and civil lawsuits. Mr. Middleton has been arrested, as have the couple's staff. Several lawsuits remain outstanding, and have been for long periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/10">The British high commission, particularly successive high commissioners, Dr. Andrew Pocock and Philip Parham, have been and remain actively engaged with the case. They have provided a lot of support to Mr. Middleton and Miss Hermitage, and have intervened many times and lobbied the Tanzanian Government on the couple's behalf. That engagement has helped to bring the situation back from the brink on several occasions. British Ministers have also raised the case at the highest levels, most recently when Lord Malloch-Brown raised it with President Kikwete earlier this month during the African Union summit. As a result of those interventions, there are signs of potentially helpful movement from senior members of the Tanzanian Government. The Chief Justice is actively engaged, and has offered to mediate between the two parties in the hope of bringing the case to a just conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/11">The Silverdale farm case is an example of why it is difficult to invest in Tanzania. It demonstrates the constraints on both the capacity and the integrity of the legal sector, which the Tanzanian authorities recognise and are trying to rectify. We will continue to be engaged on that case, with the aim of bringing it to a satisfactory conclusion. As I made clear, the British Government recognise that there are serious issues for foreign investors in Tanzania. We will continue to work with the Tanzanian Government to address those problems, with the ultimate aim of creating a positive business environment open to investment. The Government believe that that is the right way forward and will enable Tanzania to achieve its potential. We should continue to work towards realising that.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">It is a pleasure to have this debate with you in the Chair, Mr. Bercow&mdash;I know that you care more than many people about this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/2">Eradicating child poverty is a bold ambition and in politics it is important to be bold and to say that we can get rid of it. Halving child poverty by 2010-11 and eradicating it by 2020 is necessary because by making bold claims we drive change forward. Without such claims, we bibble along and make the world less worse rather than better. I am glad that we have a target and that we are doing much better than the previous Government; when in power, they managed to double child poverty between 1979 and 1997. In addition, the figures changed from one in six to one in three children living in poverty. The target is not enough; we have to deliver on that target. We know that, if we fail to deliver, we will increase cynicism and a sense of hopelessness about politics, and make poverty seem an ineradicable problem. At a time when the latest figures show that we might be going backwards, it is important carefully to consider what needs to be done to tackle this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/3">The Institute for Fiscal Studies&mdash;a body that we all admire for its rigour&mdash;predicts that if we just carry on steady as she goes, we will be 700,000 children short of our target. That is not tolerable. All the experts in the field agree that, despite the &pound;2 billion set aside in the 2007 Budget for tax credits and the rise in child benefit to &pound;20 a week by 2010, which adds up to more than &pound;1,000 a year, more money is needed, otherwise we will miss our target. I initiated this debate because I believe that the forthcoming Budget is our last chance to make sure that we do not miss the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/4">The recipe is fairly straightforward; we know what needs to be done. For child poverty to fall, the incomes of those at the bottom need to rise faster than average income. It sounds straightforward, but how do we do that? IFS says that &pound;4 billion is needed. The Government are suggesting that that amount is not available at the moment, although it seemed to be available to deal with inheritance tax issues. It would be nice if we could find some resources to tackle the issue, which I know is this Government's priority. It is absolutely essential to do so. I wish to use this debate to highlight some of the demands we have, many of which have been proposed and worked though by a range of charities that have campaigned excellently on the subject. I thank them, as I am sure other hon. Members will, for the briefings and information that they have provided us with.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.2/5">One call that is supported by an alliance of groups against child poverty is for seasonal cash grants for children in poverty. If we could deliver that, it would make a massive difference to the poorest children. There are two seasons when the grant is particularly important. In winter, some parents must choose between keeping their children warm and keeping them fed and an extra cash grant would make all the difference to the cost of keeping them warm. Fuel poverty is one of the most shocking aspects of child poverty because it is an example of the poorest people paying more for the same services than richer people. It is shocking that, for example, people on an electricity pre-payment meter pay a 10 per cent. premium for their electricity and those on a gas pre-payment meter pay 8 per cent. more for their gas. Nobody who can afford not to have a pre-payment meter has one. The poorest people are paying premium prices for warmth, which is a basic human need.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this topic at this particular time. Both in relation to electricity meters and borrowing money&mdash;whether from loan sharks who come to the door or through adverts on television&mdash;the facts show that the poorest have to pay more to subsidise the rest of us, who are either on direct debit or have cards that we can use at the bank. The poorest are charged a higher tariff throughout so their expenses are actually more. The argument could be made that the poor are subsidising the better off.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.1/1">In whatever strategy that we develop, we should recognise the features that are most associated with poverty. Compelling evidence exists that shows that, where there is a disabled child in a family, there is more poverty. Initiatives which help families with disabled children&mdash;for example, by looking at how the disabled living allowance works&mdash;might help to deal with some of those in the most dire poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">Cash on its own does not deal with the social isolation that poverty brings. That is another issue that needs to be addressed. While cash is critical to tackle child poverty, services are also important.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is a compelling case to look at the minimum wage. The minimum wage is &pound;5.52 an hour at present, and there are too many people who exist on that level of pay. Often, minimum wage jobs not only create poverty, but trap people. People on the minimum wage do not usually get annual up-ratings unless they are forced by increases in the minimum wage. They often do not get anything above minimum holidays. If they have to take time off because their child is sick, they lose pay. One of the things that we need to do in our employment strategy is to follow the Harker report, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.282.3/2" class="indent">&quot;A system which encourages parents to take any job rather than one that offers them good long-term prospects, or leads to parents 'cycling' between having a job and being out of work is neither efficient nor effective in tackling child poverty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.3/3">I am glad that the Minister who is replying to this debate is from the Department for Children, Schools and Families. As well as access to better pay in work, we need to give people access to better training and to qualifications. Often, people in the lowest-paid work are expected to train outside working hours. If they have children, that is not possible because of the cost of child care. In our welfare-to-work strategy, we should put some energy into assisting parents in the lowest-paid jobs to raise their capacity to earn more as well as to improve their income. A critical need in my constituency is access to English for speakers of other languages. Such assistance will enable people to step out of the lowest-paid work into potentially better paid work. Often, it is not better paid at the first step but it becomes better paid thereafter.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.3/4">We should place emphasis on not just getting people into jobs but keeping them in jobs and helping them to get promotion. That can be done by mentoring and supporting people in low-paid work. At the moment, our services do not focus on that. It is not a requirement of the jobcentre, yet assisting women in low pay to hang on to work and to get the skills that they need to get promotion and to improve the quality of their work would do much to sustain levels of employment and to increase their income and their families' income.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.2/1">I have long been an advocate of third-sector providers. I vividly recall visiting an American project that in this country would be classified as a project that deals with ex-offenders. However, it was an anti-poverty project. It recognised that people who had been in the criminal justice system were the most likely to face massive barriers to employment, ranging from having been locked away for so long that they did not know how to use the equivalent of the Oyster card in New York, to prejudice from employers. By providing targeted support to enable them to get into work, or by providing some element of supported employment as a step towards independent employment, the project was able to demonstrate that it could make a huge difference to the experience of some of the poorest people.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/2">We should not romanticise the capacity of voluntary organisations to deal with these issues. Because state provisions have to be scalable and replicable and to meet targets and so on&mdash;that is a democratic imperative&mdash;the state can sometimes be what I might call stupid. It does not intend to be, but that is a consequence. However, although voluntary organisations can sometimes be fleet of foot, flexible and imaginative, going round the back door rather than the front, they cannot always do so; there are some groups that they cannot help, and if the state starts stitching the voluntary sector into the statutory system, it can sometimes lose those good qualities.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.2/3">The romanticism that I sometimes see in Opposition Front Benchers regarding such fantastic initiatives, many of which are good, always being available to solve the problem is just that&mdash;romanticism.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.291.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="291"  time="015:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0007.htm#08022767000653">
	<p pid="a.291.2/1">I will certainly keep to your guidance, Mr. Bercow.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/2">Before I turn to the issue of child poverty close to home, I shall take one minute to look at the wider problem elsewhere in the world, because the scale of poverty worldwide is hard to imagine. According to a recent UNICEF report, tens of millions of children in developing countries still do not have access to basic human needs such as food, water and sanitation. In many such countries, poverty is increasing, not decreasing, and issues such as malnutrition among the under-fives are particularly significant. Such children are often plunged into poverty through no fault of their own, because of famine, drought, conflict and war, corruption, the scourge of AIDS and natural disasters&mdash;the list goes on.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/3">Closer to home, there is a wide variety of reasons why child poverty continues in the midst of wealth in many parts of our country, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> on covering many of those issues in her speech. There is no need for any child in the UK to live in poverty. The only thing that is lacking is practical action. A recent report by the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs showed that child poverty levels are at a historical high in Scotland, with 30 per cent. of children living in families whose income fell below the commonly used poverty line of 60 per cent. of median income.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/4">Earlier, several Members touched on the specific issue I shall concentrate on today: the link between disability and child poverty, which applies all over the world. I hope that the Minister will address some of the relevant issues, as some people have a constant battle every day of their lives and would like to be entitled to the same opportunities that the rest of us take for granted. While we debate today how best to meet the ambitious targets on child poverty, the link between child poverty and disability is a key area that warrants our attention. Indeed, the Government themselves have rightly noted that the 2020 target will be achievable only with targeted help for disabled children and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/5">Disability is both a cause and a consequence of poverty and the link between the two is so strong that policy makers simply cannot afford to ignore it. To tackle it, however, we need a better understanding of why that is the case. I commend the work of the Child Poverty Action Group, Contact a Family and the Every Disabled Child Matters and End Child Poverty campaigns, all of which have played a key part in doing that. According to conservative estimates, there are at least 770,000 disabled children in the UK, although it is likely that there are more than 1 million children living in poverty and affected by disability. A quarter of all poor children have a disabled parent.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/6">On top of the broader social and economic reasons behind child poverty that we have discussed so far today, disabled children face a number of other challenges. Perhaps the most obvious is that they are more likely to live in poverty simply because the incomes of disabled households are 20 to 30 per cent. lower than the income of the average household.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/7">The Government will rightly be commended for recognising the need to re-evaluate the support provided to disabled children, and indeed much has been done. However, there are genuine concerns about the way the current system operates, and a number of changes are necessary to help us to break the link between poverty and disability. I would particularly welcome the Minister's view on Monday's forthcoming announcement about the independent living strategy, and the impact that she anticipates it will have on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/8">At present, a key tool in the context of disability and child poverty is the disability living allowance. When it works it is effective, but there are too many problems; there is too much distrust of the system, too great a lack of awareness and too many other things outwith the scope of today's debate. Disability living allowance is not having as big an impact as it might. If we are to have any chance of meeting the 2010 target we simply have to do more specifically to target disabled child poverty and to give better support to disabled children and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/9">Child poverty is a national disgrace and a global disaster and is all the more tragic for being preventable. Poverty and disability often go hand in hand, but the link is not inevitable and it will have to break if we are to have any chance of meeting the child poverty targets that we all want to be achieved.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.292.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="292"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0008.htm#08022767000654">
	<p pid="a.292.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> on securing this timely debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/2">In 1997 the UK had the worst rate of child poverty in Europe, and one of the worst of any industrialised nation. In 1999 the Government set what is widely recognised as a very ambitious policy objective&mdash;to eradicate child poverty within a generation&mdash;which was reiterated in the children's plan published by the Department for Children, Schools and Families in December 2007. As I understand it, the target of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020 remains intact.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/3">It is worth remembering, especially in the light of what I shall say, that through investment in support of children and families the Government have stopped the long-term trend of increase in child poverty, and by April 2009 the poorest families will be an average of &pound;4,000 a year better off. That has meant a reduction of 600,000 in the number of children living in relative poverty in the UK, which is the biggest reduction in any EU country during the period. In the north-east, my region, child poverty has fallen by a massive 26 per cent. However, 31 per cent. of children still live in poor households, which is obviously much too high.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/4">Despite the general downward trend of child poverty, the most recent figures show only a levelling off, or even a slight increase. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has noted that changes to the child tax credit announced in the previous Budget might lift another 200,000 children out of poverty by 2010, but that would still mean that the Government were falling massively short of reaching the 2010 target. The Institute for Fiscal Studies, which my hon. Friend the Member for Slough mentioned, has estimated that between &pound;3.8 billion and &pound;4 billion is necessary to achieve the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/5">The key policies that have been used to reduce child poverty&mdash;redistribution of income through the tax and benefits system to provide a safety net for the poorest families, and assistance to make work pay&mdash;have been successful so far, but the charity Barnardo's now believes that those policies will produce diminishing returns, because the families that have so far been lifted out of poverty have been the easiest to reach. We know that the families still experiencing poverty are those with the most stubborn problems and the most complex needs. The Child Poverty Action Group has outlined a range of measures, including increasing child benefit, tax credits, getting more reliable child support through to lone parents and a fairer and more equitable tax system. I am keen to hear what the Minister thinks about those measures, and whether the Government intend to look at the CPAG proposals in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.0/6">There was discussion earlier of universal services, so I shall mention free school meals. Families living on low incomes have huge financial pressures: rent, council tax, utility bills, debt and social fund repayments. The most flexible part of the budget is often food costs. Before the Liberal Democrats took over and stopped it, Hull had a scheme for universal free school meals. There could be enormous benefits from that for all children in helping them to concentrate at school and learn social skills, but it would be excellent if the Government would commission some research and perhaps set up some pilots that would examine the impact that universal free school meals could have on reducing child poverty.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.293.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="293"  time="015:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0008.htm#08022767000655">
	<p pid="a.293.0/1">I join other hon. Members in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> on securing the debate. I obtained a similar debate about a year ago and the turnout has roughly tripled since then, which shows the extent to which the issue is now firmly on the political agenda. I welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/2">Because of the time constraints I want to make just two brief points. First, considering the issue in the context of what the Government are trying to do, particularly through the Department for Work and Pensions, in encouraging more people to get into work, good work is being done on moving people from incapacity benefit into work, and moving lone parents into work. Several other hon. Members have made the point that such movement into work is crucial to tackling child poverty. However, we must make sure that where those measures relate to families with children there is always a child-focused element to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/3">For example, the provisions on lone parents having to start work when the youngest child reaches 12 will be introduced later this year&mdash;eventually the requirement will be to start work when the youngest child reaches seven. If we do not get the &quot;better off in work&quot; calculations right, or if for example child care arrangements do not stack up, the child will be the one who suffers, if sanctions are introduced. I accept that conditionality per se may not be a bad thing, but we must make sure that we do not punish the children because of the parents. Often it is through no fault of their own that the parents are not working. It is not that they do not want to, or that they are undeserving in any respect; it is just that they cannot make all the elements of going back to work stack up. We must make sure that sanctions against the parents do not result in suffering for the children. That is a note of caution that I want to sound.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/4">Secondly, like other hon. Members who are present, I was at yesterday's launch of Save the Children's book &quot;Why Money Matters&quot;, which clearly makes the case that, for most children who are living in poverty, household income has a huge impact, not just on the household's resources but on such things as educational attainment, health and the child's development.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/5">I welcome the fact that the Government, by having the Department for Children, Schools and Families take a lead on the child poverty issue, is looking at the wider picture. I particularly welcome the Families at Risk review, because all of us who have people coming to our constituency surgeries know that some families have a multitude of problems. It is not just about the fact that there is not enough money coming into the household; there are other issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/6">For example, I think that there are about 250,000 to 300,000 children for whom a parent is a problematic drug user. There are also issues associated with parents who are serving prison sentences and there are parents with mental health problems. It is estimated that families in that situation&mdash;where they face a number of problems&mdash;can often deal with eight to 10 agencies in trying to sort out their problems. Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Minister is taking a lead in looking at a whole family-based approach and is not just looking at income.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.294.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="294"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0008.htm#08022767000656">
	<p pid="a.294.0/1">May I also start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> on securing this important debate, as we rapidly approach the deadline for the target of halving child poverty by 2010 and also the forthcoming Budget?</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/2">A number of organisations must be congratulated on their ongoing campaigning work and I would also like to mention in particular the launch yesterday of &quot;Why Money Matters&quot; by Save the Children, which I was pleased to attend. This has been a wide-ranging debate and in my short contribution I cannot touch upon everything that I would like to, or answer certain points that were made. However, I shall do my best to achieve a wide coverage of the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/3">It is generally accepted that progress has been made by the Government on child poverty targets and we congratulate them on that. We also well remember how rapidly child poverty grew in the 1980s. However, it is clear that more action is needed, if both the 2010 target and the longer-term goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020 are to be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/4">Changes to the benefits and tax credits for families with children have helped to lift a substantial number of children above the poverty line. However, it seems to be a great irony that the policy of tax credits and the complexity of the tax credits system have plunged some families into poverty when they have been overpaid and that money has subsequently been clawed back, sometimes in a very unsympathetic manner. There are also the complexities of the child care element of the working tax credit; I saw today on the website that the guide to that alone is 23 pages long. We need reform and simplification in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/5">The expansion of child care provision and other policies aimed at reducing the number of out-of-work families have undoubtedly had a positive impact on reducing child poverty. However, as has previously been said, the latest figures tend to show a rise in the number of children living in poverty. I think that it has always been known that, while some families needed only a small change in circumstances to take them out of poverty, the more marginalised families living in persistent poverty would be much harder to reach.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/6">In fact, we have noted today that half of the children living in poverty come from working households. Clearly, there is a need to make progress towards higher-paid work and sustainable work, via education, training and mentoring, as well as by making work pay and making it beneficial for lower-income families. Clearly, there are costs for entering the labour market and we need to look at those costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/7">With the change in policy that requires lone parents with older children to register for work, the extended school programme, which is already operating well, will continue to be important, as are the issues of affordability and parents applying for the tax credits for which they are eligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/8">The poorest pay proportionately more tax than the rich and I would like to see some changes in that regard. For example, council tax should be replaced with a local income tax based on the ability to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/9">We have commented today on the &quot;poverty premium&quot; and I am sure that there is more that we can do in that regard across a range of items, particularly utility bills. We have also spoken about securing credit, which is a real drawback for those poorer people who are financially excluded. They pay higher rates of interest, which only increases poverty. Reform could be made to the social fund to make it more accessible to those who need it most. We must also ensure that the poorest people are well advised and supported when they borrow money.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/10">Save the Children has estimated that, at the current rate of progress, the target of halving child poverty will not be met until 2024. We have heard that various organisations have estimated that we need an extra spending commitment of &pound;4 billion annually between now and 2010 to ensure that the 2010 target is met.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/11">The Liberal Democrats have signed up to the child poverty targets, but we were concerned that there should be policies in place showing how those targets might be reached. One policy that we have in place as a party is increasing child benefit, raising it to &pound;5 a week through the elder child rate, which would reduce the number of people living in poverty by 400,000. In due course, we would make further investment in improved child benefit, directed at second and subsequent children, to help to remove larger families from poverty. We would also invest more in child tax credit and, crucially, we would improve its administration. Furthermore, many benefits available to poor families have poor take-up rates and I feel that we could do much more to improve those rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/12">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> has already said that families with disabled children remain disproportionately likely to be in poverty and he has mentioned a number of the things that we desperately need to do to improve that situation. Of course, anyone with a disabled parent in the family has an increased risk of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/13">There are other groups, besides families with disabled children, that are most likely to suffer from poverty: large families; black and ethnic minority children; Travellers' children; children leaving care; and asylum seekers. Children in those groups are the most socially excluded children and are faced with inequality and poor social mobility. Those are issues that we must address if we are going to reduce child poverty permanently.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/14">We can talk about the extra spending that we need, but to have a sustainable reduction in child poverty entails breaking into that vicious cycle of deprivation and inequality. That cycle means that children growing up in poor families are far more likely to be poor themselves. Britain consistently performs poorly in OECD studies of social mobility and, of course, we also had the UNICEF report last year, in which the UK came bottom.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/15">There is a strong relationship between family income and educational attainment, which indicates the desperate need to form policies aimed at tackling inequality across society. That involves targeting funding at the poorest, most disadvantaged sections of society in order to improve opportunities for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/16">The Government have made considerable investment in Sure Start, but the latest evaluations are showing that the most disadvantaged are not being reached. The Liberal Democrats would like workless families to receive more support with child care, because that would be a way of providing extra early years provision and thereby breaking into that cycle of deprivation that I referred to earlier. We also propose a pupil premium, which will attach additional funding directly to pupils who are identified as disadvantaged. That funding will follow the pupil to whichever school the pupil attends.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/17">It is well documented in the 2007 UNICEF report that the Scandinavian countries scored highly on all measures, including those dealing with child poverty, in contrast to the UK. So what can we learn from those countries? They have a high proportion of single parents, but a high proportion of them are in work. There must also be lessons that we can learn from them about how to avoid disincentives and how to make it easier and more beneficial for parents to work. Scandinavian countries clearly have a high degree of transfer of earnings between rich and poor and they have high-quality child care, including good early years services and family centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/18">Poverty affects so many aspects of a child's well-being: health, cognitive development, achievement at school, aspirations, relationships and employment. We must identify the action that can be taken quickly to combat poverty. I think that it was alluded to earlier in the debate that it would be a very good idea to have &quot;poverty-proofing&quot; of all new measures. I would like to ask the Minister: to what extent has that been considered?</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1822" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> on securing this debate and also on her frank exposition of some of the problems that are still facing us on the very important issue of child poverty. It is good to see a good turnout from both sides of the House for the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">The hon. Lady made some interesting points about the Budget possibly being the last chance to do something about the problem of child poverty, because simply to go on as we are at present will mean that we miss out 700,000 children, as she said. I also thought that her suggestions about seasonal cash grants were interesting.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">The hon. Lady began by saying that to eradicate child poverty is a bold ambition. It is a bold ambition and we need to turn it into cold reality rather than just having some of the targets that I fear have failed to be achieved in recent years. Certain matters need to be addressed, therefore, including the couple penalty, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> mentioned. We have to tackle the increased cost of borrowing by the poorest&mdash;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1924" name="John Penrose">the Member for Weston-super-Mare (John Penrose)</phrase> mentioned credit unions. We have to do something about the bureaucracy involved with benefit claims&mdash;a point made by the Chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1440" name="Terry Rooney">the hon. Member for Bradford, North (Mr. Rooney)</phrase> and repeated today by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>&mdash;which means that the most vulnerable have the most hurdles to straddle when filling in forms and getting benefits that they need more than other people.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">The hon. Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> made some interesting points about the need for all our policies to be child focused. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">The hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> said that the Government have reversed a long-term trend. I fear that the reality is far from agreeing with that supposition. The Government promised to reduce by a quarter the number of children in poverty by 2005, but have failed to do so; after housing costs, they missed the target by a whopping 300,000. Last year, the number of children living in poverty actually rose. Again, using the housing cost figures, it rose by 200,000 to 3.8 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/5">If we take the 10 years between 1996 and 2006&mdash;the last year for which figures are available&mdash;the number of children in poverty has barely shifted, after 10 years of a Government who supposedly made it a priority and pumped an awful lot of money into it. In reality, as mentioned by the hon. Member for Slough, those in the most severe poverty have not been helped at all. In fact things have got worse and that group has actually expanded. However, there has been much tinkering around the margins. Many children in poverty have been lifted to just above the poverty line and in many cases are in danger of falling back below it after a short time. The Government point to some shifts in numbers that do not reflect a significant shift in the fortune of those involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/6">It is extraordinary that, under this Government, the number of people living in severe poverty has actually increased by 600,000&mdash;from 2.5 million, in 1996-97, to 3.1 million, in 2004-05&mdash;according to a report published last year by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has been cited already. Social mobility in the UK is lower than in Canada, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland. Although the gap in opportunities between the rich and poor is similar in Britain and the US, in the US it is at least static, while in Britain it is getting wider, according to the London School of Economics. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the number of poor households has grown in the last 15 years and the gap between rich and poor is the biggest it has been for 40 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/7">Are the Government backtracking from their target to reduce child poverty by half by 2010? Everyone else seems to think so. The Treasury Committee report on the 2007 comprehensive spending review stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/8" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned that the Government may have drawn back from a whole-hearted commitment to meeting this target.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/9">Will the Minister reassure us that that is not the case? Will she also tell us why, as the Treasury was forced to admit, the Joint Committee on Child Poverty, which was chaired by the then Chancellor, now the Prime Minister, and was supposed to facilitate liaison between Westminster, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Executive on the Government's child poverty strategy, held its last meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2002-09-18">18 September 2002</phrase>? The Government have apparently forgotten what they set out to do and cannot set up even the most essential of meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/10">Why is child poverty so important? A number of Members have touched on many of the issues. More than 2.2 million British children&mdash;one in five&mdash;now live in households dependent on state benefits. In some inner-city areas, almost half the children are growing up in entirely benefit-funded homes, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> mentioned earlier with respect to London. Britain has a higher proportion of its children being brought up in workless households than any other nation in Europe, including countries in eastern Europe. In fact, in the past 10 years the number of people aged 16 to 18 estimated to be not in education, employment or training has increased by more than 50,000 to 206,200. The number of homeless families with dependent children in temporary accommodation in England has increased from 54,660 in 2002 to 71,560 in 2006. The instability and inadequacy of bed and breakfast accommodation is hardly a way out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/11">As we have all said, early intervention is crucial. By the age of three, being in poverty makes a difference equivalent to nine months' development in school readiness. Children living in poverty lag two years behind their peers by the age of 14 and if they do badly at primary school are less likely to improve at secondary school. Families living in poverty have less than &pound;10 per day to buy everything they need, such as food, heating, toys, electricity and transport. One third of children in the UK are forced by their parents' poverty to go without at least one of the things that they need, such as three meals a day, essential clothes or adequate heating in the winter, as we have heard. Furthermore, children from disadvantaged backgrounds are less likely to stay on at school and are 10 per cent. more likely than their peers to leave school with absolutely no qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/12">As we have seen, poverty has an impact on all aspects of children's lives, from their educational achievements to their personal and social interactions. For a child born into poverty, it is very difficult to escape from the poverty cycle. In fact the chance of escaping from poverty more or less rapidly differs largely in Britain compared with other countries, such as Denmark where between 70 and 75 per cent. of children in poverty do not experience poverty for longer than two consecutive years. That compares with the UK where a lone parent with two young children can expect to spend an average of 4.2 years in poverty&mdash;more than double.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/13">When a child lives in poverty their aspirations and expectations for their later life can be so low that their potential goes unexplored and the cycle of poverty is repeated for generation after generation. As Save the Children commented, the extent of the poverty suffered by children in Denmark is considerably less than in our country&mdash;that goes back to the severe poverty definitions. The particular impact on families with disabled children has been mentioned. They are more likely to live in debt and face higher child care costs and more than twice as likely to have no educational qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/14">That simply is not good enough after 10 years of hearing constantly about how child poverty is a priority for the Government. Reducing child poverty must be a reality in practice, not just in soundbites and manifestos. It will be a priority for the next Conservative Government. We endorse and share the widely held aspiration that child poverty in Britain should be eliminated by 2020, but are profoundly worried about the lack of progress made by the Government. We will reform our welfare state; we want a US and Australian-style back-to-work initiative with special centres across the country, where people on benefits will have help with job applications, IT skills and interview techniques. We also want to increase the support we give to families who are in work but on low incomes, which involves using the savings generated by our welfare reforms to abolish the couple penalty in the tax credit system&mdash;mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean&mdash;that leaves many couples better off if they live apart. In doing so, we will be directing an additional &pound;3 billion a year towards many of Britain's poorest families and helping to reduce family breakdown, which is one of the key causes of child poverty. Indeed, children who live with a lone parent have a 48 per cent. chance of living in poverty compared with a 27 per cent. chance for all children. That is not good enough. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies says, that change alone will lift at least 300,000 children out of poverty, and we believe that our radical welfare reform plans will help take the figure towards 500,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/15">Furthermore, a report last year by the Frank Buttle Trust found that nearly half the children surveyed who lived in poverty had no grandparents involved in their lives&mdash;something not mentioned by Members thus far. Grandparents can make excellent support networks for disadvantaged children, especially after a family split. Why then did the Government reject our extended family amendments to the Children and Adoption Act 2006, which would specifically have addressed that problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/16">I am keen to hear from the Minister how realistic she thinks her Government's plans are for reducing child poverty over their remaining years of office. Their plan on child poverty is so far off track as to lack credibility. It is now less likely that a child of parents in a low income bracket will rise to the top income bracket in 2006 than it was in 1970. All that despite the fact that the Government have made reducing child poverty one of the main planks of their policy statements. Have all their targets and warm words been merely a gimmick, or is the truth that their approach to child poverty has failed to deliver the significant results that we were promised?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/17">All the evidence suggests that child poverty is at the start of a cycle from which it is difficult to escape. It is a false economy not to tackle it now as a priority, with policies that work at the sharp end and impact on the poorest families most of all. It is not just about ticking boxes or shifting imaginary numbers, but about bringing lasting and practical benefits to the most vulnerable people in our communities, who need them most of all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-27a.302.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1849" speakername="Beverley Hughes" colnum="302"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080227/halltext/80227h0009.htm#08022767000668">
	<p pid="a.302.2/1">Yes. The number was 3.4 million. That was the high point for the number of children in poverty. If the hon. Gentleman is trying to play around with figures and say that a little before that there were only 3 million children in poverty, he is simply pointing out that in the last year of Conservative Government the figure rose by almost half a million children as the cumulative effect of their policies. He has, therefore, not made his point very effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/2">I will look at some of the more constructive points that Members have raised. Many Members suggested refining how the welfare state looks after the poorest families and that is right. We need to uphold people's right to a decent standard of living, particularly if they are in work. There must be an active responsibility for people to take steps to find work and to safeguard their children's futures.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/3">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase> is right to say that we can see clearly from our current work that although being in work is not a guarantee against children being in poverty, it significantly reduces that risk. Work is an important component and we believe that it is the best route out of poverty. However, we must also recognise that some families face additional barriers to work. Some Members rightly said that disability plays a big role in that regard. We must ensure that we can support such families. Achieving a balance between supporting the vulnerable and encouraging the able to return to work is the key, and it underpins our strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/4">We must ensure that measures to end child poverty are sustainable and effective over the long term. It would be a hollow victory if we were to lift children just over the poverty line, only for them to slip back into poverty a generation later. That is why the strategy that we have been pursuing has four important strands, which Members have identified. First, there should be work for those who can do it and we must make work pay. Secondly, there must be direct financial support for those in the most need. Thirdly, there must be a real improvement in public services, particularly for the earliest years and for families, but which goes right the way through the age range for children to ensure that we address issues such as poor educational attainment and general health and well-being, which can be consequences of poverty. We must do all those things at the same time. Fourthly, there must be direct support to help parents to look after their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/5">Four recent developments are helping to galvanise our efforts. The creation of the Department for Children, Schools and Families, with its joint responsibilities, is extremely important. As I mentioned, there was a new public service agreement in October, which set a series of tough targets that are laying the foundations for breaking the poverty cycle. Through that PSA, there is real collaboration at the heart of Government between the Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and my Department, which includes focused work on how we can narrow the gap between the poorest children and the rest.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/6">Last but not least, there is the children's plan, which my hon. Friend the Member for Slough mentioned. It is taking the focus on a holistic view of children's well-being a stage further. My hon. Friend referred to play and I agree about its importance. I commend what she has done in trying to get her local authority to take that issue seriously. I am glad that it will be bidding to be a pathfinder.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/7">My hon. Friend mentioned the &pound;4 billion question. That has now been recalculated as &pound;3.4 million through various stages to help us reach the 2010 target. The Government are actively examining the options and doing a lot of analytical work to understand the various groupings of families with different characteristics and problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/8">It is evident that there is no single mechanism that can help all families. We have to respond to the different circumstances of different groups, whether they are in or out of work, whether there is disability or whether there are other barriers to work. We are making a careful analysis and looking at a wide range of options. My hon. Friend mentioned seasonal grants and they may be an option, but we have to look at whether they are sustainable and at how well targeted they will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/9">My hon. Friend talked about a severe poverty measure. There was some misunderstanding. The poorest children have been helped the most. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham pointed out that they will be &pound;4,000 a year better off by April 2009 and that their weekly income has risen faster than anybody else's. We need to keep the focus on the poorest children.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.2/10">Finally, the fight to end child poverty does not end in Westminster and Whitehall. It involves local authorities. We need concerted action across local government, the third sector and business, but I hope that over the coming months Members will not just have to take my assurances of today, but will see real commitment put into practice.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> on securing this debate and thank him for raising a subject that is close to the hearts of many involved in the delivery of health care. My county is not dissimilar to my hon. Friend's: it is rural and sparsely populated, with Dartmoor in the middle of it, which means that it is an appropriate county for an air ambulance to work in. I am pleased to say that we have one, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/2">We value the work that air ambulances do and the services that they deliver to patients. They have, as my hon. Friend said, demonstrated time and again that they can make a difference, particularly in emergency care and where road access is a problem and where they can get patients to hospital, and between hospitals, faster.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/3">As I am sure that my hon. Friend will appreciate, as somebody who takes a close interest in health matters, particularly funding, we are taking fewer funding decisions nationally for the health service these days as we give more autonomy to local health trusts to decide on their own spending priorities. We have to take into account the public benefit gained from any increase in expenditure. We have to start by considering where the resources that are made available for the health service will make most difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/4">I am sure that my hon. Friend will also be aware that it was this Government, in 2002, who issued guidance to trusts saying that they should support the clinical staff on air ambulances. I am concerned to hear about the list of trusts that he mentioned earlier where that is not so. I was aware of one from my own research, but I will go back and check that and, if necessary, reiterate the guidance that we gave in 2002. Of course, no statutory support for air ambulances had been provided by the previous Government. The increase in funding by this Government was part of a general package of increased funding for ambulance and emergency services since 1997 of 135 per cent. However, the current advice available to me on the cost-benefit for patients in terms of lives saved and improvements in care would not currently justify extending statutory funding for air ambulances in further areas. However, my hon. Friend identified one or two areas where that could change. For example, if emergency and particularly trauma services were reorganised in the way that he suggests with fewer major trauma centres and greater distances between them, that equation could change. It could also perhaps change more easily and more effectively in the short term with better co-ordination, and he addressed that in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/5">Where air ambulance services are targeted more effectively&mdash;my hon. Friend referred particularly to major trauma, or blunt trauma, as it is called&mdash;the research that we have commissioned from Sheffield university, about which I can write to him with the details, showed that if the average air ambulance service in the country saved four trauma victims' lives a year, it would change the balance of benefit in terms of public funding. It might be possible to achieve that benefit with better targeting. However, at the moment, there are still quite a lot of air ambulance dispatches for far more minor cases, and the economics do not stack up. Between just 1 and 2 per cent. of overall ambulance responses are conducted by air ambulances in areas that have them.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/6">My hon. Friend also highlighted a number of areas where there are still drawbacks in using air ambulances. He mentioned the lack of landing pads at hospitals, so that air ambulances must sometimes land some distance away from the hospital with subsequent road transfer of the patient. Night flying is another issue, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> was right in saying that there are still considerable safety obstacles for air ambulances flying at night. There are also medical reasons why patients with certain injuries and conditions&mdash;for example, maternity patients, neonates, and some head trauma patients&mdash;should not be transported by air ambulance.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/7">There are a number of challenges. They are not insurmountable for the air ambulance services and charities, but I wanted to outline them to try to explain to my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North that although we warmly welcome the work of air ambulances, based on the current NICE-based calculations&mdash;he is on the record as supporting that institution&mdash;it would not be worth spending more taxpayers' money than at present on air ambulances. However, that does not mean that we should not encourage trusts to follow our guidance. Nor does it mean that we should not encourage better co-ordination, which is variable and patchy throughout the country between statutory trusts and air ambulance services.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/8">My hon. Friend may not be aware of the review of co-ordination between the NHS ambulance trusts and air ambulance, which is due to report in May, and whether that co-ordination could be better and allow more effective targeting with the sort of cost-benefits to which he referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.0/9">I want to put on record a couple of other figures that my hon. Friend might be interested in. The Sheffield university research to which I referred found that the average cost of an air ambulance journey was around &pound;1,100, compared with the average cost of a land ambulance of between &pound;139 and &pound;231, so the cost multiple is between fivefold and tenfold.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that the way in which we deal with stroke patients needs a great deal of attention, and I am sure that he will be aware that we recently published an updated stroke strategy. He is right in saying that advances in technology and medical knowledge show that in many parts of the country we have not dealt with stroke victims in the most effective way. It is important to get to patients quickly, to get the right drugs to those who have suffered a certain type of stroke, and doing what can be done in an ambulance environment, but getting them to a specialist stroke centre as quickly as possible. There may be models in future under which specialist stroke centres may benefit from the quick transportation that he is outlining, but that is not currently the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.4/2">I am advised that the best advantage of air ambulances is for serious blunt trauma cases, which is where the main benefit lies. We believe that services have matured and improved since the research to which I referred, and we look forward to any changes and suggestions from hon. Friends on the contribution that air ambulances can make. We value their contribution, and we believe that they should work more closely with the service and with charities to target and deliver the care that patients need. We believe that they have a good future, supported as they are by taxpayers and the fantastic contributions that enthusiasts and volunteers make.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate and am absolutely delighted that it is under your chairmanship, Mr. Bercow.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February 2006</phrase>, I secured a debate on the events in East Timor in 1975. Today's debate covers the same ground, but it does so in the light of recent events that have revealed additional information. In 1975, Indonesia invaded East Timor and subsequently illegally occupied it for 24 years, until 1999. Following two and a half years of UN administration, East Timor finally celebrated its official independence as Timor-Leste in 2002. Sadly, it remains in the news, not least because of the recent attempts to kill President Ramos-Horte, who is now recovering. His country's commission on reception, truth and reconciliation found that in the period from the lead-up to the invasion and throughout the invasion and the subsequent time in power of the Indonesians, East Timor endured up to 183,000 more deaths than would have been expected.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/3">All those deaths are important, but I want to concentrate on the so-called Balibo five. In particular, I will argue&mdash;just as I did two years ago&mdash;that the UK Government at that time and in subsequent years had been involved in a disgraceful cover-up. Before turning to the most recent events, which cast further light on those deaths, a bit of background may be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/4">Portuguese Timor, as East Timor was then, became the focus for Indonesian destabilisation in 1974. A civil war from August to September 1975 killed more than 1,000 people. In control by then was a left-wing movement, Fretilin. Instability and unrest remained. Into this situation flew two British citizens, Brian Peters and Malcolm Rennie. They worked for the late Kerry Packer's Channel Nine network. They headed for the East Timorese border town of Balibo. There, on <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-13">13 October 1975</phrase>, they met three other journalists who were working for the rival Channel Seven network. Three days later all five were dead.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/5">As I said in the earlier debate:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/6" class="indent">&quot;When Britons die abroad we anticipate our Government doing all they can to help the relatives. We expect the Government to seek as much information as possible and to share it with the relatives. Sadly, in this case, the opposite happened. From 1975 until 1995, there was almost complete inaction. The Government were involved in a disgraceful cover-up.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2006-02-01.97"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 1 February 2006; Vol. 456, c. 97WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/7">Efforts, by friends, family and campaigners, such as my constituent Hugh Dowson, to uncover the truth about how the Balibo five died were continually frustrated. By the time of my last debate, we knew that plans were in hand for an inquest into the death of Brian Peters, one of the two British journalists, in New South Wales in Australia.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/8">It was an inquest that should have been held long ago and could have been, had our Foreign Office told the British families in 1975 and 1976 what it really knew from its own sources and from Ramos-Horta about the deaths at Balibo. The inquest has now taken place and the state coroner, Dorelle Pinch, issued her report last November. Coroner Pinch's report and her findings also apply to the other Briton, Malcolm Rennie, the New Zealander and both Australians.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/9">In responding to my 2006 parliamentary debate, the then Minister for Europe, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" name="Douglas Alexander">the right hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, South (Mr. Alexander)</phrase> hoped the inquest would</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/10" class="indent">&quot;reach a clear conclusion about what happened on <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-16">16 October 1975</phrase>.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2006-02-01.103"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 1 February 2006; Vol. 456, c. 103WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/11">The coroner found that Brian Peters was &quot;deliberately killed&quot;, and she named those responsible. She said that Peters died</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/12" class="indent">&quot;from wounds sustained when he was shot and/or stabbed deliberately, and not in the heat of battle, by...Indonesian Special Forces&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/13">including Christoforus da Silva and Captain Yunus Yosfiah. She said that Brian Peters was killed</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/14" class="indent">&quot;on the orders of Captain Yosfiah, to prevent him from revealing that Indonesian Special Forces had participated in the attack on Balibo.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/15">She also found</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/16" class="indent">&quot;strong circumstantial evidence that those orders emanated from the Head of the Indonesian Special Forces, Major-General Benny Murdani to Colonel Dading Kalbuadi, Special Forces Group Commander in Timor, and then to Captain Yosfiah.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/17">Murdani and Kalbuadi are dead. The other two are not. After diplomatic training in Britain, Yosfiah became a general and, later, a Government Minister. The coroner invited him, several times, to give evidence in person or by video link, but he declined.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/18">The coroner concluded that an international conflict was under way once Indonesian forces seized territory in East Timor on <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-07">7 October 1975</phrase>. She stated that thereafter</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/19" class="indent">&quot;the Fourth Geneva Convention (Protection of Civilian Persons in time of War, 1949)&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/20">protected journalists. She said that under that convention, the killings were</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/21" class="indent">&quot;'grave breaches' under Article 147 and may be prosecuted as war crimes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/22">Thus, by the time the Balibo five were illegally killed, the Geneva convention was applicable and so those responsible are guilty of war crimes. Given that finding, the coroner referred the case to Australia's Attorney-General. Australia's Director of Public Prosecutions will determine whether to prosecute. Given the inquest's thoroughness, the DPP has strong grounds to decide whether the surviving Indonesian nationals have a case to answer and whether they should be brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/23">The coroner also helps us to have a better understanding of the role of others, including the British and Australian Governments, at the time. The coroner concluded that in 1975, despite the Balibo murders, the Australian Government continued the &quot;charade&quot; required</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/24" class="indent">&quot;to sustain the myth that there were no Indonesian troops in East Timor.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/25">Britain had a key role in that myth, as documents released by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in 2002 show. On <phrase class="date" code="1975-09-15">15 September 1975</phrase>, a month before the deaths of the Balibo five, John Ford, our ambassador to Jakarta, told the FCO that Indonesia's Generals planned</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/26" class="indent">&quot;to step up clandestine intervention designed to look like popular uprisings...The only limitation on clandestine activity now appears to be fear of its exposure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/27">Australian documents show that the FCO advised the Australians on <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-02">2 October 1975</phrase> that the UK Government would not protest over subsequent Indonesian action in East Timor. Two days later, in a &quot;secret&quot; telegram from the ambassador to the FCO and the Ministry of Defence, Mr. Ford described the military forces ready to invade East Timor. He added that Indonesia's Defence Ministry awaited</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/28" class="indent">&quot;incidents in the next few days that would finally persuade&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/29">Indonesia's President to authorise &quot;early overt action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/30">So, to one of two Indonesian generals whom he knew was in charge of the takeover, Mr. Ford</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/31" class="indent">&quot;stressed the dangers of overt armed intervention particularly so far as Indonesia's position in the UN and with public opinion in the West was concerned.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/32">In other words, Britain did nothing to prevent the planned invasion and went further by recommending that it be kept covert. Keeping something covert means keeping journalists out of the way. Indeed, the inquest findings comment on that. Intelligence officials testified under oath at the inquest; sometimes, on national security grounds, that was done in closed session. Also in closed-session deliberations was, on subpoena, intelligence material located by long searches and covered by public interest immunity. The coroner states that the closed testimonies and intelligence material show that &quot;from early October&quot; 1975, the Indonesians were</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/33" class="indent">&quot;highly sensitive to the presence of any journalists (both foreign and domestic) in the border area&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/34">However, we know that some 20 journalists were in Balibo between mid-September and mid-October 1975. The Balibo five were among them, specifically to investigate whether Indonesian troops took part in the <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-07">7 October</phrase> seizure of a nearby hamlet in East Timor. Balibo was then attacked and the Balibo five were deliberately killed.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/35">The Australians knew of the attack in advance. The Australian Government admitted in 2002 that their officials were informed by the Indonesians on 13 and <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-15">15 October 1975</phrase> that Balibo would be seized covertly by Indonesian troops on 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-16">16 October</phrase>, which is what happened. They also quickly found out about the deaths. As the coroner's report shows, key Australian officials and Ministers knew the main facts about the deaths within 48 hours. From the closed material, including an Australian intelligence review, we can see that they even knew who led the attack. The material reveals that</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/36" class="indent">&quot;Yunus Yosfiah was the field commander in charge of the attack&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/37">on Balibo.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/38">What did the British Government know and what did they do to uncover the truth? They knew a lot, but for a long time did very little. Responding in the 2006 debate, the then Minister implied that the UK Government were not aware of the deaths until their embassy's report of <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-24">24 October 1975</phrase>. The report claimed that the Balibo five were killed</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/39" class="indent">&quot;almost certainly inadvertently&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/40">Already at that time, and contrary to the truth, comments were being made that reduced any need for further investigation, but, worse, it seems that we did not want to know more. It appears that our diplomats</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/41" class="indent">&quot;suggested to the Australians that...it is pointless to go on demanding information from the Indonesians&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/42">The report notes that Australia's embassy was</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/43" class="indent">&quot;inclined to agree but...apparently under pressure from Canberra&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/44">Our own ambassador, Mr. Ford, suggested that</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/45" class="indent">&quot;we should ourselves avoid representations to the Indonesians about them&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/46">to which the FCO replied, &quot;We agree&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/47">From the start, the Australian Government faced press demands to denounce the killings. As a result, Jakarta halted its covert operation to await the response. The Indonesian military was at the time holding on to the British passports of the two dead British journalists, but there was no British response or reaction. Even after <phrase class="date" code="1975-11-13">13 November 1975</phrase>, when the British ambassador informed the FCO that Indonesia's intelligence supremo had given the British passports to the Australian ambassador, Britain's silence continued.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/48">It gets worse. How can anyone justify the subsequent advice from Ambassador Ford to the FCO to deny knowledge of atrocities committed by Indonesian troops in December 1975 after the invasion of East Timor? By January 1976, he had even offered advice to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on how to hide those atrocities. To compound the cover-up and to add insult to injury, his <phrase class="date" code="1976-03-15">15 March 1976</phrase> in-depth analysis of the East Timor crisis claimed that Britain's policy</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/49" class="indent">&quot;has so far paid off handsomely. The lack of involvement has largely kept Timor out of the British and US headlines and away from becoming a major public issue&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/50">That dispatch also confirmed that the Balibo attack was an Indonesian military operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/51">The FCO stonewalled. These two examples from FCO documents from 1975 and 1976, which were released in 2002, illustrate that point. First, A Canberra-based British official reported to the FCO on <phrase class="date" code="1976-04-30">30 April 1976</phrase> that he had suggested to a senior Australian official that</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/52" class="indent">&quot;it would serve little purpose&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/53">if Australian public statements</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/54" class="indent">&quot;made too much of the fact that two of the journalists were British&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/55">Secondly, one of the Australian officials who was briefed in advance by the Indonesians on the Balibo attack was Allan Taylor. In 1976, the Australian Government chose him to lead a cover-up operation on the Balibo five. His report purported to find no Indonesian involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/56">Our own Government's lack of interest in seeking the truth also continued for many years, as I said. During the 2006 debate, I was reminded that when Brian Peters' sister, Maureen Tolfree, was given a range of papers on the issue in 1995, it was to reassure her</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/57" class="indent">&quot;of the Foreign Office's transparency about this case&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/58">I was told that</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/59" class="indent">&quot;she was given a collection of unclassified documents detailing what we knew about her brother's death&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2006-02-01.101"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 1 February 2006; Vol. 442, c. 101-102WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/60">Not one of those documents, however, acknowledges what the FCO really knew about the deaths. The papers on that 1995 meeting, which were released to me in 2006 following that debate, show that the FCO's real concern in 1995 was to persuade Maureen Tolfree and her MP</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/61" class="indent">&quot;that discussion should focus on the consular aspects of the case&mdash;the only legitimate claim Mrs Tolfree has to request a call on Ministers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/62">There are many other aspects of the cover-up&mdash;even apparently less important matters seem to have been subjected to it. For example, until 1999 our Parliament was told that the Balibo five were part of a single TV crew, but the FCO's documentation for the 1995 meeting with Maureen Tolfree notes that the burial plot in Jakarta for the Balibo five newsmen's remains is maintained</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/63" class="indent">&quot;at the expense of Channel 7 (the Australian TV channel which employed 3 of the journalists)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/64">It was therefore known in 1995 that it was not a single TV crew, yet the public utterances until 1999 said otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/65">What should be done now that we have had the coroner's report? The case is closed as far as Indonesia's Government is concerned. They first did that right back in 1975, because, in part, of the UK stance of doing and saying nothing. However, Australia's Government are considering action on the findings and recommendations. What about our Government? Our stance was a disaster for Indonesia and East Timor, and it must end. The conduct of the dead journalist's Government is, for Indonesia's military, a litmus test on where we stand on the issue of impunity, which matters. The men named in the coroner's findings are implicated in later atrocities, not only regarding the Balibo five. Moreover, East Timor's UN-initiated commission for reception, truth and reconciliation concluded, as I mentioned, that between 1974 and 1999, up to 183,000 more East Timorese died than would be expected in normal times.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/66">The commission made 15 calls to the international community. One was for action by the Governments involved, including Britain's, to resolve the Balibo five case and that of another international journalist killed in East Timor in 1975. The UK stance on Balibo to date means that no effort has been made to bring to justice those directly implicated in the illegal killing of the Balibo five, which was also a war crime. What signal does that send to those who would consider murdering journalists? Around the world, from 1996 to 2006, more than 1,000 journalists were murdered. In 90 per cent. of those cases, no one has faced justice. More has to be done, and action must now be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/67">I have some questions for the Minister. First, will she acknowledge that Brian Peters' sister had to overcome an FCO smokescreen to obtain the inquest? Surely the FCO should have been working with the relatives. Secondly, will the Minister involve relatives in determining a way forward and agree it with them? Thirdly, as part of that, will she endorse the coroner's report? Fourthly, will she invite the Indonesian Government to endorse the report? Fifthly, will she insist that those accused of the murders face justice, through, if necessary, a UK initiative for Interpol to issue warrants for the two surviving Indonesians who were named by the coroner? Sixthly, will she institute a fundamental review of the FCO's conduct of the case?</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/68">Finally, will the Minister review the relevant materials on the Balibo deaths? It has been a sorry saga and the way in which it was handled is a disgrace, but I hope that we can at least make progress today.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.1/1">It is not for the United Kingdom Government to take forward the findings of the coroner's proceedings in Australia or to comment on their accuracy. However, I assure the hon.

	<p pid="a.318.1/2">The Government have had contact with the families of the two deceased British journalists on a number of occasions, including meetings with FCO Ministers. As the hon.

Our consular officials wrote to the families of Brian Peters and Malcolm Rennie to inform them about developments following the conclusion of the New South Wales coroner's inquest, and they will continue to liaise with them on any future developments. I believe that shows how seriously the Government are taking the case. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we will continue to do so.</p>
