<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-01a.387.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" speakername="John Randall" colnum="387"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070501/halltext/70501h0002.htm#07050143000517">
	<p pid="a.387.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. Indeed, I was going to make that point. It was not only Ministers who acted in that way: NHS chief executives did not give evidence to the inquiries by the NHS and the Public Accounts Committee. If there had been a genuine desire to ensure that the same thing did not happen again, they would have given evidence. I should like to know what reasons they gave for not giving evidence. Were they trying to hide something? I shall give them the benefit of the doubt, but there is a strange smell about people refusing to give evidence to inquiries that are intended to sort out problems and ensure that they do not recur.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/2">The North West London SHA chief executive, Mr. Goodier, was one of the strongest supporters of the Paddington project. I remember discussing it with him. His support continued even after he was sent a letter by the Department of Health in January 2006 advising him in the strongest possible terms to write back disproving the points made in the letter. Again, nothing was forthcoming.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/3">The Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust has benefited greatly in the past six months from its association with Sir Magdi Yacoub, of whom the whole House and a great many of the public have heard. The Sir Magdi Yacoub heart science centre, which is on the Harefield site, has made groundbreaking, successful advances in the regeneration of the heart in last-chance cardiac patients using a combination of drug treatment and a ventricular-assist device. We have already heard something about what is being done at that centre. Its breakthrough in April in generating human heart tissue opened up a field that is so large in its scope to benefit patients that it is impossible for any of us to quantify.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/4">The Heart of Harefield campaign has been mentioned a lot in this and previous debates. Before Jean Brett agreed to lead that campaign back in 2000, she had to be convinced that maintaining the bed-and-bench situation at Harefield hospital, in which the patient and research are in proximity, was of such importance that destroying that affinity would result in a loss of benefit to patients both nationally and internationally. Recent events have proved her decision to have been absolutely correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/5">The trust is the UK's largest cardio-respiratory centre. Due to its expertise and eminence it has been the largest recipient of NHS research and development funds, but recent Government changes in the allocation of such funds have caused problems. Monitor has suggested that all research funding might dry up after 2009 and has claimed that the trust's strong financial position could therefore be jeopardised. That is a rather worrying thing for Monitor to say. The public, and probably the trust's board, have had a surfeit of NHS organisations throwing spanners in the works while pontificating on matters that are beyond their remit. I am afraid that I hear echoes of the whole Paddington fiasco coming back to haunt us.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/6">It is highly unlikely that the Royal Brompton and Harefield Trust or other specialist trusts will be so radically disadvantaged in respect of research moneys by the Government that all specialist trusts will therefore cease to be financially viable. It is rather more likely that the possible side effects of introducing a new research and development system were not thought through, but it is not acceptable for Monitor to take a disaster scenario approach when assessing the trust for foundation status.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/7">In the most recent round of applications, 17 trusts applied for foundation status, of which only three were successful. Given that one of the trusts was the Royal Brompton and Harefield Trust, which is regarded by the chief executive of the SHA for London as one of the most successful, there are doubts about the efficiency of the system. The press releases at the end of March suggested that the decision had been taken some time before. The application was supposed to be under consideration at that time and the decision was to be made by <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April</phrase>, but it seemed to be a foregone conclusion. I want some openness about that decision, and Members of Parliament, members of the public and members of the trust need answers about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/8">Specialist trusts should not be unilaterally disadvantaged by Monitor as a result of Government policy on cuts in R and D moneys, particularly given that decisions remain in a state of flux. There is no objection to changing the system nationally so that R and D moneys are shared more equitably throughout the country and are monitored more strictly so that they do not leak into supporting deficits, but it is not acceptable for any organisation to use the change in Government policy as an axe to disadvantage specialist trusts. The improvement of patient care and the reputation of this country both nationally and internationally depend on the fruits of specialist trusts' research.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/9">I raise this matter because I am genuinely angry about what has happened, and not only because one of the best NHS trusts in the country&mdash;a real jewel of the NHS&mdash;has been affected. I am angry about the lack of openness, the twists and turns and the political manoeuvring. Things have gone on that would make a senior Whip blush&mdash;the sort of strange things that go on behind closed doors about which I can only dream. At least, that is how things seem to me, a young innocent out here. All that is bad for the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.387.1/10">If we want to improve the NHS and its systems, as I believe everyone does, we cannot have the current system of NHS executives running roughshod over common sense and the evidence and then indulging in a vindictive war against those who have dared to cross them. I dare say that I shall have to watch out if I go to hospital in the next few months, certainly in some areas, but I lay down the marker now: I know where they are, I know where they live and they know where I live.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-01a.392.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" speakername="Andrew Lansley" colnum="392"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070501/halltext/70501h0003.htm#07050143000519">
	<p pid="a.392.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> not only on securing this debate, but on his dogged pursuit of his constituents' interests in relation to health services, as evidenced by this debate and his debate in February last year. He will not give up on the matter; he will ensure that the services on which they rely are supported and maintained. That is all credit to him, and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> who did likewise during his debate back in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood concentrated on the Royal Brompton and Harefield, and Mount Vernon hospitals, and I shall follow him. On the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust, I share my hon. Friends' anger at what happened in relation to Paddington health campus, and the delays and &pound;14 million of directly associated costs. Significant additional opportunity costs were associated with the failure of that scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> was absolutely right about what her constituents had a right to expect after the collapse of that scheme. The trust rightly called time on a project that was never, as the National Audit Office demonstrated, properly supported and organised. A simple question that must be asked in the national health service is &quot;Who is in charge?&quot; No one was ever in charge of the Paddington health campus scheme. The trust called time on it and had a right thereafter to expect to be able to manage its own affairs and to determine its own future. That is the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood made. The trust has applied for foundation trust status precisely for that purpose. It wants greater opportunity and freedom to determine its own future. The London strategic health authority put the trust forward for foundation status, but Monitor has said no for the time being, principally because of the uncertainty attaching to the trust's future income projections derived from research funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/4">I confess that the NHS research and development programme and the reorientation to a number of biomedical centres makes me happy for constituency reasons, because Addenbrookes hospital in my constituency has benefited. There are winners and losers<i>&mdash;[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>] </i>My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge reminds me from a sedentary position that the chief executive of Addenbrookes hospital is Gareth Goodier, former chief executive of the North West London strategic health authority and previously of the Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust. The national health service inhabits a small world. Ministers often remind us that the NHS employs 1.3 million, but it is funny how the same people keep turning up.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/5">It is obvious, as my hon. Friends and the trust acknowledge, that there has been cross-subsidisation from money intended for research and development into service support. The plea of my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood is that, if there are to be substantial changes of the sort proposed under the R and D programme, the financial consequences must be subject to a reasonable transition. There must also be significant opportunities to enable those who are losers for the time being, but have high quality research projects, to win other research projects, even if they have not secured a position as a centre of excellence or biomedical centre for the time being.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/6">At the same time, if I understand the way in which cardiac services are moving and particularly the sort of work carried out by the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospitals&mdash;it bears comparison with that at Papworth hospital in my constituency as a cardiothoracic centre&mdash;they need rapid adjustment in the payment-by-results and tariff system. There are too many instances of hospitals such as the Royal Brompton and Harefield, which have a relatively complex case mix and are likely to be tertiary referral centres, dealing with patients for whom the tariff is not well designed. The Minister will understand that the Government's response to the turbulence caused by the introduction of the tariff has led Ministers to hold back in the latest payment-by-results consultation document. We are moving to a timetable that is a year slower than was intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/7">In reality, the proper response to that turbulence is to make faster progress and to move the next iteration of the tariff. If one does not arrive at a point where there are recognised exceptions to the tariff and recognised outliers and where the cost is not better disaggregated to individual treatments&mdash;often the complex treatments provided by tertiary centres&mdash;often hospitals of a more specialist character lose out as a consequence of the roll-out of the tariff across the NHS. I am sure that the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust needs that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/8">I am sure that it should not be Monitor's job to seek to engage in reconfiguration as part of its authorisation process. That should not happen. It is Monitor's job to encourage as many hospitals as possible to secure the financial status that allows them to become more independent. Configuration is much more a matter of the relative choices of commissioners. I am sure that the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust would not complain if, in the long term, it had to begin a reconfiguration of its services because of a change in demand for its services. Anyone working in cardiac services at the moment knows that they have shifted from cardiac surgery to cardiology and intervention in a way that is redesigning services. The trust knows that it must do that, but it is doing so in response to demand and changes in technology, not as a result of a top-down process.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/9">I must confess that I remain sceptical about the benefit of the strategic health authority&mdash;through Sir Ara Darzi&mdash;engaging in trying to determine the future configuration of services before GPs and local commissioners have had the opportunity to determine where they want services to be. I suspect that access and specialist centres will be lost, which would not happen if decisions were left to local commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">The hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase> made a helpful speech. I do not necessarily share his immediate optimism about Sir Ara Darzi, but I share his optimism about the coming together of Imperial college and St. Mary's, Hammersmith and Charing Cross hospitals. In the health service of the future that we all want to see, in which patients increasingly make choices and GPs and local commissioners make choices, hospitals will begin to make their way in the NHS on the basis of reputation, results and outcomes for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/11">An academic centre with the foundation status that Imperial and the two trusts&mdash;St. Mary's NHS Trust and Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust&mdash;propose could be precisely the kind of major centre that attracts demand from within the NHS, makes its way in the NHS and becomes a world-class centre. We need to establish such world-class centres in this country. Cambridge is aiming for one, and west London can achieve one through such a merger.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/12">Like the hon. Gentleman, I met Professor Steve Smith and Christopher Tugendhat, and I very much share the hon. Gentleman's enthusiasm for their vision. However, I caution against their allowing it to become wrapped up in the strategic health authority reconfiguration proposals. Their vision stands on its own merits; it is not designed to achieve a certain reconfiguration effect throughout London. The two must be kept entirely separate.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/13">My hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Uxbridge made a perfectly straightforward, rational and passionate case for Mount Vernon hospital to be allowed to get on with its job in a place and in circumstances that the local population, GPs and commissioners support.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/14">We have picked on one London primary care trust, Hillingdon, but it is in serious trouble. It had an accumulated deficit of about &pound;59 million at the end of the financial year just gone, and it clearly requires strong change. How should change be achieved? The Minister might like to tell us whether there is any prospect of the PCT taking advantage of the framework for external commissioner support, which the Department set up through its tendering process. The outsourcing of commissioning is one option. It may have some advantages, but even more importantly, responsibility must be transferred rapidly into the hands of GPs&mdash;the primary care commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/15">Primary care trusts, of which Hillingdon is one, have demonstrated that there are serious dangers if they fail to do their job well. If we disaggregate budgets and ensure that the individual local commissioners&mdash;GPs&mdash;have greater control over them, we will bring together clinical decisions and budgetary responsibilities. The problem of Hillingdon PCT's deficit must be tackled. It is not fair to try to transfer the deficit into the hands of commissioners under practice-based commissioning, although that is not the Department's intention. One cannot expect commissioners to discharge their responsibilities on the basis of such a large deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/16">The Government must contemplate the transition that my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood discussed, involving changes throughout the system. There may be three financial years of transition ahead&mdash;not only this year, but the two beyond&mdash;for PCTs in the worst circumstances. Hillingdon may be in that position, and it would be helpful to know whether the Minister has received a request from Hillingdon for a plan that spans such a period.</p>
	<p pid="a.392.0/17">I endorse what my hon. Friend said on behalf of the hospitals in his constituency. It is important that we address the issues in practical terms now. He has done so, and I very much endorse what he has said.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.1/1">On revenue from North sea oil, it is interesting to note that the SNP liked what the <i>Financial Times</i> said about the current price of oil and gas&mdash;that Scotland would have a surplus this year if it got 95 per cent. of the revenue. But in future years, when gas is a bigger part of the North sea flow and prices come down, there will be a clear deficit in the Scottish budget if Scotland relied upon even 95 per cent. of the revenue from oil and gas. Is it not a false economy to make such plans when it is quite clear that prices will come down, the flow will slow and the revenue will not be there?</p>

	<p pid="a.407.3/1">Of course those people are entitled to their opinions, and I hope that they make them clear. We want to hear the opinions of business people throughout the course of the debate. However, there is no way that members of my party would get into the game of insulting such people, unlike the Prime Minister, who spoke about George Mathewson. I shall not disparage and insult the people who we saw this morning, for example. They are entitled to their views. We will leave such actions to the Prime Minister, if the Minister does not mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.3/2">As I said, the Prime Minister is back in Scotland today. We know how bad it is for the Prime Minister because when he last came to Scotland, he pleaded with the Scottish people not to give him one more kicking. &quot;I am going away,&quot; he assured them, and for that they will be eternally grateful. &quot;Do not give me one last kicking,&quot; he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.3/3">We Scots are a reasonable people, and, as far as possible, we would like to oblige and indulge the Prime Minister. However, we will give him one hell of a kicking on Thursday. The Scottish people will have their say about him, and it will not be a pretty sight. It will not be a pretty sight for the Prime Minister and it will not be a pretty sight for the Chancellor, who is probably now even more unpopular than the most unpopular Prime Minister since records began. The elections will be a disaster for the Chancellor in his own back yard because he will be defeated. What type of Prime Minister will he be then?</p>
	<p pid="a.407.3/4">I make a plea to Labour Members: please keep the Prime Minister in Scotland until Thursday. We want to ensure that we get our vote out so that we have as large a majority as possible. Will they keep the Prime Minister in Scotland for as long as they can? His presence in Scotland has focused attention on the Government's policy in Scotland. Why has the negativity failed this time? Labour Members thought that they simply needed to put the frighteners on the Scottish people one more time and they would all fall into line. That will not happen and there are two very good reasons why it will not. First and most important, the Scottish people do not believe a word that this Government and the Prime Minister say anymore. If this Prime Minister and the Government are prepared to tell untruths&mdash;I will not go into why&mdash;about why this country went to war, which is the most important fundamental decision that a Government can make, why should the Scottish people believe them about anything else? Why should they believe what the Government say about the details and features of our policy to replace the hated council tax when they tell such huge whoppers about going to war? Of course, people do not believe a word that the Government say anymore.</p>

	<p pid="a.409.4/1">In addition to the Scottish people not believing one word that Labour Members say, the second reason why the Scottish people will not believe in the negativity this time is because they are much more confident and self-assured. The Scottish people have had eight years of running their own Government and Parliament, and they know what it is like to do that. Labour Members suggest to the Scottish people that they can confidently run issues such as health and education&mdash;as the Scottish people have done already&mdash;but that they cannot somehow run defence, foreign affairs or pensions. The Scottish people are saying that that does not chime with their experience and, in that respect, a negative policy does not work anymore.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this debate with precision timing. Today is also labour day, <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May</phrase>, which is a good day to have such a debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/2">In less than 48 hours, polling stations all over Scotland will open their doors. Many of the polls predict a wind of change. The people of Scotland are willing and able to embrace change, but Scots will not be deluded into making changes that will cause the modern progress that the country has made in the past 10 years to be obliterated. I believe that the people of Scotland are confident in their national identity as part of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/3">Just last week, 150 business leaders from throughout the country, men and women, put the case for Scotland's economic and social progress as part of the Union. Like me, they believe that Scotland's best opportunities for investment, jobs and prosperity lie in being part of Britain. From prosperity emanates a love of culture and sport. That is precisely why some of our most famous sporting heroes&mdash;all Scottish patriots&mdash;have put the case for Scotland as part of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/4">During this election period, it is time to remind ourselves of the depth of the long-term ties that bind Scotland to the United Kingdom. The shared values that underpin the economic networks, financial connections and business alliances in the UK are fundamental to Scotland's success. They make us stronger together, and we would be weaker apart. They make a multinational Britain a model for a new and interdependent world.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/5">If the people of Scotland do not want independence on Friday morning, they cannot vote SNP on Thursday. Independence is the threat facing those people in Scotland who do not vote or who choose not to vote for a party that is committed to devolution. The SNP may want to give the impression that all the big questions will be postponed until a possible referendum years down the line, but its real strategy is for conflicts over powers from day one of an nationalist Administration. The leader of the Scottish nationalists has publicly threatened that the four-year war of attrition with Westminster will start on <phrase class="date" code="">3 May</phrase> if his party is elected to rule.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/6">The break-up of Britain would not only start to undermine shared family connections and economic relationships and the values that we all hold in common, but would, from day one, be a recipe for division and instability and put our prosperity at risk. East Lothian, the constituency that I represent, has like the rest of Scotland fared well within the Union in recent years. Last week's employment figures showed more people in work in Scotland than ever before, with 50,000 more people in employment in one year alone. For the first time in half a century, Scotland can contemplate marching towards full employment if we make the right long-term decisions. Scotland not only has its highest share of working age people in employment since records began, but its employment rate, currently at 76.3 per cent., has been around or above the UK rate since 2003, among the highest in the EU 25 and better than that of every G7 country. That contrasts with the position in 1997, when the Scottish employment rate was 2.5 per cent. lower than the UK rate. Far from lagging behind, Scotland has experienced higher growth in gross weekly earnings than the UK in three of the past four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/7">Devolution gives Scotland both stability and mutual support. Rising to the challenge of globalisation means nothing less than equipping each and every Scot to meet the competitive challenge. In the next 10 years, a transformation of our education and skills base is essential. That is what we must focus on, not unnecessary constitutional wrangling. Labour in Scotland will, for the first time ever, guarantee education to Scots from the ages of three to 18. That priority was identified under the devolved policy and can be delivered only by a devolved policy. However, we will succeed only if we also secure and entrench stability as the foundation of all that we do.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/8">It is time for some brutal truths about the new global economy. Investment will flow to those countries that are stable. In the same way, it will move quickly and decisively from those that are unstable. Stability is our watchword&mdash;yesterday, today and tomorrow&mdash;so Scotland must build and cement the economic stability that is the foundation of any country's success, not jeopardise or take risks with it. For those reasons&mdash;for the sake of the stability that we have enjoyed and need to continue to enjoy, and for the investment in innovation and education, which are the keys to the future, to flourish&mdash;we reject absolutely the policies of the nationalists.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/9">To reject the nationalists and independence, we must look at their failure to be honest about their policies, and start with just one example of their inventions and falsehoods. The SNP's whole financial policy is based on a series of errors and exaggerations. The nationalists have built their whole case on one volatile commodity&mdash;oil&mdash;but they have refused to face the facts about the real scale of revenues from the North sea. Almost every credible economist now confirms that the nationalists have got the oil price wrong, the oil production numbers wrong and Scotland's potential share of North sea oil and gas wrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.423.0/1">And, indeed, Scotstoun; perhaps my hon. Friend will forgive me if I focus on Govan for a second. Local industry there is so reliant on the massive number of jobs in the shipbuilding industry secured by the Government, that people there will want an answer to the questions my hon. Friend put. It is not good enough to be told that if they wrap themselves in the flag and say they love Scotland, everything will be fine. That is an insult to the people of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.0/2">I have been in Scotland taking part in the election campaign, and when I saw the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire here today I wondered why he has not been there doing the same. Now we know. They dare not let him. His speech was a gaffe-strewn disaster, a one-man Sheffield rally. The message has not got to him that he is not supposed to be gloating or cracking open champagne bottles before even one vote is cast. He is showing ugly arrogance taking the people of Scotland for granted, and the smirk will be wiped from his party's face when the people of Scotland go to the polls in 48 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.0/3">The mask slipped from the Scottish National party during the hon. Gentleman's speech. It has been sweetness and light during the campaign. Mr. Salmond, or ra<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" name="Alex Salmond">ther the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)</phrase>&mdash;he is standing in Gordon, he is standing in the list, and he wants to be an MP in Westminster, so I can be forgiven for forgetting what title to refer to him by from time to time&mdash;has been going around saying, &quot;Gloat, me? Smarmy, moi?&quot;&mdash;in no circumstances would such a thing cross his mind. However, today we see the true face of Scottish National party triumphalism&mdash;the utter contempt in its treatment of the people of Scotland, in presuming to know how they will cast their votes in two days' time. I sincerely hope that the hon. Gentleman will repeat his performance in Scotland, so that more people can see the ugly arrogance of a party that thinks that it has the voters in its pocket.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.0/4">In the few minutes that I have left I want to deal with key issues, and perhaps I can draw together some of the comments that have been made. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1998" name="Jimmy Hood">My hon. Friend the Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East (Mr. Hood)</phrase> set out in incontrovertible detail the point that if Scotland secedes from the United Kingdom, it leaves the EU. That is a fact. If it wants to get back into the EU it must reapply. It must join a queue, behind Turkey and other nations, and there would have to be an enlargement treaty. The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire shakes his head, but if he has any facts to disprove that, let him state them.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.0/5">However, Scotland would not only be out of the EU, with the disastrous ramifications that that would have for Scottish jobs, industry and inward investment. An independent Scotland that left the United Kingdom would also leave behind the G8, permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, and NATO. What other country is leaving NATO when others around Europe are lining up to join it? That is the vision of the SNP for Scotland: isolated, irrelevant and defenceless. It is not my vision for Scotland, and it is not Labour's.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.0/6">We have today seen the duplicitous way in which the SNP turns every criticism of it into criticism of Scotland. I am not here to criticise Scotland, but to criticise the SNP and its ruinous vision for Scotland, which would destroy jobs and put our monetary policy in the hands of a foreign country, and which has no credibility in fiscal policy. Our vision is of a Scotland that will, within a dozen years, have the best education system in the world, because in the knowledge-based economy of the 21st century the investment that we put into people by way of education, skills, learning and training will bring us to pre-eminence. <i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire is now chuntering away from a sedentary position. We are now fourth best in the world; we are in striking distance of being the best-educated country in the world, and we have set ourselves the target of doing it in a dozen years.</p>
	<p pid="a.423.0/7">We will achieve that under Labour, but if we spend the next three years in turmoil and instability, telling any potential investors, &quot;Do not come to Scotland, because we do not know what our currency will be, whether we will be in the EU or what our monetary or fiscal framework will be,&quot; how on earth will we attract the brightest and best to come and stay in Scotland? How can we continue to reverse the brain drain, as we are now doing? Just last week, we learned that the population of Scotland has increased for the fourth year in a row. That is a tribute to the success of the Labour-led Scottish Executive, and I am convinced that people will see that and vote for education and not separation on Thursday.</p>

	<p pid="a.429.0/1">Before I respond to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the points made by the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase>, may I regretfully announce that another soldier has died in Iraq since the Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" name="Adam Ingram">my right hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram)</phrase> and I addressed the House last Thursday? On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-29">29 April</phrase>, Rifleman Paul Donnachie of the 2nd Battalion, The Rifles was killed by small-arms fire in Basra. I am sure that the hon. Lady will join me in sending our sympathies and condolences to his family and friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing this debate on what she rightly says is an important subject, on which she has a great deal of knowledge, and as we heard last week, she gives a considered speech on the issues about which she feels passionate. I hope to respond to a number of those issues today, as well as to set out the wider context of the equipment programme and the operational direction of our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/3">I am sure that hon. Members will join me and the hon. Lady in paying tribute to our armed forces for the courage and professionalism that they show&mdash;day in, day out&mdash; in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere. I welcome the opportunity to debate the direction in which we are taking our forces. The Government have a very clear vision for ensuring that we deal with today's operational requirements and prepare for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/4">It is important to set out the context of two of our current operations&mdash;those in Iraq and Afghanistan&mdash;by talking about the challenges we face today. In both those places, our service personnel are performing outstandingly in the most difficult of conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/5">Our forces remain in Iraq under the authority of UN Security Council resolution 1723, as part of a 26-nation coalition and at the request of the democratically-elected Government of Iraq. The situation remains difficult&mdash;we understand the issues and challenges that we face. The hon. Lady talked about the serious insurgency that is taking place, although it is lesser in Basra than in Baghdad. It is worth stating that, although the current level of violence in Baghdad and surrounding provinces is of grave concern, the security picture elsewhere in Iraq is not as bleak, with the majority of attacks&mdash;about 80 per cent.&mdash;confined to four of the 18 provinces.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/6">Much progress has been made by our armed forces, working in partnership in Iraq. A new Iraqi Government and an ambitious programme of security sector reform is resulting in Iraqi forces increasingly taking the lead, with the handover of four provinces to Iraqi security control, most recently Maysan on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-18">18 April</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/7">Our commitment to Iraq is long term, and our goal remains an Iraq that can govern itself, with a functioning economy and capable security forces. Our forces will remain to provide support and training even after we have handed over security responsibility for all the provinces in the south-east, which we hope to do later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/8">I shall touch on Afghanistan before responding to the more substantive issues raised by the hon. Lady. In Afghanistan, we are part of an international effort, backed by the UN, to support the democratically-elected Afghan Government. Afghanistan was a base for international terrorism, and we cannot let it become that again. It is in our national interest to be there.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/9">The campaign is not a traditional battle, and the hon. Lady made that point. Demonstrating progress is not as simple as being able to point to towns being liberated, ground being taken or enemy killed. Progress can be measured by milestones, such as democratic elections&mdash;there were successful ballots in 2004 and 2005&mdash;and social indicators, such as the increase in the number of girls attending school and the nearly 5 million refugees who have been able to return. When there is security, construction and development follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/10">International assistance on security, governance, development, justice and economic reform has brought about great progress. The UK has, of course, played a central role, which we are rightly proud of. However, there is more to do, particularly in the south. Achieving our objectives in Afghanistan will take time, and we are committed to the task, but we must be patient. Our mission in Bosnia, which is a relatively prosperous and developed country, has taken 15 years, and there is still more to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/11">We are under no illusions that, in both Iraq and Afghanistan, we face difficult and dangerous insurgencies. The safety of our personnel on operations is a prime concern, but there is no such thing as perfect protection. Military operations are inherently risky, and if our troops are to fulfil their mission in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, they must expose themselves to danger, precisely because of which we treat the protection of our service men and women so seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/12">We have used the urgent operational requirement process to procure a fleet of new, protected patrol vehicles to supplement the vehicles already in theatre. Mastiff, Vector and Bulldog are already on the streets, saving lives and proving hugely popular with troops. We have invested hugely in new equipment to meet the specific circumstances and evolving threats of conflicts. About &pound;6.6 billion has been provided for those theatres since 2001. That has been new money from the reserve; it has not come from the defence budget, or at the expense of spending on future needs and assets. It includes &pound;700 million spent through the UOR process on new force protection equipment for those theatres on everything from body armour to electronic countermeasures. There is a whole range of issues, and we have made progress in force protection and support in our operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/13">Those UORs complement the equipment programme, which is funded from the defence budget and is designed to deliver the long-term core capabilities that our forces need. Both the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee have acknowledged how good the UOR process is at rapidly delivering to the front line the battle-winning capability required by our armed forces. However, equipment alone is not the answer to countering insurgency. Training, tactics and procedures are also most important. They are kept under constant review by the services to evolve and to meet changing needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/14">I can reassure the hon. Lady that our service personnel in theatre are equipped and prepared for their current tasks. It is simply wrong to suggest that the Government would deploy our armed forces if they were unprepared for the threats that they might meet. We have introduced a range of new systems over the last few years that have significantly enhanced our forces' capability to conduct counter-insurgency operations, including underslung grenade launchers, head-mounted night vision equipment, new light machine guns, ballistic eye protection, and a range of other offensive and defensive systems, including armoured vehicles and the helicopter uplift.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/15">The hon. Lady spoke about equipment and support. We have delivered equipment valued at more than &pound;10 billion to the armed forces in the past few years, and we have given priority to equipping our people. My experience from when I visited Afghanistan and Iraq and talked to many hundreds of service personnel is that they believe that their personal equipment is the best that they have ever had. Equipment and equipping people properly is a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.0/16">On procurement of equipment, the defence industrial strategy sets the framework for a better relationship between the Ministry of Defence and industry. It will help to deliver the capability that our armed forces need with best value for money for taxpayers. We have successfully merged the organisations that procure and support military equipment and create defence equipment and support. That establishes a unified approach to the procurement and through-life support of equipment from the factories to the front line, thus improving capability and reducing costs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-05-01a.433.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="433"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070501/halltext/70501h0009.htm#07050143000622">
	<p pid="a.433.1/1">I am very pleased to have secured the debate, but I shall begin with some important caveats, because recent media coverage has demonstrated that the politics of parenting and of parenting and work remain highly contentious. Raising a family is one of the most important, rewarding and demanding roles that life has to offer, and raising children alone is equally challenging and even more demanding than raising children in a couple. Everything that the Government do should be geared towards helping families and supporting children. For that reason, work will not be the right answer sometimes, or it will be an answer that must wait. For all those caveats, however, poverty is one of the most damaging things that can happen to a family, and work is a central route out of poverty. The Government and employers must ensure in partnership that we strike the right balance financially, personally, socially and culturally.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/2">Taken overall, the lone parent employment rate has been a success story for this Government. It has risen by 11 percentage points in a decade, largely thanks to a voluntary and supportive approach at a time of economic growth. However, there are serious challenges ahead, and some prescriptions on offer are wrong. They must be rethought if we are to deal with the problems of London, on which I shall focus most of my comments, and the problems of the most disadvantaged groups&mdash;the groups that are furthest from the labour market&mdash;elsewhere. The practical steps that could be taken would have a positive impact, but some of them deserve greater attention than they have received to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/3">I shall concentrate on the London experience, not least because it is what I experience as a constituency MP with some of the most deprived wards in the country, despite the leafy sounding title of my constituency of Regent's Park and Kensington, North. In the ward of Westbourne, 83 per cent. of children are growing up in workless households. That is the highest percentage in the country, despite the ward being only a couple of miles from the west end, with all the opportunities that the labour market has to offer there.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/4">It is clear that the strength of London's economy has demonstrably not spread fairly and equally among all sectors of the population. Child poverty is acute in London&mdash;especially inner London&mdash;and it can largely be explained by the issue of labour market access. In London, employment for parents in all families is low compared with that for non-parents. In the rest of the UK, lone parent employment rose from 45 per cent. to 58 per cent. between 1995 and 2005. The rise that took place outside London is even more impressive than the national figures that are usually cited. In London, there was a much smaller rise from a much lower baseline&mdash;38 per cent. to 43 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/5">Children in London are more likely to live in households where no one works and less likely to live in households where someone works, compared with other regions. Indeed, disparities in employment among parents account for most of the London-UK employment gap overall, which is growing. If we take account of individual characteristics, the lone parent employment rate in London is 12 percentage points lower than the rate in other metropolitan areas&mdash;up from 10 percentage points in 1997-98. With individual characteristics accounted for, that labour market phenomenon seems to be specific to London, and the tax and benefit system is very much a part of the problem. The relatively low employment rate among lone parents in London is not a city phenomenon writ large, and it is not due to differences in characteristics, such as ethnicity, between lone parents in London and in other cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/6">Returning to the national picture, there is a differential rate of job retention between parents and non-parents. In other words, it is less a question of a lone parent finding work than of them keeping it. Despite the popular image, which the media often support, the issue is not about the beloved stereotype of the teenager having babies on their own to obtain a council flat and enjoy 20 years on benefits. Lone parents, who can be alone for any number of reasons, are just as likely to try for employment as anyone else. Job entry rates for lone parents generally have converged with those for the rest of the working-age population.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/7">The main employment problem for lone parents is that job exit rates remain much higher. They have come down a little, but they are still much higher. About 10 in every 100 employed lone parents leave a job each year, compared with about 5 per cent. in the rest of the population. The heart of the matter is that if lone parents had the same job exit rates as the rest of the population in the same way that they now have the same entry rates, the 70 per cent. lone parent employment target would have been hit by now. There is not any basis for assuming that lone parents are less likely to take up work than the population as a whole, but there is good reason to believe they have more difficulty staying in a job, which explains their relatively low employment rate compared with other groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/8">That analysis challenges one of the key elements in the recent Freud review, which suggested&mdash;among many ideas&mdash;that lone parents should be moved off income support and on to jobseeker's allowance when their youngest child turned 12. First, 69 per cent. of that group are already in work. Secondly and more importantly, the JSA regime is poorly designed for the more subtle purposes of supporting sustained employment among people facing complex barriers, providing care and support for adolescent and teenage children, and skill shortages.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/9">Another Freud proposal seems to be aimed at addressing the job retention problem, but many of us are still deeply sceptical about it. On one level, it sounds sensible to reward contractors not only for getting jobseekers over an employer's threshold for a week or so, but for keeping people in work for three years. However, the strategy would involve long-term, seven-year regional monopolies in which everyone who had been on benefit for more than one year in London, for example, would pass from Jobcentre Plus to the provider. The provider would then be paid on the basis of how many more clients went into jobs than would have done otherwise. There would be a monopoly rather than a competition, and large amounts of public cash would be determined by estimates of what might have happened in an entirely different and unpredictable set of circumstances. Among other things, it is not at all clear how one would avoid rewarding providers for what others have done: for example, lone parent rates could go up because of the availability of more subsidised child care, or because of changes to the tax credit regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/10">Given what we already know about the complex needs of lone parents in the most disadvantaged groups throughout the country and particularly in London, such an approach would be insufficiently flexible and integral. We need instead to develop devolved models that can deliver to targeted groups and respond swiftly to changing circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/11">What do we need to do? Basically, we have succeeded in improving access to jobs for lone parents, but we have failed to do enough to make employment sustainable. The strongest factor associated with job exit is low pay, especially for part-timers. Among lone parents leaving the new deal, it has been reported that 18 to 20 per cent. are back on income support within six months, 29 per cent. within a year and 40 per cent. within two and a half years.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/12">The reason for the phenomenon is that compared with other regions, simply living in London reduces the chances of job entry for lone parents independently of other factors, and it slightly increases the chances of job exit. The phenomenon implies that, by London standards, part-time work is particularly low paid and keeps the entry rate down. The impact on job entry is compounded by higher living costs in London and the tax and benefit system.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/13">If we assume, as it is surely reasonable to do so, that the gain from work has to be higher in London to compensate for higher prices, parents will need a higher income to be as well off as parents elsewhere. However, increased hourly earnings do not translate into higher incomes, because there are withdrawal rates for benefits and tax credits. To be as well off in real terms as lone parents in lower cost areas, lone parents in London must earn a great deal more. If the difference in living costs is 10 per cent., earnings need to be 33 per cent. higher&mdash;even without taking housing benefit into consideration. When housing benefit is factored in, the situation obviously becomes even more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/14">Something needs to be done to equalise work incentives in London and elsewhere. In the past year or so, the Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions have recognised the requirement in principle, and the in-work credit for London was increased to &pound;60 in the recent Budget. That is great news, but it is demonstrably insufficient to bridge the gap that we have identified. I am not being in any way ungrateful, because the recognition in principle is a good step, but it must be regarded as one among many. We need to ensure that the tax and benefit system does not continue to freeze people&mdash;particularly those who do entry-level work&mdash;out of the job market.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/15">We also need more specific measures to accommodate specific challenges; I know that my hon. Friend the Minister is aware of my views on that. I put in a further plea for extending measures to boost work incentives among such vulnerable groups as homeless families in temporary accommodation. I am very aware of the &quot;Working Futures&quot; model in Newham, and it is a sensible one. It treats the higher rents for families in temporary accommodation through block grants, as if they were paying a comparable rent in social rented housing, and thereby removes the benefits trap that catches people in high-rent accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/16">Given that there are 3,000 households, many of them lone parent households, in temporary accommodation in my borough, and that research demonstrates that unemployment is at 90 per cent. among families in temporary accommodation&mdash;compared with 60 per cent. among social housing tenants as a whole&mdash;the case is made to extend &quot;Working Futures&quot; swiftly and extensively across the whole capital for households in temporary accommodation. I am completely baffled why&mdash;I see no sensible argument for it&mdash;we should run merely one very small pilot in one low-cost area of London and wait for two years to evaluate the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/17">We also need to consider how to boost part-time work opportunities at reasonable pay rates in London. Of course, our ability to influence that in the private sector is limited, but we do nothing like enough to examine job opportunities in the public sector, particularly in respect of contracted services, which provide us with a useful opportunity. In that context, we need to consider again the implications of the Gershon review and the movement of public sector jobs out of London. A recent story, linked not to Gershon but to some of the year-end pressures on the health service, revealed that part-time jobs in health care had taken the brunt of job losses in the health service. That is exactly the kind of thing that has a differential impact, particularly on lone parents and particularly on lone parents in London; they need such jobs to have any real prospect of entering and staying in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/18">Despite the achievements in improving employment rates for lone parents across the UK as a whole, there are still serious problems in London and in job retention rates generally. There are well documented examples of discrimination against parents in the work force generally. The recent report by the Equal Opportunities Commission demonstrated the impact of such discrimination. The situation demands yet more action from the Government and employers in getting real about the importance of the work-life balance and developing family-friendly employment policies. It is no one's interests&mdash;not those of employers, taxpayers or the Government&mdash;to trap hundreds of thousands of people out of sustainable employment, with all the social and economic costs that such unemployment puts on the state. If further changes were made to make employment family-friendly, we would be able to draw such people back into employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/19">As was devastatingly demonstrated in the Joseph Rowntree Foundation report released yesterday, there is plentiful evidence of discrimination against particular groups of black and minority ethnic communities. Bangladeshis were found by the report to be most discriminated against in employment terms and most likely to be trapped in poverty. It is reasonable to say that Bangladeshi women and Muslim women generally most need targeted support to help them come back into sustained employment. The work done by Jobcentre Plus and the contracted providers needs to continue to bear down on those hard-to-reach groups, and we need to continue to bear down on the discriminatory practices that lock people out of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/20">Fundamentally, the issue for lone parents is one of making work pay, and that applies in London more than elsewhere. Without sustainable job opportunities, we have no chance of making inroads into London's deplorable levels of child poverty, and without improvements in London, we cannot hit the target for the country as a whole. There have been real achievements country-wide and recognition of the special factors in London. However, I am afraid that, on the evidence so far, there is no sign of policies likely to lead to the breakthrough that we require.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.1/21">The Government have a target of halving the rate of child poverty that they inherited by 2010, but we are simply not going to reach it unless we build on what we have achieved and take further radical steps&mdash;some small and modest such as &quot;Working Futures&quot;; others more radical such as changes to the tax and benefit system&mdash;to raise those employment rates.</p>

	<p pid="a.437.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on securing this important debate. Her work on the London Child Poverty Commission means that she has a particular insight into the challenges facing families on low incomes. She has amply demonstrated that in how she has spoken this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/2">The report that my hon. Friend helped to launch in February stressed, among other things, the importance of increasing employment among parents on lower incomes as one of the essential measures for reducing child poverty in London. She raised important points about job retention among lone parents who have moved into employment and, rightly, she focused on the issue of the relative disadvantage in London in terms of costs and earnings. She also raised her concerns about the extent of the &quot;Working Futures&quot; pilot, on which she and I have already corresponded.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/3">I particularly want to reassure my hon. Friend that when we consider broader issues of labour market reform and further steps in reforming the welfare system, we Ministers at the Department for Work and Pensions are fully apprised of the specific set of factors that bear on London. I assure her that we have clearly identified the London-specific issues that we must consider. If we are to succeed in meeting our child poverty reduction targets, as my hon. Friend wants us to, we have to think specifically about certain things that need to happen in the capital, where the problems are tough. We are very focused on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/4">We all know that children in lone-parent households are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as those in couple households, and that they make up 40 per cent. of all children living in poverty. The best way to tackle that is to support lone parents into work, which we do through work-focused interviews and the new deal for lone parents, which has already helped more than 482,000 lone parents into work, including more than 55,000 lone parents in London. Furthermore, the vast majority of those who have gone through the new deal for lone parents and into work have moved into sustainable employment. None the less, we are realistic about the challenges that lone parents face in getting back to work&mdash;and, as my hon. Friend says, in staying in work once they get it. We know that those challenges can be even greater in London, given that, as she rightly pointed out, housing and living costs are higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/5">The present set-up means that many lone parents can exist on benefits for many years without any experience of being in work or developing any of the new skills that they will require when they return to work. That makes it hard for them to compete for jobs and may mean that some of those who enter jobs do not have the skills base to sustain employment once they have made that move.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/6">The UK is out of step with many other countries in what we expect of lone parents who claim benefits when they have older children. That is why we will consider whether a switch to jobseeker's allowance for that group, with its increased focus on looking for work, will improve the chances of their getting back to work and of that work being sustainable. My hon. Friend mentioned the Freud report. Let me reassure her: Freud has suggested we ask lone parents to start looking for work when their youngest child is 12. We are considering that recommendation and will report our conclusions in the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/7">As my hon. Friend said, we have achieved a good deal so far. Ten years ago, more than 1 million lone parents nationally and around 190,000 in London were on benefit. Those figures are now down by 230,000 nationally and by more than 27,000 in the capital. Fewer than 700,000 lone parents nationally were in work 10 years ago; now more than 1 million are. In London, fewer than 85,000 lone parents were in work 10 years ago and now nearly 130,000 are.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/8">The national employment rate among lone parents 10 years ago was about 45 per cent. It is now about 56 per cent. In London, that employment rate has risen from a much lower base&mdash;about 37 per cent.&mdash;to about 45 per cent. There is still a considerable gap between the rate of improvement in the country as a whole and that in London. That is why we have to address specific policy challenges in the capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/9">Overall, there has been an achievement. However, we aim to increase the lone parent employment rate to 70 per cent. by 2010 and to do that we would need about 300,000 more lone parents in work across the country. We can do that only by helping to create conditions which make work pay, make it possible to attain and make it easier to sustain. We are rolling out more work-focused interviews for lone parents, which will give them the chance to talk to experienced advisers about the problems they face in getting back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/10">No parent is going to work if they are not certain that their child or children are in safe care. That is why Freud&mdash;and Lisa Harker in her report&mdash;highlighted the importance of wraparound child care provision. That is one of the most significant concerns for all working parents and it is raised continually with us by lone parents when we discuss what else needs to happen to reduce further the barriers to employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/11">By 2010, there will be a Sure Start children's centre for every community&mdash;3,500 in total. For parents with older children, we have the extended schools programme, which by 2010 will be available from 8 am to 6 pm throughout the year, including school holiday periods. We are also making work a more realistic financial option. From April last year, we increased to 80 per cent. the proportion we pay towards child care costs for parents on a low income That increases child care affordability for vulnerable groups, particularly lone parents. Support is available to meet the costs of child care at rates of &pound;87 a week for one child and &pound;150 a week for two children or more.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/12">We have recently announced the continuation of in work credit, which helps eligible lone parents to leave benefits for employment with the payment of an extra &pound;40 a week for a year. More than 40,000 people have already taken up the in work credit, including more than 12,500 in London. We are also rolling out our pathways to work programme across the country to give even more help to those on incapacity benefit&mdash;like lone parents, that group was not given the help that it needed in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/13">London has particular issues that need to be addressed and we have already begun to do that. The new deal for lone parents has helped more than 55,000 lone parents in London into work. In April 2004, employment zones for lone parents were introduced in Haringey, Newham, Brent, Southwark and Tower Hamlets. They have helped 3,300 lone parents in those boroughs back into work. However, as my hon. Friend says, there is still a great deal more to do. We will roll out the new deal plus for lone parents to all London districts by April 2008. That will test whether a package of measures combining good, affordable child care availability with a work focus and a strong financial incentive, like the in work credit, will move lone parents closer to the labour market and into work.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/14">From July, we will increase the in work credit payment in London to &pound;60 a week when lone parents leave benefits for employment, as my hon. Friend has mentioned. The Government will also contribute &pound;11 million in funding to the child care affordability pilot to offer 10,000 new child care places across the city. The pilot is the largest region-specific initiative for a subsidised child care programme of its kind in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/15">In addition, London is benefiting from our city strategy of investing more in deprived areas to tackle worklessness and child poverty. I hope I can demonstrate to my hon. Friend that we agree with her about the challenges in London, particularly in some&mdash;albeit not necessarily all&mdash;of the boroughs. Those challenges include the cost of housing and living, and issues to do with skills and child care. We can see from the Department's analysis of all aspects of the London labour market that London has distinct characteristics. We understand that that means that reforms designed for national application will not necessarily have the same bite or impact in the capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/16">As we work through our assessment of the circumstances that pertain in the capital, we will take on board many of my hon. Friend's points, which will inform our thinking on how we can go forward through our policies in London. We have seen the report that she helped to publicise in February, which raised many of the same points. The recent reports from Freud and Lisa Harker have also highlighted London-specific issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.0/17">I hope that I have reassured my hon. Friend that the important issues that she has identified about London are on the Department's agenda. The work that we are doing to reform welfare and the labour market needs to be combined with policies to ensure that we continue to have a strong economy, which will be important for the capital as well as the rest of the country, so that they result the continued creation of more employment opportunities for lone parents, more children being lifted out of poverty, and a prospect of ensuring that the cycle of deprivation that runs through generations is not extended any further than it has to be in London and the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.441.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate a crucial issue for Leeds, West Yorkshire and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/2">A stark fact, which we are not at all happy about, is that Leeds is the only major city in this country without a dedicated children's hospital. The experts have said for 18 years that we need one; leading consultants have made the case for 15 years, and parents have campaigned relentlessly in recent years. The city and its people want to change the situation and the campaign for a new hospital has the support of all Leeds and regional MPs, the city council and councillors of all parties. Yet, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-17">17 March</phrase> this year, the parents and children of Leeds received a terrible blow. The development of the dedicated children's and maternity hospital for which they had campaigned so hard only a few years before was to be shelved, possibly indefinitely.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/3">The Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust's official statement confirmed that plans for the hospital will be severely delayed, blaming a lack of money, as well as the rising costs of the project. The trust stated that the project's affordability had not been proven, and that it felt that it would be unable to make the required repayments for the hospital under the proposed private finance initiative scheme. As the news reverberated around the community, it confirmed many people's fears that the appalling NHS situation in Leeds has had a devastating impact on health services and has led to the hospital being cancelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/4">Geoff Stagg, father of 14-year-old brain cancer sufferer Craig and campaigner for the new hospital, summed it up:</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I feel totally let down. We thought the hard work was over in getting the Government to agree&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/6">to the hospital;</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/7" class="indent">&quot;to be told now that there's no money for it is a huge blow&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/8">The Leeds children's and maternity hospital was due to open its doors in 2012, as a dedicated state-of-the-art, 370-bed facility for treating children and providing maternity care. It would have centralised services for children that are currently provided predominantly by two sites, as well as others, across the city. It was also due to include one of only three children's liver units in the country and to become the biggest centre for transplants in England. Now it is unclear when&mdash;or, crucially, if&mdash;the facility will open, and children in Leeds and the wider area are left without the dedicated facility that they so urgently require.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/9">Three years ago, the go-ahead for the hospital was finally granted, marking the culmination of a long and hard-fought campaign, led since 2002 by parents Jonathan Abbott and Carol and Dean Maddocks after they witnessed the conditions in which the dedicated and excellent staff on ward 10 of St. James's university hospital in Leeds were forced to treat young children. Jonathan Abbott has described the crowds of ill, grey adults standing around the entrance of the hospital smoking, as he wheeled in his young son Josh, who suffered from a rare form of cancer, and the complete absence of privacy on the ward. At the end of Josh's treatment, he removed his son from the ward, so that he could die in a place where he felt comfortable.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/10">Carol Maddocks talks of similar problems when her daughter, Alice, was being treated in 2002 for aplastic anaemia, now thankfully in remission. Carol's memories of that time are of cramped conditions and of having to take Alice, already suffering from the after-effects of her treatment, on long and draining journeys across Leeds between St. James's and the Leeds general infirmary, so that her treatment could continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/11">Jonathan Abbott and Carol Maddocks made a promise that they would not let other children go through what their children had experienced. With Carol's husband, Dean, they launched the campaign to improve children's facilities in Leeds. Their campaign was taken up by other parents and local organisations, such as Candlelighters, which does so much for children with cancer in Leeds. Politically, it gained the full support of Leeds MPs and Leeds city council. It was backed by the <i>Yorkshire Post</i>, the <i>Yorkshire Evening Post</i> and other local media and, most importantly, received huge support from members of the local community, 3,000 of whom signed a petition.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/12">Despite what has happened, I must take this opportunity to praise Carol, Dean, Jonathan and all the extraordinary people who led that successful campaign and inspired Leeds and its citizens to stand up for our children. It was a remarkable campaign, and on <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-27">27 July 2004</phrase>, it finally reached a conclusion when the former Health Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, gave the green light for funding for a new dedicated children's and maternity hospital in Leeds. The decision was greeted with joy throughout the city. Trust executives issued a statement heralding the development as vital to providing children across Yorkshire with the care that they need. Neil McKay, chief executive of the trust at the time, called it &quot;fantastic news&quot;. It is not surprising that Jonathan Abbott, Carol and Dean Maddocks and everyone else who fought so hard have been utterly shattered by the news that the children's hospital will not be going ahead as promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/13">Why, with all that support and political will, has the project been shelved? According to the trust, the major reason for the delay in the development of the hospital, which was due to commence at the site of St. James's university hospital, is the trust's current and projected debt. The trust also says that the projected costs have spiralled from &pound;230 million to &pound;650 million&mdash;an almost threefold increase. It is unclear why costs have risen so dramatically. However, when questioned, sources at the trust have pointed to a need to refurbish existing adult facilities, a need for new facilities not included in the original plans, such as a car park, and the fact that the required contingency fund for the hospital has risen to &pound;213 million&mdash;almost the entire cost of the original plan. That raises questions about the suitability of the original plans. Jonathan Abbott has questioned why there was a three-year consultation period costing an unknown sum if the plans were simply to be shelved. There have also been suggestions that the trust has proposed a top-of-the-range option, including the car park and rebuilt trust headquarters. The matter must be clarified as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/14">How did the trust suddenly arrive at the hugely inflated figure of &pound;650 million? Is it indeed the most expensive option and, if so, can less costly options be brought back to the table that would still deliver the necessary fundamental change in care? But the key question for the Minister and her colleagues to investigate and answer as a matter of urgency is why there is such a significant difference between the figures presented originally, which were current until a few months ago, and the costs now being presented by the trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/15">How the decision was taken and announced has also caused an uproar. Very senior medical representatives were not told until after the news leaked out, and campaigners found out from newspapers. It was described by Dr. Richard Vautrey, medical secretary of the Leeds local medical committee, as</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/16" class="indent">&quot;a bolt from the blue&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.441.1/17">Our serious concern is that the decision was taken by an interim chief executive in an informal meeting and without consulting the senior medical professionals in charge of delivering children's and maternity services, never mind general practitioners, campaigners, parents and the wider community. That is not an acceptable way to run the NHS. I ask the Minister to investigate how the decision was taken, why it was taken and how it was communicated.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.0/1">As I was saying, I would have expected the strategic health authority to be informed before any announcement was made regarding the bid and the Department of Health to be notified. It is unfortunate that that was not done, but the strategic health authority and the Department of Health are now helping to make sure that we get the figures right. The officials in the Department and the strategic health authority are playing a constructive role, which is a world away from the very party political basis of some campaign literature issued during the local elections. In the &quot;Focus&quot; leaflet to which I have referred and, I understand, in other leaflets and letters the headline has been that the Labour Government are axing plans. That is a complete misrepresentation and is disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/2">Children's services in hospitals and in communities are a major priority for us. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase>, the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh, announced a consultation on the future of payment by results. That will look at the future financing of specialised services, including children's services, under payment by results. That is important because it will set out what currently happens, but also seek to ensure that services that are so important to children and their families, and to clinicians who provide their expertise and devotion, are rewarded fairly. The consultation will also set out future options to ensure sustainability. As well as having buildings, it is important that there is the finance and throughput to ensure that services can be developed and invested in.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.0/3">The consultation will touch directly on services such as those that Leeds aspires to provide through a dedicated children's and maternity hospital. We want to look at how that aspiration can be converted into reality for the children and parents of Leeds and west Yorkshire. With our colleagues at the strategic health authority, we will look at some of the figures that the trust has identified to determine how realistic they are. We will identify ways in which we can be clear about what are extra costs and what can be dealt with in other ways.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.1/1">Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that the only way to get a children's hospital in Leeds is to stop trying to use the issue to score party political points? Opposition parties in Leeds should refrain from doing that and work together with the rest of us to achieve that goal.</p>
