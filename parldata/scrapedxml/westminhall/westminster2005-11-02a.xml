	<p pid="a.261.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. To channel anger at the situation at the PCT, however, is useless. As hon. Members will be aware, PCTs are not elected. They are wholly appointed bodies, and therefore the public cannot lay a finger on them. So much for the Government's commitment to accountability in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/2">People therefore turn their anger on the Government. What do Ministers do when the body that they appointed to run local health care runs up debts of millions and threatens the future of local hospitals? They throw up their hands and say, &quot;Nothing to do with us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/3">The Prime Minister said in response to a question from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>:</p>

	<p pid="a.261.0/5">The Government were careful to ensure that just one line in the entire &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power within the NHS&quot; document referred to PCT accountability. That line was vital, however. It reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/6" class="indent">&quot;PCTs will be accountable to the Secretary of State through the Strategic Health Authority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/7">That is indeed the case. National Government policy dictates how much money the PCT has and directs how that money is spent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.261.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="261"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.261.2/1">My hon. Friend makes several excellent points. The closure of beds and services at community hospitals will impact on ambulance services, which tend to be overstretched and unable to meet their targets, particularly in rural areas. That will lead to an increase in the inequity of health care in rural areas, where, as we know, the further someone lives from services, the less likely they are to use them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/2">A Government who are committed to equity should seek to ensure that not only people in cities but those in rural areas can access services. They must also ensure that savings in one area do not lead to increased costs in another. For example, the chief executive and chairman of the Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS trust told me that its bed occupancy is currently running at more than 100 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/3">That is the backdrop in the acute sector at a time when hospital beds in Hornsea are closing. Elderly patients in Hornsea are now being turned away from beds there because the number of available spaces has been reduced from 22 to 12.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/4">We do not dispute that the NHS has extra resources. In the unreformed NHS, however, each and every PCT is having to face the fact that many Government initiatives have proved to be more expensive than forecast. Central targets for waiting time limits and GP out-of-hours arrangements are disastrous; dentists earn &pound;250,000 a year on the NHS while patients, including many in my constituency, are denied care; and there are difficulties in implementing the new GP contract. All the initiatives have taken their toll. The new centrally negotiated GP contract has been remarkable in its impact&mdash;GPs have received huge pay rises for doing much less&mdash;but it has had too little attention. PCTs are reeling under the impact, but the Government say that it is nothing to do with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> questioned Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-13">13 November 2001</phrase> in a Westminster Hall debate on Skegness and District hospital. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/6" class="indent">&quot;if the proposed primary care trusts ran short of money, an obvious saving could be made by shutting a ward and using fewer beds. What safeguards will the Government put in place to ensure that that will not happen?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2001-11-13.236"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 13 November 2001; Vol. 374, c. 236WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/7">He did not receive an answer from the Minister, but sadly we now know the answer&mdash;no safeguards and &quot;Nothing to do with us.&quot; That is where the real anger lies. The proposals for Hornsea, Withernsea and countless other places are based not on clinical grounds but are the result of the PCT losing control of its finances.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/8">When defending cuts to local services, the Government point out that PCTs are spending the money as they see fit to meet for local needs. Indeed, another Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, is on record as saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/9" class="indent">&quot;local health care professionals have very properly surveyed the health needs of the local population, and have come to a set of recommendations, or provisional conclusions, about how to invest the resources with which they have been entrusted&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2005-06-22.265"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 22 June 2005; Vol. 435, c. 265WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/10">My response to that claim is, first, that local health managers are not enjoying the review process and the anxiety that it is causing residents and staff. They did not enter the profession in order to shut wards and close beds. They have been forced into that predicament by the Stalinist nature of Whitehall management. Secondly, a casual delving into the geographical and social character of my area will show that the PCT cannot possibly be looking out for the health needs of the local population. Instead, it is following the ever-changing edicts of a Government who still claim that is nothing to do with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/11">The Government are keen to triumph with positive headlines for the NHS. When things go wrong, however, they tend to shrug off responsibility and lay the blame at someone else's door. That must not be allowed to continue. Ministers must start to find answers to this growing crisis. They should use the primary care consultation now being conducted; they should use the forthcoming White Paper; and they should use the desire to be Prime Minister of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/12">Whatever it takes, Ministers need to save our community hospitals. If they do not, a growing number of people will not forgive their attitude of, &quot;Nothing to do with us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/13">Mr. Roger Gale (in the Chair): Many Members have indicated that they wish to speak, and one or two others who have not done so are rising. We have slightly fewer than 45 minutes before I start calling the Front Bench spokesmen at 10.30 am. I therefore urge hon. Members to be relatively brief.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on his choice of subject and the way in which he delivered his speech. What he said touched a chord in many of us. The fact that so many hon. Members are present listening to the debate and hoping to take part shows how important a subject it is. I am delighted that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State, is here.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/2">I want to be fair to the Government at the beginning of my remarks, as it is not clear to me from the debate that anyone else will be. They have put resources into the NHS, and I welcome that. There have also been improvements in the quality of the care received by our constituents. Indeed, I shall shortly be opening a new nursing home on the site of Andover hospital, jointly funded by the NHS trust and Hampshire county council. We can debate elsewhere whether the improvement in care has been commensurate with the increase in cash. We can also debate whether the increase has been fairly spread throughout England. I shall mention that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">In addition to being fair, I want to be realistic. I recognise the case for change in the buildings that the NHS uses. Patterns of treatment change, lengths of stay reduce and medical science advances and becomes more specialised. Critical mass is needed for a district general hospital; there cannot be one in every town. New guidelines on safety indicate what operations can take place where. Old buildings are, of course, expensive to run, and more care can be provided at home. Therefore, the NHS needs to be responsive to the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/4">Against that background, my local trust produced a consultation document on the future of my local community hospital in Andover. That should have been an opportunity to discuss how the extra cash that is going into the NHS might be used to expand and to improve the services in a fast-growing town. Andover War Memorial hospital, as the name implies, was built by public subscription after the first world war when Andover was a fraction of its present size. It is a much loved institution with dedicated staff, but parts of the building are now seriously substandard. It provides a portfolio of services&mdash;minor injuries, maternity, out-patients, therapy and diagnostics&mdash;but for anything more serious one has to go to Winchester. Some 67,000 people look to Andover for hospital services, and that number is about to go up.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/5">The people of Andover and I would like the consultation exercise to result in the provision of a wider range of high-quality services in a modern building, reducing the need to travel to Winchester. I echo the point that was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>. The problem with dependency on Winchester is that there is no direct train service, the bus service is infrequent and the journey lengthy, and there is nowhere to park. As Andover overtakes Winchester in population size, we see the review as an opportunity to move the centre of gravity of NHS service provision closer to the population that it serves.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/6">We are not after a new district general hospital. we just seek improved and rebalanced terms of trade. However, there is deep concern in the town that we will not get that. People suspect that the consultation exercise is driven as much by the need to save money as by the need to improve care. The document says:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/7" class="indent">&quot;we need to make . . .changes to ensure it remains . . . affordable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/8">As a result, there is a lively and broad-based campaign to fight for the hospital, led by Derek Robinson. The local paper, the <i>Andover Advertiser&mdash;</i>I mention it in the hope that it will mention me&mdash;has given extensive coverage to the debate. Public meetings have been packed.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/9">There is reason for that concern. The annual report of my primary care trust, which arrived yesterday, says that to balance the books in the current year, it has to save over &pound;11 million. Last year, it ended up owing &pound;17.5 million while being owed &pound;4.5 million. The financial position of what is called the health economy in Hampshire is deeply serious. The fear is that there will be no resources to modernise Andover hospital and that, in order to cut costs, more services will migrate to Winchester. At the heart of the issue is the formula for distributing the cash. I hope that the Minister will say that she is able to review that formula. Hampshire gets about 80 per cent. of the England average, and with that we cannot provide the quality of care to which people are entitled. Therefore, we have financial recovery plan following financial recovery plan. We have now been told to rub out the deficit in the current year. In Andover, we are ambitious but realistic. We want a fair outcome from the consultation exercise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness does from his.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/10">I want to end by raising a key issue that is not unique to Andover, and which could affect every constituency with a community hospital that needs renovation. I refer to a policy that is wholly indefensible, and which the Minister can and should change today. Part of the site of Andover hospital is to be sold. I have no philosophical difficulty with that if all the new services that we need can be provided on a smaller footprint, and the capital receipts from the disposal can fund them. The land is to be sold in two years' time for &pound;1.5 million&mdash;the estimated best price in the open market. However, that is less than the book value, which district valuers have assessed at &pound;4.2 million. I do not know how they arrived at that figure; I should have thought that a building providing health services at nil cost had a negative value.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/11">At this point in the dialogue, an uninvited guest arrives, namely the Treasury. The Treasury has spotted the gap between the open market value and the book value and has demanded what it is pleased to call an estate impairment charge. It is not even prepared to wait until 2007 to get its pound of flesh. Over &pound;500,000 is being added to this year's deficit for the alleged injury being done to the NHS estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/12">That is Treasury theology taken to an absurd degree. That tax on disposal is a major disincentive to rationalisation and is going to lead to a reduction in services in the current year. I have pursued the matter twice with Ministers, and their replies are straight from &quot;Yes Minister&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Impairment charges to the revenue account are in many respects analogous to depreciation charges and . . . measure the consumption by an entity of its economic resources.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/14">They continue:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/15" class="indent">&quot;A fall in value does not represent any error or over-estimation of the initial valuation, but rather the difference in economic value between a productive asset employed in delivering healthcare and one in which its value is merely the potential to realise sale proceeds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/16">The Government have recognised that that is nonsense, because they have set up a separate fund to compensate the trusts that have to pay the charge. Sadly, the Treasury has got at that fund, too, and it meets only part of the cost, leaving a &pound;500,000 shortfall this year in Andover.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/17">Let us sweep away this nonsense. If land and buildings are surplus, they should be sold at best value, but let us not accentuate a bad problem by allowing that absurd theology to add to the burdens of heavily indebted trusts. If nothing else happens this morning, let the Minister at least recognise that absurdity.</p>

In essence, the Government are saying that that the problems in community hospitals are caused by the second type of inequality; that differing local priorities or poor financial management are the culprits. I contend that the problem is the first type of inequality, in that PCTs in certain parts of the country do not receive the amount that they need to deliver expected levels of health care because of fundamental flaws in the weighting formula that allocates funds to different areas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.271.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" speakername="Jeremy Hunt" colnum="271"  time="010:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.271.4/1">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. Let me explain why I believe there to be a problem in the weighting formula. Guildford and Waverley PCT serves one of the most affluent parts of the country, and I fully accept that people there are relatively healthier, but against that must be weighed the fact that it is one of the most expensive areas of the country in which to deliver health care and it also has a much higher proportion of elderly people.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/2">Guildford and Waverley PCT has received generous increases in spending. The spending for our area increased by 9 per cent. last year, and is due to increase by 8 per cent. this year&mdash;increases of &pound;18 million and &pound;19 million respectively. Despite that, it is in crisis. Cranleigh hospital, which is the community hospital in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase>, faces closure. The number of beds is being cut back in Haslemere and Farnham community hospitals. A specialist rehabilitation centre, Milford, which has an enormously long track record of helping elderly people from the area make a complete recovery after strokes, also faces closure. The PCT is currently closing one-third of the community beds as an emergency measure, despite the fact that that flies in the face of the agreed local NHS strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/3">What is going wrong? The PCT has apparently been overspending and it is being asked to reign in that spending. However, considering the funding allocations, it is spending 9 per cent. less than the national average, despite the higher cost of delivering health care in the area, but the funding formula after the weighting states that it is still spending too much. This year it is spending &pound;16.3 million more than it should be, but the weighting formula states that it should be spending 17 per cent. less than the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/4">Let us be clear: according to the formula, the Department of Health expects one of the most expensive areas of the country for delivering health care, with a much higher proportion of elderly people than average, to deliver that health care spending about a fifth less money than the national average per head. Why is that? It is simply because the weighting formula states that people in the Guildford and Waverley PCT area are healthier than those in other parts of the country and therefore it needs less money.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/5">However, the effect of such a huge disparity in funding is not to decrease health inequalities but to increase them. For example, waiting times for ENT surgery is up to 13 weeks in Manchester but up to 26 weeks in Surrey; people have to wait up to 15 weeks for breast surgery in Leicester but up to 24 weeks in Surrey; for trauma and orthopaedics in Sedgefield, to take a random example, people have to wait up to 13 weeks, but in Surrey they have to wait up to 36 weeks. In trying to eradicate health inequalities, the weighting formula needs to consider not only health outcomes, such as mortality rates, but access to health care. If it focuses only on health outcomes it ends up creating equality, but by punishing the most vulnerable people who happen to live in more prosperous areas by making it massively harder for them to access health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/6">I say to the Minister that it is very easy to look at areas such as Surrey and paint them in one's mind as a uniformly prosperous place, but nothing could be further from the truth. Although the proportion of socially deprived people in such areas may be lower, those that are disadvantaged are often far more vulnerable than those in areas with widespread deprivation because they do not have access to many of the grants and funds targeted at more deprived areas. When waiting times are increased and access to community beds is decreased, wherever it is, the people who suffer the most are those who have the least and they are the ones who will suffer if the funding formula is not changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/7">The Minister and I both support a well-funded and fair health service, and in that spirit I ask her to recognise that many of the problems we are discussing are caused by a flaw in how funds are allocated. Of course, we need to take account of social deprivation, but we also need to take proper account of the cost of delivering health care and to promote fairness in access to health services. Sometimes mathematical formulae are designed to balance conflicting objectives fairly but they can also have perverse consequences, which is what is happening now.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.0/1">In the few moments left I want to congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on securing this important debate. The number of hon. Members who have wanted to take part in it shows the importance of the issue. However, the resignation of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase> will take this debate off the front pages tomorrow if the information from my pager is correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/2">I will mention just two anecdotal situations in my constituency in order to give my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> a few moments to expand on the subject. First, the hospital in Malmesbury is under great threat. Several wards have already been closed; the maternity unit has been closed; the X-ray unit is being removed despite the fact that the friends of Malmesbury hospital paid for it in the first place. It appears that Malmesbury hospital will be closed; consultations are being taken on the matter but the likelihood is that anything that looks vaguely like a hospital will be closed. Why is that?</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/3">I had a most interesting experience in the summer when I visited something called the Avon, Gloucester and Wiltshire strategic health authority. It is unclear to me what a strategic health authority is. I said to the chief executive, &quot;What is it? What do you do?&quot; and he said, &quot;Well, we are strategic,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, I'm glad about that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/4">In Wiltshire, the PCTs, and the primary care groups before them that were broken up from the Wiltshire health authority, are being brought back together in something that looks much like the old Wiltshire health authority. What do we have on top of that? We have Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority, which I went to see. It has a huge office in my constituency with a car park jam-full of BMWs. I asked the chief executive, &quot;Why are you closing our hospitals and cutting our services?&quot; and he said, &quot;Oh, that is all to do with this, that and the other.&quot; I said, &quot;I'll tell you what it's got to do with: it's to do with the fact that you're employing all these fellows here in their BMWs. I'll tell you what to do: sell this great huge building in the middle of Chippenham, fire all these fellows, close down the strategic health authority and get back to the old Wiltshire health authority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/5">What we are seeing&mdash;we have heard about this from my colleagues across the patch this morning&mdash;is deep, damaging, hated cuts in NHS front-line services, and their replacement by bureaucracy and management. I say to the Minister: cut all that nonsense and spend the money&mdash;she must spend the money&mdash;on front-line services.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.2/1">I am sure that the hon. Lady is correct. Indeed, we have heard many examples where it was local subscription that enabled a hospital to be built. In the case of Tetbury hospital in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, which I visited recently, the local community is the source of the hospital and runs it, as far as I understand. Very often these community hospitals have benefited hugely from popular local support.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/2">I saw the Secretary of State for Health on Saturday night in Birmingham, listening intently to what people were saying. If they were telling her that they want to keep their community hospitals, I wonder what her reply was. It is one of those consultations where one wonders how much is just for show and how much difference it will make. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> cited the example of Surbiton hospital, which is temporarily closed. However, as we have heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>, these things can sometimes become permanent. It is a worrying trend that my hon. Friend highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> highlighted the absurd situation where the Government seem not to know where they are going with their policy. They have announced a policy, and if anyone had read the Labour manifesto they might have been attracted by that policy. It clearly was not thought through and they are apparently back peddling on it with remarkable speed. It must be a world record.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> raised the alarming issue of the treatment of land sales. That worries me because in my area when the Frenchay hospital land is sold off to pay for improvements elsewhere it would be absurd if we not only lost our hospitals, but we were taxed on the undersale of the proceeds. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to that point.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.1/1">I had better not as I am very tight for time.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/2">The hon. Member for Cotswold, my constituency neighbour, mentioned the important issue of what payment by results means for cottage hospitals. By definition, smaller hospitals are likely to have higher than average costs. If they are receiving payment only at a tariff level&mdash;an average costs level&mdash;they will make a loss on everything that they do. PCTs may make up the difference in some way and bale them out, but if they are broke that will not happen. Do they have a long-term future under a tariff-based payment by results system? The hon. Gentleman raises a good point there.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">The hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase> referred to the problem of how we work out how much an area should get and the inequalities that can result. He raised the important issue of the cost of delivering health care. It is not only about deprivation. If it costs more to deliver health care in a particular area, it is important that that is fairly represented in the formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/4">I should like to cite one example. We have already heard about Withernsea, Hornsea, Bicester, Surbiton, Tetbury, Fairford, Moreton-in-Marsh, Cirencester, Haslemere, Farnham and Malmesbury&mdash;a long litany of threatened community hospitals. To that I would add Thornbury in my constituency, and following the precedent set by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, I praise the <i>Thornbury Gazette</i>, for its support for the &quot;Save the Thornbury hospital&quot; campaign. I do that because the hospital has just two wards, one of which&mdash;a mental health ward for elderly people&mdash;is being lost. We are left now with one ward on which the number of beds is being cut. It is death by a thousand cuts. The question is: how long will such hospitals survive? At present, the service is provided by the primary care trust. As we have heard, in principle, PCTs may end up not providing services. Is it going to be a private hospital or a voluntary hospital? We just do not know. There is a huge amount of uncertainty, which is damaging local communities and patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/5">I do not think that any of us are defending the status quo. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said, none of us is saying that the service should not change or evolve. The service needs key-hole surgery, but it is getting amputation with a rusty hack-saw. That is what is going on in the health service at the moment. By all means, let us have evolution and new roles for community hospitals. Let them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton suggested, take on new services and new local means of delivering health care.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.2/1">We have had a fantastic debate today; I cannot remember the last time that I saw so many colleagues in Westminster Hall: we can call it a truly packed event. It is a particular pleasure to see the shadow Secretary of State for Health here, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>. That is a mark of the importance that we place on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/2">We have heard a great deal about the threat to patients and carers, and I can admit straightaway to an interest in that there are four community hospitals in my constituency, each of which is, in one way or another, under threat, two of them directly now. There are three on the periphery of my constituency that are similarly under the spotlight. It is an issue about which I feel strongly. We have heard little about the staff who work in such hospitals, and it is worth while putting on record that they are wonderful people who are experts in their field, and who operate in what we might call the less glamorous fringes of our health care system. They deserve our thanks and admiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/3">We have recently conducted a good deal of research on the matter, and I am happy to announce the results of that research. As of this morning there were 89 community hospitals in the country that we believe are under threat of closure or being seriously scaled back. However, it is worse than that. There is a clear correlation between primary care trusts with big deficits and community hospitals that are threatened with closure. That puts a lie to the notion that the exercise is about reconfiguring health care in the interests of local people; it is actually about reconfiguring health service budgets. We must be clear that that is what we are dealing with. That is important because it removes the responsibility from PCTs and puts it clearly where it should be, with the Secretary of State for Health. That is where it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/4">When I saw the Secretary of State a few days ago, she was keen to impress upon me that such matters were for local decision making by PCTs; they had nothing to do with her. The fact that we have found a strong correlation between PCT deficits and community hospital closures shows that that is an issue not for local decision making but for Ministers. They must understand that, and must take responsibility for the closures that we have shown are happening throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/5">We know what the public think; we are in the age of consultation. It was clear from the national bed survey in 2001 that there was overwhelming support for community hospitals. Indeed, the NHS plan said that we would get 5,000 intermediate care beds. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister where she thinks they are&mdash; that was poorly defined in the document. However one defines intermediate care beds, it is difficult to see where they have landed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/6">I have read the 2005 Labour party manifesto. The small part that deals with health underscores the NHS plan and promises, as others have said, a new generation of community hospital. From where my colleagues and I stand, we cannot see a new generation of community hospitals. We see what we have closing down day by day. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister about the new generation of community hospitals. Where will they be? What will they look like? Will they have any beds in them, or will they be the GP mega surgeries or polyclinics that the Government are so keen on? Is that what they really mean by community hospitals? I suspect that there might be some confusion about what is meant by a new generation of community hospitals. If the Minister means souped-up primary care practices, she needs to say so, so that the public are clear about what was meant in the Labour party manifesto of just a few months ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/7">I share the exasperation of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, who has been kind enough to give me a copy of Lord Warner's extraordinary letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October</phrase>. Lord Warner, the Minister of State, clearly does not have a clue about what he is going to put into community hospitals. My hon. Friend might like to know that the then health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>, wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase> and gave his definition of community hospitals, saying that the important thing is not the building but the services that it provides.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/8">So in March I am told that the services matter, not the bricks and mortar; in May the Government commit to buildings without knowing exactly what will go in them, and by October not only do we find community hospitals closing at an alarming rate, but the Government, clueless and consulting as ever, still have no idea what they are going to do with the new buildings that they promised just five months earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/9">That lack of direction gets worse. As others have said, in March Sir Nigel Crisp put out his extraordinary document &quot;Creating a Patient-led NHS&quot;, in which he ordained that PCTs would divest themselves of the direct provision of services. Yet we have had no news about where community hospitals will lie in the new scheme of things. What does the Minister think? Can we, at long last, have a sense of direction? Will acute trusts take over&mdash;if so, please will she say so&mdash;or will the private, not-for-profit sector take on the hospitals? There would be a certain irony if they did, because that is where they came from in the 1940s. Institutions that had been supported and nurtured by local communities for many years, often the gifts of benefactors, were taken on by the NHS, and the communities that handed them over felt that they were putting them into safe stewardship. Now, under this Government, many of those community hospitals are closing their doors.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/10">I add my tribute to those that have been paid to the leagues of friends and others who support such hospitals. Huge voluntary effort goes on in my constituency and throughout the country. The Minister needs to take on board the views of those who support and, frankly, subsidise health care in such a fantastic way.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend and I was happy to add my name to the early-day motion that he tabled on this subject. I would like to tell him about the consultation that I conducted in Warminster four years ago. It was a fantastic comprehensive exercise, involving no cost to the Treasury, but it was ignored by health policy managers. I need not tell my hon. Friend what the survey showed: there was overwhelming support for Warminster hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/2">What hon. Members have described is happening throughout the country. I suspect that I shall not have time to say much about sham consultation exercises, about &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot;, which culminated in Birmingham this weekend, and about the myriad regional events held in the run-up to that. All I will say is that it is a betrayal of people's trust if they are invited to take part in a consultation and have their say, but what they have to say is ignored; if people are selective in which surveys they pay attention to; and if people are selective about those whom they invite to contribute in the first place, as is the case with the current survey, which we understand is to inform the White Paper later this year. We will not hold our breath on that, given that if we put rubbish in, we will get rubbish out.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/3">I would like to nail the lie about cost. With respect, I take issue with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, because I think that he is wrong. If we cost the patient journey properly and consider case mix properly, we will find that community hospital costs are substantially less than costs that accrue to treatment in acute units. Those figures are available and are quite stark, and I commend them to the hon. Gentleman. I would also like the Minister's comments on that. At the moment, individual PCT chief executives take decisions on their own bit of budget, usually faced with deficits and adverse district auditor reports. They are obliged to make cuts where they can. That is their duty, what they are employed to do and their legal obligation. They have no choice. We must not blame them; we must pin the blame where it should properly reside, which is with Ministers who have got up this system whereby PCTs find themselves in deficit. They, not PCTs, are driving the closures, and it is important to know that.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/4">The Minister will say that the situation is down to individual PCTs and local decision-making. However, one thing that she cannot avoid responsibility for is public health. Just in passing, I point out that 10 days ago we heard about the contingency plan for epidemic flu, which highlighted the gross shortage of beds that we will have in the eventuality of a pandemic. The Minister cannot absolve herself of responsibility for allowing for bed space. It seems bizarre, at a time when we are clearly so short of bed space for the emergency that the chief medical officer says will arise, that we should even contemplate closing down intermediate care beds in the way in which that is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/5">We have had a fantastic debate today, the best that I can remember in this place. If the Minister has any doubt at all about the feelings of people in our constituencies, I invite her to visit any one of them that has been represented here today. If she comes to west Wiltshire, she will be sure to get the message.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an astute point, and I come now to the issue of increased expenditure. What is encouraging about the debate is the fact that many Conservative Members, as well as the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, have agreed that expenditure on the NHS has increased; nobody has said that it has decreased. There have been comments about the formula, but given the consensus that expenditure on the NHS has increased dramatically, it is important to recognise that the Government expect proper financial management of that expenditure. It was the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness who said that there had not been proper financial management in the past. Were any other political party represented here to be in Government, I cannot imagine it simply saying that there was no need for good financial management. Quite honestly, that would do patients and the public no good at all. I hope, therefore, that we can agree on the need for good, rigorous financial management.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">Perhaps I can come to the process of consultation on reconfigurations. If we agree that it is important that trusts deal with the financial deficits, we then come to the issue of how they deal with them. Let me briefly answer some of the questions asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, of which he gave me notice. Of 303 PCTs, 170&mdash;or 56 per cent.&mdash;are in financial balance, with no planned support. If we take account of those with some financial support, we see that 70 per cent. are in financial balance. Some 25 per cent. have deficits, but the majority of those are quite small, although some trusts have larger deficits. I hope that that is helpful in answering the hon. Gentleman's questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Gale, for giving me the opportunity to talk about road accidents on the A47 in Norfolk. I am pleased to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> and my hon. Friends the Members for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon) and for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser) in the Chamber. The hon. Members for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) sent their apologies; they could not be here, but they support the thrust of the debate. The Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> is also aware of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">This is Westminster Hall, so this must be another debate urging Ministers to consider the A47. I have lost count of the number of debates on the A47 that I have secured or participated in since I was elected in 1997. There have also been at least two delegations with other hon. Members to see Ministers, hundreds of letters and dozens of meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3">Since December 2004, work on dualling the A47 has actually regressed, with the Government deciding to downgrade the A47 from a strategic route to one of regional priority, for decision by a regional transport board. The Minister probably knows that that caused real anger and frustration in Norfolk across the political parties and in a wide range of communities. Almost a year later, we still have no date for the establishment of the regional transport board, and we do not know who its members will be or what its powers will be. Will the Minister enlighten us with those details when he sums up? Even when the regional transport board is established, Norfolk's A47 will have to fight for priority with dozens of probably equally worthy schemes in the eastern region. Will the Minister confirm that the regional funding allocation for the eastern region in the next three years is not sufficient even to meet existing commitments?</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">The Minister will know that particular schemes to dual certain priority sections of the A47, which were agreed before December 2004, have now slipped into the regional melting pot. We have consistently argued for the dualling of the A47 on the grounds of road safety, east-west communications, and meeting the criteria of alleviating social deprivation, particularly in areas such as Great Yarmouth, and encouraging economic development&mdash;ironically, criteria that were all established by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">The A47 is inadequate to meet the existing traffic flows of Norfolk's population, even without the demand made by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Norfolk to provide 78,000 extra homes in the next decade. I shall use this short debate to deal with the specific issue of road accidents on the A47 in Norfolk, particularly on the stretch of the A47 west of Norwich from North Tuddenham to Easton. Many other stretches of the road affect hon. Members who are in the Chamber today, but I shall focus on that particular stretch of the road because of a fatal accident that has provoked widespread anger and dismay among my constituents and a demand for ministerial action. They want no more studies, no more promises, and no more evasions; they want action, not words, on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-03">3 October</phrase>, a major accident occurred on the A47 where the C539 Mattishall road meets the A47 just east of Honingham. The crash involved a car, a fuel tanker, a low loader, another HGV and a van. David Jackson, a 19-year-old, was seriously injured, and, despite their best efforts, medical teams could not save his life. Quite understandably, his mother, Mrs. Andrea Jackson, is distraught, but she is equally determined to ensure that action is taken to prevent another parent from losing another child under such circumstances. That tragic death has galvanised local communities in villages such as Mattishall and Dereham, as well as in Norwich. A fortnight after that incident, I happened to visit the Neatherd high school in Dereham and was lobbied by the school children, many of whom had known the young man. That accident is but one that has resulted in previous deaths and injuries along the A47. The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth and I share a stretch of the A47 known as the Acle straight, where if one has the misfortune to come off the road and land in a ditch and one cannot be pulled out one drowns. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/7">Another consequence of the accident on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-03">3 October</phrase> was that the A47 was shut for nearly 12 hours and diversions occurred through Fakenham in the north and Thetford in the south, miles and miles away. That has frequently happened on other stretches of the A47, including the Acle straight. When it happens in Great Yarmouth, a large sea port is cut off, something that did not happen even in the time of Horatio Nelson. Only yesterday there was another accident on the A47 along a similar stretch with yet more delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/8">So what would I like from the Minister today? A commitment that the Highways Agency will use its small programme of works to alleviate the inherent dangers associated with the stretch that I have been talking about. The preferred solution by local residents is that they should consider a roundabout at the Wood lane-Honingham junction of the A47. That is to save lives in my constituency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.285.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="285"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h02.htm#51102h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.285.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a strong point, for which I thank him: I know that road only too well and one takes one's life in one's hands there. I am sure the Minister is aware that the real danger is not the consequence of the accidents along the east-west thrust of the A47, but in all the small communities north and south having to try to get across it. East of Norwich we have a similar problem around the village of Lingwood and there is also a major problem for the lorries and cars trying to get to the sugar beet factory at Cantley. That is my first point to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/2">Secondly, will the Highways Agency bring forward its priority review of those sections of the A47 in view of the increasing congestion and the unacceptable record along the length of the route, and will that action will be initiated as soon as possible? The road accident figures relating to the section of the A47 to which I referred underline my case. There have been six fatal accidents in which nine people died, 18 serious injuries and 55 slight injury accidents on that length of the A47 in the past six years. Of that total, three accidents in which five people died and three serious injury accidents occurred at the junction known as Wood lane-Honingham. The accident severity ratio for the length of the route over the six-year period is over 60 per cent. higher than the national average for similar types of road. That is not acceptable and my constituents are no longer prepared to accept it.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/3">The average daily traffic flow is almost 22,000 vehicles per day; nearly 50 per cent.&mdash;about 14,000&mdash;above the threshold for dualling. By the Government's own criteria, many stretches of the A47 should be dualled. There is a morning peak-hour flow in the area of more than 2,000 vehicles per hour, making the road both difficult and, at some junctions, such as that with the C539, extremely hazardous.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/4">Potential new housing allocations at Dereham from the local development plan could well result in an additional 2,000 dwellings, seeing a further increase in road traffic. Apart from the cost in human life and in injuries from such accidents, let me tell the Minister of a financial equation. I understand that the cost of fatal and serious accidents at the particular stretch of the A47 that we are debating was &pound;3.25 million during the past three years. During the past six years, the cost was &pound;5.1 million. The cost of a roundabout, which has been proposed by the county council and is the favoured option of local residents&mdash;I agree that it is one remedial option&mdash;is about &pound;750,000. It makes financial as well as humane sense to undertake that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/5">I have been supported by members of the A47 alliance, which meets regularly. I represent all the local MPs of all political parties, county councillors, district councillors, representatives of the local communities and local businesses. I am meeting Mrs. Andrea Jackson on Friday afternoon to discuss what further action needs to be taken. She has raised a petition from more than 2,000 people demanding action.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/6">I have put forward what I hope are reasonable suggestions for remedial work to meet the immediate problem, not negating our long-term aim for dualling. I hope that the Minister can give us some positive words that I can take back to Mrs. Jackson and other constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.0/1">I begin with an apology. I have done what you did, Mr. Gale, two or three years ago. I have come into Westminster Hall and discovered that my poppy has fallen out. That is a crime made even worse by the fact that it was the poppy that you bought me at the Festival of Remembrance in Margate on Friday night. I promise to replace it.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing the debate. This is a stretch of road that he has long taken an interest in, and I understand his concern about the accidents that are happening on this road. I also share the concerns of other hon. Members present today, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/3">Let me start by asking the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk to pass on my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of those who have been tragically killed on this stretch of road, particularly in the accident that he described. It always saddens me when, despite everything we are trying to do to improve safety on our roads, there are fatalities and accidents. I want to assure the House that the Highways Agency and the Government take road safety very seriously and are committed to improving safety on the road network. Our targets are challenging. We intend to reduce the number of adults killed on our roads by 40 per cent. and the number of children killed or seriously injured by 50 per cent. by 2010 compared with the average for 1994&ndash;98.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/4">In 2004, 3,221 people were killed in road crashes and 31,130 were seriously injured. That is 28 per cent. below the baseline and over two thirds of the way to our 40 per cent. target. In 2004, 166 children were killed in road crashes and 3,739 were seriously injured. This is 43 per cent. below the baseline and over three quarters of the way to the 50 per cent. target. So we are making progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/5">The most recent figures for the A47 in Norfolk originate from the local authority rather than the Highways Agency and are for the period from January 2000 up to September 2005. They show a total of 40 fatal, 149 serious and 717 slight accidents, totalling 906 for the period. The cold statistics hide the personal tragedies of every single one of those fatalities. Nevertheless, the severity index rate, which is the number of fatal or serious injury collisions divided by the total collisions for the A47 in Norfolk is 21 per cent. That is the same level as other national rural trunk roads in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/6">Such comparisons are always invidious, but if we compare the accident rates based on the period from 2000 to 2004, the approximate accident rate per 100 vehicle kilometres on the A47 in Norfolk is 16, compared with a national figure for road casualties on similar rural roads in Great Britain of 27. Although the incidents on this road are stark and serious and each one is a tragedy, the road is not grossly more dangerous than other similar roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.1/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to open this debate, particularly under your expert chairmanship, Mr. Chope.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/2">The reconfiguration of primary care trusts and ambulance trusts has concerned Members throughout the country. The timing over the summer, the lack of consultation with MPs, clinicians and PCTs and the rushed timetable have worried us all, but the Secretary of State for Health has already apologised for much of that, so I will not dwell on it. However, the impression left is still that strategic health authorities have come up with a plan based on Sir Nigel Crisp's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase> commissioning a patient-led NHS, and that that plan&mdash;a one-size-fits-all formula&mdash;will be forced through despite local views.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/3">In Staffordshire and Shropshire, we had a short pre-consultation period, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September</phrase>. The responses were mostly critical of the recommendations, but the recommendations went forward to the Secretary of State unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/4">There have been far too many NHS reorganisations. The NHS craves and needs stability, not permanent revolution. I recognise that there is a need for some changes&mdash;first, to strengthen commissioning in order to hold acute hospitals to account, and secondly, to bring PCTs together if that makes sense&mdash;for instance, in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/5">The reconfiguration does not seem to recognise what PCTs have already achieved. In my constituency, the PCT has done wonders for that semi-rural, former mining area of Staffordshire. For the first time, services are designed for my constituents, not for the people who live in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/6">I shall give a few examples. The local out-of-hours GP clinics now run every weekend, which avoids about 250 patients a month travelling 10 to 20 miles to Stoke-on-Trent. The PCT employs community matrons to work proactively with GPs, which avoids 6,000 emergency hospital admissions every year, and saves about &pound;6 million. There is also a joint health improvement plan, involving the voluntary sector, housing associations, local government, GPs and local employers in promoting local public health. That is just what PCTs are supposed to be doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/7">The strategic health authority proposal is to stick Staffordshire, Moorlands into a giant, county-wide PCT, to be coterminous with social services. However, that ignores the fact that north Staffordshire is already a natural health economy, with key north Staffordshire partnerships including the northern area social services department and the north Staffordshire police division. A county-wide PCT would weaken the commissioning of NHS services&mdash;not strengthen them, as the Government want&mdash;because Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Moorlands already speak with one voice in regard to negotiations with the acute hospital. They already share functions and staff. A Staffordshire PCT would be far more remote than the old North Staffordshire health authority that we got rid of.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/8">The only evidence so far that anyone is listening is that the Secretary of State has rowed back from the ban on PCTs employing community staff. However, all the uncertainty is still causing anxiety and a slump in staff morale. We need to know what the impact will be on PCTs that run community hospitals such as Leek. Will PCTs be able to continue to provide those services directly?</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate. Hers is a neighbouring constituency. I welcome the Minister to Westminster Hall. I assure him that I am the first to recognise the huge difference that the Labour Government have made to investment in our NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">I want to focus principally on the future role of primary care trusts, particularly what is happening on the ground following the Department of Health document &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot;. That does not mean that the ambulance service is not important to me. I simply do not want to repeat what was said by my hon. Friend. She spoke powerfully and persuasively on the matter as it affects our county, and I agree with her 100 per cent. about the Staffordshire ambulance service. Nor do I wish to dwell on the way in which the document was issued, save to say that the ineptitude over the summer was truly mind-boggling. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has since apologised for the way in which that was done.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">The Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4" class="indent">&quot;district nurses, health visitors and other staff who deliver services in the community will continue to be employed by the PCT unless and until it decides otherwise.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-10-25.152"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 October 2005; Vol. 438, c. 152</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/5">However, I am conscious that in a reply to me dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October</phrase>&mdash;just the day before, and long after the storm had broken in Parliament&mdash;Lord Warner continued to repeat pretty much verbatim the mantras of the NHS document.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/6">We all know that a White Paper will be produced on those issues in December. Above all, we know that NHS managers, certainly those in Staffordshire, are preparing the way for many of the proposed changes, which are still to be submitted for formal consultation. I suspect that many colleagues have similar stories to tell.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/7">One of the great values of debates such as this is to remind the Department that assurances given in the House need to be followed through in the White Paper and above all on the ground. My local PCT in Newcastle-under-Lyme was set up only three years ago after extensive public consultation and a major investment of NHS resources and staff commitment to the reorganisation. Since then, I have found my PCT to be approachable and very responsive to local needs&mdash;a refreshing change from the previous north Staffordshire health authority, the sub-regional health authority that served Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Staffordshire, Moorlands, which was bureaucratic and remote.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/8">The new SHA proposal, which is before a vetting panel in the Department, is for a single Staffordshire-wide PCT that would be even more remote than the old sub-regional authority. Indeed, it would dwarf any of the other merged PCTs that are being proposed for the region. Moreover, the proposal was in no way justified by the pre-consultation conducted by the SHA in the brief time allowed it in the summer. Not a single Staffordshire MP supported it. Only two PCTs in the whole of Staffordshire supported it. Indeed, only nine of the 49 responses received by the SHA from the whole of Staffordshire and Shropshire supported so-called coterminosity with county social services.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/9">Regrettably, I must mention Staffordshire county council in particular. I understand that, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-09">9 August</phrase>, the county did support a single PCT. I say that I understand, because for well over a month I have asked the county to confirm the processes by which the response was submitted in the council's name. Sadly, I have not yet received a satisfactory response, but it is clear that this was an officer's submission that did not go through the proper processes for such a major decision. In other words, it was not considered by the cabinet scrutiny committee and the full council.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.303.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" speakername="Gordon Prentice" colnum="303"  time="015:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew21">
	<p pid="a.303.4/1">I will be brief, because I want to hear what my colleagues have to say. I want to pick up on what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> said about clarity. We need clarity. I am fed up with wandering about in a hall of mirrors.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/2">We listen to one Labour Minister and get the impression that something will happen and then that is immediately contradicted by the next. We were told, quoting the Secretary of State at health questions, that it would be up to PCTs whether or not they divested themselves of their provider functions. Yesterday, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, no less, told the Public Administration Committee that it is still Government policy to turn PCTs into commissioning bodies only, and the only thing that had changed was that the end date of December 2008, which is in the Crisp letter, had been lifted.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/3">The pressure from the Government is to force and persuade PCTs to get rid of their provider functions: the occupational therapists, the physiotherapists, the health visitors, the midwives and the chiropodists. Those are serious issues. They were not in the manifesto. Every time I listen to a Minister, they quote the little red book; this is a Maoist Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/4">The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster made a speech in Portcullis House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-24">24 August</phrase> and talked in terms of &quot;continuous reinvention and renewal.&quot; That is what he wants to see. The point is that, in this little red book, there is nothing about transferring front-line medical and clinical staff from primary care trusts into the private sector, the not-for-profit sector and the voluntary sector. There is not a single word, and if there had been, we would not have got re-elected. Do not let any Minister&mdash;whether it be the Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Minister here&mdash;refer us to the little red book and say that we are signed up to it. We are not signed up to it. It is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/5">The proposals open the gate to a wholesale privatisation of our health service. I do not have time to go into that, but the Minister will be aware of the critique published by the Adam Smith Institute decoding the manifesto&mdash;we rely on it to do that&mdash;and drawing attention to the huge opportunities for the private sector. I have said before that the private sector is like a big 900 lb hairy gorilla. Once it has a foot in the door, it will be in there. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I say that for effect, but there is a wee bit of truth in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/6">The proposals have not been thought through; they are back-of-the-envelope stuff. The PCTs have been told that the reconfiguration has to deliver 15 per cent. in cost savings, but there is no 15 per cent. in the ambulance trusts. In Lancashire, we are told that we should have one PCT across the whole county, but Lancashire is one of the biggest counties in the country, in which more than 1 million people live. That would involve replacing eight PCTs with two little PCTs: Blackburn&mdash;I wonder why that one survives&mdash;and Blackpool. There is no coherence there at all. I say to the Minister and the Secretary of State that I want clear answers to the clear questions that have been posed. The proposals are unacceptable in their current form.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.0/1">If we abolish anything today, let it be the dreadful word &quot;reconfiguration&quot;. It is an ugly weasel word, and the truth is that bad language conceals bad thinking. The fact that the NHS has an independent reconfiguration panel puts the fear of God into me. Whatever else we do, please, no more reconfiguration.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/2">If I were asked to name the two public bodies that are working best in my patch, my answer would be the Staffordshire ambulance service, which is the best in the country, and Cannock Chase primary care trust, which has revolutionised health care for my constituents. I recently received a letter from the longest-serving GP in my constituency. He said that, were we to get rid of the Cannock Chase PCT, we would be putting all that we have achieved in recent years back into the great bureaucratic pot from which we once lost out.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/3">I looked at the consultation of four years ago that set up the PCT. I shall not go through the whole thing because I do not have enough time, but the criteria that were brought to bear on the decision were exactly those that are relevant now, including locality focus. That consultation answers why we cannot merge three of the primary care groups in Staffordshire into a primary care trust. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/4" class="indent">&quot;This merger would involve a total population of 385,000. This would make it difficult to provide a locality focus for the specific areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/5">It goes on to say that the particular socio-economic characteristics of Cannock Chase would be lost were any larger scheme in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/6">Fours years on, the PCT has a population of 800,000. It is losing all its locality focus, as well as the attention that is paid to the socio-economic characteristics of the area. The PCT is the best thing to have happened to health care in my area, and I am not prepared to see it disappear.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/7">I support the Government mantra on their approach to public service reform: &quot;What matters is what works.&quot; That is a sensible, non-ideological approach. It is daft to replace it with one that says, &quot;If it's working outstandingly well, abolish it&quot;&mdash;sorry&mdash;&quot;reconfigure it.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.310.1/1">Having echoed all the excellent comments of Labour Members, there is little more for me to do in this debate. Their comments show that there is more than a faint whiff of suspicion that staff and patients are being bulldozed into the changes. It is understandable that many people are worried.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/2">The proposals are the latest in a string of gaffes and shambles that have come out of the Department of Health in recent weeks, at a time when PCTs and other health trusts around the country are facing enormous financial deficits that have been greatly underestimated by the Government; for example, 80-odd community hospitals are under threat. As the hon. Member for Stroud said, this debate and the one in this Chamber this morning are one seamless debate. A recent British Medical Association survey found that three out of four trusts were facing financial shortfalls of between &pound;0.2 million and &pound;25 million each. There are, of course, the historic financial deficits that they took on; 19 out of 28 strategic health authorities predict deficits in their region approaching &pound;1 billion overall. The RCN has predicted a loss of 3,000 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/3">There is concern that the proposals for changes to structures are made from a position of weakness and financial necessity rather than one of strength, and that they are not driven by a desire to make improvements to patient service and staff support.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/4">I shall quote from a member of staff from the East Staffordshire primary care trust in the county of the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands. Mrs. Susan Joyce, who joined the PCT two years ago, wrote to the Secretary of State, various other Members of Parliament and others as a fairly new employee of the NHS. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I couldn't help but notice the dedication and enthusiasm of the staff and their commitment to improving the healthcare of the local people in East Staffordshire&mdash;I really felt that, at last, I was doing a very worthwhile job.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/6" class="indent">During this relatively short time I have observed the instigation of many new initiatives, all set up to improve the health of the population in primary care, which I understood was on the Government's Public Health Agenda. If the proposed merger of the 6 PCTs in Staffordshire into 1 large organisation is approved, then all this hard work, dedication and improvements to our local health service will be lost.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/7">I am sure that her comments are typical of many others who work in that PCT and others throughout the country which face an uncertain future.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/8">The same is true of my own primary care trust in West Sussex. Adur, Arun and Worthing PCT has a population of 230,000 to look after, and five PCTs will be merged into one super PCT for almost 750,000 people in the whole county of West Sussex. That bears a remarkable similarity to the boundaries of the old West Sussex health authority with which we started in 1997. How much money, time and effort has been spent and expended to replace the structure that was in place eight years ago? What will happen to much of the expertise of those in other PCTs in West Sussex who will not form the management of the new super PCTs?</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/9">That reorganisation may be right, and we should welcome any reductions in bureaucracy, as they have not transpired so far. If it means saving about &pound;636 million that can be recycled to front-line patient care, it has its merits, but why is it being done in such a hurry? Many people have said that local focus will be lost. We have heard that from many hon. Members present. The Government have performed a U-turn since the initial missive from the Department of Health in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/10">The <i>Health Service Journal </i>and NHS Alliance carried out a survey of all PCT chairmen in England, revealing that three quarters said that local circumstances and patient needs were not receiving proper consideration in planning reconfiguration, while only 20 per cent. said that they were. Some 54 per cent. said that reconfiguration would have a neutral impact on the quality of patient care, while 31 per cent. believed that the impact would be negative. Some 58 per cent. said that patient care would suffer from the planned cut in management cost, and four out of five said that reconfiguration would weaken the clinical engagement of GPs and GP practices in their areas. The comments go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/11">The RCN's comments reflect the criticism of the rushed and confused way in which reorganisation is coming about. It is taking legal action against the Government over their announcement of the document, &quot;Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS&quot;. The RCN is seeking a judicial review of the Government's failure to carry out public consultation on the proposed changes to the role of PCTs in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/12">The RCN says that giving PCTs a &quot;minimum&quot; provider role will dramatically redistribute the balance between public and private provision in favour of the latter and that there are enormous work force implications for front-line staff. That is right, particularly as we have been told that the proposals for the changes must be in place by October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/13">What about the problems with PCTs with large deficits&mdash;which we know many of them have&mdash;proving unattractive merger partners for PCTs that have been able to balance their books? What is the rush that has brought about those changes, such that the documents for them were issued just a few days after Parliament went into summer recess? Where is the detail?</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/14">Cathy Newman and Nicholas Timmins in an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> two weeks ago said:</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/15" class="indent">&quot;250,000 staff have been left with no idea who their new employer will be&mdash;possibly the private or voluntary sector, possibly local government, possibly GP practices, or even themselves if they set up as local entrepreneurs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/16">Are the Government still to put a cap on how much will be done by the independent sector, or is it now a completely free and open market? There are enormous work force implications for front-line staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/17">The idea might be a good one, but what is there to distinguish it from the extension of GP fundholders made under the last Conservative Government? That is another example of a wasted, expensive eight years. There will be a serious impact on the NHS because 300 PCTs in England control three quarters of the NHS budget and provide a wide range of non-hospital related services. I will not continue because I know that hon. Members want to hear the Minister's response on the ambulance trust, but many Members have reflected anger about another ill-thought-out regionalisation of services, which will reduce the number of ambulance trusts by a drastic 50 per cent. A reduction to such a small number was certainly not envisaged in the Bradley review.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/18">The proposals are hasty and ill thought out with little genuine consultation. What is the hurry? What is the real motivation behind the changes? Is it making real progress in the health service, or dealing with deficits? At this time record amounts of expenditure are going into the health service, but what on earth will happen when that tails off in the next few years? Will yet more change help the NHS after years of permanent revolution, as various hon. Members have said? If it ain't bust, don't fix it. When will the Government acknowledge the genuine concerns of many members of staff whose jobs depend on the future structure of PCTs?</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/19">Ultimately, has everything already been decided? Will the Minister come clean on that? Will he come away from the hall of mirrors that the hon. Member for Pendle said he was sick of, clear up the confusion and give a clear steer on the Government's intentions? They owe that to the many dedicated members of the NHS who work within PCTs, and for whom the changes will have a desperate and important impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.1/1">I accept that point, but it would be wrong to prejudge the outcome of the White Paper. The heart of the matter is to ensure that, as the great philosopher Billy Connolly, our &quot;dogma mustn't run over our karma&quot;. That point was eloquently made by my hon.

	<p pid="a.316.1/1">Most debates in this Chamber take the form of an hon. Member identifying a problem and asking a Minister to tackle it. Unusually, that is not what I want to do today. I want to tell, and share with my hon. Friend the Minister, a remarkable success story at my local hospital and to show how the whole National Health Service can benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/2">Our NHS has two distinctive features. First, it is free at the point of delivery, regardless of ability to pay, which is why it commands overwhelming public support. That is a principle that must never be abandoned. The second feature is not good: the wait for treatment. That is the worst feature of the NHS and is what most people want changed. The Government undertook a massive public consultation on the NHS in 2000 and waiting was by far the main concern of the millions of people who responded; that is the same today.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/3">One of the largest contributors to overall waiting lists is orthopaedic surgery, such as elective work on hips and knees, which also has some of the longest waits. As people live longer and medical health improves, the demand for replacement of worn-out joints continues and will continue to increase. National figures and those that I have seen for my local hospital show that, over the years, those on orthopaedic waiting lists comprise at least one quarter of the total of all those waiting up to six months for treatment. On average, they have comprised those waiting six to nine months and form the vast bulk of those who have had to wait more than nine months.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/4">The Government's record on reducing waiting lists by around 300,000 and getting waiting times down from 18 months or more under the previous Government to a maximum of nine months last year and a maximum of six months by the end of this year is one of their best achievements. They have increased resources and set targets. However, The Department of Health has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Orthopaedics is considered the biggest challenge to delivering the December 2005 target.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/6">In January 2004, the national orthopaedic project had to be set up, in the words of the then Health Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/7" class="indent">&quot;to reduce long waits in a challenging area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/8">With effort and drive, our aim is that by the end of December this year, no one will wait more than six months. Any objective observer would conclude that that represents huge progress since 1997. However, the wait is still six months and to an individual patient, that seems a long time, especially if he is in pain. As people forget the old 18-month waits, they will feel that the NHS is not what it should be if they have to wait for six months or even 18 weeks. As things stand, waiting is still set to be part of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/9">I can tell the Chamber, however, that at my local hospital, the James Paget healthcare trust, patients of orthopaedic surgeon Mr. John Petri do not wait for six months or 18 weeks. Mr. Petri, as I told the Prime Minister this afternoon, has no waiting list at all. Let me explain how that remarkable achievement came about. John Petri used to work in France. When he arrived at the James Paget, he could not understand why we had long waiting lists. The hospital at which he had worked in France was of a similar size, serving a similar size of population with fewer resources&mdash;but with no waiting lists; they were unheard of. At James Paget, there were twice as many orthopaedic surgeons and twice as many anaesthetists as in his hospital in France, but they worked in a different way, in different hours, and performed fewer operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/10">In France, it was normal for a surgeon to work with two teams in two theatres, moving, after scrubbing up, straight from an operation in one theatre to another in a second. Here, he found that after an operation it was normal for a surgeon to sit around drinking tea and waiting for his one team to prepare the next patient for the same theatre. That is what is wrong with the surgery system in our hospitals. In a typical three-and-a-half-hour operating session, only two hours of a surgeon's time may actually be spent operating. As Mr. Petri put it, if we were running a factory, we would not allow our most important and expensive machine to stand idle for that length of time. I would suggest that the same is true of a surgeon in a hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/11">There was another key difference. The French hospital had three theatres, compared with two at James Paget. We have the wrong balance of resources between surgeons and theatres. In about 2000, when Mr. Petri saw more resources coming in to the NHS, he put a proposal to the management of the hospital to introduce the dual operating system there. That was when I first met him. He felt that orthopaedic patients were being let down by the NHS; there was something seriously wrong and they deserved better. Sadly, the other surgeons at that hospital did not wish to change. They said that dual operating would not work and so, at that time, did the Royal College of Surgeons. However, the chief executive of the hospital, David Hill, and his managers backed John Petri.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/12">In 2001, Mr. Petri began a pilot scheme of one dual operating session a week, and his team visited France to see the system in operation. Quickly, his waiting list for hip operations reduced from one year to three weeks. The system worked, but more theatre space was needed for it to continue. A business case was put to the strategic health authority, and it supported it with &pound;2 million for a new theatre, which was opened in 2003. Dual operating was phased in as additional theatre and ward staff were recruited, additional beds opened and the process was refined.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/13">Dual operating has been running fully in 2005. Mr. Petri performs two such sessions a week in addition to one conventional session. It involves his being allocated two theatres for five hours instead of the conventional three and a half hours. Both theatres are fully staffed, and he operates on one patient while the next is prepared in a second theatre. He then moves on to the second patient, leaving a support doctor to complete the first operation by stitching up and such like. By the time he has finished in the second theatre, a third patient is waiting for him in the original theatre, and so on. He can perform two or three major operations and four or five minor ones in a five-hour session, compared with one major and a couple of minors in the conventional way. There is more flexibility and there are fewer cancellations.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/14">Trial figures show that in 50 operating sessions, John Petri performed 270 operations. Two colleagues, in 50 sessions each using single theatres, totalled 225 operations. That is why John Petri now has no waiting list. Not only is he maintaining that position, he is now taking patients off his colleagues' lists, reducing waiting times across the hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The change could not have happened without the &pound;2 million investment from the NHS, but it would not have happened without the innovative and brave stance taken by Mr. Petri. It raises some questions&mdash;as I will go on to show&mdash;about the way in which surgeons work. I hope that there are some lessons to be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/2">Mr. Petri said to me that</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/3" class="indent">&quot;a three and a half hour session is absurd, it's office hours. A theatre is not an office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/4">He said that he feels energised by what he is doing, and that he felt sleepier under the old system, with long breaks between the operations. He has been nominated for the 2005 medical futures innovation award, and we will know tomorrow night whether he has won. He deserves to win, because he is a hero of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/5">Full credit, however, must also be given to the James Paget hospital, its management led by David Hill, and its board led by John Hemming. It is a top-performing three-star hospital with no deficit, which has always met all its targets and which will move to foundation status in April. The hospital backed John Petri and, as a quality organisation, managed the necessary changes. Those changes could not have been made without such management and the investment that the Government have made in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/6">John Petri is an innovator, but what is being achieved is also a team effort involving the support of anaesthetists, theatre staff, ward staff, sterile services staff and porters. On behalf of my constituents and those of my hon. Friend, I should like to thank all those staff who have signed up to dual operating.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/7">Sadly, the other orthopaedic surgeons have not signed up to it. Even though dual operating has been proven to work, the other orthopaedic surgeons at the James Paget hospital will not change over to it. The historic compromise made at the birth of the NHS means that they are contracted to the hospital, not employed by it, and so the hospital management cannot require them to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/8">I asked the Royal College of Surgeons to comment. I would not say that it was completely negative, but it was not yet convinced. It said that the system needed trialling&mdash;I pointed out that it had been going on for the best part of a year&mdash;and that it wanted to look at it more carefully. I had thought that it would be more welcoming of the idea, and would ask what we needed to do to make it work, rather than being sceptical about it. However, to be fair, the president and vice-president of the royal college will visit James Paget hospital in a couple of weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/9">I asked why other surgeons would not take up that innovation. Habit and lack of motivation must be part of the answer. The new contract for consultants seems to give them no incentive to do so; in that respect it was a missed opportunity. One should also ask whether those at the top of the NHS&mdash;those who manage the NHS&mdash;really understand what is going on down below, and whether those down below really make the effort to alert those at the top. The system of tea drinking never seems to have been challenged either from within or outside the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/10">If surgeons do not want to change, one should also ask whether there is really a full commitment to the NHS. Are they really worried that if they have no waiting list, there will be no private patients? Do they have a vested interest in maintaining some waiting lists? Mr. Petri's private income has fallen by 10 per cent. in the past year, and he expects it to fall further. However, he said to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/11" class="indent">&quot;I care about my private practice but I care more about people who have no money getting their operation tomorrow and not having to wait a year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/12">Where are the other surgeons who think like that?</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/13">Why have we got the wrong ratio of surgeons to theatres? Has the Department of Health studied the number of operations performed in relation to the number of surgeons employed over the years? Have we had the corresponding rise in the number of operations from the increased numbers of surgeons?</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/14">The number could be going down because of changes in anaesthetics. In the UK, we have traditionally made quite heavy use of general anaesthetic compared with other countries&mdash;that entails certain dangers. As we rightly move towards more use of local anaesthetics, I am told that that will increase the pre-operative preparation time, resulting in more tea drinking for surgeons unless we change the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/15">I also asked Mr. Petri whether dual operating had wider application to surgery beyond orthopaedics. &quot;No doubt&quot;, he said. It is not applicable for longer operations but, for operations of between one hour and one and a half hours, he said that we &quot;Could do it easily&quot;. In the light of that, on behalf of patients in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> and patients all over the country, I must lay down a challenge to surgeons: please have a good look at Mr. Petri's example and please follow it. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to take this matter further and to encourage the surgeons to follow that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/16">&quot;Contestability&quot; is the new word in the national health service. Let us contest the working practices of surgeons. Our aim as a Government is to get down to a maximum wait of 18 weeks. To do that, we are reorganising primary care trusts, introducing GP-based commissioning, shaking up local providers and giving patients a choice of four treatment centres. I wonder whether following Mr. Petri's innovation might be a simpler way of bringing down the waiting times, but we are going down that road. Dual operating needs to be part of the new system. If it is, we might be able to exceed the 18 week target by a long way.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/17">I am convinced that it is right to have a patient-led NHS, but patients rarely challenge doctors. They usually see them as some kind of God who can do no wrong and they tend to blame politicians for the shortcomings of the NHS. Given Mr. Petri's innovation and the reluctance or unwillingness of surgeons to adopt it, the public must ask questions of their consultant surgeons. They must challenge why their consultant is not doing dual operating and achieving a waiting list of zero.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/18">I am not criticising surgeons' expertise, commitment to the job or care. I was admitted to the James Paget hospital with a broken hip; it was an emergency. Those who operated on me and subsequently looked after me as an out-patient were first class. I know that when I go back next year to have all the metalwork in my hip removed, I will receive excellent treatment, despite making this speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/19">For a long time in this country, there has been an acceptance of waiting lists. People have never really asked why they exist; they might assume that the NHS needs more funding. None of them know about the tea drinking. How can they when they are on the operating trolley? John Petri told me of the looks on his patients' faces when he tells them that they do not have to wait at all. This should be the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/20">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will, as a result of this debate, undertake to examine how dual operating can be introduced in all our hospitals. After all, we know the benefits of dual operating in Westminster Hall; this debate would not have taken place at the same time as the one in the main Chamber if we did not have dual operating.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate, so that we can discuss the Government's proposals to merge police forces in the south-west. I am pleased to be joined by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>, who will be seeking to catch your eye later, Mr. Chope, and to contribute briefly to this debate. I encourage him to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/2">I am totally opposed to the merger proposals in principle. I say &quot;in principle&quot; because we do not yet know the details of the proposals. As I understand it, the Government have said that the ideal force size is at least 4,000 officers and have asked the chief constables and police authorities up and down the country to come forward with proposals based on that guideline.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/3">Gloucestershire constabulary has some 1,300 officers and will, under the Government's criteria, be a prime contender for merger with two or three other forces&mdash;or possibly, as we are beginning to hear, with a force that covers the whole of the south-west. That latter proposal is the nightmare scenario, although it would fit neatly into the Government's regionalisation policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/4">Even the proposal to merge Gloucestershire constabulary with two or three other forces is unacceptable. The constabulary may be relatively small, but by all measures it performs very well indeed, and surely performance, rather than dogma, is what matters. The constabulary has a good track record of dealing with extraordinary incidents. The shoe bomber was arrested in Gloucester. The largest legal aid fraud case was brought to a successful conclusion in the county, as was the infamous West case, one of the largest murder investigations in the country. All those cases were investigated without the benefit of special grant financial resources. Add to that the special protection that the constabulary has to provide to members of the royal family who live in Gloucestershire, and one gets the impression of a competent force that has improved much in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/5">Even on the Government's own measures, the assessments are good. In the &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report, the constabulary was awarded an &quot;excellent&quot; for strategic management and a &quot;good&quot; for investigating major and level 2 crimes&mdash;the areas critical to the concerns raised from a national perspective. Last month, the whole organisation was recommended for an Investors in People award, and was graded as being &quot;good&quot; on financial management in a recent assessment by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. That same body acknowledged that the force had successfully met the challenges of serious and organised crime and terrorism. That latter point is most important, because the Government say that one of the main reasons for proposing mergers is to enable forces to tackle the threat of terrorism more effectively, and to counter organised and serious crime. However, HMIC says that Gloucestershire constabulary already meets those criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/6">Let me be absolutely clear: the fight against terrorism should have as high a profile as possible. Nothing should be spared in our determination to protect our country and citizens from any form of attack. That is one of the biggest challenges that we face, and nothing should be allowed to detract from that. However, as well as that&mdash;and not instead of it&mdash;it is important to recognise that most of my constituents are more concerned about the yobs on the corner of the street every evening who are drunk, on drugs, kicking in doors, pushing down fences, throwing stones, swearing, threatening and being generally abusive. My constituents are more concerned about those people than about al-Qaeda.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/7">Of course, there are criticisms such as &quot;We never see a policeman around here&quot;, &quot;The police are obsessed with hounding motorists to the exclusion of everything else&quot;, and &quot;They do not turn up when crimes are reported&quot;. I am well aware of those criticisms, but it must be pointed out that they are made about not just the Gloucestershire constabulary or the smaller forces, but about forces of all sizes. The police are too remote for my liking, but that is the fault of too many pointless Government targets, too much paperwork, too much political correctness and, yes, perhaps too heavy an emphasis on traffic crime, when that could be tackled differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/8">The police are not just another arm of Government; they are there to serve the public. The question is whether they could better serve the old lady whose purse has been snatched, or the shopkeeper whose window has been put in if we made control of the police more remote. I do not think that they could. The chief constable of Gloucestershire, Dr. Timothy Brain, has a detailed knowledge of the entire county. When I talk to him about villages or even hamlets in my constituency, he knows where I mean and what the issues are. Would that be true of a chief constable who controlled a force covering three or four counties or, for goodness' sake, the whole south-west? It just could not be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/9">At present, the police authority draws its members from the county, but it would become remote, unaccountable and unresponsive if members were drawn from three or four counties, or from the whole region. If the authority represented such a large area, how would the enlarged force be financed? People make strong enough objections now to paying for increases in the police precept. Those same people would find it highly objectionable to be asked to pay increasing police precepts&mdash;on top of the inexorable rise in council tax&mdash;when that money would be spent on police work in other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/10">The local aspect is important. In the run-up to the county council elections, the Conservatives in Gloucestershire said that, in office, it would fund an extra 63 police officers for the constabulary. That is a 5 per cent. increase in manpower for the force. The Conservatives took over administration in May, and are starting to fulfil that pledge. Those extra officers could be lost if the mergers go ahead, because the county council is pledged to provide them for Gloucestershire only.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/11">In a joint statement, chief constable Dr. Timothy Brain and the chairman of the police authority, Brigadier Michael Browne, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/12" class="indent">&quot;It is our overwhelming conclusion that there is a compelling case for continuing to stand alone as an independent force, and we shall be advising the Home Office of this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/13">The chief constable goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The merger process is costly and in assessments made the payback period will be at least eight years, which is a cost that will have to be borne by the tax payer. This is eight years of money that could and should be invested in the County police.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/15">There is no equivocation there from the chief constable or the police authority of Gloucestershire. They believe that they have met the Government's requirements, have performed well and are still improving, and that to merge police forces would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/16">The Government say that forces must be large enough to be blind to existing county borders but even a regional police force would have its borders. I live in virtually the most northerly house in the county of Gloucestershire. I am a long way from Cornwall; in fact, I am as near to the Scottish border as to Land's End. However, if a crime were committed just a few hundred yards up the road from me, who would deal with it&mdash;the remote south-west police force or the much nearer West Midlands police force? The point that I am making is that taking away county boundaries will not help in that respect. A further point is that Gloucestershire has far more in common with Worcestershire and Herefordshire than with Cornwall and Devon, yet the force is more likely to be amalgamated with Cornwall and Devon, or at least Wiltshire and Avon, with which it has nothing in common. In other words, regions do not exist in any meaningful sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/17">The people of the north-east voted to reject the proposal to create an elected regional assembly in that area of England, yet the Government are introducing regional government by stealth. Proposals to merge the ambulance service, the fire service and the police are already on the table, as is the move towards regional planning and road funding, for example. The electorate have never voted for such changes. The only place where they are desired is in the pro-European minds of the Prime Minister and his Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/18">To summarise, the Government say that they want forces to be more capable of tackling national, international, serious and organised crime and terrorism. Gloucestershire constabulary, which has increased its number of detectives and other specialist investigators, has already showed itself to be capable of doing so. What the Government should be doing is concentrating on improving those forces that are not performing; in other words, take the rifle approach. The blunderbuss approach&mdash;setting yet another arbitrary and meaningless target, such as the requirement on forces to have a strength of 4,000 or more officers&mdash;will not achieve the Government's objectives. Nor will it satisfy a dissatisfied public who want Osama bin Laden arrested, but also want an end to the antisocial behaviour at the corner of their streets, which is blighting their lives. There is an old saying that all politics is local. It is not true; nor is it true that all policing is local. However, those are commonly held views.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.1/1">I may in a while, but my main duty is to respond to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury. If there is a little time available, I shall take the intervention. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman made the Chair aware of his interest in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.1/2">In its review, Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary found a relationship between the size of a force and its ability to cope with the demands that I have mentioned. Larger forces were more likely to be able to absorb them with less impact on their front line and on local policing. The move to larger strategic forces will protect neighbourhood policing, by ensuring that all forces have the necessary resilience and can tackle crime at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.1/3">The hon. Gentleman is right; we need police forces that can deal with the threats of terrorism and organised crime and also deal with the yobs who create difficulties for his constituents, and lend assistance to victims of crime such as the old lady to whom he referred. What is happening is a matter of correctly rebalancing strategy and strategic organisation at one end with neighbourhood policing at the other. The basic command units will not be diminished by the restructuring that we have in mind. On the contrary, they will be strengthened. Most importantly, they will remain the key platform for the provision of local policing services to communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.1/4">I agree that the role of the local police officer&mdash;the bobby on the beat&mdash;is essential. We want those officers to be more visible, but the reforms will strengthen neighbourhood policing, not detract from it.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.2/1">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, and apologise to him, to you, Mr. Chope, and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on obtaining the debate, for being late. I, too, was wrong-footed by the change in timing. I just want to ask the Minister whether he is quoting Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary only when it suits him. It reported on Gloucester constabulary in October 2004 and said that</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/2" class="indent">&quot;a number of successful cross-border operations targeting Level 2 drug offenders and money launderers have been conducted&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.329.2/4" class="indent">&quot;for a force of its size, Gloucestershire Constabulary has a comprehensive level 2 capability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/5">It may be right in a general sense that level 2 policing is not effective at county level, but that is not true of Gloucestershire.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.3/1">The status quo is not an option for reasons that I am about to give. My earlier remarks need to be seen in the context of the overall recommendations. As the hon. Gentleman said, HMIC was clear that the creation of strategic forces would require at least 4,000 officers or 6,000 staff to provide the necessary capacity to offer the &quot;best business solution&quot;. It is a radical solution, but I put it to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and other hon. Members that simply fudging the issue, perhaps by asking for greater collaboration or some sort of federation without considering the need to create strategic forces, would mean that, in time, as level 2 threats increased and other, neighbourhood issues had to be dealt with, we would have to return to the issue again.</p>
