	<p pid="a.257.3/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak about a highly regarded local service: the community hospital. I do so on behalf of all those whose community hospitals are under threat&mdash;sadly, a growing constituency throughout England&mdash;and, in particular, on behalf of my constituents, who want to defend two much-loved institutions: Withernsea and Hornsea community hospitals. There is a third community hospital&mdash;the Beverley Westwood&mdash;in my constituency, but fortunately that is not currently under threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/2">Hon. Members will recognise that, in a predominantly rural area with poor roads, poor local transport facilities and an older-than-average population, this issue is of the greatest consequence. I plan to talk first about the situation in my constituency and then to discuss the national crisis in community hospital care. I shall not make any promises about how short my speech will be, because I have noticed that other hon. Members never seem to keep theirs.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/3">Hornsea and Withernsea are coastal resort towns with older-than-average populations. On a good day, each is a 40-minute drive from the other and from Hull. Both suffer from poor transport infrastructure. Neither has a railway station. Hornsea does not have a single A road and has a patchy bus service. One elderly constituent told me that returning home to Hornsea from Castle Hill hospital in Hull once took her four hours using public transport&mdash;she left at 2 pm.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/4">Each town has a community hospital providing beds and a minor injuries unit. Both enjoy tremendous local support: each has an active friends' group that raises many thousands of pounds to improve the experience of patients. The two hospitals are run by Yorkshire Wolds and Coast primary care trust, set up by the Government with a financial deficit from birth. During this year, the PCT has gradually lifted its prediction of deficit. At the beginning of the year, it was &pound;4 million. Then it was &pound;6 million and then &pound;8 million and now, astonishingly, it is &pound;11 million. That is all in less than six months. The PCT has undoubtedly been guilty of some financial mismanagement, but it has also reeled under the effect of national policies to which I shall return. Earlier in the year, it merged its management with East Yorkshire PCT, whose chief executive took over at Yorkshire Wolds and Coast, and, although technically separate, it has been run by a joint board ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/5">A review process into the viability of four local hospitals&mdash;Hornsea and Withernsea, in my constituency, and neighbouring Bridlington and Driffield&mdash;was instigated by Yorkshire Wolds and Coast PCT after it published details of the ballooning deficit. An independent consultant was brought in to produce a report on the viability of each hospital, and public consultation meetings were held in each town affected by the review. The conclusions of the first stage of the review, which ended in May, could not have been clearer. For Hornsea, it recommended closure, citing low bed occupancy and a significant and expensive programme of backlog maintenance.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/6">That announcement had a huge impact on the region. People were understandably angry. They were also hungry for information. That is where the PCT let itself down badly. Throughout the review process, which has now lasted almost a year, it has been extremely difficult to determine its strategy. I asked for the brief given to the consultant for each hospital review. In Hornsea's case, he was simply asked to save &pound;500,000 a year and to find a &pound;1 million cash windfall. There was no mention of health improvements, just hard cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/7">The PCT made out at &quot;pre-consultation&quot; meetings in March that it was awaiting the consultant's report on the hospitals. Those meetings were a farce, with residents given no steer as to what might be planned or the financial pressures facing the PCT. Residents were split into &quot;workshops&quot; and asked to talk about what they would like to see in their local hospital. They were distrustful, and they were right to be. I found out later that the PCT had received the report from the consultant for Hornsea in early November the year before.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/8">After nine months, the PCT finally announced its proposals in September, with a three-month consultation period to follow. At a packed joint board meeting in Driffield with more than 300 people in attendance, it was announced that Withernsea minor injuries unit would permanently lose its overnight service and that the service would drop from 24 hours to 12. At Hornsea, the MIU would be closed and the number of beds reduced from 22 to 12.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/9">The people of east Yorkshire are extremely angry. The <i>East Riding Mail's</i> &quot;Hands Off Our Hospitals&quot; campaign, with the help of various voluntary and community groups, has collected more than 15,000 signatures in protest at the threat to our hospitals. More than 1,000 people have attended protest marches. I pay tribute to the hard work of people such as Liberal Democrat Councillor Polly Worsdale, Independent Councillor Barbara Jefferson and Joan Heathershaw of the Hornsea residents' association&mdash;all in Hornsea. I pay tribute also to Councillor Richard Stead, Councillor Chuck Hunter, Councillor John Parsons, the town's mayor, Stuart Woodruff, and Edna Harknett in Withernsea. There are many more people involved. This issue has brought together people of every political persuasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/10">The proposed closure of the Hornsea MIU would be a particular blow. The PCT has not sought to commission an enhanced minor injury service from the GP practice, so what will happen to patients? Why do the isolated, the poor and the sick have to pay the price for the mistakes made by the Government and unelected quangos? Local people want to know.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/11">I will now turn to the national picture. According to the <i>British Journal of General Practice</i>, there are 471 community hospitals in the United Kingdom, containing 18,579 beds. Community hospitals contribute enormously to the quality of life of local people. In some areas, the community hospital is the only hospital service for many miles. They are close to people's homes, and patients enjoy the continuation of care provided by their own general practitioner or by local primary care teams. The low-technology environment in community hospitals generally proves more reassuring, especially to elderly patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/12">One visit to Hornsea cottage hospital summed up for me the reason why people love their local hospital. I asked an elderly gentleman what it was like being in Hornsea. He said,</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/13" class="indent">&quot;What's it like? I was eight weeks in Hull Royal. When I woke up here I thought I was in bloody heaven.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/14">The Government have also recognised the important role that community hospitals can play. &quot;Keeping the NHS local: a new direction of travel&quot;, which was published in 2003, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/15" class="indent">&quot;Community hospitals can provide a rich variety of local health and other community services . . . one common theme for this type of hospital is a key role in the provision of intermediate care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/16">It went on to say&mdash;remarkably&mdash;that the first principle that should guide any alteration in services should be</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/17" class="indent">&quot;developing options for change with people, not for them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/18">The Minister will, perhaps, explain whether that is what is happening in Hornsea or Withernsea at the moment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="259"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.259.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman agree with me that one of the problems with community hospitals is that the relationship with the care sector, particularly care homes, has never been properly defined? There is an overlap of people, sometimes because of delayed discharges, and that can cause confusion because of the different pricing mechanisms that are in place. In a sense, community hospitals are free, although we know that the cost is higher, but within the care sector they are paid for. That matter needs to be sorted out as a priority.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.259.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="259"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.259.1/1">I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman. There is a huge issue related to tariffs and the way in which, when patients come out of an acute hospital to go to the community hospital, the PCT is financially rewarded for the service that is being provided. There are also issues related to care homes. As it happens, there is not one nursing home in east Yorkshire&mdash;that is another failure of care in the current situation. Opposition to cuts in Hornsea and Withernsea appears unanimous.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/2">The Labour party's general election manifesto earlier this year pledged to</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/3" class="indent">&quot;help create an even greater range of provision and further improve convenience . . . we will over the next five years develop a new generation of modern NHS community hospitals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/4">Despite the rhetoric, however, we find ourselves in a position where the threat of closure or service cuts looms over community hospitals throughout the UK. Along with Hornsea and Withernsea, Felixstowe, Aldeburgh, Henley-on-Thames, Wantage, Wallingford and Didcot are all under threat. We will hear about other hospitals later in the debate. Evesham hospital is to lose two wards. The maternity ward at Malmesbury is to go. There is a long list, which will be added to during the debate. We believe that there are about 90 community hospitals that face threats of cuts or closure.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.0/1">My hon. Friend mentioned the maternity ward at Malmesbury. He may not be aware that, thanks to cuts by Malmesbury PCT, the whole of Malmesbury hospital is under threat&mdash;not only the maternity ward. Does he agree with me that Malmesbury provides a superb local service for local people? It is not only maternity services that are under threat there&mdash;it is the whole hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.260.1/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend's intervention. That only goes to confirm the ongoing and growing crisis in our community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/2">&quot;The NHS Plan: a plan for investment, a plan for reform&quot;, which was published in 2000, not only committed the Government to introducing 5,000 extra intermediate care beds, but stated that there was</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/3" class="indent">&quot;near universal support for the development of 'care closer to home'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/4">Legislation gave PCTs explicit responsibility for funding most of the activities of the NHS in their areas. As the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, said,</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/5" class="indent">&quot;It is for local health economies to make decisions on how to invest growing resources in ways that most effectively respond to the needs and priorities of their local populations.&quot;&mdash;<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-26">26 May 2005</phrase>; Vol. 434, c. 227W.]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.260.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1578" speakername="Ian Taylor" colnum="260"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.260.2/1">My hon. Friend has touched on an important point. Many of the communities that have community hospitals have contributed to them through fundraising. The friends of Thames Ditton hospital in my constituency have done that for Emberbrook care centre, only to see the number of NHS-taken beds under threat because of PCT cuts.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.260.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="260"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.260.3/1">The point is well made and applies in many of the constituencies that are represented by Members who are present.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/2">The truth is that extra money has gone into the NHS. Over the three years of the 2004 spending review, NHS spending will increase by 23 per cent. That will take total spending on the NHS in England from &pound;69 billion in 2004&ndash;05 to more than &pound;92 billion in 2007&ndash;08. The Minister will therefore appreciate the public's desire to know why, in the light of record spending, their local hospitals are under threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.3/3">Had the Government done more to ensure that extra NHS funding got through to front-line services, more than a third of trusts would not be in deficit, and the prospect of job cuts, closed beds and reduced services would not be looming.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.260.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="260"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.260.4/1">My hon. Friend has just touched on the nub of the problem. No doubt the Ministers will trumpet all that extra spending. The problem is that it is not getting to the front line.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.4/2">My PCT inherited an historic debt. It has been told that it must meet the deficit by April 2006; it has no time to adjust. That is why nearly all the cottage hospitals in my constituency are now under threat of bed closures, if not ward closures, if not entire closures.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.261.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="261"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.261.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. To channel anger at the situation at the PCT, however, is useless. As hon. Members will be aware, PCTs are not elected. They are wholly appointed bodies, and therefore the public cannot lay a finger on them. So much for the Government's commitment to accountability in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/2">People therefore turn their anger on the Government. What do Ministers do when the body that they appointed to run local health care runs up debts of millions and threatens the future of local hospitals? They throw up their hands and say, &quot;Nothing to do with us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/3">The Prime Minister said in response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Decision making on the configuration of local services must be a matter for the PCT&mdash;that is the procedure with which I think we all agree.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <i>House of Commons</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-20">20 July 2005</phrase>, Vol. 436, c. 1250.]</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/5">The Government were careful to ensure that just one line in the entire &quot;Shifting the Balance of Power within the NHS&quot; document referred to PCT accountability. That line was vital, however. It reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/6" class="indent">&quot;PCTs will be accountable to the Secretary of State through the Strategic Health Authority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/7">That is indeed the case. National Government policy dictates how much money the PCT has and directs how that money is spent.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.261.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="261"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.261.1/1">I would like to pick up on a point made about these budget deficits. The situation at Guildford and Waverley PCT is the same as that in many other parts of the country. With community beds shutting, people will either be admitted to acute trusts, where costs are higher, or there will be a cost-shifting exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/2">Does my hon. Friend agree that councils that are already struggling will have to pick up the tab for care at home or in the community? PCTs' deficits might be wiped, but social services and councils will have to pick up the rest of the tab.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.261.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="261"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.261.2/1">My hon. Friend makes several excellent points. The closure of beds and services at community hospitals will impact on ambulance services, which tend to be overstretched and unable to meet their targets, particularly in rural areas. That will lead to an increase in the inequity of health care in rural areas, where, as we know, the further someone lives from services, the less likely they are to use them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/2">A Government who are committed to equity should seek to ensure that not only people in cities but those in rural areas can access services. They must also ensure that savings in one area do not lead to increased costs in another. For example, the chief executive and chairman of the Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS trust told me that its bed occupancy is currently running at more than 100 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/3">That is the backdrop in the acute sector at a time when hospital beds in Hornsea are closing. Elderly patients in Hornsea are now being turned away from beds there because the number of available spaces has been reduced from 22 to 12.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/4">We do not dispute that the NHS has extra resources. In the unreformed NHS, however, each and every PCT is having to face the fact that many Government initiatives have proved to be more expensive than forecast. Central targets for waiting time limits and GP out-of-hours arrangements are disastrous; dentists earn &pound;250,000 a year on the NHS while patients, including many in my constituency, are denied care; and there are difficulties in implementing the new GP contract. All the initiatives have taken their toll. The new centrally negotiated GP contract has been remarkable in its impact&mdash;GPs have received huge pay rises for doing much less&mdash;but it has had too little attention. PCTs are reeling under the impact, but the Government say that it is nothing to do with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">My hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> questioned Ministers on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-13">13 November 2001</phrase> in a Westminster Hall debate on Skegness and District hospital. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/6" class="indent">&quot;if the proposed primary care trusts ran short of money, an obvious saving could be made by shutting a ward and using fewer beds. What safeguards will the Government put in place to ensure that that will not happen?&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-13">13 November 2001</phrase>; Vol. 374, c. 236WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/7">He did not receive an answer from the Minister, but sadly we now know the answer&mdash;no safeguards and &quot;Nothing to do with us.&quot; That is where the real anger lies. The proposals for Hornsea, Withernsea and countless other places are based not on clinical grounds but are the result of the PCT losing control of its finances.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/8">When defending cuts to local services, the Government point out that PCTs are spending the money as they see fit to meet for local needs. Indeed, another Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, is on record as saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/9" class="indent">&quot;local health care professionals have very properly surveyed the health needs of the local population, and have come to a set of recommendations, or provisional conclusions, about how to invest the resources with which they have been entrusted&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-22">22 June 2005</phrase>; Vol. 435, c. 265WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/10">My response to that claim is, first, that local health managers are not enjoying the review process and the anxiety that it is causing residents and staff. They did not enter the profession in order to shut wards and close beds. They have been forced into that predicament by the Stalinist nature of Whitehall management. Secondly, a casual delving into the geographical and social character of my area will show that the PCT cannot possibly be looking out for the health needs of the local population. Instead, it is following the ever-changing edicts of a Government who still claim that is nothing to do with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/11">The Government are keen to triumph with positive headlines for the NHS. When things go wrong, however, they tend to shrug off responsibility and lay the blame at someone else's door. That must not be allowed to continue. Ministers must start to find answers to this growing crisis. They should use the primary care consultation now being conducted; they should use the forthcoming White Paper; and they should use the desire to be Prime Minister of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/12">Whatever it takes, Ministers need to save our community hospitals. If they do not, a growing number of people will not forgive their attitude of, &quot;Nothing to do with us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/13">Mr. Roger Gale (in the Chair): Many Members have indicated that they wish to speak, and one or two others who have not done so are rising.

	<p pid="a.263.0/1">I will adhere to your stricture, Mr. Gale, and I can tell the House that the full text of any documents to which I may refer can be found on my website, <a href="http://www.tonybaldry.co.uk">www.tonybaldry.co.uk</a>.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/2">In its general election manifesto, the Labour party promised a new generation of community hospitals. During the summer, I tried to discover by way of parliamentary questions what was meant by a new generation of community hospitals. I was told that Ministers' thinking was at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/3">In desperation, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-13">13 October</phrase> I wrote to the Secretary of State asking what was meant by a new generation of community hospitals, who would fund them, who would run them, who would pay for them&mdash;and whether they would have beds. I did not receive the courtesy of a response from the Secretary of State, but I did receive a letter from Lord Warner, a Minister of State in the Department of Health. I shall share with the House three paragraphs of his letter, and my response to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/4">Lord Warner, being an elegant Member of the other place, started his letter with an apology:</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/5" class="indent">&quot;I am sorry that previous correspondence on community hospitals has failed to elaborate on the details of the manifesto commitment. However, we are keen that the 'Your Health, Your Care, Your Say' consultation is a genuine listening exercise and do not want to pre-empt the outcome of it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/6">I replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/7" class="indent">&quot;This is bizarre. The General Election that contained this commitment was over six months ago. In the meantime, Primary Care Trusts and people locally are left in limbo, with no clear guidance as to what the Government means or intends when it refers to a 'new generation of community hospitals'.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/8" class="indent">You seem incapable of even explaining or answering whether such new community hospitals will be hospitals with beds, or without beds. This is also of importance to local acute NHS Hospital Trusts, such as the Oxford Radcliffe NHS, who clearly from their recent strategic planning document, envisage community hospitals with beds increasingly being able to help resolve the perennial problem of bed-blocking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/9">Lord Warner replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Policy officials are currently undertaking scoping work to consider the range of services that a modern community hospital could offer. This will be shaped by the outcome of the consultation, and I would not want to speculate on the outcome of the work at this time.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/11">I responded:</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/12" class="indent">&quot;How can the Government promise a new generation of community hospitals when the Government seemingly have absolutely no idea what services those community hospitals should deliver? This is crazy. In Oxfordshire, there was a comprehensive review of community hospital provision in 1998 when these issues were considered exhaustively, and where the Minister of State, Alan Milburn, promised the people of Bicester a new and enlarged community hospital with 30 beds. There was no confusion at that time among officials as to what a community hospital should look like, and as to what services it should deliver.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/13">Lord Warner replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Turning to your concerns about ownership and running costs, 'Commissioning a patient-led NHS', published by the Department of Health in July, indicates that PCTs need to identify the most appropriate providers of community services. Therefore, decisions about ownership, management and running costs will be made locally.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/15">My response was:</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/16" class="indent">&quot;This is complete gobbledygook. Who else at the moment, apart from primary care trusts, are going to be running community hospitals? If it is your intention that the responsibility for community hospitals passes to acute NHS trusts, then say so. This matter is even more confused in Oxfordshire now that the strategic health authority has simultaneously indicated that the existing PCTs in Oxfordshire are going to merge into a single primary care trust, and that management of that primary care trust is almost certainly going to be put out to the private sector. So there is now complete limbo in decision-making until some time next year, when we see the emergence of a single trust and are clear as to who is going to be running that trust, and on what basis.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.264.0/1">I wonder whether my hon. Friend heard the announcement of the former Secretary of State for Health, before the general election, that new community hospitals would all operate within the NHS and would be run by primary care trusts. I wonder whether he has seen the flip-flopping of the Government on this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.1/1">It is grossly unfair that decision taking is now in complete limbo, which is made worse by the Government's failure to explain what community hospitals should look like, whether they have beds, or who will run them. Acute hospital trusts see those hospitals as a solution to bed-blocking. The strategic health authority is totally incapable of even answering letters about community hospitals, other than in the most general of terms, because they clearly do not know what Ministers' thinking is. Ministers do not seem to know what their thinking is about the future of community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/2">The last letter to which I draw my colleagues' attention is one signed by me and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my hon. Friends the Members for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase>, for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey), and for Henley (Mr. Johnson) to <i>The Oxford Times</i> last Friday in which we state that the NHS in Oxfordshire is in freefall. The strategic health authority expects the Oxfordshire health economy somehow to save &pound;35 million between now and the end of the financial year. Decision taking is in complete chaos, and there is a complete lack of guidance from Ministers as to what they expect. That is against a background of cutting and slashing over the next few months. It is absolute chaos.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/3">I do not think that a Minister has been seen in Bicester since 1997, other than a fleeting appearance by the Home Office Minister to discuss the asylum centre. I would genuinely welcome the Minister to Bicester to talk to its people about community hospitals. Indeed, my Labour party opponent at the last general election invited Ministers to come to Bicester during the Labour party conference. They would be most welcome to try to explain the chaos to everyone in the Oxfordshire health economy. I am sorry that, given the time constraints, I have not been able to take colleagues through the full texture of the debate. As I say, please look at my website, which shows how chaotic decision taking is in the area of community hospitals in Oxfordshire and, I suspect, elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.0/1">Already the cases we have heard today have echoed my experience. I am sure that we are about to hear similar accounts from other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/2">In August, the Kingston primary care trust announced, totally out of the blue, that it wanted to close Surbiton hospital. We were told not to worry and that that would be temporary. A new survey had been received on the roof and, because of one little leak in one room, the trust thought that there was a case for closing the hospital. The survey found that to replace the roof entirely, which was apparently the only option that could be considered, would cost &pound;300,000 and bust the budget. Health and safety required that all the elderly patients in the hospital were moved out. Some had been there for years. The out-patient facilities were also closed. One can imagine the local uproar.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.0/3">When people asked when the hospital would reopen, the PCT could not answer. There was no plan and no strategic approach, and people were concerned and suspicious. They went on websites and looked at what was happening in other parts of the country, and their suspicions grew.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to recount that tale, because it is replicated wherever we look. In Lyndhurst in my constituency, Fenwick hospital was &quot;temporarily closed&quot; because of a shortage of staff leading to health and safety concerns. Once that was rectified, did it reopen? Not likely.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.265.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" speakername="Edward Davey" colnum="265"  time="09:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h01.htm#51102h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.265.2/1">I am disturbed, although not surprised, to hear that account. That is our worry in Kingston and Surbiton. Since that August shock, we have had meetings with the PCT. I have had private meetings. We have also held public meetings. We have held consultations and had meetings with the strategic health authority. I met Lord Warner to put the case and the whole process is ongoing. I do not think that the hon. Gentleman will be surprised to learn that, as a result of a long process, one is more confused than clear about the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/2">National policy impacts on such cases. The infamous letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase> from Lord Warner to PCTs and strategic health authorities across the country has created such instability and confusion that the ability of local managers to plan and to take strategic decisions has, frankly, been taken away. That is not their fault but the fault of the Department of Health. All the cards have been thrown up in the air. That, as I shall explain shortly, has created lots of difficulties with knowing how GPs and PCTs can plan ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/3">There is also confusion when one tries to work out what the local policy is. When one tries to test the arguments about the roof and the health and safety issues, they do not stand up to scrutiny and one's suspicions are increased. In my meeting with Lord Warner, he explained that I had nothing to worry about, that the reorganisations would not impact on any local decisions and that he would require the strategic health authority for south-west London to take whatever decisions it needed to. Of course, the strategic health authority was pleased to have that ruling, although it is fighting for its life and is not even sure that it will be around in a year's time. It is nice to have those words from Ministers at the Department of Health, but how it will impact on the ground is, I am afraid, very different.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/4">It seems to me that the local policy makers are driven by two factors: the confusion in national policy and another aspect of the proposed changes, which is the fact that the PCTs, however they are configured in the future, will not be direct providers of services. A lot of the PCTs and their management want to get in early and to divest themselves of services that they can push off into the local care sector or to other providers. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Hon. Members are saying from a sedentary position that Ministers have changed the position and are saying that PCTs &quot;may&quot; have to divest themselves of services. However, the managers on the ground are still fearful that their careers will be built around the number of services of which they divest their trusts. That may be how the ruling is worded, but the reality for the NHS bureaucrats is that they feel under severe pressure to divest their trusts of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/5">The other issue that is driving decision makers, certainly in south-west London, is the budget. The strategic health authority for south-west London has been told that the sub-regional health economy must come in on balance this year and that all the different trusts in the area must sum to zero. However, one or two acute trusts, particularly St. George's in Tooting, have massive deficits. Everywhere else is expected to come into surplus to make up the difference. That is not in any consultation paper. It is not even admitted, when that obvious fact is pointed out. However, it is clearly driving what is happening. There is a desperate wish to make short-term savings, and bad long-term decisions are being made to balance the books by April. That is a real problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/6">As to our local battle, I hope that through our arguments and the pressure that we exert we shall be able to prevent some hospitals from shutting in the short term, and that we can save out-patients, even if it appears that those concerned are determined to move in-patients. That, at least, will give my constituents and the community time to regroup so that we can develop an alternative long-term vision, to take up the Government's pledge to provide proper, modern community hospitals and to test their vision. We have a vision in Kingston and Surbiton of a modern, 21st century, state-of-the-art community hospital, which provides in-patient services but which also provides a portfolio of out-patient services&mdash;more than are provided on the site now&mdash;that could relieve pressure on the acute hospital at Kingston.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/7">As an example, the audiology department is under huge strain, with the laudable digital hearing aid programme that the Government have set in train. However, it does not need to be offered on an acute hospital site. That service could easily be provided on a community hospital site. The community hospital movement needs to get a grasp of such changes to the configuration of services, and so do the Government. We can provide primary care services of that kind more effectively through an expanded and modernised community hospital movement, and in doing so save money and remove pressure from the acute services, whether in their car parks, their accident and emergency departments, or their diagnostic services.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.2/8">Community hospitals are part of the solution, not part of the problem, as far too many people in the health service seem to think. Whether Surbiton or other community hospitals are at issue, I hope that the Minister will listen, and move fast to ensure that the reorganisations elsewhere in the health service will not get in the way of sensible long-term planning.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on his choice of subject and the way in which he delivered his speech. What he said touched a chord in many of us. The fact that so many hon. Members are present listening to the debate and hoping to take part shows how important a subject it is. I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State, is here.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/2">I want to be fair to the Government at the beginning of my remarks, as it is not clear to me from the debate that anyone else will be. They have put resources into the NHS, and I welcome that. There have also been improvements in the quality of the care received by our constituents. Indeed, I shall shortly be opening a new nursing home on the site of Andover hospital, jointly funded by the NHS trust and Hampshire county council. We can debate elsewhere whether the improvement in care has been commensurate with the increase in cash. We can also debate whether the increase has been fairly spread throughout England. I shall mention that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">In addition to being fair, I want to be realistic. I recognise the case for change in the buildings that the NHS uses. Patterns of treatment change, lengths of stay reduce and medical science advances and becomes more specialised. Critical mass is needed for a district general hospital; there cannot be one in every town. New guidelines on safety indicate what operations can take place where. Old buildings are, of course, expensive to run, and more care can be provided at home. Therefore, the NHS needs to be responsive to the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/4">Against that background, my local trust produced a consultation document on the future of my local community hospital in Andover. That should have been an opportunity to discuss how the extra cash that is going into the NHS might be used to expand and to improve the services in a fast-growing town. Andover War Memorial hospital, as the name implies, was built by public subscription after the first world war when Andover was a fraction of its present size. It is a much loved institution with dedicated staff, but parts of the building are now seriously substandard. It provides a portfolio of services&mdash;minor injuries, maternity, out-patients, therapy and diagnostics&mdash;but for anything more serious one has to go to Winchester. Some 67,000 people look to Andover for hospital services, and that number is about to go up.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/5">The people of Andover and I would like the consultation exercise to result in the provision of a wider range of high-quality services in a modern building, reducing the need to travel to Winchester. I echo the point that was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase>. The problem with dependency on Winchester is that there is no direct train service, the bus service is infrequent and the journey lengthy, and there is nowhere to park. As Andover overtakes Winchester in population size, we see the review as an opportunity to move the centre of gravity of NHS service provision closer to the population that it serves.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/6">We are not after a new district general hospital. we just seek improved and rebalanced terms of trade. However, there is deep concern in the town that we will not get that. People suspect that the consultation exercise is driven as much by the need to save money as by the need to improve care. The document says:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/7" class="indent">&quot;we need to make . . .changes to ensure it remains . . . affordable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/8">As a result, there is a lively and broad-based campaign to fight for the hospital, led by Derek Robinson. The local paper, the <i>Andover Advertiser&mdash;</i>I mention it in the hope that it will mention me&mdash;has given extensive coverage to the debate. Public meetings have been packed.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/9">There is reason for that concern. The annual report of my primary care trust, which arrived yesterday, says that to balance the books in the current year, it has to save over &pound;11 million. Last year, it ended up owing &pound;17.5 million while being owed &pound;4.5 million. The financial position of what is called the health economy in Hampshire is deeply serious. The fear is that there will be no resources to modernise Andover hospital and that, in order to cut costs, more services will migrate to Winchester. At the heart of the issue is the formula for distributing the cash. I hope that the Minister will say that she is able to review that formula. Hampshire gets about 80 per cent. of the England average, and with that we cannot provide the quality of care to which people are entitled. Therefore, we have financial recovery plan following financial recovery plan. We have now been told to rub out the deficit in the current year. In Andover, we are ambitious but realistic. We want a fair outcome from the consultation exercise, as my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness does from his.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/10">I want to end by raising a key issue that is not unique to Andover, and which could affect every constituency with a community hospital that needs renovation. I refer to a policy that is wholly indefensible, and which the Minister can and should change today. Part of the site of Andover hospital is to be sold. I have no philosophical difficulty with that if all the new services that we need can be provided on a smaller footprint, and the capital receipts from the disposal can fund them. The land is to be sold in two years' time for &pound;1.5 million&mdash;the estimated best price in the open market. However, that is less than the book value, which district valuers have assessed at &pound;4.2 million. I do not know how they arrived at that figure; I should have thought that a building providing health services at nil cost had a negative value.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/11">At this point in the dialogue, an uninvited guest arrives, namely the Treasury. The Treasury has spotted the gap between the open market value and the book value and has demanded what it is pleased to call an estate impairment charge. It is not even prepared to wait until 2007 to get its pound of flesh. Over &pound;500,000 is being added to this year's deficit for the alleged injury being done to the NHS estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/12">That is Treasury theology taken to an absurd degree. That tax on disposal is a major disincentive to rationalisation and is going to lead to a reduction in services in the current year. I have pursued the matter twice with Ministers, and their replies are straight from &quot;Yes Minister&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Impairment charges to the revenue account are in many respects analogous to depreciation charges and . . . measure the consumption by an entity of its economic resources.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/14">They continue:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/15" class="indent">&quot;A fall in value does not represent any error or over-estimation of the initial valuation, but rather the difference in economic value between a productive asset employed in delivering healthcare and one in which its value is merely the potential to realise sale proceeds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/16">The Government have recognised that that is nonsense, because they have set up a separate fund to compensate the trusts that have to pay the charge. Sadly, the Treasury has got at that fund, too, and it meets only part of the cost, leaving a &pound;500,000 shortfall this year in Andover.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/17">Let us sweep away this nonsense. If land and buildings are surplus, they should be sold at best value, but let us not accentuate a bad problem by allowing that absurd theology to add to the burdens of heavily indebted trusts. If nothing else happens this morning, let the Minister at least recognise that absurdity.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.0/1">I am glad to catch your eye, Mr. Gale. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> for raising this important subject. I am also grateful to the Minister for being present, and I have forewarned her of one or two of the questions that I shall ask. I am glad to see that my hon. Friend is recovering. Judging by the way he waved his arm this morning, he is clearly not in pain, so someone must have been treating him properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/2">Gloucestershire has a problem, in common with many of the areas represented by Opposition colleagues&mdash;there are a great many Opposition Members present, but very few Government Members, which must tell us something about this debate. All my cottage hospitals&mdash;Tetbury, Fairford, Bourton-on-the-Water, Moreton-in-Marsh and, to a lesser degree, Cirencester&mdash;are threatened with bed closures, ward closures or complete closure. The reason is that Cotswold and Vale primary care trust inherited a &pound;5 million historical debt and has been told that it cannot overspend at the end of this financial year&mdash;it must close that deficit, come what may. The only way in which it can make up that amount on a &pound;100 million budget is to close either wards and beds or complete hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> said, PCTs are being bribed with the possibility of new and better facilities. However, given that PCTs will all be merged&mdash;that is likely to happen in Gloucestershire before it does in the rest of the country&mdash;I do not think that some of those new facilities will ever emerge. My first question to the Minister, therefore, is how many PCTs in the country achieve financial balance without any external support? My contention is that most have a financial deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/4">Following on from what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> said, I note that 70 to 80 per cent. of admissions in many areas are to the local hospital, whether it is a community or acute hospital. In Gloucestershire, that figure is down to only 10 per cent., which leads to an absurd and unsustainable situation, because people are travelling 3 million miles to get to their out-patient appointments. Clearly, that is unsustainable and undesirable, and the problem will not be solved by April. The ultimate solution must, therefore, be to keep community and cottage hospitals open, operating at full capacity and treating people to the best of their ability, whatever that means in terms of modern scientific developments and modern diagnostic possibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/5">The Government are changing their system for measuring the viability of local hospitals and moving to a system of payment by results and practice-based commissioning. I therefore have two questions for the Minister. First, what work has the Minister done to see whether cottage hospitals will become more or less viable when they move to the payment-by-results system? My second question relates to practice-based commissioning, which, we are all told, is to be the new saviour of our cottage hospitals. Under this new system, there will be a plurality of providers, but what will happen when no provider comes forward to run the local cottage hospital? What safeguards will there be as regards the over-mighty foundation hospital? In Gloucestershire, the problem is that it is sucking in all the resources and making cottage hospitals even less viable. What safeguards will there be to prevent predatory action by the over-mighty foundation hospitals?</p>

The hospital of someone who lives in Gloucester or Cheltenham is the district general hospital, yet we are fortunate to have community hospitals. Part of the problem is that there is an urban and a rural split, which is very difficult to make sense of in health provision. Does he agree that we need to consider that problem very seriously?</p>

	<p pid="a.270.1/1">I entirely agree with my neighbour. Part of the problem is the differential in funding. Foundation hospitals receive an amount that is well in excess of inflation, whereas cottage hospitals are being starved of funds. Many other colleagues have referred today to the rurality of some areas in Gloucestershire, which are 25 to 30 miles away from the nearest district general hospital. That is a real problem in the middle of the night. I know of someone who died because they did not get to the district general hospital in time.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/2">We do need to make better use of cottage hospitals. They are the long-term viable option and the environmentally friendly option, and they are the best option for the patient. The Minister and the Government were elected on the manifesto of strengthening our national health service. It is quite unacceptable that some people in this country are receiving a national health service that is vastly superior to that received by others. There should not be a postcode lottery. All areas, particularly the rural ones, should be fairly treated by their national health service. The formula for distributing the money should not be skewed, as it has been, so that ratings for the elderly and rurality are lowered. It is simply not fair that some hospitals in our large cities are thriving, but other hospitals in our rural areas are closing.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.0/1">I shall talk about health inequalities, as they go to heart of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.0/2">There are two different concepts of health inequality. The first is when one primary care trust receives less per head than another. The second is when two PCTs receive broadly the same amount, after weighting, but choose to spend their allocation differently. One PCT might spend more money on prescription drugs, another might spend more on acute care, and yet another more on community hospitals. One PCT might use its resources more efficiently than another.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.2/1">May I develop the thrust of my argument, because I want to base my contribution on what the Secretary of State said last week? In essence, the Government are saying that that the problems in community hospitals are caused by the second type of inequality; that differing local priorities or poor financial management are the culprits. I contend that the problem is the first type of inequality, in that PCTs in certain parts of the country do not receive the amount that they need to deliver expected levels of health care because of fundamental flaws in the weighting formula that allocates funds to different areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.3/1">I should point out that there are more complex and sophisticated reasons for differences in the per capita funding of PCTs, not least age, profile, morbidity and other social statistics. Does the hon. Gentleman accept that an ideal system will not necessarily deliver comparable amounts per head even to adjacent PCTs?</p>

	<p pid="a.271.4/1">I accept the hon. Gentleman's point. Let me explain why I believe there to be a problem in the weighting formula. Guildford and Waverley PCT serves one of the most affluent parts of the country, and I fully accept that people there are relatively healthier, but against that must be weighed the fact that it is one of the most expensive areas of the country in which to deliver health care and it also has a much higher proportion of elderly people.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/2">Guildford and Waverley PCT has received generous increases in spending. The spending for our area increased by 9 per cent. last year, and is due to increase by 8 per cent. this year&mdash;increases of &pound;18 million and &pound;19 million respectively. Despite that, it is in crisis. Cranleigh hospital, which is the community hospital in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase>, faces closure. The number of beds is being cut back in Haslemere and Farnham community hospitals. A specialist rehabilitation centre, Milford, which has an enormously long track record of helping elderly people from the area make a complete recovery after strokes, also faces closure. The PCT is currently closing one-third of the community beds as an emergency measure, despite the fact that that flies in the face of the agreed local NHS strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/3">What is going wrong? The PCT has apparently been overspending and it is being asked to reign in that spending. However, considering the funding allocations, it is spending 9 per cent. less than the national average, despite the higher cost of delivering health care in the area, but the funding formula after the weighting states that it is still spending too much. This year it is spending &pound;16.3 million more than it should be, but the weighting formula states that it should be spending 17 per cent. less than the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/4">Let us be clear: according to the formula, the Department of Health expects one of the most expensive areas of the country for delivering health care, with a much higher proportion of elderly people than average, to deliver that health care spending about a fifth less money than the national average per head. Why is that? It is simply because the weighting formula states that people in the Guildford and Waverley PCT area are healthier than those in other parts of the country and therefore it needs less money.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/5">However, the effect of such a huge disparity in funding is not to decrease health inequalities but to increase them. For example, waiting times for ENT surgery is up to 13 weeks in Manchester but up to 26 weeks in Surrey; people have to wait up to 15 weeks for breast surgery in Leicester but up to 24 weeks in Surrey; for trauma and orthopaedics in Sedgefield, to take a random example, people have to wait up to 13 weeks, but in Surrey they have to wait up to 36 weeks. In trying to eradicate health inequalities, the weighting formula needs to consider not only health outcomes, such as mortality rates, but access to health care. If it focuses only on health outcomes it ends up creating equality, but by punishing the most vulnerable people who happen to live in more prosperous areas by making it massively harder for them to access health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/6">I say to the Minister that it is very easy to look at areas such as Surrey and paint them in one's mind as a uniformly prosperous place, but nothing could be further from the truth. Although the proportion of socially deprived people in such areas may be lower, those that are disadvantaged are often far more vulnerable than those in areas with widespread deprivation because they do not have access to many of the grants and funds targeted at more deprived areas. When waiting times are increased and access to community beds is decreased, wherever it is, the people who suffer the most are those who have the least and they are the ones who will suffer if the funding formula is not changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.4/7">The Minister and I both support a well-funded and fair health service, and in that spirit I ask her to recognise that many of the problems we are discussing are caused by a flaw in how funds are allocated. Of course, we need to take account of social deprivation, but we also need to take proper account of the cost of delivering health care and to promote fairness in access to health services. Sometimes mathematical formulae are designed to balance conflicting objectives fairly but they can also have perverse consequences, which is what is happening now.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.0/1">In the few moments left I want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">my hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on securing this important debate. The number of hon. Members who have wanted to take part in it shows the importance of the issue. However, the resignation of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase> will take this debate off the front pages tomorrow if the information from my pager is correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/2">I will mention just two anecdotal situations in my constituency in order to give <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> a few moments to expand on the subject. First, the hospital in Malmesbury is under great threat. Several wards have already been closed; the maternity unit has been closed; the X-ray unit is being removed despite the fact that the friends of Malmesbury hospital paid for it in the first place. It appears that Malmesbury hospital will be closed; consultations are being taken on the matter but the likelihood is that anything that looks vaguely like a hospital will be closed. Why is that?</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/3">I had a most interesting experience in the summer when I visited something called the Avon, Gloucester and Wiltshire strategic health authority. It is unclear to me what a strategic health authority is. I said to the chief executive, &quot;What is it? What do you do?&quot; and he said, &quot;Well, we are strategic,&quot; and I said, &quot;Well, I'm glad about that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/4">In Wiltshire, the PCTs, and the primary care groups before them that were broken up from the Wiltshire health authority, are being brought back together in something that looks much like the old Wiltshire health authority. What do we have on top of that? We have Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire strategic health authority, which I went to see. It has a huge office in my constituency with a car park jam-full of BMWs. I asked the chief executive, &quot;Why are you closing our hospitals and cutting our services?&quot; and he said, &quot;Oh, that is all to do with this, that and the other.&quot; I said, &quot;I'll tell you what it's got to do with: it's to do with the fact that you're employing all these fellows here in their BMWs. I'll tell you what to do: sell this great huge building in the middle of Chippenham, fire all these fellows, close down the strategic health authority and get back to the old Wiltshire health authority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.0/5">What we are seeing&mdash;we have heard about this from my colleagues across the patch this morning&mdash;is deep, damaging, hated cuts in NHS front-line services, and their replacement by bureaucracy and management. I say to the Minister: cut all that nonsense and spend the money&mdash;she must spend the money&mdash;on front-line services.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> for allowing me time to speak briefly. I shall discuss the two community hospitals in my constituency&mdash;the Dilke Memorial hospital and the Lydney and District hospital. They are both supported by active friends' groups, which have raised a great deal of money not only for medical equipment at those hospitals, but, particularly at Lydney, for the physical infrastructure of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/2">I echo the concerns of some of my colleagues. Like many other PCTs, the West Gloucestershire primary care trust faces a significant financial problem this year: it has a deficit from last year, its previous forecast was for a deficit this year and it has been told that it must close all of that gap in this financial year. The trust is reviewing community health care in the area, and, although I am reassured that it wants to protect the community hospital facilities, I fear that its financial predicament may force it to take a different decision. It was expected to make proposals this autumn for community hospital provision, but it made it clear earlier this year that it would be unable to bring forward those proposals, ostensibly because it was unable to produce them locally in time.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/3">Given what colleagues have said, particularly <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, it is difficult to avoid concluding that part of the problem is the direction that the trust is getting from the centre about the national strategy for community hospitals and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> said, the fact that all the PCTs in Gloucestershire are likely to be merged into one, which means that a great deal of management time is being expended on future structures instead of front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/4">My constituents and I are concerned that despite the trust's best intentions and the fact that it wants to provide community facilities, resources are being taken out of the West Gloucestershire PCT area, which covers my constituency, and sucked towards the acute hospitals in Gloucester and Cheltenham, because the trust has to close its financial deficit, because its most recent financial report, in September, said that its financial position had deteriorated and because its largest service agreement with the acute hospital trust, which, as my hon. Friend the Member for Cotswold said, runs the hospitals in Gloucester and Cheltenham, means spending &pound;382,000 more than planned with that trust. The outcome of all that is that, despite not wanting to, local decision-makers might be forced either to close one or other of the community hospitals, or&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.275.0/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> not simply on securing the debate, but on the gracious and fair way in which he presented his case. I thank him for paying tribute to the people of all the political parties in his constituency who have worked together. When local political parties can work together on these campaigns, they are all the more effective. I thank him for his remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.0/2">Much of what the hon. Gentleman said resonated with hon. Members. We have all had similar experiences. There was the consultation that was not, where we already knew what the outcome would be. He mentioned the manifesto pledge to have a new generation of community hospitals. The rhetoric is one thing, but the reality appears to be very different. In my area the argument for merging two district general hospitals into one super acute tertiary hospital is that it will do more in the community. At the same time, however, community provision is under threat. It is certainly not a joined-up piece of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.0/3">The root cause of our debate is the Prime Minister's announcement that he is not planning to stand again for election. Now he is in a hurry. He wants a legacy. That means reform has to happen quickly. Primary care trusts have to get their books balanced by next April instead of having several years to sort things out because everything has to be rushed through so that we can see health reform implemented and the Prime Minister's legacy in place. Were there not such a hurry, many of these transitions could take longer and people would have time to adjust. Some trusts are in surplus but we do not hear about them. Those that are in deficit, instead of having time to adjust as they would once have had, are having to scramble to cut costs at every opportunity. Community hospitals are in the front line of those cuts.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is so much focus on structure rather than service delivery? That is the gap between Government and local people, which is why we have heard stories from many hon. Members today about local people raising funds to support their community hospitals. In my constituency, local residents are raising funds not only to build but to own their local hospital, Cranleigh village hospital, because they are concerned about service delivery, not structure.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.2/1">I am sure that the hon. Lady is correct. Indeed, we have heard many examples where it was local subscription that enabled a hospital to be built. In the case of Tetbury hospital in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the constituency of the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, which I visited recently, the local community is the source of the hospital and runs it, as far as I understand. Very often these community hospitals have benefited hugely from popular local support.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/2">I saw the Secretary of State for Health on Saturday night in Birmingham, listening intently to what people were saying. If they were telling her that they want to keep their community hospitals, I wonder what her reply was. It is one of those consultations where one wonders how much is just for show and how much difference it will make. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">My hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> cited the example of Surbiton hospital, which is temporarily closed. However, as we have heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">the hon. Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase>, these things can sometimes become permanent. It is a worrying trend that my hon. Friend highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> highlighted the absurd situation where the Government seem not to know where they are going with their policy. They have announced a policy, and if anyone had read the Labour manifesto they might have been attracted by that policy. It clearly was not thought through and they are apparently back peddling on it with remarkable speed. It must be a world record.</p>

Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> raised the alarming issue of the treatment of land sales. That worries me because in my area when the Frenchay hospital land is sold off to pay for improvements elsewhere it would be absurd if we not only lost our hospitals, but we were taxed on the undersale of the proceeds. I should be interested to hear the Minister's response to that point.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.1/1">I had better not as I am very tight for time.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/2">The hon. Member for Cotswold, my constituency neighbour, mentioned the important issue of what payment by results means for cottage hospitals. By definition, smaller hospitals are likely to have higher than average costs. If they are receiving payment only at a tariff level&mdash;an average costs level&mdash;they will make a loss on everything that they do. PCTs may make up the difference in some way and bale them out, but if they are broke that will not happen. Do they have a long-term future under a tariff-based payment by results system? The hon. Gentleman raises a good point there.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1859" name="Jeremy Hunt">The hon. Member for South-West Surrey (Mr. Hunt)</phrase> referred to the problem of how we work out how much an area should get and the inequalities that can result. He raised the important issue of the cost of delivering health care. It is not only about deprivation. If it costs more to deliver health care in a particular area, it is important that that is fairly represented in the formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/4">I should like to cite one example. We have already heard about Withernsea, Hornsea, Bicester, Surbiton, Tetbury, Fairford, Moreton-in-Marsh, Cirencester, Haslemere, Farnham and Malmesbury&mdash;a long litany of threatened community hospitals. To that I would add Thornbury in my constituency, and following the precedent set by the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire, I praise the <i>Thornbury Gazette</i>, for its support for the &quot;Save the Thornbury hospital&quot; campaign. I do that because the hospital has just two wards, one of which&mdash;a mental health ward for elderly people&mdash;is being lost. We are left now with one ward on which the number of beds is being cut. It is death by a thousand cuts. The question is: how long will such hospitals survive? At present, the service is provided by the primary care trust. As we have heard, in principle, PCTs may end up not providing services. Is it going to be a private hospital or a voluntary hospital? We just do not know. There is a huge amount of uncertainty, which is damaging local communities and patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/5">I do not think that any of us are defending the status quo. As the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said, none of us is saying that the service should not change or evolve. The service needs key-hole surgery, but it is getting amputation with a rusty hack-saw. That is what is going on in the health service at the moment. By all means, let us have evolution and new roles for community hospitals. Let them, as my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton suggested, take on new services and new local means of delivering health care.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.1/1">That is very much the case. In Thornbury hospital, the range of services providing, for example, intermediate care means that people can see someone close to home. Relatives and friends can just pop in rather than make a long bus journey to make a formal visit. That is good for patient care. It surely ought to be at the heart of the debate, rather than finance-driven cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.1/2">It takes breathtaking mismanagement for the Government to allocate record sums to the NHS, and for us then to see cut after cut throughout the land. That takes some doing. The way forward must be to begin with the patient and the community. If changes are needed, let us make them in co-operation and genuine consultation with local people, listening to them first, rather than producing blueprints long before the consultation begins that are then rubber stamped at the end of the process. We should not try to set our community services in aspic. They need to evolve and change, but what is needed is an imaginative approach, looking at all the good things that community and cottage hospitals can deliver: the potential for what somebody once called a patient-led NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.2/1">We have had a fantastic debate today; I cannot remember the last time that I saw so many colleagues in Westminster Hall: we can call it a truly packed event. It is a particular pleasure to see the shadow Secretary of State for Health <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">here, my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>. That is a mark of the importance that we place on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/2">We have heard a great deal about the threat to patients and carers, and I can admit straightaway to an interest in that there are four community hospitals in my constituency, each of which is, in one way or another, under threat, two of them directly now. There are three on the periphery of my constituency that are similarly under the spotlight. It is an issue about which I feel strongly. We have heard little about the staff who work in such hospitals, and it is worth while putting on record that they are wonderful people who are experts in their field, and who operate in what we might call the less glamorous fringes of our health care system. They deserve our thanks and admiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/3">We have recently conducted a good deal of research on the matter, and I am happy to announce the results of that research. As of this morning there were 89 community hospitals in the country that we believe are under threat of closure or being seriously scaled back. However, it is worse than that. There is a clear correlation between primary care trusts with big deficits and community hospitals that are threatened with closure. That puts a lie to the notion that the exercise is about reconfiguring health care in the interests of local people; it is actually about reconfiguring health service budgets. We must be clear that that is what we are dealing with. That is important because it removes the responsibility from PCTs and puts it clearly where it should be, with the Secretary of State for Health. That is where it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/4">When I saw the Secretary of State a few days ago, she was keen to impress upon me that such matters were for local decision making by PCTs; they had nothing to do with her. The fact that we have found a strong correlation between PCT deficits and community hospital closures shows that that is an issue not for local decision making but for Ministers. They must understand that, and must take responsibility for the closures that we have shown are happening throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/5">We know what the public think; we are in the age of consultation. It was clear from the national bed survey in 2001 that there was overwhelming support for community hospitals. Indeed, the NHS plan said that we would get 5,000 intermediate care beds. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister where she thinks they are&mdash; that was poorly defined in the document. However one defines intermediate care beds, it is difficult to see where they have landed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/6">I have read the 2005 Labour party manifesto. The small part that deals with health underscores the NHS plan and promises, as others have said, a new generation of community hospital. From where my colleagues and I stand, we cannot see a new generation of community hospitals. We see what we have closing down day by day. I shall be interested to hear from the Minister about the new generation of community hospitals. Where will they be? What will they look like? Will they have any beds in them, or will they be the GP mega surgeries or polyclinics that the Government are so keen on? Is that what they really mean by community hospitals? I suspect that there might be some confusion about what is meant by a new generation of community hospitals. If the Minister means souped-up primary care practices, she needs to say so, so that the public are clear about what was meant in the Labour party manifesto of just a few months ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/7">I share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the exasperation of my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, who has been kind enough to give me a copy of Lord Warner's extraordinary letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-17">17 October</phrase>. Lord Warner, the Minister of State, clearly does not have a clue about what he is going to put into community hospitals. My hon. Friend might like to know that the then health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>, wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-22">22 March</phrase> and gave his definition of community hospitals, saying that the important thing is not the building but the services that it provides.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/8">So in March I am told that the services matter, not the bricks and mortar; in May the Government commit to buildings without knowing exactly what will go in them, and by October not only do we find community hospitals closing at an alarming rate, but the Government, clueless and consulting as ever, still have no idea what they are going to do with the new buildings that they promised just five months earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/9">That lack of direction gets worse. As others have said, in March Sir Nigel Crisp put out his extraordinary document &quot;Creating a Patient-led NHS&quot;, in which he ordained that PCTs would divest themselves of the direct provision of services. Yet we have had no news about where community hospitals will lie in the new scheme of things. What does the Minister think? Can we, at long last, have a sense of direction? Will acute trusts take over&mdash;if so, please will she say so&mdash;or will the private, not-for-profit sector take on the hospitals? There would be a certain irony if they did, because that is where they came from in the 1940s. Institutions that had been supported and nurtured by local communities for many years, often the gifts of benefactors, were taken on by the NHS, and the communities that handed them over felt that they were putting them into safe stewardship. Now, under this Government, many of those community hospitals are closing their doors.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.2/10">I add my tribute to those that have been paid to the leagues of friends and others who support such hospitals. Huge voluntary effort goes on in my constituency and throughout the country. The Minister needs to take on board the views of those who support and, frankly, subsidise health care in such a fantastic way.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for coming to my constituency. In New Forest, East, in New Forest, West and in Romsey, five community hospitals are under threat. What does he think about a consultation process whereby the leagues of friends generate a 41,000-name petition and hand it to the chief executive of the PCT, who, on going back into his building, is reliably overheard to say, &quot;Where is the nearest bin?&quot; That is what happened.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend and I was happy to add my name to the early-day motion that he tabled on this subject. I would like to tell him about the consultation that I conducted in Warminster four years ago. It was a fantastic comprehensive exercise, involving no cost to the Treasury, but it was ignored by health policy managers. I need not tell my hon. Friend what the survey showed: there was overwhelming support for Warminster hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/2">What hon. Members have described is happening throughout the country. I suspect that I shall not have time to say much about sham consultation exercises, about &quot;Your health, your care, your say&quot;, which culminated in Birmingham this weekend, and about the myriad regional events held in the run-up to that. All I will say is that it is a betrayal of people's trust if they are invited to take part in a consultation and have their say, but what they have to say is ignored; if people are selective in which surveys they pay attention to; and if people are selective about those whom they invite to contribute in the first place, as is the case with the current survey, which we understand is to inform the White Paper later this year. We will not hold our breath on that, given that if we put rubbish in, we will get rubbish out.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/3">I would like to nail the lie about cost. With respect, I take issue with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, because I think that he is wrong. If we cost the patient journey properly and consider case mix properly, we will find that community hospital costs are substantially less than costs that accrue to treatment in acute units. Those figures are available and are quite stark, and I commend them to the hon. Gentleman. I would also like the Minister's comments on that. At the moment, individual PCT chief executives take decisions on their own bit of budget, usually faced with deficits and adverse district auditor reports. They are obliged to make cuts where they can. That is their duty, what they are employed to do and their legal obligation. They have no choice. We must not blame them; we must pin the blame where it should properly reside, which is with Ministers who have got up this system whereby PCTs find themselves in deficit. They, not PCTs, are driving the closures, and it is important to know that.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/4">The Minister will say that the situation is down to individual PCTs and local decision-making. However, one thing that she cannot avoid responsibility for is public health. Just in passing, I point out that 10 days ago we heard about the contingency plan for epidemic flu, which highlighted the gross shortage of beds that we will have in the eventuality of a pandemic. The Minister cannot absolve herself of responsibility for allowing for bed space. It seems bizarre, at a time when we are clearly so short of bed space for the emergency that the chief medical officer says will arise, that we should even contemplate closing down intermediate care beds in the way in which that is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.1/5">We have had a fantastic debate today, the best that I can remember in this place. If the Minister has any doubt at all about the feelings of people in our constituencies, I invite her to visit any one of them that has been represented here today. If she comes to west Wiltshire, she will be sure to get the message.</p>

It has raised a number of interesting issues and it certainly shows the depth of feeling that there is about community hospitals.

	<p pid="a.280.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an astute point, and I come now to the issue of increased expenditure. What is encouraging about the debate is the fact that many Conservative Members, as well as the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, have agreed that expenditure on the NHS has increased; nobody has said that it has decreased. There have been comments about the formula, but given the consensus that expenditure on the NHS has increased dramatically, it is important to recognise that the Government expect proper financial management of that expenditure. It was the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness who said that there had not been proper financial management in the past. Were any other political party represented here to be in Government, I cannot imagine it simply saying that there was no need for good financial management. Quite honestly, that would do patients and the public no good at all. I hope, therefore, that we can agree on the need for good, rigorous financial management.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.0/1">I am not sure whether the Minister was concurring with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> that concerns about reducing spending in the Oxfordshire health economy by &pound;35 million in one year were, as he put it, no more than hyperventilating and posturing. I would welcome the Minister coming to Oxfordshire, but the point is that, although we all accept that public finances must be properly managed, it is simply impossible to make slash-and-burn cuts in one year. The Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS trust cannot find savings of &pound;35 million between now and April, but the strategic health authority was incapable of telling us whether Ministers would be willing to allow those savings to be made over a period of years. When one writes to Ministers, however, they say that the issue is the responsibility of the SHA. What is driving us all mad is that we can find no one in the system who will take responsibility for anything.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">Perhaps I can come to the process of consultation on reconfigurations. If we agree that it is important that trusts deal with the financial deficits, we then come to the issue of how they deal with them. Let me briefly answer some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the questions asked by the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, of which he gave me notice. Of 303 PCTs, 170&mdash;or 56 per cent.&mdash;are in financial balance, with no planned support. If we take account of those with some financial support, we see that 70 per cent. are in financial balance. Some 25 per cent. have deficits, but the majority of those are quite small, although some trusts have larger deficits. I hope that that is helpful in answering the hon. Gentleman's questions.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.2/1">Do the Government accept any responsibility for setting up PCTs in the first place and, in the case of Yorkshire Wolds and Coast primary care trust, for the deficit from the beginning, or is everything the PCTs' fault? Do the Government continue to say, &quot;It's nothing to do with us&quot;?</p>

	<p pid="a.281.3/1">If PCTs have inherited deficits, that is, as I said, because there have been problems with financial management. It is absolutely right that the Government should deal with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.3/2">As for the consultation on the proposals, the hon. Gentleman described a process in which the PCTs had been talking to local people; it sounded quite thorough. However, he said that he did not feel that there was any accountability in the process, and that PCTs seemed already to have made up their minds. I have two comments: first, our clear position is that PCTs must rigorously consult their communities. Secondly, it is important that when decisions of the sort in question are being made PCTs should have in mind the general thrust of national policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.3/3">We have made a clear commitment to community hospitals within that general thrust, but the PCTs will, at the moment, be dealing with the financial deficits that they face, and considering how best to provide services within that context. In some instances that will mean difficult decisions. I agree with the important point that arose in the debate, which is that we need greater transparency in the deciding of priorities in different areas. There has been discussion of health inequalities and the differences in population mix between areas. That is an important aspect of the way forward to the development of a modern, reformed NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.3/4">I remind hon. Members that there are overview and scrutiny committees. I am not sure how many of the reconfigurations that have been mentioned today have been referred to them. In addition, I have been working on patient forums, focusing particularly on approaches to be used when there is a closer relationship between local authorities and health authorities. Many hon. Members have referred to changes in the provision of the relevant services nowadays, and many of them gave good examples of improvements that could be made. However, accountability is an important point and we need to think carefully about how to improve it.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.1/1">I will not give way. There are only two minutes left, and I am aware that I have not dealt with all the points that hon. Members have made. I want to set out some principles. The White Paper consultation that hon. Members have alluded to has been thorough. Many hon. Members have asked what the Government's vision is for community hospitals, but it is difficult to say that before the consultation that we have talked about has been carried out. <i>[Interruption.]</i> Six months ago in a manifesto, yes.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">We have committed about &pound;100 million to developing community hospitals. It is ludicrous to think that we can finalise all the details in such a short time. We have made it clear that we have ideas about some services, and hon. Members have come up with ideas today. Examples are the possibilities for day surgery and diagnostic services. It might, indeed, be possible for GP or dentistry services to be offered in community hospitals. The important point is that we are committed to considering a new generation of community hospitals, backed up by investment, but we want to consult thoroughly on the services that people want locally. It will vary by area.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/3">I acknowledge that that is happening against a background in which PCTs are closely examining the services that they offer, to deal with financial deficits. However, it would be wrong to claim that those deficits should be ignored.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Gale, for giving me the opportunity to talk about road accidents on the A47 in Norfolk. I am pleased to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1738" name="Richard Bacon">my hon. Friends the Members for South Norfolk (Mr. Bacon)</phrase> and for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser) in the Chamber. The hon. Members for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb) and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson) sent their apologies; they could not be here, but they support the thrust of the debate. The Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> is also aware of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">This is Westminster Hall, so this must be another debate urging Ministers to consider the A47. I have lost count of the number of debates on the A47 that I have secured or participated in since I was elected in 1997. There have also been at least two delegations with other hon. Members to see Ministers, hundreds of letters and dozens of meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3">Since December 2004, work on dualling the A47 has actually regressed, with the Government deciding to downgrade the A47 from a strategic route to one of regional priority, for decision by a regional transport board. The Minister probably knows that that caused real anger and frustration in Norfolk across the political parties and in a wide range of communities. Almost a year later, we still have no date for the establishment of the regional transport board, and we do not know who its members will be or what its powers will be. Will the Minister enlighten us with those details when he sums up? Even when the regional transport board is established, Norfolk's A47 will have to fight for priority with dozens of probably equally worthy schemes in the eastern region. Will the Minister confirm that the regional funding allocation for the eastern region in the next three years is not sufficient even to meet existing commitments?</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">The Minister will know that particular schemes to dual certain priority sections of the A47, which were agreed before December 2004, have now slipped into the regional melting pot. We have consistently argued for the dualling of the A47 on the grounds of road safety, east-west communications, and meeting the criteria of alleviating social deprivation, particularly in areas such as Great Yarmouth, and encouraging economic development&mdash;ironically, criteria that were all established by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">The A47 is inadequate to meet the existing traffic flows of Norfolk's population, even without the demand made by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for Norfolk to provide 78,000 extra homes in the next decade. I shall use this short debate to deal with the specific issue of road accidents on the A47 in Norfolk, particularly on the stretch of the A47 west of Norwich from North Tuddenham to Easton. Many other stretches of the road affect hon. Members who are in the Chamber today, but I shall focus on that particular stretch of the road because of a fatal accident that has provoked widespread anger and dismay among my constituents and a demand for ministerial action. They want no more studies, no more promises, and no more evasions; they want action, not words, on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-03">3 October</phrase>, a major accident occurred on the A47 where the C539 Mattishall road meets the A47 just east of Honingham. The crash involved a car, a fuel tanker, a low loader, another HGV and a van. David Jackson, a 19-year-old, was seriously injured, and, despite their best efforts, medical teams could not save his life. Quite understandably, his mother, Mrs. Andrea Jackson, is distraught, but she is equally determined to ensure that action is taken to prevent another parent from losing another child under such circumstances. That tragic death has galvanised local communities in villages such as Mattishall and Dereham, as well as in Norwich. A fortnight after that incident, I happened to visit the Neatherd high school in Dereham and was lobbied by the school children, many of whom had known the young man. That accident is but one that has resulted in previous deaths and injuries along the A47. The hon. Member for Great Yarmouth and I share a stretch of the A47 known as the Acle straight, where if one has the misfortune to come off the road and land in a ditch and one cannot be pulled out one drowns. That is totally unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/7">Another consequence of the accident on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-03">3 October</phrase> was that the A47 was shut for nearly 12 hours and diversions occurred through Fakenham in the north and Thetford in the south, miles and miles away. That has frequently happened on other stretches of the A47, including the Acle straight. When it happens in Great Yarmouth, a large sea port is cut off, something that did not happen even in the time of Horatio Nelson. Only yesterday there was another accident on the A47 along a similar stretch with yet more delays.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/8">So what would I like from the Minister today? A commitment that the Highways Agency will use its small programme of works to alleviate the inherent dangers associated with the stretch that I have been talking about. The preferred solution by local residents is that they should consider a roundabout at the Wood lane-Honingham junction of the A47. That is to save lives in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.0/1">The main issue for which we have argued for a considerable time is safety. While we are arguing for the dualling of the A47, the most important thing we are after regarding the Acle straight and the safety measures mentioned by the hon. Gentleman is for the work to be carried out quickly to alleviate any further loss of life or severe accidents. That is a quick fix. The long-term issue is the dualling of the road. Does the hon. Gentleman agree?</p>

	<p pid="a.284.1/1">I would certainly agree. The hon. Gentleman and I are veterans of other debates on the A47. We are all committed to the dualling of the whole of the A47 but we realise that that is probably in the long grass. We are looking now for remedial measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.2/1">My hon. Friend makes the point that we recognise that the dualling may take longer. Does he recognise that a roundabout is something that cannot wait any longer? I speak with a personal interest in that my private secretary lives in Mattishall and was a friend of the family of David Jackson. She tells me that local people hate using that junction and turning right to head east into Norwich and will avoid it at almost any cost.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.285.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="285"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h02.htm#51102h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.285.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a strong point, for which I thank him: I know that road only too well and one takes one's life in one's hands there. I am sure the Minister is aware that the real danger is not the consequence of the accidents along the east-west thrust of the A47, but in all the small communities north and south having to try to get across it. East of Norwich we have a similar problem around the village of Lingwood and there is also a major problem for the lorries and cars trying to get to the sugar beet factory at Cantley. That is my first point to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/2">Secondly, will the Highways Agency bring forward its priority review of those sections of the A47 in view of the increasing congestion and the unacceptable record along the length of the route, and will that action will be initiated as soon as possible? The road accident figures relating to the section of the A47 to which I referred underline my case. There have been six fatal accidents in which nine people died, 18 serious injuries and 55 slight injury accidents on that length of the A47 in the past six years. Of that total, three accidents in which five people died and three serious injury accidents occurred at the junction known as Wood lane-Honingham. The accident severity ratio for the length of the route over the six-year period is over 60 per cent. higher than the national average for similar types of road. That is not acceptable and my constituents are no longer prepared to accept it.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/3">The average daily traffic flow is almost 22,000 vehicles per day; nearly 50 per cent.&mdash;about 14,000&mdash;above the threshold for dualling. By the Government's own criteria, many stretches of the A47 should be dualled. There is a morning peak-hour flow in the area of more than 2,000 vehicles per hour, making the road both difficult and, at some junctions, such as that with the C539, extremely hazardous.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/4">Potential new housing allocations at Dereham from the local development plan could well result in an additional 2,000 dwellings, seeing a further increase in road traffic. Apart from the cost in human life and in injuries from such accidents, let me tell the Minister of a financial equation. I understand that the cost of fatal and serious accidents at the particular stretch of the A47 that we are debating was &pound;3.25 million during the past three years. During the past six years, the cost was &pound;5.1 million. The cost of a roundabout, which has been proposed by the county council and is the favoured option of local residents&mdash;I agree that it is one remedial option&mdash;is about &pound;750,000. It makes financial as well as humane sense to undertake that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/5">I have been supported by members of the A47 alliance, which meets regularly. I represent all the local MPs of all political parties, county councillors, district councillors, representatives of the local communities and local businesses. I am meeting Mrs. Andrea Jackson on Friday afternoon to discuss what further action needs to be taken. She has raised a petition from more than 2,000 people demanding action.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/6">I have put forward what I hope are reasonable suggestions for remedial work to meet the immediate problem, not negating our long-term aim for dualling. I hope that the Minister can give us some positive words that I can take back to Mrs. Jackson and other constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> for allowing me to make a specific point about an accident on the A47 in my constituency. I also thank the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/2">I rise in support of all that my hon. Friend has said. The issues of the A47 have gone on for quite a long time, as I know the Minister is aware. I hope that we will see some imminent action on the problems raised. Specifically, I want to draw the Minister's attention to an accident on the A47 in my constituency that closed that part of the road for approximately 15 hours on Friday evening. The accident happened on a single carriageway stretch of the road and involved a car, a van and a bus. The bus's fuel tank ruptured and there was a huge diesel leak on the road, which needed to be resurfaced. That meant that lengthy diversions had to be put in place, which not only affected my constituents but members of the public across the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/3">Our roads in Norfolk clearly cannot cope, not only with the accidents on the A47 but with the consequential problems on the minor roads around them. When something goes wrong on the A47, it takes a great deal of time to sort it out. The accident to which I referred was the third in four days involving a bus on the A47. I need not tell the Minister how important it is to make sure that our public transport works well and, in addition, that it also works safely and in an environment in which passengers feel comfortable.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/4">The road is unsafe and unfit for traffic conditions in the 21st century. It must, as my hon. Friend says, be dualled and the Government must find the money to make that possible. Investment in the roads infrastructure in East Anglia is a disgrace. The A47 is a vital link for business in the area, for commuters and for private motorists. It is not acceptable for the Government to tell us that the A47 and the A11, which faces similar problems, should compete for funding from the East of England regional assembly because they are not significant enough to merit central funding. Would that be the answer if those roads were in the Government heartlands in the north of England? How many more people must die, how many more major accidents must happen, and how much more traffic chaos must there be before the Government understand the problems we face in Norfolk?</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/5">Finally, I want to add to my hon. Friend's points about the cost of upgrading the A47. There is another figure that we should bear in mind. The accidents are estimated to have cost Norfolk around &pound;60 million, based on Government figures including ambulance, police and hospital costs, losses to employers and so on. Is it reasonable that people in Norfolk should bear such a financial burden as a result of the failure to develop a proper roads infrastructure in the county? I believe it is not. I hope that the Minister will take that into account in his response.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.0/1">I begin with an apology. I have done what you did, Mr. Gale, two or three years ago. I have come into Westminster Hall and discovered that my poppy has fallen out. That is a crime made even worse by the fact that it was the poppy that you bought me at the Festival of Remembrance in Margate on Friday night. I promise to replace it.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> on securing the debate. This is a stretch of road that he has long taken an interest in, and I understand his concern about the accidents that are happening on this road. I also share the concerns of other hon. Members present today, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/3">Let me start by asking the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk to pass on my deepest sympathy to the family and friends of those who have been tragically killed on this stretch of road, particularly in the accident that he described. It always saddens me when, despite everything we are trying to do to improve safety on our roads, there are fatalities and accidents. I want to assure the House that the Highways Agency and the Government take road safety very seriously and are committed to improving safety on the road network. Our targets are challenging. We intend to reduce the number of adults killed on our roads by 40 per cent. and the number of children killed or seriously injured by 50 per cent. by 2010 compared with the average for 1994&ndash;98.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/4">In 2004, 3,221 people were killed in road crashes and 31,130 were seriously injured. That is 28 per cent. below the baseline and over two thirds of the way to our 40 per cent. target. In 2004, 166 children were killed in road crashes and 3,739 were seriously injured. This is 43 per cent. below the baseline and over three quarters of the way to the 50 per cent. target. So we are making progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/5">The most recent figures for the A47 in Norfolk originate from the local authority rather than the Highways Agency and are for the period from January 2000 up to September 2005. They show a total of 40 fatal, 149 serious and 717 slight accidents, totalling 906 for the period. The cold statistics hide the personal tragedies of every single one of those fatalities. Nevertheless, the severity index rate, which is the number of fatal or serious injury collisions divided by the total collisions for the A47 in Norfolk is 21 per cent. That is the same level as other national rural trunk roads in Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/6">Such comparisons are always invidious, but if we compare the accident rates based on the period from 2000 to 2004, the approximate accident rate per 100 vehicle kilometres on the A47 in Norfolk is 16, compared with a national figure for road casualties on similar rural roads in Great Britain of 27. Although the incidents on this road are stark and serious and each one is a tragedy, the road is not grossly more dangerous than other similar roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.1/1">It is often said that if one tortures statistics for long enough one can make them confess to anything. Does the Minister agree that not only do the statistics hide the personal tragedies, but they do not take account of hot spots? The fact that Norfolk, with only 800,000 people, is England's second largest county of course means that statistics may look skewed in one direction. If one were to take a more accurate assessment of the land area occupied by people, rather than the fields of sugar beet, barley and wheat, one would get a very different result. We still need to deal with the question of hot spots.</p>

	<p pid="a.288.0/1">I understand the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. That was what I was trying to get over by saying that each of these statistics hides a personal tragedy. I realise that we can twist these statistics all day long. I can probably prove that this is a very safe road and hon. Members can prove that it is a very dangerous road. The fact is we must do something to deal with the tragedies that are happening on this road. I entirely take that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.0/2">I was saddened to hear about the recent accident at Honingham. I do not want to discuss that accident in detail because we have yet to see the reports from the coroner's inquest, but I can tell the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk that in the event of a fatality on the roads network the Highways Agency always undertakes a study of the accident and if more detailed investigations are recommended as a result, independent safety engineers are asked to carry out a further investigation study which would try to identify possible improvements in safety measure on that stretch of road. The recommendations are targeted at preventing similar types of accidents occurring and the study into the accident that we are discussing is under way. I will ensure that the hon. Gentleman's constituents' idea of a roundabout is considered, and if that is the best way of making certain that such an accident does not happen again&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.288.1/1">In June, I raised the matter of an accident on the Acle straight in my constituency involving Glenn Francham, who drowned in the dyke, a matter to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> referred. The Minister said at the time of the debate that she expected the information to be gathered in the not-too-distant future and hoped to come forward with a decision based on the safety aspects that were required to prevent a similar accident. It is now 10 months down the road from that accident. Can the Minister shed some light on when we can expect a decision on the safety measures to be implemented on that stretch of road?</p>

	<p pid="a.288.2/1">I shall deal with the Acle straight in detail in a few moments, but first I shall share something that I have observed since I became Minister with responsibility for roads. I have frequently had to look at studies on stretches of roads that go back decades. They come across my desk and my immediate thought is to say, &quot;Why on earth was this not sorted out years ago?&quot; But when I look at the complexities of such stretches of road it becomes clear why decisions have not been taken quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.288.2/2">The Acle straight is a case in point. There are some extremely difficult environmental problems to be overcome if work is to be carried out on that road. I entirely understand the economic and safety arguments; I would be blind not to, but it is a nightmare to find a way of doing the sort of work for which my hon. Friend, and, no doubt, other hon. Members, have campaigned for many years without damaging the sensitive environment through which the road passes&mdash;the heritage landscape, the biodiversity, the flora and fauna&mdash;and getting agreement to do it from the Environment Agency and the other people who are trying to protect the countryside. However, I can give my hon. Friend a guarantee that I am absolutely determined to crack that problem one way or another and to come to a decision on how best to move forward on the matter. I will give him details of how that decision will be arrived at in a moment.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.1/1">If I may, I want first to make a little progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/2">Some safety improvements on the A47 at Honingham have already been implemented in the past few years. I understand that early in 2003, safety improvements were implemented at the Taverham road-Blind lane and Mattishall road junctions, which involved changing road markings, including providing ladder hatching with red infill, the installation of high-friction surfacing on approaches to the junctions, improvements to signing and the provision of road studs and hazard marker posts. Those measures were designed to address accidents on the stretch of road that was identified in a 2002 safety study. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said no more studies, but studies lead to work eventually.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.2/1">I understand what the Minister is saying. It sounds as if I am being churlish, but it is only in the sense that eight years have made me and my constituents very churlish. There has been some remedial work, but although I can understand the Minister's brief and the financial restraints, we are not prepared to accept that any longer. I understand the environmental problems, but tell that to the people who have been involved in accidents on the Acle straight. The life cycle of rare newts does not equate to human life, and we must get real about that. I welcome the Minister's comment that the Highways Agency might consider the option of a roundabout, but from what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> said, the study is likely to last 10 months or two years. My constituents are not prepared to put up with the situation any more. We want action now.

	<p pid="a.289.3/1">Money has been spent on the road junction where the accident happened. There was another set of road improvements at the junction in 2004, involving changes to the give way sign and road markings and the addition of a new map-style, advanced direction sign to help people navigate their way through the area. Money is being spent. We must take the evidence of experts on the best way of dealing with these issues, and the study will identify those best ways forward. If it is clear that we can save lives by doing remedial work such as building a roundabout, I will look keenly at doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/2">As for the Acle straight, if&mdash;it is a big if&mdash;at the end of all the deliberations, in the next month or two, I decide that we should go ahead with some improvements to that road, I shall look to the hon. Gentleman, his constituents and my hon. Friend to be at my shoulder when I take the brickbats from the environmental people, who will not make jokes about newts and will not take these issues lightly. They will demand that the decision should be reversed and that the Government should be overthrown.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.0/1">I assure my hon. Friend that he would have 110 per cent. support from both sides of the House, all the local authorities, and every part of my constituency if he were brave enough to take that on, because all that we have been arguing, in relation to the whole stretch of the A47, is whether to put environmental considerations above those of the lives of road users. I know where I stand on that, and I do not accept the environmental argument that the proposed changes would do untold damage to any stretch of that road, including the Acle straight.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.1/2">In the last minute or so left, I move quickly to the issue of making the decision. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk is right to say that we have asked for regional prioritisation of the scheme. His constituents might find that disappointing, but I shall tweak him slightly by reminding him that it was the Conservative Government in 1996 who decided to reduce the roads programme by removing a large number of schemes from it. Many of the schemes in the tranche that they took out involved dualling the A47 in Norfolk. Since then, of course&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.290.3/1">Let me make some progress. Since then we have carried out some multi-modal studies in the area to identify how we can improve traffic on the A47. The decision to seek regional prioritisation for road schemes is perfectly sensible. Ministers do not know best about what is happening everywhere in the country. As has been said, we have a lot less money than we have ideas for how to spend it on the road system. It would be much better if local people were to help us to prioritise those decisions by telling us which ones are most important to them. All we want to do with regional prioritisation is to seek advice on which Ministers will ultimately take decisions. We expect that regional prioritisation to be with us in January, and we will make decisions early in the new year. Hopefully there will be some announcements that the hon. Gentleman likes then.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/2">As I said earlier, the decision regarding the Acle straight is difficult. I intend to go there and see it for myself before making that decision, because I want to see what part of the environment so desperately needs protecting and what the safety issues are. I promise that that will happen soon.</p>

	Primary Care and Ambulance Trusts
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.291.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="291"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.291.1/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to open this debate, particularly under your expert chairmanship, Mr. Chope.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/2">The reconfiguration of primary care trusts and ambulance trusts has concerned Members throughout the country. The timing over the summer, the lack of consultation with MPs, clinicians and PCTs and the rushed timetable have worried us all, but the Secretary of State for Health has already apologised for much of that, so I will not dwell on it. However, the impression left is still that strategic health authorities have come up with a plan based on Sir Nigel Crisp's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase> commissioning a patient-led NHS, and that that plan&mdash;a one-size-fits-all formula&mdash;will be forced through despite local views.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/3">In Staffordshire and Shropshire, we had a short pre-consultation period, from <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-16">16 September</phrase>. The responses were mostly critical of the recommendations, but the recommendations went forward to the Secretary of State unchanged.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/4">There have been far too many NHS reorganisations. The NHS craves and needs stability, not permanent revolution. I recognise that there is a need for some changes&mdash;first, to strengthen commissioning in order to hold acute hospitals to account, and secondly, to bring PCTs together if that makes sense&mdash;for instance, in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/5">The reconfiguration does not seem to recognise what PCTs have already achieved. In my constituency, the PCT has done wonders for that semi-rural, former mining area of Staffordshire. For the first time, services are designed for my constituents, not for the people who live in Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/6">I shall give a few examples. The local out-of-hours GP clinics now run every weekend, which avoids about 250 patients a month travelling 10 to 20 miles to Stoke-on-Trent. The PCT employs community matrons to work proactively with GPs, which avoids 6,000 emergency hospital admissions every year, and saves about &pound;6 million. There is also a joint health improvement plan, involving the voluntary sector, housing associations, local government, GPs and local employers in promoting local public health. That is just what PCTs are supposed to be doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/7">The strategic health authority proposal is to stick Staffordshire, Moorlands into a giant, county-wide PCT, to be coterminous with social services. However, that ignores the fact that north Staffordshire is already a natural health economy, with key north Staffordshire partnerships including the northern area social services department and the north Staffordshire police division. A county-wide PCT would weaken the commissioning of NHS services&mdash;not strengthen them, as the Government want&mdash;because Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme and the Moorlands already speak with one voice in regard to negotiations with the acute hospital. They already share functions and staff. A Staffordshire PCT would be far more remote than the old North Staffordshire health authority that we got rid of.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/8">The only evidence so far that anyone is listening is that the Secretary of State has rowed back from the ban on PCTs employing community staff. However, all the uncertainty is still causing anxiety and a slump in staff morale. We need to know what the impact will be on PCTs that run community hospitals such as Leek. Will PCTs be able to continue to provide those services directly?</p>

	<p pid="a.292.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that this issue goes further than the uncertainty that PCTs are subject to because of the Government's drive for yet one more reorganisation? Is it not also the case that in some PCTs some managers welcome yet another opportunity to lose their deficits and to progress in career terms? It is not always the case that senior staff are being forced reluctantly down the aggregation road? In some cases that is happening with their consent and approval.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.292.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="292"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.292.1/1">In some circumstances, yes. I am pleased to say that within my own PCT I am working closely with both the chairman and the chief executive. They both recognise that it makes no sense to move the community hospitals to alternative providers when no such providers are available at the moment. It makes no sense to look for contractors when the goal is to provide better patient pathways, not greater fragmentation of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/2">The Government tell us that public services should modernise and learn from best practice. But no other ambulance service has learned the lessons from Staffordshire. It has been the best service for 10 years. The Minister knows all about it. Not only has it been the best, it has been the cheapest emergency ambulance service. Let us consider some of the facts: 86 per cent. of all emergency calls are met within eight minutes compared with a national average of 62 per cent. The NHS target is 75 per cent. but many ambulance services are not meeting it. Yet still the lessons from Staffordshire are not being learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/3">More lives are saved by ambulance services in Staffordshire than elsewhere. They achieve 200 successful resuscitations from cardiac arrests every year. Staffordshire is the cheapest service. Why? Because it is the most efficient. It can treat 40 per cent. of emergency and urgent responses at home saving &pound;100 per hospital visit. That amounts to &pound;9 million per year, which is worth saving and also avoids unnecessary and stressful ambulance transports to hospital. How has that been achieved? Not by fiddling the figures as some would have it and not by tinkering at the margins. It has been achieved by using an entirely different operational system. It is called system status management.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/4">When it was introduced it caused tremendous anxiety and hostility. I know. I was working for the trade union at the time. It is a radical and innovative system which demands total and absolute commitment from staff. Emergency demand was analysed in great detail. As a result, an operating plan has been created that places available ambulances where life-threatening demand is expected. It puts more crews on duty when demand is highest. The rapid emergency call-answering system means that ambulances are dispatched immediately. There is no wasted time deciding what priority the call should have.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/5">That is not all. Staffordshire is a highly rural constituency. Many of my constituents live in small villages in isolated communities. Staffordshire ambulance has therefore developed its own community first responders. In Staffordshire, Moorlands I have 170 of these people. They are fully trained to ambulance technician standard. These trained volunteers arrive within four minutes of a 999 call, backed up by community paramedics with additional treatment and advanced skills. Back at base&mdash;ambulance control&mdash;there is always a doctor to diagnose the patient. The crew is backed up via a telemedicine system, ensuring that life-saving treatment, such as the use of clot-busting drugs, can be started in the ambulance before the patient even gets to the hospital. That is about being patient focused.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/6">The emergency response costs of a future west midlands merged ambulance service based on Staffordshire's operation would be &pound;64 million. Based on the west midlands operation, it would be &pound;83 million and would deliver a poorer service. Time and again I have heard Ministers say that the objective is to bring the rest of the west midlands up to Staffordshire's standards. Let us not kid ourselves. Staffordshire's performance has been achieved over 10 years of development. It has been achieved only through the determination and vision of one man, Roger Thayne, the chief executive of Staffordshire ambulance.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/7">The NHS is hugely resistant to change. Ambulance services have for years known why Staffordshire is better, but they have been unwilling to follow in Staffordshire's footsteps. It will not happen with this merger; in fact, the reality of reorganisation is that the ambulance system in the west midlands will be disturbed for some time. No one has yet considered the size of the operational unit. Costs increase massively with an operational unit of more than 2 million people.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/8">The original proposal, by Peter Bradley, was for 28 ambulance services. That would have created a Staffordshire and Shropshire ambulance service for about 1.5 million people, which would make absolute sense, as the two counties are similar and it would be within efficient operational dimensions. However, one service covering the whole of the west midlands is unworkable, especially if there is to be only one call centre. That would be madness.</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/9">One of my constituents, from Shirburn road, Leek, sums it up:</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/10" class="indent">&quot;My wife suffered a heart attack three years ago in the early hours of the morning. Within three minutes of making a 999 call the paramedic arrived, followed three minutes later by the ambulance. We feel her excellent recovery was largely due to the quick response and expertise of the service we are very lucky to have in place. We feel strongly that the merger with other areas will only result in a much less efficient service where lives would be put at risk. We cannot stress too strongly how much we are against such a merger.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.292.1/11">I have had loads of other letters like that.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.0/1">I am following everything that hon. Lady has said and I agree with everything so far. However, does she agree that the same circumstances that apply to the ambulance service, and the losses in local knowledge that will result from that, apply to the fire service as well? Presumably, therefore, she will object to the regionalisation of the fire services into a smaller number of regions, which the Government are bulldozing through as well?</p>

	<p pid="a.294.0/1">No, I do not accept that, because the success of Staffordshire ambulance is not all about local knowledge, but the operating system as well. It can track its ambulances wherever they are, which is an entirely different situation from that in the fire service.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/2">In conclusion, I ask the Minister a number of questions. Can he assure me that the consultation on the PCT configuration and the ambulance mergers is not a foregone conclusion, as we are led to believe by the SHA, and that there is not a one-size-fits-all plan to which all PCTs must comply, which will not take on board local circumstances? Can he assure me too that PCTs will be able not only to employ community health staff but to run community hospitals, as they do so well in Leek at present? Will it be their choice, not that of the SHA? On ambulances, will he assure me that Lord Warner, the Minister of State, will learn the lessons from Staffordshire ambulance, and that Staffordshire ambulance will maintain full operational independence with its own call centre, so that it can continue to perform as the best and cheapest ambulance service in the country?</p>

	<p pid="a.294.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on her eloquent speech. I know from many discussions since the summer recess that the situation in Leeds is replicated throughout the country. At the end of July, a tablet of stone was dropped down from the Department of Health. On it were etched two commandments: first, there should be fewer PCTs; and secondly, PCTs should divest themselves of service provision. MPs were invited in by West Yorkshire strategic health authority and were told&mdash;not consulted&mdash;about what was expected of the SHAs and the PCTs. When we spoke to PCTs, they clearly felt that they had been guilty of failure without any investigation, evidence or trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/2">MPs in Leeds have generally found the PCT configuration as it stands to be very effective. The PCTs have adopted a very effective approach&mdash;they assess need and commission local services accordingly. They have also been robust in their relationship with Leeds acute trust, and have, I stress, developed services to meet local needs. Indeed, community services in Leeds were successfully transferred to PCTs from the then community mental health trust in order to achieve just such an improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/3">West Leeds, one of the PCTs in my area, is developing a rapid response team, the aim of which is to avoid unnecessary admissions of older people to hospital. That is a big problem in Leeds. Statistics show that we hospitalise too many people and keep them there for too long. In addition, a respiratory team is being developed so that people can be treated in the community rather than in hospital, and we have a team of advanced specialist practitioners who work with patients who have already had multiple admissions to hospital, and who regularly require the assistance of their GP.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/4">If we have a problem with the NHS in Leeds, it is with the acute trust, and with the measures that it has been forced to take despite massive extra investment to deal with its deficit. The shortcomings of the trust have been largely responsible for the loss of some of the PCTs' star ratings.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/5">I am aware that many hon. Members want to participate in this debate, as they do in any discussion on the issue, so I shall conclude, like my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, by asking the Minister a few questions. First, and most importantly, what was broken in Leeds? What needed to be fixed? We would be grateful if he could tell us.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/6">Secondly, there must be proper recognition that the process that was so eloquently described by my hon. Friend was fatally flawed. It is to the credit of Ministers that there has already been some acknowledgement of that, but they have not gone far enough. Thirdly, it must be made crystal clear&mdash;I make no apology for reiterating the comments of my hon. Friend&mdash;that PCTs will continue to be service providers where they so wish. Statements so far have moved in the right direction, but not far enough to assuage the concerns of my constituents, the PCTs in my area and organisations such as the Royal College of Nursing which, I understand, might even seek judicial review.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/7">My final point is that reconfiguration proposals that have already been submitted should be viewed in the context of a flawed process. They are not carefully considered plans for the improvement of commissioning and services. They are an acquiescent response to the commandments set down in Sir Nigel Crisp's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>. As such, they must be revisited.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.295.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" speakername="Paul Burstow" colnum="295"  time="14:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.295.0/1">I, too, will try to limit my contribution, as there is a lot of interest in the subject. Like everybody, I am interested in the way in which my local health service is developing and in the threat to continuity of care and to working relationships between the PCT, local authorities and other agencies. Sutton and Merton primary care trust has good working relationships with my local authority, the London borough of Sutton. It is making progress on a host of the issues that the Government would be interested in, including integration of services, and it is a key player in the development of the local community plan and strategy. However, because of the Government's requirement for it to look at reconfiguration, all of that must necessarily be put to one side or given a lower priority than it would otherwise get. At all levels of the PCT, people are thinking about their own future and that of the organisation; that is the nature of reorganisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/2">One of my concerns is that PCTs came fully into existence across the country only in April 2002. We have had some three years in which to assess whether they are fit for purpose and can do the job of providing and commissioning services, as well as holding GPs and other parts of the health economy to account. How can the Government have formed the clear view, as we heard, that they are failing organisations that need to be cast into uncertainty and made to reorganise?</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/3">What criteria are the Government using to evaluate the effectiveness of PCTs&mdash;they have been around for only three years&mdash;and how long will the new structures be allowed to stand before they, too, are subject to further review? We seem to go through cycles&mdash;big is beautiful, then small is beautiful, then big is beautiful again. Many of the proposals, which include London, would make SHAs coterminous with regional offices. Only a few years ago, Ministers stood at the Dispatch Box and said that the NHS no longer needed a regional tier. We are now back with a regional tier. When will these constant changes stop? As important, when will they stop giving the appearance that they are change for change's sake?</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/4">I have some questions on divesting the services. Sir Nigel Crisp's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase> to primary care trusts and strategic health authorities seemed incredibly clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the direction of travel is clear: PCTs will become patient-led and commissioning-led organisations with their role in provision reduced to a minimum. We would expect all changes to be completed by the end of 2008.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/6">The RCN is seeking a judicial review on that subject. However, Sir Nigel's statement seemed to be slightly qualified in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-26">26 August</phrase> from John Bacon on &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot;. It said that we do not have to reorganise the way in which services are provided by October 2006, and that it does not have to happen until 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/7">That has left PCTs uncertain about whether, in the longer term, the Government intend that PCTs should focus on commissioning and provide a minimum of services or, as we heard in Health questions last week, that services may be retained. No one can plan sensibly or rationally in such a situation. The Government must be clear about what is to happen. I certainly need clarity in my patch, because it is in the midst of a major reconfiguration of services under the health care close to home initiative. That involves the establishment of local care hospitals&mdash;they will provide many services hitherto provided by the acute trust&mdash;and a new critical care hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/8">The problem with such projects is that they can go on for decades&mdash;and that one certainly will. Who will form the decision-making body for it? Will that body still be around to account for any errors in judgment? Will the decision makers still be around? There may be no continuity, but continuity is essential in order to ensure that those projects are completed on time and on budget, and that they deliver the sort of health care close to home that my constituents want.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/9">I end with a question about the proposals for my patch. There may be some sense in having one SHA for London, but I am concerned that everyone might move up a size and that PCTs would step into the shoes of the old SHAs. The PCTS may thus become remote organisations, and in a few years' time people may say that they are too far away from the public to understand local health needs and that we need new, smaller PCTs. I hope for an assurance that, if the PCT has well established local relationships, a strong case can be made for it being genuinely coterminous with the local authority, which would lead to the integration of local services. If not, we will be going backwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/10">I want clarity on the direction of travel. Have the Government put the brakes on? Are they going backwards, or are they going round in circles? We also need clarity on whether coterminosity can deliver joined-up services on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate. Hers is a neighbouring constituency. I welcome the Minister to Westminster Hall. I assure him that I am the first to recognise the huge difference that the Labour Government have made to investment in our NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">I want to focus principally on the future role of primary care trusts, particularly what is happening on the ground following the Department of Health document &quot;Commissioning a patient-led NHS&quot;. That does not mean that the ambulance service is not important to me. I simply do not want to repeat what was said by my hon. Friend. She spoke powerfully and persuasively on the matter as it affects our county, and I agree with her 100 per cent. about the Staffordshire ambulance service. Nor do I wish to dwell on the way in which the document was issued, save to say that the ineptitude over the summer was truly mind-boggling. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has since apologised for the way in which that was done.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">The Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4" class="indent">&quot;district nurses, health visitors and other staff who deliver services in the community will continue to be employed by the PCT unless and until it decides otherwise.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-25">25 October 2005</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 152.]</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/5">However, I am conscious that in a reply to me dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-24">24 October</phrase>&mdash;just the day before, and long after the storm had broken in Parliament&mdash;Lord Warner continued to repeat pretty much verbatim the mantras of the NHS document.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/6">We all know that a White Paper will be produced on those issues in December. Above all, we know that NHS managers, certainly those in Staffordshire, are preparing the way for many of the proposed changes, which are still to be submitted for formal consultation. I suspect that many colleagues have similar stories to tell.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/7">One of the great values of debates such as this is to remind the Department that assurances given in the House need to be followed through in the White Paper and above all on the ground. My local PCT in Newcastle-under-Lyme was set up only three years ago after extensive public consultation and a major investment of NHS resources and staff commitment to the reorganisation. Since then, I have found my PCT to be approachable and very responsive to local needs&mdash;a refreshing change from the previous north Staffordshire health authority, the sub-regional health authority that served Stoke-on-Trent, Newcastle-under-Lyme and Staffordshire, Moorlands, which was bureaucratic and remote.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/8">The new SHA proposal, which is before a vetting panel in the Department, is for a single Staffordshire-wide PCT that would be even more remote than the old sub-regional authority. Indeed, it would dwarf any of the other merged PCTs that are being proposed for the region. Moreover, the proposal was in no way justified by the pre-consultation conducted by the SHA in the brief time allowed it in the summer. Not a single Staffordshire MP supported it. Only two PCTs in the whole of Staffordshire supported it. Indeed, only nine of the 49 responses received by the SHA from the whole of Staffordshire and Shropshire supported so-called coterminosity with county social services.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/9">Regrettably, I must mention Staffordshire county council in particular. I understand that, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-09">9 August</phrase>, the county did support a single PCT. I say that I understand, because for well over a month I have asked the county to confirm the processes by which the response was submitted in the council's name. Sadly, I have not yet received a satisfactory response, but it is clear that this was an officer's submission that did not go through the proper processes for such a major decision. In other words, it was not considered by the cabinet scrutiny committee and the full council.</p>

I believe that we would all support better joint working, but I would turn the question around and say that I wish that county social services were as responsive to me and my local people as my local PCT is.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/2">Since the beginning of August, the county council has rowed back, for the precise reason that its members do not support its proposal any more than the local MPs do. I therefore ask the Minister to bring to the attention of the Department's panel, which is chaired by Michael O'Higgins and is vetting the questions and proposals due to go out to formal consultation in December, the fact that the proposal advanced by the Shropshire and Staffordshire SHA does not reflect the opinions of the vast majority of local partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/3">I also ask the Minister to take note of another key issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.298.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1867" speakername="Brian Jenkins" colnum="298"  time="14:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.298.2/1">I know that my hon. Friend has talked about the number of members in the PCTs, but I am not sure that what he said reflected the true extent of the situation. The PCTs outside Staffordshire are to have an average of 275,000 members, but the proposal is for 782,000 members in Staffordshire. That is a marked difference, which I want to emphasise. Does he agree?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.298.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" speakername="Paul Farrelly" colnum="298"  time="14:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.298.3/1">I certainly do. I have not gone through the figures because I do not want to take too much time, but it is right to say that a PCT of that size would dwarf any other. Again, that reflects the fact that that PCT does not adequately consider the realities and different health needs of different parts of Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/2">Will the Minister take note of another key issue, which is breeding further cynicism locally? The belief is that the exercise will simply be a consultation with a pre-determined outcome. I say that because of the behaviour of senior NHS executives on the ground, not least the recently appointed chief executive designate of three west midlands SHAs, Mr. David Nicholson. We will be consulted on whether SHAs are, on a regional basis, the right way to go, but to my recollection we were not consulted on the appointment of a chief executive designate in the interim. I had the courtesy to inform Mr. Nicholson that I would refer to him by name in this debate. However, he has not yet had the courtesy to reply to my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-14">14 September</phrase> on these issues. It is widely known that during the summer Mr. Nicholson&mdash;I hate to personalise this matter, but I feel that his role is so substantial that I must name him&mdash;was informing NHS executives at the PCTs that the change to single coterminous organisations was inevitable; it was going to happen elsewhere, so the question to ask was what was so different about Staffordshire.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.299.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="299"  time="14:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.299.0/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend will be delighted to know that the same Mr. Nicholson will appear before the Select Committee on Health shortly.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.299.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" speakername="Paul Farrelly" colnum="299"  time="14:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.299.1/1">I am delighted to know that and I look forward to Mr. Nicholson appearing before other Committees in the House with other NHS officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/2">My response to Mr. Nicholson centred on why, given the fundamental differences between north, south and east Staffordshire, that was not the most intelligent question for him to ask. His guidance to career officials on the ground explains why many of them have reluctantly gone along with the way in which the wind was blowing. As we have seen, that wind was blowing right from the desk of the NHS chief executive Sir Nigel Crisp. I am referring to the way in which the document was issued during the recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/3">That is the second issue on which I would like the Minister to reflect and respond following the debate: the signals that such behaviour sends across the country. The message is that the opinions of elected representatives and properly appointed representative boards can be ignored by officials on a whim. That is a dangerous development. It is not unique to the Department of Health, but it continues to be reinforced by that Department's behaviour in Staffordshire now.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/4">I therefore ask the Minister to look into and respond to why, before consultation has even started, Mr. David Lingwood, the ex-chief executive of North Stoke PCT, has been moved to a post at the SHA to prepare the ground for a merger of all the PCTs in Staffordshire. In his place, Mr. Mike Ridley from South Worcestershire PCT has been appointed interim chief executive of the proposed single PCT covering the whole of Stoke-on-Trent.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/5">People in Stoke-on-Trent do not oppose that logical development, but they question the way in which the appointments were made and, in particular, why a single name was put by the SHA to the boards of North Stoke and South Stoke PCTs, in effect for them to rubber-stamp. There is, of course, immense disquiet in the NHS locally&mdash;warm formal press statements from the boards notwithstanding&mdash;about the way in which such things are being done. Will the Minister reflect and respond on how that behaviour accords with the procedures for senior NHS appointments and the role of the NHS Appointments Commission?</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/6">Mr. Ridley's appointment is understood to be interim because he intends to retire following the proposed merger in Stoke. Therefore, just as we are about to commence work on a brand new &pound;250 million hospital, yet another chief executive will have to be appointed. That instability in senior appointments goes hand in hand with the uncertainty caused by the NHS paper's dogmatic insistence on a division between PCTs as commissioners and as providers of health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/7">I shall not add much more on the subject, given what has already been said and the statements by the Secretary of State. I shall finish by pointing out that my local PCT runs a very successful community hospital at Bradwell in Newcastle-under-Lyme. It will be responsible for brand new health centres locally that have been financed by this Government's investment. It employs scores of district nurses. It is already tackling market failure by employing salaried GPs to fill gaps caused by retirement, when younger doctors have neither the wherewithal nor the inclination to buy into existing practices. Indeed, at one new health centre in Cross Heath, the PCT will also cut through the difficulties with NHS dentistry by employing an NHS dentist directly for the first time. Surely that is the way to go to fill such gaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/8">The approach can be responsive to local need, and therefore efficient, because it is so local. It is not remote, as a single Staffordshire PCT might well be. I am sure that none of the hon. Members in the Chamber today is deaf to the argument that smaller PCTs might duplicate bureaucracy, or might not commission health services as effectively or cheaply as larger organisations. However, we have not yet seen any evidence from the Department that the policy is soundly enough based to justify yet another distracting and demoralising reorganisation of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/9">That is the final issue on which I urge the Minister to reflect and respond. If the evidence is not presented, people will perceive another change for change's sake&mdash;and, moreover, one that is based on dogma. They will see a top-down, one-size-fits-all business model that is not rooted in the reality of providing proper health care.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate and declare a personal family interest in that my wife is director of public health in the Cheltenham and Tewkesbury primary care trust, and therefore faces redundancy under the proposals. I have not consulted her about the content of my speech, but I await with some trepidation her judgment on it when I get home.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/2">The time scale for the proposed reconfiguration is very short. On occasion that can happen, but it is serious in the current case because so much else is going on. Ambulance trusts, the mental health partnership trust in Gloucestershire and the strategic health authority are being reorganised simultaneously. The reorganisation of the direct provision of services by the primary care trust has been discussed, and I add my support to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" name="Paul Farrelly">the remarks of the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly)</phrase> about the need to retain the right for primary care trusts to provide the services in question directly, when they want to. We are not convinced that the statement was as unambiguous as he thought, but if he is right, I will be reassured.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/3">The seriousness of the budget complexities is beginning to dawn on us. The Cheltenham and Tewkesbury primary care trust, with its three stars, has balanced its books, and has presumably made sacrifices on the way to achieve that. The other two primary care trusts in Gloucestershire face substantial deficits and have financial recovery plans. The strategic health authority has implied that those financial recovery plans will continue to apply, after the primary care trusts merge, in the geographical areas of the old PCTs. Is that true or will Cheltenham have to make the sacrifices twice and pick up the bill a second time?</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/4">Those are all major issues, which attract the attention of the senior management teams and boards of primary care trusts at a time when they are distracted by the need to attend to their own reconfiguration and reorganisation. In addition, there is a threat of pandemic flu, and primary care trusts will be in the front line for the implementation of action plans. Reorganisation in any organisation causes disruption and likely cost, and I endorse <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the comments of the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> about that. It is extraordinary that such disruption, cost and distress to staff should be undergone only three years after the organisations in question were set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/5">I have a copy of the previous consultation document, which was published in 2001 and praised the existing set-up as more flexible and responsive, and on working more closely with partners, communities and the public. It even used the new Labour buzzword &quot;modernisation&quot;. It viewed the set-up as a more modern configuration of primary care trusts.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.0/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned disruption. By focusing on restructuring, the Government are failing to grasp several other problems facing PCTs, particularly in the south-east of England. My constituency is covered by the North Hampshire primary care trust. Under the local health care funding formula we receive only 80 per cent. of the national share. That puts several of our health care activities in peril. Further reorganisation will only add to the confusion and take the focus away from resolving local issues.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.301.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" speakername="Martin Horwood" colnum="301"  time="15:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.301.1/1">The hon. Lady is right and underlines the serious problems caused by trying to do these things in such a short time. When bodies have to discuss their reconfiguration, other things are squeezed off the agenda, so it is a serious matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/2">As the original consultation document said, the value of primary care trusts is that they have proved local and accountable, and all credit must go to the Government for setting them up. In my constituency, Battledown children's ward was threatened with being moved to Gloucester as an in-patient facility and would not have continued to exist as a 24-hour ward. In the end, the primary care trust intervened and was responsive enough locally to prevent that from happening. We are going to trial a nurse-led ward, and the 350 children a year who would have been transferred to Gloucester for in-patient treatment will now stay near their parents in Cheltenham. The primary care trust made a valuable contribution to the consultation process. However, would that have happened had the trust been based in Swindon? I am not sure that it would.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/3">The primary care trust has built valuable partnerships, including with the Sure Start programme, for which the Government should also take due credit. There are also neighbourhood projects in less well-off areas of Cheltenham, such as Hester's Way and Whaddon. Those local partnerships are extremely valuable and are rooted in the fact that the primary care trust is based in the town and has good local connections of a kind that might not be preserved in a larger organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/4">The crisis in NHS dentistry has been mentioned. Again, our primary care trust has been responsive and attentive. It has tried to take steps to deal with the fall in registration in NHS dentistry, which is now below 40 per cent. in Cheltenham and Tewkesbury, although the greatest steps must be made in the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/5">The primary care trust has also enjoyed good communication with MPs. I have very good relations with my director of public health&mdash;we are married, after all&mdash;and with the chief executive and others on the management team. There is, however, a serious point: if I had to liaise with a primary care trust that covered Wiltshire and Gloucestershire, there would not be the same chance of face-to-face communications with the chief executive and other members of the primary care trust board.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/6">Why are we going back, in effect, to the old health authorities in terms of the geographical configuration? There seems to be a pattern, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> referred. Primary care trusts are not the only things that are becoming less local: our ambulance trust, our strategic health authority, our children's services, our fire control centre and Gloucestershire constabulary are all becoming less local. The suspicion is that that is directed not by an analysis of each case, but by an overall need to reduce costs, to balance the Government's books post-election and to make savings. The Minister has to convince us that that is not the real reason and that we should look at such cases on their merits.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/7">In the case of Gloucestershire primary care trusts, we were given six options, three of which were, in effect, for Gloucestershire. They were: Gloucestershire-only; the status quo, although it became clear that that was not a practical option in reality and that the strategic health authority would not accept it; and Gloucestershire plus Swindon, which was the worst possible combination. I see some advantages to a larger primary care trust. For instance, there would be some merit in having a greater bargaining position when commissioning services from the local acute trust. There is really only one powerful acute trust in Gloucestershire, and the three primary care trusts could have had a stronger position vis-&agrave;-vis that trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/8">I disagree with some hon. Members because I found the strategic health authority consultation quite reasonable, given the parameters that the Department of Health had set. I also felt that the authority went to lengths to listen, and it is pleasing that the proposal that it sent to the Department is for a primary care trust that is as large as Gloucestershire, but no larger. Of the options that are available, I would certainly support that one. If, by any chance, the proposal was for a larger Swindon-based primary care trust, I would oppose it strongly.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/1">I am interested in the hon. Gentleman's comment that his authority is good at consultation. I understand that it will save &pound;26 million. Was he given the details of the management and administration costs for each PCT so that he could estimate which were the best and make a contribution? If not, what exactly was the contribution to the efficiency savings?</p>

	<p pid="a.303.1/1">No, I was not given those details. I was merely saying that I thought that the strategic health authority went to some lengths to explain the different options and the implications behind them. I felt that I was consulted by the SHA, but, as hon. Members have pointed out, that was within strict parameters effectively dictated by the Department of Health.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/2">I concede that the proposals might have possible benefits in strengthening the primary care trusts. However, I hope that they are worth the disruption, distress and cost of reorganisation so soon after the last one. Most importantly, if such reorganisations happen and we create a Gloucestershire primary care trust, those local connections that have been so valuable in maintaining local partnerships and connecting the primary care trusts to some of the least-well-off communities in Cheltenham should be preserved and some presence of the trust should be retained within the town. Otherwise, the record of the new trust will not be nearly as impressive as those of its predecessors.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.4/1">I will be brief, because I want to hear what my colleagues have to say. I want to pick up on what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> said about clarity. We need clarity. I am fed up with wandering about in a hall of mirrors.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/2">We listen to one Labour Minister and get the impression that something will happen and then that is immediately contradicted by the next. We were told, quoting the Secretary of State at health questions, that it would be up to PCTs whether or not they divested themselves of their provider functions. Yesterday, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, no less, told the Public Administration Committee that it is still Government policy to turn PCTs into commissioning bodies only, and the only thing that had changed was that the end date of December 2008, which is in the Crisp letter, had been lifted.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/3">The pressure from the Government is to force and persuade PCTs to get rid of their provider functions: the occupational therapists, the physiotherapists, the health visitors, the midwives and the chiropodists. Those are serious issues. They were not in the manifesto. Every time I listen to a Minister, they quote the little red book; this is a Maoist Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/4">The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster made a speech in Portcullis House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-24">24 August</phrase> and talked in terms of &quot;continuous reinvention and renewal.&quot; That is what he wants to see. The point is that, in this little red book, there is nothing about transferring front-line medical and clinical staff from primary care trusts into the private sector, the not-for-profit sector and the voluntary sector. There is not a single word, and if there had been, we would not have got re-elected. Do not let any Minister&mdash;whether it be the Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster or the Minister here&mdash;refer us to the little red book and say that we are signed up to it. We are not signed up to it. It is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/5">The proposals open the gate to a wholesale privatisation of our health service. I do not have time to go into that, but the Minister will be aware of the critique published by the Adam Smith Institute decoding the manifesto&mdash;we rely on it to do that&mdash;and drawing attention to the huge opportunities for the private sector. I have said before that the private sector is like a big 900 lb hairy gorilla. Once it has a foot in the door, it will be in there. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I say that for effect, but there is a wee bit of truth in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.4/6">The proposals have not been thought through; they are back-of-the-envelope stuff. The PCTs have been told that the reconfiguration has to deliver 15 per cent. in cost savings, but there is no 15 per cent. in the ambulance trusts. In Lancashire, we are told that we should have one PCT across the whole county, but Lancashire is one of the biggest counties in the country, in which more than 1 million people live. That would involve replacing eight PCTs with two little PCTs: Blackburn&mdash;I wonder why that one survives&mdash;and Blackpool. There is no coherence there at all. I say to the Minister and the Secretary of State that I want clear answers to the clear questions that have been posed. The proposals are unacceptable in their current form.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.304.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="304"  time="15:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew22">
	<p pid="a.304.0/1">Follow that, as they say. I shall do so briefly. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> for securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/2">This is the second debate today on the same general issue&mdash;some of us were here for the debate on community hospitals this morning. It is a seamless debate. We cannot separate the future of community hospitals from some of the things going on in primary care trusts and ambulance trusts. The message to the Government this morning was loud and clear: do not tamper with, and certainly do not destroy, community hospitals for the sake of a grand vision in which facilities are outsourced and someone will take up the work.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/3">I am in favour of a degree of experimentation. The Minister may know that I put together, with others, the idea of a health mutual on the Standish hospital site&mdash;I mention that for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" name="Anne Snelgrove">my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase>&mdash;and I hope the Government will seriously consider that. However, such ideas can work only in partnership with the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/4">We are talking about disembowelling the PCTs, but we made a dramatic error in Gloucestershire from the outset in that the PCTs were too small. On virtually every issue, that resulted in there being a lead PCT of the three. It therefore makes sense to unify them. I would have gone with one for the west and for the east from the outset, but we now have a unified county. I will go with that provided that it is clear that commissioning and delivery are not separate entities. I hope that the Secretary of State, if she is rethinking the strategy, will carry on in the same vein.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/5">I am worried about what will happen to the facilities. They might go to the acute sector, but people already face dramatic problems trying to manage the difficulties of acute hospitals and those people will be overpowered. I speak with direct experience. In my idiosyncratic way, I am a governor of a foundation trust and can tell hon. Members what it is like at the front end, trying to run facilities when the chief executive comes in in the morning and some wards are at 146 per cent. capacity. That is real pressure. I do not know quite how one deals with that, but the pressures exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/6">If we are to consider types of outsourcing, we must consider carefully who we do that in partnership with. As for our relationship with the care sector, if we are increasingly revolutionising the way in which we deliver services, we know where the weak link is. Sadly, it is in the care sector, which is totally vulnerable. We need to make sure that there is a better relationship between health and care. If there is continual revolution, that will never happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/7">I conclude with remarks on what I am most angry about: the reorganisation of the ambulance trusts. In Gloucestershire, we were given the answer at the outset and told that we would be consulted. The answer was that there would be a unified trust unifying Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire. We had a wonderful report from PricewaterhouseCoopers with traffic light signals telling us that option 1, the status quo, is red, which means that it will not be chosen, and that option 3, the unified arrangement, is green, which means that it is the one that we will go for.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/8">Clearly, the report is a self-fulfilling document, which comes up with the desired answer. I maintain that there is a different way of doing things through the tri-service arrangements that my near neighbour in Cheltenham mentioned. Such arrangements should be properly evaluated before we mess around with that vital service, which must be linked with health as well as wider ambulance provision. The failure to deal with problems on the ground means, effectively, that we have no passenger transport. We do well with emergencies and keep within most targets, but there is no transport to get our constituents to hospital and we rely entirely on the voluntary sector. We must do something about that. That is where the pressure points lie; let us forget the structural changes and get on with the real job.</p>

	<p pid="a.305.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> for securing the debate. I shall be brief, but I echo her and other hon. Members' comments about the Staffordshire ambulance service, which is consistently the best in the country, offers value for money, and is innovative. If it is not broken, we should not try to fix it.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.0/2">As for PCTs, we have waited 25 years to find the perfect solution to the organisation of health services. I tell my hon. Friend the Minister that there is no perfect solution. There are different geographical areas in this country and, because there is no perfect solution, we should stop looking for one. Through perpetual change, we create anxiety among staff and afford no opportunity for the health service to settle down.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.0/3">I understand the need to ensure that the unprecedented expenditure on health is well used, and that we must reduce spending on bureaucracy, and instead concentrate it on patient care. However, I am concerned that the links of PCTs with local authorities and communities will be lost. I am also concerned that the ability to develop local services and meet local need will not be able to continue if PCTs are altered. I seek reassurance that the comparative underfunding of PCTs such as East Staffordshire will continue to be addressed, and that we shall not lose out in a larger PCT area, as we did under the old health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.0/4">I question whether there is true support among GPs for practice-based commissioning. Most important, I seek further reassurance, as have others, that PCTs will be able to continue to provide services directly. There is much talk about choice in primary care, but most people who need community nursing or physiotherapy do not want choice; they want a decent service in their own homes or their GPs' surgeries. Our district nurses and other health service professionals have seen numerous changes in recent years and they deserve certainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.0/5">Finally, I turn to PCTs and the innovations that they can bring, and I shall quote two examples. The first is the renewal of Barton-under-Needwood cottage hospital, which was brought about because of the involvement of the PCT. Secondly, the development of a health centre in Winshill, in a relatively poor area of my constituency, would not have been possible had it not been for the PCT's ability to employ GPs directly, because none was interested in establishing a practice there. I seek reassurance that not only will the health centre be able to continue through whatever PCT we have, but that such services will be able to be developed in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.0/1">If we abolish anything today, let it be the dreadful word &quot;reconfiguration&quot;. It is an ugly weasel word, and the truth is that bad language conceals bad thinking. The fact that the NHS has an independent reconfiguration panel puts the fear of God into me. Whatever else we do, please, no more reconfiguration.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/2">If I were asked to name the two public bodies that are working best in my patch, my answer would be the Staffordshire ambulance service, which is the best in the country, and Cannock Chase primary care trust, which has revolutionised health care for my constituents. I recently received a letter from the longest-serving GP in my constituency. He said that, were we to get rid of the Cannock Chase PCT, we would be putting all that we have achieved in recent years back into the great bureaucratic pot from which we once lost out.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/3">I looked at the consultation of four years ago that set up the PCT. I shall not go through the whole thing because I do not have enough time, but the criteria that were brought to bear on the decision were exactly those that are relevant now, including locality focus. That consultation answers why we cannot merge three of the primary care groups in Staffordshire into a primary care trust. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/4" class="indent">&quot;This merger would involve a total population of 385,000. This would make it difficult to provide a locality focus for the specific areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/5">It goes on to say that the particular socio-economic characteristics of Cannock Chase would be lost were any larger scheme in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/6">Fours years on, the PCT has a population of 800,000. It is losing all its locality focus, as well as the attention that is paid to the socio-economic characteristics of the area. The PCT is the best thing to have happened to health care in my area, and I am not prepared to see it disappear.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.0/7">I support the Government mantra on their approach to public service reform: &quot;What matters is what works.&quot; That is a sensible, non-ideological approach. It is daft to replace it with one that says, &quot;If it's working outstandingly well, abolish it&quot;&mdash;sorry&mdash;&quot;reconfigure it.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.307.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" speakername="Julia Goldsworthy" colnum="307"  time="15:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h03.htm#51102h03_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.307.0/1">I will keep my remarks brief because I am looking forward to the Minister's response to the thoughtful, passionate and often entertaining contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate. Many hon. Members think that the issue is important to their constituencies, not to mention the wider impact that reorganisation will have on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/3">The debate's thoughtfulness stands in stark contrast to the Government's approach. The speed with which reforms have been introduced and rushed out has allowed little opportunity for scrutiny. We heard several times about the letter from Nigel Crisp which hit hon. Members' desks. It was sent out on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-28">28 July</phrase>, after Parliament had gone into recess for the summer. The final sentence in the letter referred to the reorganisation of ambulance trusts. It did not merit more of a mention than that, and that is very concerning. The fact that the Royal College of Nursing is taking legal action because of the way in which the letter was issued speaks for itself. I am not sure whether it is because I am a new Member who does not understand the process, but it would have made more sense to consult on and issue a White Paper before any discussions were held on restructuring the ambulance trusts. Surely it makes more sense to decide on function before structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/4">The speed with which reforms have been introduced has also been demoralising for primary care trusts and their staff. They were only set up three years ago, and this is the third restructuring in 10 years. Many think that their existing work programme will disappear and their priorities will be lost, along with the connections that the existing primary care trusts have established with local communities. Much of what we have heard has focused on the importance of those connections. It is not even a one-size-fits-all approach from the Government, but a case of any size fits as long as it is bigger than what we have now.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/5">My primary care trust in Cornwall accepted that restructuring and some type of strategic vision were required. The three primary care trusts in Cornwall dealt, with varying degrees of success, with the financial deficits with which the previous restructuring had left them. Although some PCTs had good recovery plans in place and were returning to an even keel, others had fared much worse. As a result, their deficits have been getting much bigger.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/6">Those that have been working hard think that there is no point in enduring all the pain if they will not see any gain. Why should they have any financial stringency if, in a couple of years, they are reorganised once again? Why work towards building good local connections and services if all that restructuring means that the progress is lost again? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">My hon. Friend the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> made that point well.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/7">One of the Government's key comments about trying to build up good financial management is ironic when a key driver behind the reorganisation is economic savings rather than putting the patient first. The savings target from the restructuring of primary care trusts is 15 per cent. That automatically implies larger primary care trusts, irrespective of whether there is coterminosity with social services.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/8">Coterminosity exists between primary care trusts and social services in London, yet the Government are planning to move to five super primary care trusts there. If coterminosity is a goal, why are the Government considering taking that away from London? Only speed, and the need for saving, is driving the move. Perhaps the plan is to fulfil the requirements of the Gershon review rather than to improve services.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/9">There are many cases in which restructuring will result in turmoil, greater costs and poorer services. One example is Milton Keynes. The suggestion is to merge all three primary care trusts in Buckinghamshire, including Milton Keynes, into one, but because it is a unitary authority, Milton Keynes and Buckinghamshire want two PCTs&mdash;one to match the boundaries of Buckinghamshire county council and the other to match those of Milton Keynes. That sounds as if it makes sense, but they are being told that they have to move to one PCT. There has been a lot of joint working already. They have appointed a joint public health director with the PCT and pooled budgets in other areas of social care. Reorganisation will mean increased costs because they will have to undo that good work and start all over again. There will be not only a financial impact but a loss in terms of the progress they want to make.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.0/1">I know Buckinghamshire well because I had the pleasure of fighting Chesham and Amersham in the 1997 election. As with Milton Keynes and the rest of the county, Buckinghamshire is similar to Staffordshire and Stoke-on-Trent, yet in that city one PCT is proposed and accepted. There is no consistency of thinking across the NHS between different counties.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.1/1">I agree. It is difficult to understand the logic behind many of the restructurings. Rather than creating coterminosity and partnership working, those are being destroyed in many cases. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">my hon. Friend the. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> said, continuity of care is being put at risk. Often, new structures for a move to PCT commissioning services are being created when there is no clear idea who will provide them or whether there is the capacity to make those changes. It makes one ask whether the changes are being driven by dogma rather than what is most suitable for local areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/2">Primary care trusts that continue to provide some care may strengthen their position as commissioners, as it could give them greater leverage to transfer out of hospitals rather than into them. The Department of Health may change its mind on that. Is it Nigel Crisp's guidance to move away from providing services by the end of 2008, or is it closer to what the Secretary of State said in Health questions last week&mdash;that community staff employed by primary care trusts will continue to be employed by primary care trusts unless and until the primary care trust decides otherwise, following full public consultation? Will the Government withdraw the guidelines? Will there be a move away from providing services? Will there be a clear statement of the direction of policy? I shall be grateful if the Minister makes that clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/3">Much has been said about the changes that have taken place, whether it is the new GP contracts, the strategic health authority reconfiguration, payment by results or foundation trusts, and there is much uncertainty about the impact of those changes. The Government are introducing more change and more uncertainty, not only for NHS staff, but for patients, too. Although there has been national public consultation events for things like the White Paper, there has been no proper consultation of staff or consultation at a local level for the reconfiguration, which might be in place by April next year. Will the Minister make the future direction of policy clear? If, after local public consultation, primary care trusts decide that they want to continue to provide services, what will be the Government's response?</p>

	<p pid="a.309.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is notable that this is the third debate in two days in Westminster Hall which has centred on complaints about what is going on in the NHS. I fear that I have not so much been involved in a debate, as intruded into a meeting of the parliamentary Labour party, such has been the catalogue of gripes that Labour Members have come up with.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/2">The hon. Lady herself said that there had been many objections to the proposals which had been ignored. There was no evidence that the Department of Health was listening. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">The hon. Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> described the PCT proposals as tablets of stone that were dropped down from the Department of Health. He asked what was broken and said that the whole process was flawed. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" name="Paul Farrelly">The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly)</phrase> described it as ineptitude of truly mind-boggling proportions, saying that it was change for change's sake, based on dogma.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> talked about disembowelling PCTs. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">The hon.

Member for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright)</phrase> said that bad language conceals bad thinking and if something is working outstandingly well, it should be reconfigured. The priceless contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">the hon. Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> was that he was fed up with the whole hall of mirrors and the Government's little red book of Maoist thinking. According to him, this is a continuous reinvention and renewal process and the wholesale privatisation of our health service&mdash;a 900 lb hairy gorilla plucking parts of the health service away. It is back-of-the-envelope stuff and there is no coherence at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.1/1">Having echoed all the excellent comments of Labour Members, there is little more for me to do in this debate. Their comments show that there is more than a faint whiff of suspicion that staff and patients are being bulldozed into the changes. It is understandable that many people are worried.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/2">The proposals are the latest in a string of gaffes and shambles that have come out of the Department of Health in recent weeks, at a time when PCTs and other health trusts around the country are facing enormous financial deficits that have been greatly underestimated by the Government; for example, 80-odd community hospitals are under threat. As the hon. Member for Stroud said, this debate and the one in this Chamber this morning are one seamless debate. A recent British Medical Association survey found that three out of four trusts were facing financial shortfalls of between &pound;0.2 million and &pound;25 million each. There are, of course, the historic financial deficits that they took on; 19 out of 28 strategic health authorities predict deficits in their region approaching &pound;1 billion overall. The RCN has predicted a loss of 3,000 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/3">There is concern that the proposals for changes to structures are made from a position of weakness and financial necessity rather than one of strength, and that they are not driven by a desire to make improvements to patient service and staff support.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/4">I shall quote from a member of staff from the East Staffordshire primary care trust in the county of the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands. Mrs. Susan Joyce, who joined the PCT two years ago, wrote to the Secretary of State, various other Members of Parliament and others as a fairly new employee of the NHS. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I couldn't help but notice the dedication and enthusiasm of the staff and their commitment to improving the healthcare of the local people in East Staffordshire&mdash;I really felt that, at last, I was doing a very worthwhile job.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/6" class="indent">During this relatively short time I have observed the instigation of many new initiatives, all set up to improve the health of the population in primary care, which I understood was on the Government's Public Health Agenda. If the proposed merger of the 6 PCTs in Staffordshire into 1 large organisation is approved, then all this hard work, dedication and improvements to our local health service will be lost.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/7">I am sure that her comments are typical of many others who work in that PCT and others throughout the country which face an uncertain future.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/8">The same is true of my own primary care trust in West Sussex. Adur, Arun and Worthing PCT has a population of 230,000 to look after, and five PCTs will be merged into one super PCT for almost 750,000 people in the whole county of West Sussex. That bears a remarkable similarity to the boundaries of the old West Sussex health authority with which we started in 1997. How much money, time and effort has been spent and expended to replace the structure that was in place eight years ago? What will happen to much of the expertise of those in other PCTs in West Sussex who will not form the management of the new super PCTs?</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/9">That reorganisation may be right, and we should welcome any reductions in bureaucracy, as they have not transpired so far. If it means saving about &pound;636 million that can be recycled to front-line patient care, it has its merits, but why is it being done in such a hurry? Many people have said that local focus will be lost. We have heard that from many hon. Members present. The Government have performed a U-turn since the initial missive from the Department of Health in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/10">The <i>Health Service Journal </i>and NHS Alliance carried out a survey of all PCT chairmen in England, revealing that three quarters said that local circumstances and patient needs were not receiving proper consideration in planning reconfiguration, while only 20 per cent. said that they were. Some 54 per cent. said that reconfiguration would have a neutral impact on the quality of patient care, while 31 per cent. believed that the impact would be negative. Some 58 per cent. said that patient care would suffer from the planned cut in management cost, and four out of five said that reconfiguration would weaken the clinical engagement of GPs and GP practices in their areas. The comments go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/11">The RCN's comments reflect the criticism of the rushed and confused way in which reorganisation is coming about. It is taking legal action against the Government over their announcement of the document, &quot;Commissioning a Patient-Led NHS&quot;. The RCN is seeking a judicial review of the Government's failure to carry out public consultation on the proposed changes to the role of PCTs in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/12">The RCN says that giving PCTs a &quot;minimum&quot; provider role will dramatically redistribute the balance between public and private provision in favour of the latter and that there are enormous work force implications for front-line staff. That is right, particularly as we have been told that the proposals for the changes must be in place by October 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/13">What about the problems with PCTs with large deficits&mdash;which we know many of them have&mdash;proving unattractive merger partners for PCTs that have been able to balance their books? What is the rush that has brought about those changes, such that the documents for them were issued just a few days after Parliament went into summer recess? Where is the detail?</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/14">Cathy Newman and Nicholas Timmins in an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> two weeks ago said:</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/15" class="indent">&quot;250,000 staff have been left with no idea who their new employer will be&mdash;possibly the private or voluntary sector, possibly local government, possibly GP practices, or even themselves if they set up as local entrepreneurs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/16">Are the Government still to put a cap on how much will be done by the independent sector, or is it now a completely free and open market? There are enormous work force implications for front-line staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/17">The idea might be a good one, but what is there to distinguish it from the extension of GP fundholders made under the last Conservative Government? That is another example of a wasted, expensive eight years. There will be a serious impact on the NHS because 300 PCTs in England control three quarters of the NHS budget and provide a wide range of non-hospital related services. I will not continue because I know that hon. Members want to hear the Minister's response on the ambulance trust, but many Members have reflected anger about another ill-thought-out regionalisation of services, which will reduce the number of ambulance trusts by a drastic 50 per cent. A reduction to such a small number was certainly not envisaged in the Bradley review.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/18">The proposals are hasty and ill thought out with little genuine consultation. What is the hurry? What is the real motivation behind the changes? Is it making real progress in the health service, or dealing with deficits? At this time record amounts of expenditure are going into the health service, but what on earth will happen when that tails off in the next few years? Will yet more change help the NHS after years of permanent revolution, as various hon. Members have said? If it ain't bust, don't fix it. When will the Government acknowledge the genuine concerns of many members of staff whose jobs depend on the future structure of PCTs?</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/19">Ultimately, has everything already been decided? Will the Minister come clean on that? Will he come away from the hall of mirrors that the hon. Member for Pendle said he was sick of, clear up the confusion and give a clear steer on the Government's intentions? They owe that to the many dedicated members of the NHS who work within PCTs, and for whom the changes will have a desperate and important impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Chope, it is a privilege to serve under your chairmanship. First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate on the future of primary care trusts and ambulance trusts. I congratulate her not simply on securing the debate but on the action that she has taken: she has raised the matter with the Prime Minister and on the Health Committee. Today she was admirably supported by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1728" name="Paul Farrelly">my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly)</phrase> and for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright). It is a good example of the way in which she has championed the issues that matter to her community.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/2">The backdrop to today's debate is rapidly rising levels of investment in the national health service. It will have risen from &pound;33 billion in the year the Government were elected to more than &pound;90 billion in a couple of years' time, including &pound;30 million extra for the local PCT of my hon. Friend the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands. That increased investment, combined with the hard work of nearly one and a half million NHS staff, is transforming our hospitals, reducing waiting lists, improving accident and emergency departments and providing modern services, which means people are living longer. Rates of cardiovascular disease are down by nearly 31 per cent. and death rates from cancer are down by nearly 12 per cent. Those are admirable achievements for any Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/3">However, the vast majority of patient contact with the NHS is through primary care. In fact, 90 per cent. takes place in primary care settings and the challenge in the next four to five years is how we improve primary and community services. We need dramatically to strengthen the services provided for people with long-term conditions and how we provide services in the community. In this country, 14 million people have a long-term condition and 2 per cent. of long-term condition patients account for as much as 30 per cent. of hospital admissions. Much of the care for those people can be provided far more effectively in the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">My hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> spoke of problems in hospitals in Leeds. I would add more challenges to the list he eloquently outlined this afternoon. Too many people are still waiting too long for treatment. Waiting times for diagnostic scans, such as MRI tests, are too long. Too many people, particularly those from disadvantaged areas, cannot find a GP fast enough or, when they have a family doctor, cannot get an appointment at a time that suits them. Too many patients are admitted to hospital because the care that they might have preferred to receive at home simply is not available in the right way at the right time.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/5">Patients want more control over the care that they receive: they want to be able to make choices about how services are best delivered to them, they want the services to be more convenient, they want to have their voices heard and they want to be fully involved in the treatment plans. They want an NHS that works with patients, not an NHS that simply does things for patients. The question at the centre of today's debate is: how do we do that? How do we modernise the national health service? How do we create a patient-led NHS? I would argue that we have to invest more in community health and care services. An improvement&mdash;a step change&mdash;in the way in which we commission services is critical to the next period of change. That means that the NHS must get better still at securing the best possible services.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/6">What that means for us at the beginning of this term of Parliament is that we must get the structures of primary care trusts right. We are about to put another &pound;22 billion in growth money into the national health service. In our first two terms, we revolutionised hospital care&mdash;thanks not least to the 138 new or refurbished hospitals that have been delivered across the country. The risk we have to manage now is that a strong, vibrant and incentivised hospital sector has the potential to suck resources towards it, unless it is counterbalanced by an equally strong and vibrant commissioning function that represents patient interests effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/7">I welcomed the recognition of the need for reform expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friends the Members for Staffordshire, Moorlands and for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1757" name="Gordon Prentice">My hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Mr. Prentice)</phrase> will be delighted to hear that I am no Maoist. I do not believe that permanent revolution is something to be enc<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1861" name="Paul Burstow">ouraged. However, the hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Mr. Burstow)</phrase> asked, &quot;Why fix something if it is not broken?&quot; I am afraid that that slightly misses the point. The question is not whether primary care trusts are broken, but how we make them stronger still.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/8">My hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme asked what evidence we had to back up our reforms. The sheer variability in health outcomes across the country is unacceptable and provides a clear sign that things have to change. Local primary care trusts must get much stronger. However, as part of the reorganisation, it is important that we ensure there is a proper consultation process. This was flagged up in March, so there has been some time since then. The initial proposals would be subject to full statutory consultation, where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/9">My hon. Friends the Members for Staffordshire, Moorlands, for Cannock Chase, for Newcastle-under-Lyme and for Pudsey raised some important concerns about proposals for PCT reconfiguration in Staffordshire and Leeds. I am extremely grateful to them for bringing those matters to the attention of this Chamber and I will personally ensure that the external panel is alerted to those concerns. My hon. Friends asked for reassurances that processes are not prejudged. It would be quite improper for statutory consultation processes to be prejudged in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/10">The hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam and my hon. Friends the Members for Newcastle-under-Lyme and for Cannock Chase alluded to the question of how we ensure accountability and local responsiveness in the reorganisation. Those matters will be dealt with in the White Paper that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will publish at the turn of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> raised important concerns about deficits and the treatment thereof in the proposed reorganisations. Work is under way on the financial strategy to accompany the White Paper and I will write to him with further details of that when it is ready.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/12">Staffing is one of two central points. In the future, the way in which we deliver services should be varied according to the different needs that people have. The needs of people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are different from the needs of people who have had a stroke. In the case of prevention, the strategies involved in smoking cessation are different from the strategies needed to reduce levels of teenage pregnancy where they are too high. We need variability in different models.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/13">However, there are three key facts and I hope that they provide some reassurance to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1465" name="Janet Dean">my hon. Friends the Members for Pudsey, for Pendle and for Burton (Mrs. Dean)</phrase>. First, district nurses, health visitors and other staff delivering clinical services will continue to be employed by their PCT unless and until that PCT decides otherwise. Secondly, the terms and conditions of staff will be protected. Thirdly, any decision to alter the status quo would be driven locally following our White Paper deliberations. Form will follow function.</p>

	Orthopaedic Surgery
</major-heading>

	<p pid="a.316.1/1">Most debates in this Chamber take the form of an hon. Member identifying a problem and asking a Minister to tackle it. Unusually, that is not what I want to do today. I want to tell, and share with my hon. Friend the Minister, a remarkable success story at my local hospital and to show how the whole National Health Service can benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/2">Our NHS has two distinctive features. First, it is free at the point of delivery, regardless of ability to pay, which is why it commands overwhelming public support. That is a principle that must never be abandoned. The second feature is not good: the wait for treatment. That is the worst feature of the NHS and is what most people want changed. The Government undertook a massive public consultation on the NHS in 2000 and waiting was by far the main concern of the millions of people who responded; that is the same today.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/3">One of the largest contributors to overall waiting lists is orthopaedic surgery, such as elective work on hips and knees, which also has some of the longest waits. As people live longer and medical health improves, the demand for replacement of worn-out joints continues and will continue to increase. National figures and those that I have seen for my local hospital show that, over the years, those on orthopaedic waiting lists comprise at least one quarter of the total of all those waiting up to six months for treatment. On average, they have comprised those waiting six to nine months and form the vast bulk of those who have had to wait more than nine months.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/4">The Government's record on reducing waiting lists by around 300,000 and getting waiting times down from 18 months or more under the previous Government to a maximum of nine months last year and a maximum of six months by the end of this year is one of their best achievements. They have increased resources and set targets. However, The Department of Health has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Orthopaedics is considered the biggest challenge to delivering the December 2005 target.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/6">In January 2004, the national orthopaedic project had to be set up, in the words of the then Health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/7" class="indent">&quot;to reduce long waits in a challenging area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/8">With effort and drive, our aim is that by the end of December this year, no one will wait more than six months. Any objective observer would conclude that that represents huge progress since 1997. However, the wait is still six months and to an individual patient, that seems a long time, especially if he is in pain. As people forget the old 18-month waits, they will feel that the NHS is not what it should be if they have to wait for six months or even 18 weeks. As things stand, waiting is still set to be part of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/9">I can tell the Chamber, however, that at my local hospital, the James Paget healthcare trust, patients of orthopaedic surgeon Mr. John Petri do not wait for six months or 18 weeks. Mr. Petri, as I told the Prime Minister this afternoon, has no waiting list at all. Let me explain how that remarkable achievement came about. John Petri used to work in France. When he arrived at the James Paget, he could not understand why we had long waiting lists. The hospital at which he had worked in France was of a similar size, serving a similar size of population with fewer resources&mdash;but with no waiting lists; they were unheard of. At James Paget, there were twice as many orthopaedic surgeons and twice as many anaesthetists as in his hospital in France, but they worked in a different way, in different hours, and performed fewer operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/10">In France, it was normal for a surgeon to work with two teams in two theatres, moving, after scrubbing up, straight from an operation in one theatre to another in a second. Here, he found that after an operation it was normal for a surgeon to sit around drinking tea and waiting for his one team to prepare the next patient for the same theatre. That is what is wrong with the surgery system in our hospitals. In a typical three-and-a-half-hour operating session, only two hours of a surgeon's time may actually be spent operating. As Mr. Petri put it, if we were running a factory, we would not allow our most important and expensive machine to stand idle for that length of time. I would suggest that the same is true of a surgeon in a hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/11">There was another key difference. The French hospital had three theatres, compared with two at James Paget. We have the wrong balance of resources between surgeons and theatres. In about 2000, when Mr. Petri saw more resources coming in to the NHS, he put a proposal to the management of the hospital to introduce the dual operating system there. That was when I first met him. He felt that orthopaedic patients were being let down by the NHS; there was something seriously wrong and they deserved better. Sadly, the other surgeons at that hospital did not wish to change. They said that dual operating would not work and so, at that time, did the Royal College of Surgeons. However, the chief executive of the hospital, David Hill, and his managers backed John Petri.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/12">In 2001, Mr. Petri began a pilot scheme of one dual operating session a week, and his team visited France to see the system in operation. Quickly, his waiting list for hip operations reduced from one year to three weeks. The system worked, but more theatre space was needed for it to continue. A business case was put to the strategic health authority, and it supported it with &pound;2 million for a new theatre, which was opened in 2003. Dual operating was phased in as additional theatre and ward staff were recruited, additional beds opened and the process was refined.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/13">Dual operating has been running fully in 2005. Mr. Petri performs two such sessions a week in addition to one conventional session. It involves his being allocated two theatres for five hours instead of the conventional three and a half hours. Both theatres are fully staffed, and he operates on one patient while the next is prepared in a second theatre. He then moves on to the second patient, leaving a support doctor to complete the first operation by stitching up and such like. By the time he has finished in the second theatre, a third patient is waiting for him in the original theatre, and so on. He can perform two or three major operations and four or five minor ones in a five-hour session, compared with one major and a couple of minors in the conventional way. There is more flexibility and there are fewer cancellations.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/14">Trial figures show that in 50 operating sessions, John Petri performed 270 operations. Two colleagues, in 50 sessions each using single theatres, totalled 225 operations. That is why John Petri now has no waiting list. Not only is he maintaining that position, he is now taking patients off his colleagues' lists, reducing waiting times across the hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.0/1">My constituents in Great Yarmouth share the hospital with those of my hon. Friend. Is not the lesson to be learned from the example of that particular surgeon, that the issue is not just the resources that go into the hospitals? Millions of pounds of investment have been made in our hospital in Great Yarmouth, but does my hon. Friend not agree that his example proves the point that it is about the working practices, not just of the surgeons, but of the rest of the staff? If there is a trend towards looking at other practices across the UK and Europe and throughout the world, we can learn a lot and benefit our constituents, whom we are here to serve.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The change could not have happened without the &pound;2 million investment from the NHS, but it would not have happened without the innovative and brave stance taken by Mr. Petri. It raises some questions&mdash;as I will go on to show&mdash;about the way in which surgeons work. I hope that there are some lessons to be learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/2">Mr. Petri said to me that</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/3" class="indent">&quot;a three and a half hour session is absurd, it's office hours. A theatre is not an office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/4">He said that he feels energised by what he is doing, and that he felt sleepier under the old system, with long breaks between the operations. He has been nominated for the 2005 medical futures innovation award, and we will know tomorrow night whether he has won. He deserves to win, because he is a hero of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/5">Full credit, however, must also be given to the James Paget hospital, its management led by David Hill, and its board led by John Hemming. It is a top-performing three-star hospital with no deficit, which has always met all its targets and which will move to foundation status in April. The hospital backed John Petri and, as a quality organisation, managed the necessary changes. Those changes could not have been made without such management and the investment that the Government have made in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/6">John Petri is an innovator, but what is being achieved is also a team effort involving the support of anaesthetists, theatre staff, ward staff, sterile services staff and porters. On behalf of my constituents and those of my hon. Friend, I should like to thank all those staff who have signed up to dual operating.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/7">Sadly, the other orthopaedic surgeons have not signed up to it. Even though dual operating has been proven to work, the other orthopaedic surgeons at the James Paget hospital will not change over to it. The historic compromise made at the birth of the NHS means that they are contracted to the hospital, not employed by it, and so the hospital management cannot require them to change.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/8">I asked the Royal College of Surgeons to comment. I would not say that it was completely negative, but it was not yet convinced. It said that the system needed trialling&mdash;I pointed out that it had been going on for the best part of a year&mdash;and that it wanted to look at it more carefully. I had thought that it would be more welcoming of the idea, and would ask what we needed to do to make it work, rather than being sceptical about it. However, to be fair, the president and vice-president of the royal college will visit James Paget hospital in a couple of weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/9">I asked why other surgeons would not take up that innovation. Habit and lack of motivation must be part of the answer. The new contract for consultants seems to give them no incentive to do so; in that respect it was a missed opportunity. One should also ask whether those at the top of the NHS&mdash;those who manage the NHS&mdash;really understand what is going on down below, and whether those down below really make the effort to alert those at the top. The system of tea drinking never seems to have been challenged either from within or outside the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/10">If surgeons do not want to change, one should also ask whether there is really a full commitment to the NHS. Are they really worried that if they have no waiting list, there will be no private patients? Do they have a vested interest in maintaining some waiting lists? Mr. Petri's private income has fallen by 10 per cent. in the past year, and he expects it to fall further. However, he said to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/11" class="indent">&quot;I care about my private practice but I care more about people who have no money getting their operation tomorrow and not having to wait a year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/12">Where are the other surgeons who think like that?</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/13">Why have we got the wrong ratio of surgeons to theatres? Has the Department of Health studied the number of operations performed in relation to the number of surgeons employed over the years? Have we had the corresponding rise in the number of operations from the increased numbers of surgeons?</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/14">The number could be going down because of changes in anaesthetics. In the UK, we have traditionally made quite heavy use of general anaesthetic compared with other countries&mdash;that entails certain dangers. As we rightly move towards more use of local anaesthetics, I am told that that will increase the pre-operative preparation time, resulting in more tea drinking for surgeons unless we change the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/15">I also asked Mr. Petri whether dual operating had wider application to surgery beyond orthopaedics. &quot;No doubt&quot;, he said. It is not applicable for longer operations but, for operations of between one hour and one and a half hours, he said that we &quot;Could do it easily&quot;. In the light of that, on behalf of patients in my constituency and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> and patients all over the country, I must lay down a challenge to surgeons: please have a good look at Mr. Petri's example and please follow it. I ask my hon. Friend the Minister to take this matter further and to encourage the surgeons to follow that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/16">&quot;Contestability&quot; is the new word in the national health service. Let us contest the working practices of surgeons. Our aim as a Government is to get down to a maximum wait of 18 weeks. To do that, we are reorganising primary care trusts, introducing GP-based commissioning, shaking up local providers and giving patients a choice of four treatment centres. I wonder whether following Mr. Petri's innovation might be a simpler way of bringing down the waiting times, but we are going down that road. Dual operating needs to be part of the new system. If it is, we might be able to exceed the 18 week target by a long way.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/17">I am convinced that it is right to have a patient-led NHS, but patients rarely challenge doctors. They usually see them as some kind of God who can do no wrong and they tend to blame politicians for the shortcomings of the NHS. Given Mr. Petri's innovation and the reluctance or unwillingness of surgeons to adopt it, the public must ask questions of their consultant surgeons. They must challenge why their consultant is not doing dual operating and achieving a waiting list of zero.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/18">I am not criticising surgeons' expertise, commitment to the job or care. I was admitted to the James Paget hospital with a broken hip; it was an emergency. Those who operated on me and subsequently looked after me as an out-patient were first class. I know that when I go back next year to have all the metalwork in my hip removed, I will receive excellent treatment, despite making this speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/19">For a long time in this country, there has been an acceptance of waiting lists. People have never really asked why they exist; they might assume that the NHS needs more funding. None of them know about the tea drinking. How can they when they are on the operating trolley? John Petri told me of the looks on his patients' faces when he tells them that they do not have to wait at all. This should be the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/20">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will, as a result of this debate, undertake to examine how dual operating can be introduced in all our hospitals. After all, we know the benefits of dual operating in Westminster Hall; this debate would not have taken place at the same time as the one in the main Chamber if we did not have dual operating.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.0/1">May I say to both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1912" name="Bob Blizzard">my hon. Friends the Members for Waveney (Mr. Blizzard)</phrase> and for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright) how grateful I am that they have had the opportunity of this Adjournment debate to discuss this issue? Undoubtedly, there are issues about resources in the NHS and I will explore them in more detail. Resources are needed, but this is not just about them; it is about thinking outside the normal framework and the traditional way in which things have always been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/2">One pleasing aspect of this Adjournment debate, secured by my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney, is that it seems that in his hospital, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth also shares an interest, there is a culture of opportunities for staff to raise issues and ideas. Management will then try to pay heed to those and consider where they can be introduced and supported to make a difference to the patients in Waveney and Great Yarmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/3">There has been a view, which I am glad to say is changing, that the NHS is characterised by long waits in accident and emergency, long waits to see a GP and very long waits to see a hospital consultant. Many patients were waiting more than 18 months for an operation. To be honest, when we came to power in 1997 the situation was out of control. It was particularly bad for patients waiting for orthopaedic operations, who would often be in pain and have restricted mobility that could affect their work and other aspects of their lives, thereby having a knock-on effect on their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/4">Against that background, the changes that we have brought in, with the help of dedicated staff, have been astonishing. Gone are the days of 18-month-plus waiting times. Now nobody should wait more than nine months, and that will be down to six months by the end of the year. In 1998, the average waiting time for an orthopaedic operation was more than 19 weeks; it is now down to just 12 weeks, and it is still falling.It is our ambition that by 2008 we will have brought down the entire time from GP referral to the start of treatment to a maximum of 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/5">What is heartening about today's debate is that it highlights that as well as what we are doing, we can explore problems and achieve innovation in the way that Mr. Petri has shown. It is important to examine the practices that exist and how they can work better. As my hon. Friend the Member for Waveney pointed out, not only has Mr. Petri led in this area, based on his experience of working in France, but he has convinced the team that he works with that what he has pioneered can make a difference to the patients. I am sure that that must lead to more job satisfaction&mdash;for example, from the look on the faces of patients who are told, &quot;There are no waiting lists, so we can see you as soon as possible.&quot; That makes a welcome change from the long waits that people are often used to. I am glad to see that that, and what people expect from the NHS, is changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/6">We have made a huge investment in the NHS. We have increased the budget from &pound;34 billion in 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;70 billion this year, and that figure will top &pound;90 billion in 2007&ndash;08. In orthopaedics, we have increased the number of consultant doctors by more than 40 per cent., and I understand that there have been similar increases in the numbers of physiotherapists, occupational therapists, specialist nurses and theatre staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/7">I read in a newspaper a call from the Royal College of Surgeons for more theatres and more staff. Clearly, in Mr. Petri's hospital there was an understanding that in order to initiate reform and shorten the waiting lists there had to be investment, and it is my understanding that that was attended to in respect of both theatre facilities and staff. We have to challenge those who say, &quot;It's just a question of more money,&quot; by asking them, &quot;How are you using the facilities and the staff that you already have in your hospitals?&quot; It is always possible to come up with a thousand reasons why systems of working cannot change, but it would be nice if people occasionally looked at the example of what is happening in Great Yarmouth under the leadership of John Petri&mdash;and with the support of other hospital staff&mdash;and if they said, &quot;If they can do it there, why can't we do it here?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/8">That is an issue for a patient-led NHS. Patients often accept that what they are being told is what they can expect; it is what they are used to. I hope that the recent publicity might make more trusts question how they operate. I hope, too, that patients will have read the story and will ask questions of their GPs and others. I would also like the patient representatives who are involved in our local patient forums, and those who are on the boards of PCTs and trusts, to say, &quot;Well, hang on; it might not be simple to do the same thing in our community, but can we at least explore why it can't happen here as well as in Great Yarmouth?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/9">Orthopaedics presents particular challenges in respect of getting waiting times down. That is why we set up the national orthopaedics project. The project team built support among clinicians, and provided management support where it was most needed, and the results so far have been impressive. The number of patients waiting longer than six months has fallen from 57,000 to just over 15,000. Moreover, as I said, we are also on track to achieve our target that by the end of the year no one will wait longer than six months for an operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/10">In seeking to sustain these gains and to tackle waiting times by treating people within 18 weeks of their GP referral, it is clear that resources alone will not work. Resources and reform have to go hand in hand. We need to search for innovative new ways to drive up standards. That is why we have talked about selective use of the independent sector, and that is why we are introducing greater patient choice, extending the number of foundation trusts and setting a national tariff for NHS services. These fundamental changes are part of a coherent package to revolutionise patient care, abolish the second best and reward good and popular services.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/11">However, we need to build on that by considering what is being done in the NHS. Today we have heard about a good example of what an NHS hospital with NHS staff can achieve. I noticed the quotes from Mr. John Petri in the article in<i> The Sunday Times</i>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/12" class="indent">&quot;If you were running a factory, you wouldn't allow your most important and most expensive machine to stand idle. The same is true in a hospital.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/13">I shall take the idea of dual operating back to the Department and we shall consider it further. I know that Mr. Petri is up for an award tomorrow and I wish him all the very best. Whether he gets that award or not, he should be congratulated on not only talking the talk but walking the walk by providing the services that people need.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/14">Innovation such as the dual-surgery approach pioneered by Mr. Petri is to be welcomed, and we need to consider further how we can complete a framework for treating people with muscular-skeletal conditions so that they can be given the most appropriate treatment as soon as possible. We have also considered how we can prevent people with such problems having falls, which lead to hospital treatment. Furthermore, we have considered how to make sure that there are packages that prevent people, particularly the elderly, coming back to our hospitals after treatment because of another, preventable, fall. Some excellent work is going on between PCTs and hospitals to put together a care package for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/15">I was interested by something my hon. Friend said earlier, when we were discussing this issue, about the number of cases referred to orthopaedic surgery that do not necessarily need surgery. That is another area that can be considered; other professionals can work with GPs to ascertain whether time is being wasted on referring people to surgeons when they do not need surgery. We can look at a number of areas to reduce the waiting times for hospital care, particularly orthopaedic care.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.0/16">With unprecedented investment, the NHS has the money and staff to deliver the standard of care that all patients deserve. We have created a strong NHS and tried to reduce the influence from Whitehall. The combination of investment, support and reform can work. Average waiting times have come down by 40 per cent., but we can do more. We need to look to innovation and share best practice in professional exchange, so that the public know what they can expect and should demand from their local services. Only by doing that will we truly have a patient-led NHS that best serves patients' interests and, importantly, maintains its good reputation as an organisation that does not stand still, but can move with the times and be a health service fit for the 21st century.</p>

	Police Force Mergers (South-West)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.324.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" speakername="Laurence Robertson" colnum="324"  time="17:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.324.1/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate, so that we can discuss the Government's proposals to merge police forces in the south-west. I am pleased to be joined by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>, who will be seeking to catch your eye later, Mr. Chope, and to contribute briefly to this debate. I encourage him to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/2">I am totally opposed to the merger proposals in principle. I say &quot;in principle&quot; because we do not yet know the details of the proposals. As I understand it, the Government have said that the ideal force size is at least 4,000 officers and have asked the chief constables and police authorities up and down the country to come forward with proposals based on that guideline.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/3">Gloucestershire constabulary has some 1,300 officers and will, under the Government's criteria, be a prime contender for merger with two or three other forces&mdash;or possibly, as we are beginning to hear, with a force that covers the whole of the south-west. That latter proposal is the nightmare scenario, although it would fit neatly into the Government's regionalisation policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/4">Even the proposal to merge Gloucestershire constabulary with two or three other forces is unacceptable. The constabulary may be relatively small, but by all measures it performs very well indeed, and surely performance, rather than dogma, is what matters. The constabulary has a good track record of dealing with extraordinary incidents. The shoe bomber was arrested in Gloucester. The largest legal aid fraud case was brought to a successful conclusion in the county, as was the infamous West case, one of the largest murder investigations in the country. All those cases were investigated without the benefit of special grant financial resources. Add to that the special protection that the constabulary has to provide to members of the royal family who live in Gloucestershire, and one gets the impression of a competent force that has improved much in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/5">Even on the Government's own measures, the assessments are good. In the &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; report, the constabulary was awarded an &quot;excellent&quot; for strategic management and a &quot;good&quot; for investigating major and level 2 crimes&mdash;the areas critical to the concerns raised from a national perspective. Last month, the whole organisation was recommended for an Investors in People award, and was graded as being &quot;good&quot; on financial management in a recent assessment by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. That same body acknowledged that the force had successfully met the challenges of serious and organised crime and terrorism. That latter point is most important, because the Government say that one of the main reasons for proposing mergers is to enable forces to tackle the threat of terrorism more effectively, and to counter organised and serious crime. However, HMIC says that Gloucestershire constabulary already meets those criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/6">Let me be absolutely clear: the fight against terrorism should have as high a profile as possible. Nothing should be spared in our determination to protect our country and citizens from any form of attack. That is one of the biggest challenges that we face, and nothing should be allowed to detract from that. However, as well as that&mdash;and not instead of it&mdash;it is important to recognise that most of my constituents are more concerned about the yobs on the corner of the street every evening who are drunk, on drugs, kicking in doors, pushing down fences, throwing stones, swearing, threatening and being generally abusive. My constituents are more concerned about those people than about al-Qaeda.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/7">Of course, there are criticisms such as &quot;We never see a policeman around here&quot;, &quot;The police are obsessed with hounding motorists to the exclusion of everything else&quot;, and &quot;They do not turn up when crimes are reported&quot;. I am well aware of those criticisms, but it must be pointed out that they are made about not just the Gloucestershire constabulary or the smaller forces, but about forces of all sizes. The police are too remote for my liking, but that is the fault of too many pointless Government targets, too much paperwork, too much political correctness and, yes, perhaps too heavy an emphasis on traffic crime, when that could be tackled differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/8">The police are not just another arm of Government; they are there to serve the public. The question is whether they could better serve the old lady whose purse has been snatched, or the shopkeeper whose window has been put in if we made control of the police more remote. I do not think that they could. The chief constable of Gloucestershire, Dr. Timothy Brain, has a detailed knowledge of the entire county. When I talk to him about villages or even hamlets in my constituency, he knows where I mean and what the issues are. Would that be true of a chief constable who controlled a force covering three or four counties or, for goodness' sake, the whole south-west? It just could not be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/9">At present, the police authority draws its members from the county, but it would become remote, unaccountable and unresponsive if members were drawn from three or four counties, or from the whole region. If the authority represented such a large area, how would the enlarged force be financed? People make strong enough objections now to paying for increases in the police precept. Those same people would find it highly objectionable to be asked to pay increasing police precepts&mdash;on top of the inexorable rise in council tax&mdash;when that money would be spent on police work in other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/10">The local aspect is important. In the run-up to the county council elections, the Conservatives in Gloucestershire said that, in office, it would fund an extra 63 police officers for the constabulary. That is a 5 per cent. increase in manpower for the force. The Conservatives took over administration in May, and are starting to fulfil that pledge. Those extra officers could be lost if the mergers go ahead, because the county council is pledged to provide them for Gloucestershire only.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/11">In a joint statement, chief constable Dr. Timothy Brain and the chairman of the police authority, Brigadier Michael Browne, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/12" class="indent">&quot;It is our overwhelming conclusion that there is a compelling case for continuing to stand alone as an independent force, and we shall be advising the Home Office of this.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/13">The chief constable goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The merger process is costly and in assessments made the payback period will be at least eight years, which is a cost that will have to be borne by the tax payer. This is eight years of money that could and should be invested in the County police.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/15">There is no equivocation there from the chief constable or the police authority of Gloucestershire. They believe that they have met the Government's requirements, have performed well and are still improving, and that to merge police forces would be to throw the baby out with the bathwater.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/16">The Government say that forces must be large enough to be blind to existing county borders but even a regional police force would have its borders. I live in virtually the most northerly house in the county of Gloucestershire. I am a long way from Cornwall; in fact, I am as near to the Scottish border as to Land's End. However, if a crime were committed just a few hundred yards up the road from me, who would deal with it&mdash;the remote south-west police force or the much nearer West Midlands police force? The point that I am making is that taking away county boundaries will not help in that respect. A further point is that Gloucestershire has far more in common with Worcestershire and Herefordshire than with Cornwall and Devon, yet the force is more likely to be amalgamated with Cornwall and Devon, or at least Wiltshire and Avon, with which it has nothing in common. In other words, regions do not exist in any meaningful sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/17">The people of the north-east voted to reject the proposal to create an elected regional assembly in that area of England, yet the Government are introducing regional government by stealth. Proposals to merge the ambulance service, the fire service and the police are already on the table, as is the move towards regional planning and road funding, for example. The electorate have never voted for such changes. The only place where they are desired is in the pro-European minds of the Prime Minister and his Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/18">To summarise, the Government say that they want forces to be more capable of tackling national, international, serious and organised crime and terrorism. Gloucestershire constabulary, which has increased its number of detectives and other specialist investigators, has already showed itself to be capable of doing so. What the Government should be doing is concentrating on improving those forces that are not performing; in other words, take the rifle approach. The blunderbuss approach&mdash;setting yet another arbitrary and meaningless target, such as the requirement on forces to have a strength of 4,000 or more officers&mdash;will not achieve the Government's objectives. Nor will it satisfy a dissatisfied public who want Osama bin Laden arrested, but also want an end to the antisocial behaviour at the corner of their streets, which is blighting their lives. There is an old saying that all politics is local. It is not true; nor is it true that all policing is local. However, those are commonly held views.</p>

	<p pid="a.326.0/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that I concur with what he is saying. I am sorry that I missed the first two minutes of his speech. I do not know whether he mentioned the new headquarters in Quedgeley, but in respect of the link between that and triservices, there would be a huge cost implication if there were two white elephants. Is it not time that the Government considered the implications of that, rather than just scrapping Quedgeley before evaluating the situation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.327.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" speakername="Laurence Robertson" colnum="327"  time="17:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.327.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Member, who is my neighbour in Gloucestershire, for making that point. The three emergency services moved two years ago into a tristar centre. As far as I can see&mdash;I have visited it&mdash;it is a centre of excellence. Gloucestershire constabulary has a new building coming as its headquarters, yet we are talking about moving it and throwing that all away. That is absolutely incredible, and he makes a good point.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.0/2">To conclude my remarks, in reality, control of the police should be a mixture of local as well as national input, and there should be no place for mergers based on political dogma, arbitrary targets or artificially drawn boundaries. I ask the Government to think again.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.327.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="327"  time="17:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.327.1/1">I wish to make two brief points. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> drew attention to the successful way in which Gloucestershire constabulary deals with serious incidents. As long ago as 1995, it dealt successfully with the West case, one of the largest murder investigations in the country. In 2003, it led the successful policing operation in respect of RAF Fairford, which involved one of the largest deployments of police officers in the United Kingdom since the miners' strike. In the same year, Gloucestershire was the focus of international attention with the highly successful terrorist operation to arrest Sajid Baadat, the alleged shoe bomber, in Gloucester. It was not supported by specific Home Office grants, but funded purely from the constabulary's own resources. The constabulary is capable of dealing with both serious crime and terrorist incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.1/2">I represent a rural part of the county and I wish to draw attention to the impact that a merger, especially a large-scale merger, would have on policing in rural areas. The constabulary confirms in its outline business case that experience of such mergers has demonstrated that resources will inevitably be drawn from rural and suburban parts of forces to the largest settlements within the boundaries. There is already tension in Gloucestershire about such matters and a perception in its rural communities that a disproportionate amount of resources is devoted to Cheltenham and Gloucester.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.1/3">I am concerned about mergers with large cities. For example, if we merged with Avon and Somerset, Bristol would be in the mix. In those circumstances, my worry and that of my constituents is that there would be an inexorable move of policing resources to the large cities, given the more serious crime in those areas and, as a result, my constituents and those in other rural parts of the county would be disadvantaged. That is why I have no hesitation in supporting the police authority and the chief constable in their contention that the best strategic option for Gloucestershire is to remain a stand-alone police force.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.328.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="328"  time="17:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.328.0/1">I apologise to you, Mr. Chope, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the Minister and to my hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> for being a little late for the start of the debate. The time change has slightly confused me.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/2">I wish to pick up on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase>. One of the great successes in policing in recent years is the result of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and, in particular, local policing initiatives. Even if they are not visible on the streets of our small market towns, the local police can get closer to their communities. They have been successful in Gloucestershire, for example, in providing mobile police information units to some of our more remote villages, which have been of great benefit and have provided much reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/3">If the Government's plan is to merge police forces, a proposal that I strongly oppose, we shall have to make changes to the other agencies of the Court Service. Under the heading &quot;Force Restructuring&quot;, a letter that I received from the chief constable dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-04">4 October 2005</phrase> states:</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/4" class="indent">&quot;In response to your question of 30th September, I can confirm that there are significant implications for other Criminal Justice partners consequent upon any changes to force boundaries. The CPS, Probation Service, Combined Court Service and the Youth Offending Service are all likely to be directly affected.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/5">It seems that, in general, people have not got to grips with some implications. The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/6" class="indent">&quot;You will be aware that the Combined Court Service has only recently completed its own re-structuring process.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/7">The Government are restructuring everything yet again. The chief constables goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Currently all of the justice agencies are co-terminous with the Gloucestershire Constabulary and this has, undoubtedly, been a great strength in the improvements that have been achieved in the last two years with respect to joined-up justice within the County. Clearly, it would be a matter for individual agencies to comment upon the direct implications for them arising from any re-structuring.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/9">The matter is serious, and I hope that the Minister will respond to it. Suffice it to say, Opposition Members represent a large chunk of Gloucestershire and it is the perception that the people of Gloucestershire do not want their county force, which they much respect, merged into a larger unit.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> on obtaining this important debate. I am glad that he has had the opportunity to raise <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">his concerns, and that his hon. Friends the Members for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> and for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> have been able to raise their concerns. I am becoming more familiar with policing issues in the south-west, not least those affecting <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the constituency of the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase>, who on a previous occasion obtained a similar debate, to which I responded. It is helpful to me to understand some of the local concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/2">I do not deny that there are concerns. Equally, I hope that the debate and other opportunities will enable me to explain why we believe that the reforms that we have in mind will strengthen policing, not just at strategic level, but locally. That was the key point among several important ones that the hon. Member for Tewkesbury made. I understand why hon. Members are concerned, but, as I have said, our proposals, far from pulling resources away from neighbourhood policing, will reinforce it.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.1/3">The clear message from Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary is that the demands that are now placed on our police forces by what are called level 2 threats&mdash;terrorism and organised crime&mdash;are growing. If we do not do anything about that, the growth in business, as it were, for the police, will increasingly draw resources away from neighbourhood policing.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.1/1">I may in a while, but my main duty is to respond to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury. If there is a little time available, I shall take the intervention. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman made the Chair aware of his interest in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.1/2">In its review, Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary found a relationship between the size of a force and its ability to cope with the demands that I have mentioned. Larger forces were more likely to be able to absorb them with less impact on their front line and on local policing. The move to larger strategic forces will protect neighbourhood policing, by ensuring that all forces have the necessary resilience and can tackle crime at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.1/3">The hon. Gentleman is right; we need police forces that can deal with the threats of terrorism and organised crime and also deal with the yobs who create difficulties for his constituents, and lend assistance to victims of crime such as the old lady to whom he referred. What is happening is a matter of correctly rebalancing strategy and strategic organisation at one end with neighbourhood policing at the other. The basic command units will not be diminished by the restructuring that we have in mind. On the contrary, they will be strengthened. Most importantly, they will remain the key platform for the provision of local policing services to communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.1/4">I agree that the role of the local police officer&mdash;the bobby on the beat&mdash;is essential. We want those officers to be more visible, but the reforms will strengthen neighbourhood policing, not detract from it.</p>

	<p pid="a.329.2/1">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way, and apologise to him, to you, Mr. Chope, and to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on obtaining the debate, for being late. I, too, was wrong-footed by the change in timing. I just want to ask the Minister whether he is quoting Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary only when it suits him. It reported on Gloucester constabulary in October 2004 and said that</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/2" class="indent">&quot;a number of successful cross-border operations targeting Level 2 drug offenders and money launderers have been conducted&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/3">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/4" class="indent">&quot;for a force of its size, Gloucestershire Constabulary has a comprehensive level 2 capability&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.329.2/5">It may be right in a general sense that level 2 policing is not effective at county level, but that is not true of Gloucestershire.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.330.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="330"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.330.0/1">I shall deal in a moment with the performance of Gloucestershire police. It is encouraging, but I would argue that it is not sustainable. With the ever-increasing demands made by level 2 criminality, we cannot expect our smaller police forces to continue that level of improvement, which is what we want of them. The question is how to ensure a sustainable structure that can deal with the level 2 threat as well as neighbourhood policing, which is important to us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/2">I return to the question of force structure. The work now being undertaken by police forces and their authorities is not the result of some whim or diktat from the Home Office; it is the result of a detailed study by independent professional advisers on policing matters. It did not come out of the blue from Marsham street. It is a considered study by professional advisers. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has made it clear that he has no blueprint for force amalgamations. The initiative for reform should be and is being driven locally, by people who know their communities and who know the challenges faced by the police in each area.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.0/3">HMIC's report &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; is the product of an extensive examination of the capacity and ability of all 43 forces to provide key protective services to national standards. It found that the 43-force structure is no longer fit for the purpose, and that the police service cannot provide protective services to the standard that is essential given the twin demands of level 2 criminality and neighbourhood policing.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.1/1">The Minister said that we have 43 forces in England and Wales. Will he give us an idea of how many forces might remain at the end the process? Will there be 25 or 30? Will he also take the opportunity to rule out a single force for the south-west? I would be interested to know how many amalgamations there are likely to be.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.330.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="330"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.330.2/1">I am sorry to disappoint the hon. Gentleman&mdash;we have had exchanges on the subject before&mdash;but I cannot give him an optimum number because, as I said, the Home Secretary does not have one. We want to see it built from the ground up. Equally, I cannot confirm or deny whether there will be a regional force. [Hon. Members: &quot;Oh!&quot;] I do not confirm or deny that we will have a regional force, because we want to see what is recommended and proposed by the police forces and authorities from the region represented by the hon. Gentlemen. We are listening to local opinion; we do not have a preset agenda about size or shape, nor about numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.2/2">With regard to the performance of the Gloucestershire police force, the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and others have commented on the improvements in dealing with local crime and neighbourhood disorder, and in terms of reducing volume crime. Gloucestershire deserves credit for achieving a 10 per cent. reduction in volume crime since last year and for its strong performance in sanction detections, achieved with a record number of police officers. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean said that there are now 1,300 officers&mdash;I would settle for that; my notes say that there are 1,291 which is fairly close. That is 158 officers more than in 1997.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.331.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="331"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.331.0/1">With impeccable timing, the Minister closed on the point that I wanted to follow up on&mdash;the reason for the increase in the number of police officers. The number funded by central Government since 1997 has fallen; the increase has come about because of an increase in the police precept. The increase in the number of officers has been completely paid for by local council tax payers. It is they who should be thanked, not the Government.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.331.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="331"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.331.1/1">Time does not allow for a detailed analysis of who has paid for what, but I promise to write to the hon. Gentleman, giving him a clear breakdown of the increases in Government funding for the police force in his area&mdash;increases of which we are proud.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.331.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="331"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.331.2/1">The Minister has said more than once that he has no preconceived idea of what sort of police forces might emerge from the consultations. He also said that he would listen to local opinion. If local opinion and the view of the Gloucestershire police is overwhelmingly against a merger, is the status quo still an option?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.331.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="331"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.331.3/1">The status quo is not an option for reasons that I am about to give. My earlier remarks need to be seen in the context of the overall recommendations. As the hon. Gentleman said, HMIC was clear that the creation of strategic forces would require at least 4,000 officers or 6,000 staff to provide the necessary capacity to offer the &quot;best business solution&quot;. It is a radical solution, but I put it to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury and other hon. Members that simply fudging the issue, perhaps by asking for greater collaboration or some sort of federation without considering the need to create strategic forces, would mean that, in time, as level 2 threats increased and other, neighbourhood issues had to be dealt with, we would have to return to the issue again.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.331.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="331"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.331.4/1">Will the Minister give way?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.331.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="331"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.331.5/1">I shall make a little more progress and then, if there is time, I will happily give way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/2">Gloucestershire police have about 1,300 officers and 2,029 staff in total. As I have emphasised, I am not prejudging the submission to be made by Gloucestershire police authority in December, but if Gloucestershire police want to remain as an independent force, they will need to make an extremely powerful case for that to be considered, because it would fall completely outside the criteria that have been advised to us by HMIC.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.331.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="331"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.331.6/1">Seven of the 43 existing forces have 4,000 or more officers. I would be interested if the Minister could say how much flexibility there is on that figure. Will only forces of more than 4,000 officers be considered appropriate under the new regime, or will there be scope for forces below that size?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.332.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="332"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.332.0/1">Again, HMIC has made a recommendation on what it regards as the minimum size for a strategic force. The hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that a small number of forces already fit that. An extremely powerful case would need to be made for a force to have numbers lower than the ones that I have indicated and to be considered sufficient to be a strategic force.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.332.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="332"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew19">
	<p pid="a.332.1/1">The Minister's latter comment seems to suggest, assuming that a sufficiently powerful case is made, that the status quo is an option, whereas he previously said that it was not. I am a little unsure; perhaps he can help me.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-02a.332.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="332"  time="17:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051102/halltext/51102h05.htm#51102h05_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.332.2/1">I refer the hon. Gentleman to the title of the debate, which is about the south-west. We are talking in a slightly wider context, although we are focusing on Gloucestershire. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has made it absolutely clear that, in respect of the number and size of our police forces, the status quo certainly cannot remain. I am also saying&mdash;I shall repeat it one final time&mdash;that we have not made a prejudgment about which forces we want or do not want. We want things to happen from the ground up. We are waiting to hear the preference of people in the south-west&mdash;the police authorities and the police forces&mdash;and that will be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/2">The hon. Member for Tewkesbury gave Gloucestershire constabulary credit for its performance in dealing with a number of high-profile investigations and public order incidents. I share his view that it should be congratulated and I heartily join him in doing so. I shall write shortly to all chief constables, including his chief constable, on the subject of asset recovery. Gloucestershire can take credit for being ahead of its target in terms of the number of asset confiscation orders issued. Again, that is because the force has made the issue a priority and it should be congratulated on doing so. I cannot, however, share the hon. Gentleman's view that that is sufficient to meet the requirements that HMIC has set out. More importantly, HMIC does not share his view. &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; found that all forces lacked capability to deal with the less publicly visible but hugely important challenges posed by serious and organised crime and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/3">We should also consider how effectively and efficiently we equip our police service to cope with extra burdens under the current structure. Gloucestershire constabulary received a special grant of &pound;7.2 million for policing RAF Fairford during the Iraq war. The hon. Member for Forest of Dean raised that issue. I recognise that policing the base was a major burden on the force and I place it on the record that I believe that it did a very good and professional job. Although there will always be exceptional cases in which mutual aid between forces is required, even under the new structure with the larger strategic forces, a larger and more resilient force is still less likely to have to rely on help from other forces to manage such demands. That is one reason why we are considering restructuring. Police forces and authorities throughout England and Wales have now submitted their initial shortlist of options, and experts from HMIC, supported by specialist analysts and researchers, are working through the plans with forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/4">Each proposal will be assessed on its merits, and the local discussion of the options will be informed by the design criteria set out in HMIC's report, including such matters as size, geography, coterminosity with partner agencies, criminal markets and local identity. The hon. Member for Cotswold is correct to say that there will be consequences for the criminal justice agencies if and when there are changes and the strategic forces are introduced. I assure him that the Government will consider that question very carefully, because we have placed great emphasis in recent years on developing, for example, local criminal justice boards so that local agencies can collaborate. As we move to new strategic forces, we will need to take account of other changes that will be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/5">Although restructuring at force level will give us the larger strategic forces that we need to deal with the new threats and the increased pressures, I shall not deny the hon. Gentleman or any other hon. Members the neighbourhood policing that they require. The Government do not believe that the strategic forces will detract from resources or the focus on neighbourhood policing; rather, they will allow the resources to be allocated that are needed at that level. Resources will not be pulled away to deal with the new and more difficult threats that we face. We will be able to have the front-line policing that we all need.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/6" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/7" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at eighteen minutes to Six o'clock.</p>
