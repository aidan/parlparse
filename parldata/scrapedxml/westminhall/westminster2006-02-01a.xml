	<p pid="a.80.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. Israel will take desperate measures if it is in a desperate circumstance. The west should not allow Israel to find itself in such desperate circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/2">The Foreign Secretary has described military action as &quot;inconceivable&quot;. He has said that that is not on the table and is not something that we should think about. That is hopelessly naive. We need to maintain the leverage&mdash;as John McCain referred to it&mdash;of having that option available to us. It is an appalling action to take, but it may be the least worst alternative and we should continue to consider that as a possibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/3">Time is running out to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons. If we think we have a problem now, how much greater will it be when Iran acquires nuclear weapons? There have been occasions when this Government have been bold and courageous in taking action in the belief that they were stopping a rogue state acquiring weapons of mass destruction. The Prime Minister has shown great leadership on this type of issue in the past, although that is, perhaps, an unpopular view, at least in his own party. None the less, it is time that this Government recovered some of that courage and prepare to take bold action to defend our interests and those of the world community as a whole. We face an enormous challenge. I hope that the Government show that they are up to that challenge.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.2/1">I should like to point out to the Chamber my position as chairman of Labour Friends of Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> on securing this debate on a vital, extremely timely and fast-moving issue. I was pleased to have been able to hear his contribution to the debate on Israeli policy in the Palestinian territories a couple of weeks ago. He spoke with experience and wisdom about the security threat facing Israel, and did the same again today, with astute analysis and thoughtfulness.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/3">This is the most profound and important issue affecting international relations today. It has an impact not only in the immediate region, but throughout the world. It affects relations between and with the European Union, the United States, China, Russia and India&mdash;a subject that I shall come back to, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/4">The internal nature of Iran is not particularly encouraging. By and large, since 1979, religious extremism has been at the top of the Iranian Government, interpreting Islamic teachings as anti-western, anti-capitalist and anti-Semitic. The election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad as Iranian President in June 2005 fortified decisively the position of the extremist clerical elite at the heart of Iranian Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/5">Thus, as the hon. Gentleman said, we see a denial that the holocaust ever took place: last month, Iran announced its intention to sponsor a conference to examine the scientific evidence supporting the holocaust. There have been calls for the death of the western world. Soon after he became President, Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Thanks to the blood of the martyrs, a new Islamic revolution has arisen and the Islamic revolution of 1384 will, God willing, cut off the roots of injustice in the world.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/7">As the hon. Gentleman also said, there is a direct threat to the existence of another state; the comments last year about wishing to see Israel wiped off the face of the earth were both offensive and disturbing. Only last week, the Iranian Defence Minister was quoted as saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/8" class="indent">&quot;Zionists should know that if they do anything evil against Iran, the response of Iran's armed forces will be so firm that it will send them into external coma, like Sharon&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/9">I find it absolutely astonishing that one member of the United Nations should be permitted to express a wish to obliterate another. That cannot be tolerated. It is therefore vital that all of us&mdash;particularly the Foreign Office and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs&mdash;should support the work this week by the international community to ask the International Atomic Energy Agency to report Iran to the UN Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/10">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Iran's expansionist and aggressive foreign policy, which has been backed up by Iranian support for terrorist groups. As he pointed out, Iran has strong links with groups associated with violence and terrorism, such as Hezbollah, that wish to undermine the middle east peace process. Iran supports Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which claimed responsibility for the attack at Hadera in Israel in October 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/11">Given that context&mdash;a demagogic religious extremist President, support for terrorist groups and a wish to wipe out Israel&mdash;it appears likely that Iran is attempting to back up its foreign policy through an acceleration of its nuclear programme. That would completely derail the middle east peace process, increase tension in the region to crisis point and have profound repercussions throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/12">As I mentioned earlier, the Iranian nuclear issue is affecting, and will continue to make its mark on, relations between EU states and with the United States. The attitude of the emerging economic superpowers of the world&mdash;China, India, Russia&mdash;to the Iran nuclear question could shape global politics for decades. For example, Iran provides about 15 per cent. of China's oil needs, a percentage that is becoming ever higher and more lucrative, given the expansion of the Chinese economy. For its part, Russia is building a nuclear power station for Iran. Both nations are very dependent on Iran, so their support for the United States and the EU three on reporting Iran's nuclear programme to the Security Council this week is welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/13">I disagree slightly with the hon. Gentleman's interpretation of that support. I think it a sign of greater decisive action that shows an encouraging element of almost universal support from the international community in requesting that Iran complies with its non-proliferation treaty obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.2/14">It is extremely important that negotiations go well when Russia meets with Iran on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February</phrase> to discuss the Russian proposal to enrich uranium outside Iran.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.1/1">I agree to some extent. Russia's meeting with Iran on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February</phrase> will be vital. There are not many grounds for optimism at the moment, but that meeting is a chink of light that I hope will expand.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/2">It is difficult to be hugely optimistic at the moment. Iran has deceived the rest of the world about its nuclear research for close to 20 years. Its posturing President seems hell-bent on securing nuclear weapons to assert domination in the region and threaten the security of Israel. Yet I should like to end on a positive note. I am convinced that Iran has a vibrant and positive role to play in the international community. Its vast oil reserves will ensure that it becomes a major economic player with a strong say in international politics; the country would be able to play a role on the world stage without recourse to aggression.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/3">Its demographic pattern&mdash;there is a young, large and increasing population&mdash;gives Iran huge potential in economic, social and cultural matters in future decades. The hon. Gentleman said that we should be extraordinarily critical about the Iranian Government but not the Iranian people, and that was very valid. A moderate Iranian nation would be strong, proud and able to fulfil its potential both internally and internationally. There is hope, but it is vital that the international community should stay together in its condemnation of Iran's leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/4">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving us the opportunity to express our views at such a timely moment&mdash;the next few days and weeks are of huge importance. I sincerely hope, and think it essential, that the United Nations should show real leadership when the issue is reported to it.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.2/1">I am extremely grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> for securing this debate on an extremely important subject, and I am privileged to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase>. Many of the points made have shown that all parties feel that the issue is the most serious that we have faced during the past several years.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/2">I should like to draw attention to two pieces of rhetoric that everybody in the Chamber will have heard and that contrast starkly with some words on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning. First, we heard President Ahmadinejad spewing forth a series of appalling, irrational statements of hatred and loathing that emphasise the point made by both my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire and the hon. Member for Hartlepool: our argument must be with Iran's Government and not with its people. Secondly, President Bush recently talked in his state of the nation address about the serious view that he takes of the situation. However, both those pieces of rhetoric contrast starkly with the words of Mrs. Spicer on the radio this morning. She talked about her young son Leon, who was killed outside Basra just before Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/3">I am sure that many hon. Members remember the BBC documentary &quot;Last Night Another Soldier&quot; from the 1980s, about the steady drip of military casualties in Northern Ireland. Let us spare a thought this morning for the parents of Lance Corporal Allan Douglas of the Highlanders and Corporal Gordon Pritchard of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. Two families in Scotland have been shattered by events in Iraq which are directly related to what is going on in Iran. Anyone who doubts that the technology that killed those soldiers came from anywhere other than Iran needs to consider carefully the words of the free press in the west, the less-than-free press in the east, our ambassador in Baghdad and our general officer commanding Multinational Division (South East). They all make it clear that wherever this kit is coming from, it is destined to destabilise, kill and distract the west from Iran's nuclear programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/4">My hon. Friend made said that it was possible that destabilisation by Iran had already started or that it would start in the near future in Afghanistan. Precisely the same sorts of weapons&mdash;exactly the same manufacture and design&mdash;that have been used to kill our soldiers in southern Iraq are appearing on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. It does not take a rocket scientist&mdash;that might be a bad pun&mdash;to work out where this stuff is coming from. It is instructive to see how the pernicious influence of terrorism spreads from Tehran through Pakistan, to the border of Afghanistan and through to Iraq. Precisely those same routes will be followed in the event of Iran gaining a nuclear weapon.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/5">It is worth bearing in mind the exact Iranian position. We have no need to emphasise the fact that Iran's support to Shi'a extremists via the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Lebanese Hezbollah has killed, and continues to kill, people throughout the middle east. Iran plays host to a powerful group of al-Qaeda operatives. As far as we aware, those people are confined; they are contained somewhere in Tehran. The influence that comes from the fact that those men exist, albeit under Iranian civil and police control, continues to allow powerful groups of Sunni extremists to operate inside the borders of Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/6">The conflict between Sunni and Shi'a inside Iran does not need to be emphasised, but we should not underestimate the influence on President Ahmadinejad of those particular strengths and feelings in his country. He is trying to balance Shi'a against Sunni and is having to play host to the world's most dangerous terrorist organisation. People such as Abu Mussab al-Zarqawi are using their influence through Iran to operate inside Iraq and Afghanistan. Anyone who underestimates the pressure on Iran at the moment is clearly wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/7">We would all condemn the continued support of Palestinian terrorists by Iran. There is no doubt that the fingerprints of the IRGC and of Lebanese Hezbollah are seen every day in the middle east. Any moves that Iran is likely to make can serve only further to destabilise the middle east peace process. If we allow Iran further to develop its ability to produce nuclear weapons, albeit under the umbrella of nuclear power, and if we allow the Government in Iran further to exercise their stranglehold on the people of Iran, we will have only ourselves to blame.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/8">Anyone who cannot see the comparison between the situation in Iran and the situation in Iraq more than 10 years ago, and who does not feel the same lurch in his or her stomach when we discuss this subject, is blind to the lessons of the past three or four years in Iraq. If the west wishes to avoid another situation like the one that we face today, which is killing our soldiers day on day, we must understand that this is the most serious threat that we have faced for some years.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/9">I despair when I read that the Secretary of State for Defence has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Elements within or connected to the Iranian system&mdash;I put it no more strongly than that&mdash;seem to be encouraging violent opposition to multinational forces.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/11">Here is the rub, however, because he continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/12" class="indent">&quot;That is a risky way for anyone to behave, so we hope that it does not continue.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2005-10-10.34"><i>Official Report,</i> 10 October 2005; Vol. 437, c. 34</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.82.2/13">What words are those to try to salve the consciences of the families of dead soldiers? What words are those to go forward to oppose the dangerous Government in Iran? We need less empty rhetoric and more action by the Government to ensure that we provide the right gestures, not just the right words.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">If the hon. Gentleman will restrain himself, I might say some other things that will prompt him to ask me to give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> on securing the debate. Although I know that it tends to become a matter of rubric to congratulate people, he does need to be congratulated on that, on the way he prosecuted the case and on how he illustrated the concerns of many Back-Bench Members across the political spectrum about the situation and how we have reached it in terms of our international diplomacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3">I share concerns about the gravity of the international situation. I do not think that it has been so grave since the fall of the Berlin wall. What surprises me is that that has not been picked up by some of our colleagues in Parliament or by the media. Put in a nutshell, we know that Israel cannot, and will not, tolerate Iran getting anywhere near having the capacity to develop a nuclear weapon. The clock is ticking.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">The situation requires the maximum amount of international agreement, particularly among the five permanent members of the Security Council, and all our diplomatic skills to prevent Iran from having nuclear weapons. Otherwise, even the most moderate Israeli Government will feel compelled to intervene. As Israeli Governments have repeatedly reminded us since the founding of the Israeli state, Israel cannot afford to lose one war. For that reason, the situation is extraordinarily grave.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/5">I take heart from the fact that the Russian Federation and China have joined the other permanent members of the Security Council at least in contemplating reporting Iran to the Security Council. That is significant, because although reference has been made to Russia's commercial interest in Iran and to Iran's aspirations to having nuclear energy and/or a nuclear weapon, both the Russian Federation and China probably recognise the gravity of the situation. They realise that the potential for a major conflict or a conflagration is consequent on Iran's approach to nuclear power and nuclear weapons, which, if not arrested, would have consequences that are in no one's interests. Moscow and Beijing now realise how serious the international situation is in relation to the Tehran regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/6">I am surprised that the Minister for Europe is present, because it seems as if a different Minister responds on these issues each time. I am not sure whether he is the jobbing Minister or the Minister who has responsibility for this matter. I do not say that sarcastically&mdash;I would like to know the answer. There seems to be a shifting of the sands, which is indicative of how our Foreign Office works&mdash;I deliberately say &quot;Foreign Office&quot; and not &quot;Ministers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/7">I do not think that the Foreign Office has been very skilled in relation to Iran, and that eventually permeates through to the ministerial team, whose sincerity and diligence on this matter I do not question. Disappointing advice and counsel has been given by our diplomatic professionals and that has worked its way through to the ministerial team over a number of years. That is shown by the three wasted years when the EU3, with the best of motives, pandered to, and appeased, the Tehran regime. They have nothing to show for it. History shows us that when we take the advice and counsel of the Foreign Office and follow appeasement, we pay a heavy price later.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/8">As a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the previous Parliament, I remember how we were coaxed and encouraged by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to visit Tehran. I refused to go. My colleagues were well motivated, but the visit bolstered the regime. It sent all the wrong signals. The visit was made under the encouragement, advice and counsel of the Foreign Office. I say in all seriousness to the Minister that the Government need to listen more to Back Benchers. On some occasions, their prudence and wisdom might surpass that of the mandarins at the Foreign Office. If they listen to Back Benchers, especially across the political spectrum, it might occur to them that perhaps there has been a misread in the Foreign Office about the nature of the regime in Tehran and its intentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/9">Reference has been made to people, both in Iran and in painful exile, who are boldly standing in resistance to the regime in Tehran. We must recognise that those who have given the west the greatest indication of the full nature of the threat of developments in Iran and the technologies that it is pursuing in its nuclear programme are members of the Iranian resistance, yet we treat them as pariahs. That is not only unacceptable, it is bad politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/10">Many of us consider that the constituent organisation of the national council's resistance, the PMOI, has been listed with a terror tag to placate and appease the dreadful people in the regime in Tehran. That must stop as a matter of justice. It must also stop out of our naked self-interest. We need to send a signal that we stand by people who stand for freedom. We have a rich tradition. In 1940, some people thought that we should not recognise Charles de Gaulle. Whatever we might think of him, he was a brave man and also a correct man. As Churchill said, &quot;Here is the constable of France.&quot; He was the flame flickering. There were some who would have tallied and bargained with the Vichy regime. It now comes round full circle. The Minister needs to take account of those who support freedom, and who will also helping him to find out what is really happening in Iran.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-01a.89.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" speakername="Keith Simpson" colnum="89"  time="010:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060201/halltext/60201h01.htm#60201h01_spnew28">
	<p pid="a.89.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> on introducing this important debate on Iran's nuclear programme. Like him and other hon. Members, one has the sense that this is a serious moment and that the next few months and years will be important not only for the international community but for Britain. As somebody who is by nature a reasonably sunny personality&mdash;at least politically&mdash;I am pessimistic not only about the situation in Iran but about the connected situation in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">Hon. Members have spoken passionately and I should like to congratulate Labour and Conservative Friends of Israel on some most effective lobbying. Perhaps one day, when the regime has changed, we shall have a debate in which Labour and Conservative friends of Iran will be represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">The hon. Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> seemed to speak on behalf of a number of my colleagues who were unable to get in. He is, of course, the voice of Lady Thatcher, in that when she was Prime Minister she believed that the Foreign Office existed to represent the interests of foreigners inside the United Kingdom. As a shadow Foreign Office Minister, I am not here to defend the Foreign Office&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will do that&mdash;but I should like to point out a factual error that the hon. Gentleman made. The most malign advice that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was given did not come from a Foreign Office official. Sir Horace Wilson was of course from the Treasury, and we should all know where our real enemies lie in Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/4">Our policy is simple. We welcome Monday's decision by the five permanent members of the Security Council to report Iran in March. We recognise that we must work hard to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, for all the reasons that have been succinctly argued by colleagues. However, like other colleagues, I have a number of concerns. It seems that Iran has had numerous opportunities to change course and address international concern about its nuclear intentions, yet the seven resolutions that the International Atomic Energy Agency has passed on Iran since 2003 represent a litany of Iran's failures to declare its activities and the deficiencies in its co-operation with the agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/5">After more than three years of inquiries, the IAEA has not been able to establish the details of the full genesis of Iran's programme. Iran has failed to provide transparency and has followed a deliberate policy of concealment. In early January, it removed IAEA seals from its nuclear installations and made preparations to begin enrichment. It has violated its safeguard agreements and there is a long litany of its saying one thing and doing the exact opposite. That is a difficulty for both the Foreign Office and the international community. They are hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. There is no guarantee that any commitment made by Iran, whether individually to the United Kingdom or to the international community, will every be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/6">A number of hon. Friends and colleagues, including my hon. Friend, put forward the dilemma for any democratic country and the international community. That is what happens when every element of diplomacy has been used, an attempt has been made to bring pressure to bear and sanctions have ultimately been introduced but the country at the receiving end has failed to respond. That leaves a great chasm and some form of military action may then be inevitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/7">A number of hon. Friends and colleagues pointed out their concern that if Iran fails to respond and the international community fails to persuade it, Israel might ultimately decide to take military action. If I follow the logic of the arguments of my hon. Friends and colleagues, that puts even greater emphasis on the international community to think about taking the full rack of sanctions. As we know from the United Nations charter, that does not rule out the international community's use of some form of military action.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/8">I want to flag up for the Minister a number of the Conservative party's concerns. We are worried that we seem already to have moved away from the outcome that our Government, the United States and our allies were seeking&mdash;an early referral to the UN Security Council. The Government's original response to the Iranian ending of suspension was, rightly, very strong, but are we able to deliver on our threat? Have the Government received assurances from Russia and China that they will support tougher action if necessary and if Iran continues its course of intransigence and confrontation? To my mind, Russia and China are the key. If they decide to sit on their hands and not go the full course, I greatly fear that someone&mdash;I am sure that the Government are attempting to point this out to them&mdash;will take what most of us would consider to be unacceptable action, which would ultimately be the military option.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-01a.92.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2008" speakername="Douglas Alexander" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="92"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060201/halltext/60201h01.htm#60201h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.92.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> on securing the debate. I have, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase> urged me to do, listened carefully to the contributions from hon. Members on both Back Benches, which included a number of powerful speeches, and from the Front-Bench spokespeople for the principal Opposition parties who offered considered and measured contributions to this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">In his characteristically mild, supportive and gentle way, my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock asked on what basis I, as the Minister for Europe, was appearing before the Chamber this morning. Perhaps I might clarify that the Minister for the Middle East is meeting Ministers from the region who are in London attending the Afghan conference, and the Foreign Secretary is meeting the Iranian Foreign Minister this very morning, so I speak on behalf of my Foreign Office colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">There have been a number of powerful and measured contributions from both sides. However, perhaps not for the first time in recent days, Labour is not as well represented as the Opposition. That was a source of concern until I heard the contribution from my hon. Friend the Member for Thurrock, which made me revise my view on whether more contributions from the Labour Back Benches would be entirely helpful to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">I acknowledge at the outset, as did the hon. Member for South-West Hertfordshire, that the debate is exceptionally timely. Before I explain the significance of that, I must echo the tributes that have been paid, and the sentiments that have been expressed by hon. Members on both sides of the House, to the families of the service personnel who lost their lives in Iraq in recent days.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/5">The debate is timely because tomorrow the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors will meet in special session in Vienna. For the board's 35 members, there will be just one agenda item: Iran's challenge to the international non-proliferation system and how to respond to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/6">I have a certain sympathy with the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase>, who acknowledged that there is a fairly broad consensus among the parties on the nature of the problem facing us. However, with the greatest of respect to hon. Members, I struggled to find clarity in their contributions of the details of the prescription, as distinct from the description, in the face of the problem. I shall try to set out for the record the Government's position and how we will take matters forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/7">Let me explain why the Government, with France and Germany, as part of the E3 process and supported by the European Union, believe that the time has come to involve the UN Security Council, to which a number of hon. Members referred. Two and a half years ago, Iran was forced to admit to the IAEA that it was building secret installations to enrich uranium and to produce plutonium which could be used to produce material for nuclear weapons. Iran was and still is building missiles that could carry nuclear warheads. Subsequent investigations showed that, in the IAEA's words,</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Iran's policy of concealment has resulted in many breaches of its obligation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/9">A series of IAEA reports identified serious grounds for concern that Iran's nuclear programme might not be, as Iranian leaders claim, solely for peaceful purposes. Then, and now, our aim has been to persuade Iran by building broad international support&mdash;that relates to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> about Russia and China&mdash;and working through multilateral bodies in order to take steps to guarantee that its nuclear programme will not be used for military ends. Under the IAEA's statute, Iran should have been reported to the Security Council two years ago. The UK, with France and Germany, decided to look for a way forward, through negotiation. The IAEA board agreed to delay involving the Security Council to give that initiative a chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/10">At the heart of our initiative was a proposal that Iran should suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing activities that could be used to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon while we discussed mutually acceptable long-term arrangements. The IAEA board adopted successive resolutions asking Iran to suspend those activities. In November 2004, Iran finally agreed to move ahead on that basis. The Paris agreement set out the framework for talks and offered the prospect of not just a long-term solution to the nuclear issue, but a stronger relationship between Europe and Iran, including co-operation on political and security issues and in economic and scientific fields. We have pursued the process in good faith, but Iran has rejected all constructive attempts to find a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/11">Last August, Iran unilaterally restarted uranium conversion at its plant in Isfahan, in violation of the Paris agreement and contrary to IAEA board resolutions. The same month, without serious consideration, it rejected our detailed proposals for long-term arrangements. Those were the most far-reaching ideas for relations between Iran and Europe that have been presented since the 1979 Iranian revolution and they offered the possibility of an improved relationship based on co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/12">The IAEA board confirmed the legal basis for involving the Security Council under articles XII.C and III.B.4 of the IAEA's statute. However, at the request of our partners, we agreed to propose that the board again delay involving the Security Council, to enable more time for diplomacy. In December, European and Iranian officials met to explore whether we could find a basis for resuming talks. We made it clear that it would be essential for Iran not to resume further the suspended activities. With our support, Russia also sought a way forward by proposing that, as part of a final agreement, Iran might have a financial-only stake in an enrichment joint venture based in Russia. Such an agreement would have helped to assure Iran that it could rely on a supply of fuel for its nuclear reactors without acquiring technologies that could be used to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon. The Russians also made it clear that Iran would need to continue suspension of all enrichment-related activities if such ideas were to be discussed further. We were prepared to endorse that idea, as long as no enrichment took place inside Iran. We understand that the Russians presented it in those terms as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/13">Since then, the Iranian position has been contradictory and deliberately confusing. At its request, European political directors agreed to meet one of its negotiators, Javad Vaidi, in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>&mdash;this past Monday&mdash;but Vaidi indicated no room for flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/14">Iran's resumption of uranium enrichment-related activity three weeks ago was a clear rejection of European and Russian efforts to get back to talks. Its actions have shown no respect for IAEA resolutions or for the commitments that it made to us and to Russia. Iran has portrayed its activities as harmless research, but they involve the development of technologies that would enable it to produce fissile material for a nuclear weapon. What Iran claims is a small step is, in fact, fundamental.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/15">Therefore, the backdrop to tomorrow's IAEA board meeting involves not just Iran's 18-year history of concealment, to which several hon. Members referred, and its failure to take steps that would give us confidence about its nuclear intentions, but also its policy towards Israel and Iraq, its attitude towards terrorism and its human rights record. I echo some of the sentiments that have been expressed. We have all been appalled by the comments of President Ahmadinejad, his denial of the holocaust and his calls for the destruction of the state of Israel, which my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, who has not received universal support in this debate, described as sickening, horrific hostility to the Israeli people. In Damascus just 10 days ago, President Ahmadinejad met leaders of Islamic Jihad while its bombs were killing and injuring civilians in Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/16">The consequences of Iran acquiring nuclear weapons are unthinkable. Central Asia and the middle east&mdash;two of the world's most volatile areas&mdash;would be destabilised. Other states might seek to enhance their own capabilities, prompting a regional arms race. The non-proliferation treaty&mdash;the very bedrock of international efforts to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons&mdash;would be badly damaged, as would the goal of creating a zone free of weapons of mass destruction in the middle east, a cause to which we are committed. Iran's latest actions are a challenge to the multilateral non-proliferation system and a rejection of the diplomatic track. We must respond firmly.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/17">On Monday, Foreign Ministers from the UK, France and Germany, together with their counterparts from the United States, Russia and China, agreed that in Vienna tomorrow we should work with the IAEA board, which should</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/18" class="indent">&quot;report to the Security Council its decision on the steps required from Iran, and . . . report to the Security Council all IAEA reports and resolutions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/19">I welcome that decision. There is strong emerging consensus that it is time for the Security Council to become involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/20">Several hon. Members asked whether it had been appropriate to follow the diplomatic track. The efforts have not been in vain, as we are closer to securing genuine international consensus than we have been at any point in the preceding two years. For some of the reasons that have been outlined, it is vital that we secure such agreement. The Iranian regime fears genuine international consensus. What would be more to its advantage is a position from which it would be able to divide and seek to exploit the international community, thereby guaranteeing the continued potential for developing nuclear weapons.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-01a.97.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" speakername="Don Foster" colnum="97"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060201/halltext/60201h02.htm#60201h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.97.1/1">I am delighted to have this opportunity to debate the important issue of the deaths of those called the Balibo Five in East Timor in 1975.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/2">In 2002, East Timor celebrated its official independence as Timor-Leste. This followed two and a half years of United Nations administration and a 24-year illegal occupation by Indonesia, in which, according to a recent report, up to 180,000 people died. Today, I want to concentrate on just five of those deaths: the deaths on <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-16">16 October 1975</phrase> of five journalists, now known as the Balibo Five. They were a New Zealander, two Australians and the two Britons, Brian Peters and Malcolm Rennie.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/3">When Britons die abroad we anticipate our Government doing all they can to help the relatives. We expect the Government to seek as much information as possible and to share it with the relatives. Sadly, in this case, the opposite happened. From 1975 until 1995, there was almost complete inaction. The Government were involved in a disgraceful cover-up. Thirty years on, information is still being withheld from the relatives of Brian Peters and Malcolm Rennie, and from the relatives of the other three journalists. Hence, this debate concerns the release of documents relating to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor in 1975.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/4">With the help of many former and present Members of both Houses, the relatives have sought to prise open the store of documents about events surrounding the deaths of the Balibo Five. Success to date has been limited. This debate is designed to persuade the Government to make more information available, especially in time for the inquest of Brian Peters, due to take place this year in Sydney.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/5">What do we know? Following a civil war from July to September 1975, East Timor was in the control of a left-wing movement, Fretilin. Thousands had died and there remained instability and unrest. Into this situation flew Brian Peters and Malcolm Rennie. They were working for the late Kerry Packer's Channel Nine network and arrived in the East Timorese border town of Balibo on <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-13">13 October 1975</phrase>. There they met the other three journalists who were working for the rival Channel Seven network. Three days later all five were dead. How and why they died is what the relatives want to know.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/6">As we get closer to answering these questions it is increasingly clear that the reluctance of our Government to find out more&mdash;or to reveal more&mdash;about the deaths is because to do so would reveal even more than we now know about Britain's sorry role in Indonesia's war on East Timor. We are finding out more about that sorry role because, under intense pressure, both our Government and the Australian Government have released various documents. A selection of the released British official documents&mdash;compiled by my constituent Hugh Dowson&mdash;now appears on the website of the national security archive of George Washington university.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/7">From those and other documents we now know, for example, that the Australian Government were told in advance by Indonesia that it intended to invade East Timor. A briefing to the Australian Government on <phrase class="date" code="1975-10-13">13 October 1975</phrase> finally gave them the invasion date of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-15">15 October</phrase> and the invasion route, which went through Balibo. It took 25 years before even that information was officially shared with the relatives of the Balibo Five.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/8">While we do not yet know the precise nature of our own Government's understanding of what was about to happen, we know that they knew enough to anticipate an attack. In effect, the British and the Australians gave a green light to Indonesia. Indeed, it was later to be said by our ambassador to Indonesia that the Balibo Five</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/9" class="indent">&quot;were in the war zone of their own choice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/10">When the British selection was published last November, it prompted <i>The Times</i> to run a story with the headline &quot;Government lied to cover up war crimes in 1975 invasion of island&quot;. The Asia editor, Richard Lloyd Parry, began his article in equally stark terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The British government knowingly lied about Indonesian atrocities in East Timor, including the killing of British journalists in 1975, according to newly released diplomatic documents.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/12">I should, however, point out that most of the documents were not newly released. Most were made available in 2002 and just the analysis was new, but that does not alter the starkness of the point made. The article continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/13" class="indent">&quot;In a startling insight into foreign complicity in Indonesia's invasion of the former Portuguese colony, the documents show that Britain used its position as chair of the United Nations Security Council to 'keep the heat out of the Timor business' in the UN.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/14">Despite frequently telling the relatives of the dead men that the full facts of their deaths were unknown, British documents released in recent years indicate a rather different story. The documents show that our ambassador to Indonesia at the time, John Ford&mdash;now Sir John&mdash;sought to persuade the Australians not to press the Indonesian Government for information about the deaths. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/15" class="indent">&quot;We have suggested to the Australians that, since we, in fact, know what happened to the newsmen it is pointless to go on demanding information from the Indonesians which they cannot, or are unwilling to provide.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/16">This is in stark contrast to what relatives and parliamentarians have been told over the years. This was shown, for example, in the answer to a parliamentary question of <phrase class="date" code="1994-03-07">7 March 1994</phrase>, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/17" class="indent">&quot;We pressed the Indonesians for information at the time.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/1994-03-07.20"><i>Official Report</i>, 7 March 1994; Vol. 239, c. 20W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/18">The documents also show that while the full invasion of East Timor by the Indonesians did not begin until <phrase class="date" code="1975-12-07">7 December 1975</phrase>, incursions involving Indonesian troops did begin, as the Australian Government were warned, in October. In a confidential memo dated <phrase class="date" code="1976-03-15">15 March 1976</phrase> to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the ambassador describes how attempts were made to destabilise the Fretilin movement by providing support, training and resources to the anti-Fretilin forces. The memo continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Increasingly, Indonesian troops were used clandestinely to stiffen the Timorese guerrillas or replace them under the anti-Fretilin banner. In one of these actions on 15&ndash;<phrase class="date" code="2006-10-16">16 October</phrase> five journalists from Australia (two of them British by birth) were killed at Balibo near the border when reporting on the fighting from the Fretilin side.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/20">Thus, while the full-scale invasion was to come later, Indonesian troops were in action in East Timor at the time of the deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/21">I would argue, therefore, that the answer to a parliamentary question on <phrase class="date" code="1994-03-14">14 March 1994</phrase>, which claimed that</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/22" class="indent">&quot;The deaths occurred over seven weeks before the Indonesian invasion&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/1994-03-14.473"><i>Official Report</i>, 14 March 1994; Vol. 239, c. 473W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/23">may be technically accurate, but it certainly evades giving a true reflection of what actually happened. This is especially so when we now know that the action, which was codenamed Operasi Flamboyant, involved a mixed force of 3,600 Kopassanda&mdash;Indonesian commandos&mdash;and anti-Fretilin Timorese. We also know that the second report on the deaths, published on <phrase class="date" code="1999-02-16">16 February 1999</phrase> by Australia's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Tom Sherman, said that the attack on Balibo came at the start of a general offensive by Indonesian military forces to annex East Timor.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/24">Given this cavalier approach to the truth both at the time and since, it is no surprise to read that when the Indonesian invasion resumed and the capital, Dili, was seized in December 1975, our ambassador to Indonesia sent a Christmas eve message to the FCO, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Once the Indonesian forces had established themselves in Dili they went on a rampage of looting and killing . . . . if asked to comment on any stories of atrocities I suggest we say that we have no information&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/26">So, the situation is clear. There was a cover-up of the invasion and of the atrocities that took place during it, including the deaths of the Balibo Five. As Richard Lloyd Parry's piece in <i>The Times</i> put it:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/27" class="indent">&quot;In the Cold War atmosphere of 1975, after the US defeat in Vietnam, Indonesia's status as a pro-Western, anti-communist leader was far more important to Britain than justice for tiny and obscure East Timor&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/28">But the relatives want justice and to know what happened. They have been given various accounts of what might have happened, including that the five journalists were killed in crossfire during the civil war or, more recently, that they were accidentally killed during the invasion, or precursor to an invasion, by Indonesia. Indeed, although Indonesia's Government have yet to admit that their troops were involved, Indonesia's special forces have admitted that they killed the newsmen. We even know the names of some of those involved in the attack, including Yunus Yosfiah and Dading Kalbuadi.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/29">However, many believe that this was no accidental killing, but murder to prevent evidence of Indonesia's covert war on East Timor from being broadcast to the outside world. We, and the relatives, still do not know which is the correct version. More needs to be done to help them find out and to find out whether more could have been done to warn the Balibo Five of what was about to happen. However, to be fair, more recently more has been done. In 1998, for example, the then new Indonesian President was asked by our Government to look again at the deaths of the Balibo Five. He agreed to do so, but others more powerful than him blocked that investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/30">Since then, many British and other official documents have been released. Bodies other than our Government have sought to make progress. The UN itself tried to carry out an investigation. The Indonesians refused to co-operate. What that investigation revealed is in the UN police files, a point to which I shall return in a moment. Most recently, East Timor's reception, truth and reconciliation commission has, among many thousands of other issues, considered the deaths of the Balibo Five. Its final report is expected to be made public later this year and may shed further light.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/31">However, this debate was intended to see whether our Government could do more. The Minister and his officials will, by now, have studied in detail the analysis on the national security archive website of documents released by his Department. Will he either now, or in writing in the near future, respond to that analysis? Will he acknowledge that for most of the past 30 years relatives of the deceased, hon. Members representing the interests of the relatives, and both Houses of Parliament have been misled? In a face-to-face meeting with the Minister's immediate predecessor, relatives of British citizens Malcolm Rennie and Brian Peters asked for help in ensuring that the evidence collected by the UN police is not contaminated. The letter of June 2005 from the Minister for Trade, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" name="Ian Pearson">the hon. Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson)</phrase> to those relatives failed to allay their concerns about this urgent matter. Will the Minister now undertake to address those concerns?</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/32">Given the forthcoming inquest in Australia into the death of Brian Peters, will the Minister guarantee to provide full co-operation to the coroner? In particular, will he agree to release the documents referred to in my letter to the Secretary of State of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-15">15 November 2005</phrase>? Once the final report of the reception, truth and reconciliation commission has been published, will the Minister establish high-level discussions with the Indonesian, Australian, New Zealand and East Timorese Governments? The purpose of such discussions would be to identify and put in place the further action needed to provide comprehensive information about the deaths of the Balibo Five and to bring to justice any persons identified as potential wrongdoers.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/33">I acknowledge that back in 1975 the UK Government were extremely anxious to keep what was happening in East Timor out of the news. The memo of <phrase class="date" code="1976-03-15">15 March 1976</phrase> from our ambassador to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office states</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/34" class="indent">&quot;that East Timor was an area in which Britain was no longer directly involved and that Britain's interests indicated a low profile&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/35">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/36" class="indent">&quot;Dr Kissinger did likewise. This policy has so far paid off handsomely. The lack of involvement has largely kept Timor out of the British and US headlines and away from becoming a major public issue&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/37">Our Government, along with others, sought to hush up what was happening in East Timor and even to give political support to Indonesia. In the UN General Assembly vote of <phrase class="date" code="1975-12-12">12 December 1975</phrase>, which</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/38" class="indent">&quot;deplored the Indonesian military intervention in Portuguese Timor&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/39">Britain abstained. We did what had been recommended, which was to</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/40" class="indent">&quot;keep our heads down and avoid siding against the Indonesian government&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/41">Many suggest that the reason for that approach was because Indonesia was a major international arms buyer, but, whatever the reason, our Government have some responsibility for the deaths of thousands of people. They certainly have a responsibility to come clean on all that they know about the deaths of the Balibo Five and to help the relatives find answers and obtain justice.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-01a.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="106"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060201/halltext/60201h03.htm#60201h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.106.1/1">The hon. Gentleman, my neighbour from Kettering, is right that the provision of utilities in slum areas is a major challenge. Access to clean drinking water, one of the targets for the millennium development goals, is essential, particularly for child health. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will refer to that when he winds up.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/2">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that one of the problems that has to be tackled now and in future, as we try to prevent the sprawl of slum areas, is the provision of infrastructure services for people as they move into the cities. He is right to highlight that as a major issue for urbanisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/3">In addition to the Cities Alliance is the African Ministers conference on housing and urban development. That initiative was introduced by NEPAD and UN-Habitat and is due to hold its second meeting in April. The international community has also made commitments, and the MDGs include the goal of improving the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. The Commission for Africa also recognised the scale of the problem and made recommendations on finance for slum upgrading and on water and infrastructure. The significance of the problem was reinforced at last year's world summit, which underlined the fact that the future of slums would influence the achievement of all the MDGs.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/4">However, the international community's actions and commitments so far will not deliver on the goals that it has set. It is perhaps partly the size of the task that is daunting. There is the sheer number of people involved, and it is expected that there will be 1 billion extra slum dwellers. There is also the complexity of the services that are needed. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is the issue of utilities, water supplies and infrastructure. There is also the sheer cost of it all, particularly given the very statist view of housing in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/5">I therefore have three requests to put to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State as regards meeting the needs of the world's slum dwellers and achieving the MDGs. First, the UK Government must give priority to promoting slum dwellers' security of tenure and better urban governance. Without security of tenure, it will be impossible to achieve the rest of our goals. The residents' lack of security is a real barrier to upgrading slums, and slum dwellers can be swept away easily to satisfy a political elite's predilections, to make way for road building or as part of the ethnic cleansing of a capital city. UN-Habitat's excellent study of forced evictions lists a number of such removals, but I shall mention just two. First, there are the clearances in Khartoum, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State saw for himself. Southerners were moved to make way for, I think, for road building&mdash;at least, that was the excuse; in fact, the move was thought to be political because it involved southerners. Secondly, there are the forced removals in Zimbabwe, which I saw on my recent visit there. It caught not only some of the poorest and most vulnerable people, including HIV orphans, their carers and many more, but half of the Zimbabwean UN staff working in Harare, as well as some of the locally engaged staff from the British embassy in Harare.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/6">Secondly, I ask that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State prioritise the development of financial instruments for slum upgrading. If <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> makes a contribution, I am sure that he will talk about infrastructure and utilities, but I specifically ask for priority to be given to the development of financial instruments for slum upgrading, because this country has particular expertise in financial modelling and services. Prioritising financial instruments in that way would also underline the fact that slum upgrading is an economic project. Slum dwellers pay quite high rents. However awful the housing, and however destitute the people in those shacks in Kibera, they all speak of how much rent they pay and how much they owe in rent arrears. Shacks are good investments in the conventional sense, and it is calculated that a landlord in Nairobi will recoup his investment in a shack within nine months, given the rent that he can charge on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/7">Thirdly, I urge my right hon. Friend to support the UN-Habitat proposal for a slum upgrade facility of $250 million a year for five years. Without it, there is little chance of meeting the MDG. The facility would provide a combination of short-term loans for housing schemes for poor people, loan mechanisms for grassroots schemes and funds for technical help in designing and setting up projects for slum upgrading.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/8">Above all, however, what is required, and what the debate is intended to achieve, is a high priority for urbanisation on the international development agenda. The world summit rightly recognised that we cannot achieve the MDG if we simply react to the terrible and growing poverty of the burgeoning number of slum dwellers. The international community also needs to run ahead of the problem and to prevent slum development, not by stopping urbanisation, but by planning for it and providing the governance, infrastructure and financial capacity to cater for the 1 billion more people who will be living in towns and cities. Last year's world summit specifically recognised that.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.1/9">I hope that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will set out his response to the three particular requests that I have made and, above all, that he will make clear the UK Government's commitment to meeting the challenge of the world's 1 billion slum dwellers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-01a.114.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="114"  time="015:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060201/halltext/60201h03.htm#60201h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.114.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing the debate. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> mentioned, it is key that the issue be discussed and absorbed by the Department for International Development. One quality of urbanisation&mdash;and the hon. Member for City of York mentioned this&mdash;is that it is irreversible. That is important now, but will become even more so in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">Urbanisation and the urbanisation of poverty have been described as the second biggest challenge for the developed world, after the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Clearly, the process of urbanisation is one of the most significant changes taking place in developing nations. The world's urban population multiplied tenfold in the 20th century and now stands at about 3 billion. Properly managing that change is one of the key challenges facing the international community today.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/3">Despite its importance, urbanisation is often misunderstood in international politics and we have yet to adapt to some of the challenges it poses. Africa now has a larger urban population than either north America or western Europe&mdash;I found that hard to believe about western Europe&mdash;yet it is often perceived as being overwhelmingly rural. Our aid efforts often seem to focus on farmers and rural challenges when the biggest challenges are perhaps in the more urban cities and townships. All too often donor agencies prioritise investment in rural areas, and it does not reach the majority of the poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/4">It is clear that the locus of poverty has fundamentally shifted away from rural areas to cities and townships. There is no point in denying that that change has occurred. It has happened and is, as the hon. Member for City of York said, irreversible. How best to deal with the urbanisation of poverty is one of our biggest challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/5">Although rapid urban growth is often seen as a problem, it is worth remembering that it is normally the nations with the best economic performances that urbanise most rapidly. Also, there is a proven link between rapid urban change and a marked increase in standards of living. It is an often overlooked fact that some of the world's fastest-growing cities of the past 50 years have among the best standards of living in their respective nations, but that is not the picture that we see in many developing countries. Our own cities grew as our rural population declined, and that is a classic example of the shift from rural to urban. Edinburgh, for example, has grown steadily over decades and centuries while the population in the countryside has reduced dramatically.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/6">Many commentators see the rapid growth of sub-Saharan cities over the past 50 years as a serious problem, if not a full-blown disaster, but that approach over-simplifies the situation. One reason for rapid urbanisation is the achievement of political independence and the end of discriminatory controls over people's lives. In Uganda, urban growth was slower than expected in the early post-independence period because violence and instability crippled the country's economy. However, once stability was restored, the economy expanded and urbanisation was more rapid. More obviously, in post-apartheid South Africa, it is because of the legacy of apartheid that that country remains relatively non-urbanised, although there is a move to urban centres. Much of the explanation for that is the strict control imposed on the African population's right to live in urban areas. Those examples should be a warning against viewing urbanisation as necessarily a bad thing. Often it is the result of positive changes in a society.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/7">Urbanisation brings with it a whole range of problems if it is not managed effectively. Cities and urban centres can and should be hubs of creativity and economic growth, but rapid urbanisation in the developed world has left 1 billion people living in slums and squatter settlements; estimates suggest that that number will double by 2030. Almost no large city has had its initial urban expansion guided by a rational plan, but it is unrealistic to expect that.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/8">In cities in this country and other high-income nations, it is taken for granted that systems of governance exist to facilitate and monitor urban expansion. Planning controls, building standards, sewerage, drainage, schools and hospitals are more or less taken for granted. We all accept that the staff of urban governments should be answerable to elected representatives, but it is important to remember that the well worn paths of local governance are a relatively recent occurrence that we cannot take for granted. They simply do not exist in many cities and urban centres around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/9">In many poor and developing countries, city governments are corrupt and unrepresentative with the result that decisions are afforded little legitimacy by the local population. The accountability of local authorities to their citizens is a fundamental tenet of good governance, but the widespread prevalence of patron-client relationships has further undermined and corrupted democracy and accountability. Corruption takes resources from those least able to afford the loss, and they work their way through to the richer. It undermines credibility and deepens urban poverty. As a result, investment in the basic infrastructure lags far behind what is desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/10">As I mentioned last Thursday in the debate on international development, the Select Committee on International Development visited a clinic in Nairobi where, for want of the local authority connecting the water and electricity supplies for eight years, the doctors and nurses in that clinic had to remain in an outdated building. It is vital that the local authorities in such cities play their part. It is common for half or more of the population of cities in the developing world to be without access to water taps in their homes or yards, and for more than three quarters to have inadequate provision for sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/11">When the hon. Member for Northampton, North mentioned flying toilets, I was reminded of my visit to Kibera, the slum on the outskirts of Nairobi. I come from a city &mdash;Edinburgh&mdash;with a history of such things; in days gone by, people emptied sewage out of the high storeys of buildings with a cry of &quot;gardez l'eau&quot;. It is a disgrace that in today's world the waste from toilets is still flying through the air. In that same slum, we also visited a shack, and were amazed by the quality of life. The children were immaculately turned out to go to school. With so few basic facilities&mdash;no water supply, no sewerage&mdash;families were able to pick themselves up and did the best that they could.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/12">Sadly, that was by no means an isolated example. Most cities in Africa have sewerage connections for less than 10 per cent. of their populations, and many have no sewerage system at all. The harsh reality is that hundreds of millions of urban dwellers in Africa, Asia and Latin America have to rely on water sources that are unsafe, unreliable and difficult or impossible to access. As a result, it is common for one in every four children in poorly managed cities to die before their fifth birthdays. Many of those deaths can be directly attributed to chronic lack of infrastructure and services. In this country, we do not question the fact that our bins are emptied and, in some cases, our material for recycling is collected; street lamps line our roads; and our water runs hot and is clean enough to drink. We have become so used to the web of institutions that provide these services that we sometimes forget their fundamental importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/13">We have all seen satellite images of the world at night, showing a stunning map of brilliantly lit cities. Only across Africa do many cities remain dark at night. In the absence of appropriate or effective governance structures, too few planning controls are in place. Those that exist are often bypassed as a result of corruption, or for other reasons. As a consequence of ineffective land use planning, cities expand chaotically, causing problems along the way. Many cities have no city-wide plan because the built-up area falls into different local jurisdictions and no governance structure exists to enable co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/14">The hon. Member for City of York mentioned the high rate of return on shacks in city slums. In New Delhi, there are massive slums&mdash;some officially recognised and some not&mdash;and what struck me was the fact that the return on a fast-food restaurant in one of the wealthiest parts of London is only one third of the return that a slum landlord can achieve in such a city. That is an outrage, and unless it changes, people will, for economic reasons, drive on with the continuation of slum dwellings.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.1/1">That is a valid point; clearly there area money and businesses in the slums and there are dynamic entrepreneurs. If that money could circulate in the same area, there could be a vast improvement. Without a doubt, those who receive those high rents do not live in the slums. Money is pouring out of the pockets of slum dwellers into the pockets of those living Californian lifestyles just around the corner.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/2">As many of the people in the room have seen first hand, many walled residential developments that are protected by security firms are only two blocks down the road from squatter communities. Such communities are sometimes unrecognised by the Government and lack the most basic infrastructure and services. Indeed, it is now common in some parts of the world for between a quarter and a half of a city's population to live in a squatter settlement without official approval or recognition.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/3">Such stories paint a bleak picture, and other hon. Members have pointed to the immense problems that we face. The scale of the challenge is indeed daunting: cities have become places to fear, where crime and disease are rife. Nairobi was mentioned earlier and it is sometimes called &quot;Nairobbery&quot;. Even on the recent Select Committee visit, a colleague was unfortunate enough to be robbed and mugged.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/4">However, the situation might not be all doom and gloom. There is no automatic link between rapid urban growth and urban problems. In his impressive body of work on the issue, David Satterthwaite of the International Institute for Environment and Development says that cities provide many potential advantages when it comes to tackling the problems that hon. Members have mentioned. The goals of ensuring universal provision of infrastructure and services, keeping down waste levels and de-linking a high quality of life from high levels of resource consumption are all more achievable in an urban setting. Far from being a cause of the current problems, cities can provide part of the long-term solution if they are governed in the right way. It is often easier to provide water supplies, drains, schools and health facilities to a static population of reasonable size in an urban area than to a smaller, mobile, rural population.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/5">There are many examples of expanding cities in low-income countries that have managed to avoid many of the problems about which we have heard. Curbita and Porto Allegre in Brazil, for example, have grown rapidly in recent years, but they have a high quality of living and innovative environmental policies. One reason for that is the improvement in local government planning, which involves all groups in the city. Many cities in poorer countries have created local Agenda 21s in response to the guidelines in Agenda 21&mdash;the action plan on sustainable development that most world Governments endorsed at the UN Earth summit in 1992. Unlike conventional city plans developed by consultants or town planning officers, these local plans involve all groups in the city in an attempt to gain a consensus on the priorities that need to be addressed. They have helped many cities to develop viable long-term planning that involves all key stakeholders and responds better to local needs and problems. That is community politics at its best.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/6">The other most obvious development that is needed to address the problems facing many urban centres is sustained investment in infrastructure and services in the poorest areas. Poverty, corruption and other social problems often mean that a major backlog of investment must be met before any real improvements can be seen. That is already happening in many cities, where major upgrading programmes have been set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/7">Obviously, it is impossible to generalise about what is needed in different cities in different countries, but the importance of good governance is a constant thread running through these issues. Investment and the adoption of local agendas have often been effectively supported via stronger and more accountable local democracy. For example, the introduction of city mayors and councillors has helped many city governments to be more accountable and more responsible to their citizens. When cities and smaller local authorities have power devolved to them and are empowered with sufficient resources and autonomy, they are more likely to meet their responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/8">I want to give the Secretary of State ample time to comment, so I shall keep my concluding remarks brief. Obviously, the spectre of global poverty will hang heavy over any such discussion; indeed, the sheer scale of the problem makes it hard to see a solution. However, far from being a cause of poverty, urbanisation is one potential vehicle out of it. Rather than fretting about the pace of urbanisation, it is far better that we try to ensure that cities have effective, democratic local governments to allow them to meet the challenges that urbanisation poses. The problem is not the reality of urbanisation, but the lack of many basics of life, including infrastructure. As has been mentioned, to deal with the ill effects there must be sustained investment in water supplies, sewerage services, hospitals and schools. That will require a vast increase in investment, better planning controls, more decentralisation of power and responsibility, and increased efforts to tackle corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/9">The problem of poverty in developing countries will not be solved overnight. However, urbanisation, if properly managed, may give us one tool to provide real improvements in the medium and long term. I look forward to hearing the views of the Secretary of State and his Department on this issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-01a.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" speakername="Andrew Mitchell" colnum="118"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060201/halltext/60201h03.htm#60201h03_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.118.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the hon. Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on securing a debate that she described as historic; it has been enormously interesting and at times illuminating. At the beginning of her speech, she set out the issues that she wanted to cover today, and she has set the scene extremely well.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/2">In a speech that showed great expertise on this issue and a profound understanding of the history of his city, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> made many interesting points to which the Secretary of State will no doubt want to respond. I want to echo three of the hon. Gentleman's points. First, we should never underestimate the effect of conflict in enshrining poverty in the areas affected by this issue. It goes without saying that if people are being forcibly dispossessed or shot at, no amount of aid or trade will lift them out of poverty. Last week I returned from a visit to Rwanda, and I am particularly conscious that in the past neither international institutions nor Governments recognised adequately the importance of conflict prevention, which must be at the centre of the work of DFID, as I know it is under this Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/3">The second point made by the hon. Member for City of York was about the consultation process on the White Paper published last week. I want to echo his comments on the importance of that process, which ranges widely across the many interesting aspects of this subject. I strongly agree with his third point, which was about good governance in areas of the world where Britain is focusing its aid efforts. He will acknowledge that many of the foundations of the Government's current policies on good governance were laid by Chris Patten when he occupied a ministerial position, and indeed by Lynda Chalker. The good governance provisions that inform our policies in this area are immensely important for achieving the outcomes that we so fervently desire.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/4">One thing that strikes me about this debate and indeed the whole subject&mdash;this follows on from what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said&mdash;is the extent to which all the political parties have pretty much converged on the same territory. We all agree on the importance of different policy aspects. There is very little between the aspirations of the two major political parties of this country. There are certainly issues on which the Opposition think that the Government can do more and issues on the international agenda on which we are as restless as the Government about the speed of progress. However, on many international development issues, there is no longer a Labour, Conservative or Liberal Democrat agenda&mdash;there is a British one. The Government derive great strength from that in pursuing important tasks in international forums as well as in their bilateral involvement in poor countries around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/5">The secret minutes of an internal Labour party meeting happened to land on my desk, and they say that the Secretary of State suggested that the Conservatives were hanging on the coat-tails of the Labour Government on some of these issues, although I am sure that the comment was not delivered in quite as churlish a way as I represent it. In a number of important international development areas, the unity between Front Benchers and unity of purpose across the House of Commons are a great strength.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/6">On the interesting comments made by the hon. Member for Northampton, North, the developing world is an increasingly urban world, as she said. In coming years, the rural population of developing countries is projected to remain stable at about 3 billion, but the urban populations are expected to expand from some 2 billion today to about 4 billion by 2025. How does that affect development? Urbanisation in itself is no bad thing. Indeed, it offers a number of advantages, as higher population densities make it possible to provide a range of services such as education, infrastructure and health services in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/7">Cities are often vibrant centres of innovation, culture and politics, but in too many places across the developing world the opportunities afforded by urbanisation are not being realised. Many national and local governments fail to provide the essential services that poor people need, leading to urban squalor and decay, weak economic growth and high unemployment. That foments discontent and radicalism, particularly among urban youth. As the hon. Member for City of York set out, the most vivid manifestation of the downside of urbanisation is the massive slums in many cities in the developing world. Anyone who has travelled in a major city in the developing world will be familiar with the crowded and unsanitary conditions in which millions of people are forced to live. The worst thing about those slums is often the dramatic lack of basic services, such as in health and education. For me, the journey from the airport in Mumbai to the centre of that great city is a strong example.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/8">Any response to the challenge of urbanisation must have at its heart measures to tackle infectious diseases, particularly HIV/AIDS; in general, infectious diseases spread more rapidly in urban areas. Providing clean water and sanitation is one of the most efficient and cost-effective ways of saving lives and reducing mortality, particularly infant mortality.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/9">Around the world, 1.1 billion people lack access to clean water. Many of them live in towns and cities, and in many cases, the urban poor actually pay more per unit for water than the urban rich. What is to be done? The primary responsibility, as ever, lies with Governments in developing countries, but there are things that Britain can do: we can use our money and influence to support the extension of access to Government water services, and we can champion innovative approaches that harness the dynamism and capital of the private sector to expand access to water in urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/10">DFID has sometimes been criticised for failing to reflect the importance of clean water and sanitation in its spending priorities. Will the Secretary of State explain what plans he has to increase the proportion of aid that DFID spends on this vital sector? In an interesting speech in February 2004, he posed an important question:</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/11" class="indent">&quot;If relatively few developing countries see water and sanitation as a priority for inclusion in their Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, what then? Our commitment to the MDGs&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/12">the millennium development goals&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/13" class="indent">&quot;and to country ownership point in two different directions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/14">It would be interesting to hear how he plans to handle that tension in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/15">We should consider carefully how the private sector can help in delivering essential services such as water. It may well be damaging to keep water supply as a monopoly of the state in countries where the state is manifestly failing to deliver adequate services to its citizens. If there is proper supervision, regulatory bodies and contract enforcement, well-managed privatisation has the potential to help expand access to clean water and to save lives. I should be grateful to hear the Secretary of State's assessment of the merits of greater private sector participation in service delivery in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/16">An important way to empower the urban poor is to strengthen and formalise property rights. The poorest suffer most when property rights are weak. Weak legal systems combined with dysfunctional political arrangements offer the urban poor no protection from arbitrary state force.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.0/17">The worst example, to which the hon. Member for City of York alluded, comes from Zimbabwe, where Robert Mugabe's latest repression has destroyed the homes of between 200,000 and 1 million people under the pretext of slum clearance. The campaign is called &quot;Operation Clean Up Filth&quot; or &quot;Operation Drive Out Rubbish&quot;. Children have been killed as houses were demolished around them. Some people have been forced to burn down their own homes. Weak property rights are also damaging in less dramatic ways.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-01a.121.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" speakername="Hilary Benn" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for International Development"  colnum="121"  time="015:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060201/halltext/60201h03.htm#60201h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.121.2/1">I join hon. Members in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase> on having done us all a great service by securing this debate. She has a keen interest in urban matters, which dates back many years. It was evident during her time as a Minister in DFID and I am glad that it continues today. Her interest is shown not least in her having secured what we now learn, having come through those doors, is an historic debate on poverty and urban development.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/2">May I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> that I welcome the fact that there is apparently now quite a large degree of consensus? Had the Conservative party any coat-tails that the rest of us could have hung on to as far as development policy was concerned, we would perhaps have been pleased to do so. Since he provokes me just mildly, I must say that I enormously welcome the fact that the party that managed to cut our development spending as a percentage of our national wealth in half in 18 years has come to recognise that that was a fundamental mistake.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/3">I unreservedly welcome the fact that we are now able to debate the challenge of development in the spirit that we do. It demonstrates how development politics has moved from the margins, where it was in some people's minds, to bang in the centre of the big political questions of our age, because it is about the future of our planet. If we do not sort these problems out, we are all in big trouble, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/4">The movement of people to cities is as old as humankind. We have all agreed, during the debate, that that is an irreversible process and it is no good wishing that it could be different, because human beings will do as they will. The debate has brought out clearly the variety of reasons that lead people to move, including to find employment and flee conflict, as the hon. Gentleman said.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/5">Cities such as Kathmandu, Addis Ababa and Luanda have grown for many reasons. People have moved there because they might be marginally safer when the countries were going through conflict. Women have fled domestic violence. People have tried to escape the stigma and poverty of their caste. People have always come to cities to acquire a new identity. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> talked about people not having enough food to eat.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/6">In the past 20 years, the number of people living in Mumbai has grown by 100 per cent., but the number of squatters has increased by more than 1,000 per cent. That illustrates the scale of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/7">In our country during the 1970s, we thought that there was a bias towards urban areas and that we needed to concentrate on reducing poverty in rural areas, but we now recognise that we need to consider the problem in a much more rounded way. Indeed, there is a lively debate to be had about where urban areas stop and rural areas begin, particularly as technology makes it possible, in some countries, for people to live and work in ways that were not possible in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/8">I want briefly to deal with four issues: how to understand better what is happening and what we are grappling with, economic growth, governance, especially local government, and finance. We have heard some of the statistics mentioned forcefully. The truth is that most&mdash;almost all&mdash;of the population growth in developing countries in the next generation will be in towns and cities. The total urban population in Africa, Asia and Latin America will double to 4 billion by 2035. Africa is the fastest-urbanising continent in the world. Nearly 40 per cent. of Africans currently live in cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/9">It is particularly striking that in 1960 Johannesburg was the only city in sub-Saharan Africa with a population of more than 1 million, but by 2010 there will be 33 cities in Africa with populations of over 1 million. That tells us all we need to know about the pace of change. One of our tasks is to understand better what is happening and to monitor the trends, because good information is vital if the Governments of developing countries are to make decent decisions about that fundamental change.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/10">Target 11 of the MDGs requires us to make a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers by 2020. Some countries are making progress and others are off-track and we need to understand why. Having reliable data on slums&mdash;the face of urban poverty&mdash;is vital. That is why we are working in partnership with UN-Habitat. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to Anna Tibaijuka and UN-Habitat for the work that they are doing and for flying the flag of this debate. UN-Habitat is responsible, as well as the World Bank, for global monitoring to ensure that we get decent data that will assist us.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/11">A number of hon. Members have said that cities are the powerhouses of economies. Urbanisation has been central to the sustained economic growth in Asia that has enabled a number of countries in that part of the world to lift many of their citizens out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/12">Shanghai has just over 1 per cent. of China's population and contributes 12.5 per cent. of its GDP. I went for the first time last year and spent most of the time with my jaw on the floor. It is an astonishing place. To see the pace of change that is occurring there tells us just how important that city's contribution is to China's economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/13">That is happening not only in Asia. Nairobi comprises 12 per cent. of the population of Kenya. It contributes 30 per cent. of the GDP. That tells us in part about the great wave of migration within countries. We talk much about migration between countries, but that is dwarfed by the movement within countries as people leave the places where they have lived for towns to seek work and a better life. As the debate has demonstrated clearly, such growth comes at a price. Very poor people crowd into spaces that no one else will take. They are around open sewers, perched on the side of embankments along railway lines and live in the intense squalor to which my hon. Friend the Member for City of York referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/14">Land is the central issue. The poor rarely have tenure on the land that they occupy. It is not always clear who owns the land. We have heard about landlords who make a healthy return on renting their land, but what if there is no clarity about who holds the land? If people are unsure about their future on the land, there is less incentive to invest in improvements. Slum dwellers often have no right to services. In Dhaka in Bangladesh, it is formal policy not to provide them with services. Slum dwelling brings stresses and strains. Mental ill health is a problem. Crime is another problem. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest proportion of urban population living in slums.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/15">There is spectacular wealth living alongside intense poverty, and that can bring violence. Indeed, the Commission for Africa said:</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/16" class="indent">&quot;Africa's cities are becoming the powder-keg of political instability and discontent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/17">We ignore that at our peril. I could not agree more with my hon. Friend the Member for City of York when he talked about crime and ensuring that people are not abandoned because they are poor. Security is indeed the precondition for progress while communities try to deal with the enormous problems that such areas face.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/18">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the Member for Northampton, North and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said, slum dwellings are also places of inspiring resourcefulness. People make a living. They manage to turn their children out in the way that has been described, despite the shacks in which they live. It is possible to make changes. On my recent visit to Bangladesh, I saw a project that we had helped to fund. For about 25 years, a group of people had been living on the embankment going down to the river and by which the sewage was flowing not very fast. That project has provided clean water and sanitation facilities for members of the community, which played an important part in making that happen. According to their ability to pay, people contribute towards the cost. They keep a list and the community decides who can afford to pay what. The project was a striking example of what can be done. I asked the women, because it was they who led the work, about the impact on diarrhoeal diseases. Drinking dirty water gives children diarrhoeal diseases, which is why 6,000 children die in the developing world each day. They do not have clean water to drink. The women said that they had noticed a reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/19">That is an illustration of what can be done to change people's lives for the better. However, above all, jobs are needed. Barriers that prevent people from migrating to towns to work must be removed. People must have the opportunity to set up their own businesses, which goes back to the title to land and property rights, a topic to which I shall return. It is necessary for people to be able to move around the town. Much of the economic life of cities depends on the contribution that is made by the people who live in the slums. They might be working in domestic service or contributing to the manufacture of goods that are exported.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/20">As several hon. Members have said, the process reminds us of what we have been through. It is exactly what happened to us at the start of the 19th century. The conditions were just as appalling. Let us draw on some of those lessons and the social reformers who reported on the condition of human kind, and motivated change through the political process in the 19th century, such as the great pioneer of health, John Snow, who finally proved that cholera was associated with dirty water by taking off the handle from the famous pump in Broad street. There were pioneers in local government who got together to decide what to do about the conditions&mdash;the problem included, of course, the great stink outside, which encouraged Parliament to take a greater interest. Joseph Bazalgette was responsible for building the sewers and the water supply system that probably did more than anything else in this country to increase life expectancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/21">That brings me to my next point, which is about Governments. Many countries are thinking more about how to devolve power to local level. We should welcome that unreservedly. The truth is that people know best what they need locally. What is striking about the issue of water&mdash;and I want directly to deal with the point that the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield made&mdash;is how often, in many conversations that I have had in towns, villages and urban areas in developing countries, clean water has emerged as people's priority for improving their lives. Yet that priority does not seem, in many developing countries, to be reflected when national priorities are set.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/22">That is why, in my speech on world water day, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, I committed us to double our spending on water in Africa. I shall be reflecting on how things have gone&mdash;we have been working in slightly different ways in the past year in implementing that commitment&mdash;in a speech that I shall give later this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/23">The private sector has a contribution to make. My view on that score is fairly simple. I am profoundly uninterested in an ideological debate about whether the approach should be this or that. I am interested&mdash;and so I think are all hon. Members&mdash;in what will work to bring more clean water to the largest number of people. When developing countries and their communities have worked out how to do that, let us have more of it, and faster. That is the task that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/24">Property rights are extremely important, but acquiring rights is the first stage. People have to be able to exercise them. I recollect from my first visit to Bangladesh that the landless poor there had rights&mdash;but when they tried to exercise them, the police used to come and beat them over the head. It was only through wonderful civil society organisations and their work to help them, which we funded, that those poor people were able to exercise the rights that the law accorded to them. However, the hon. Gentleman makes an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/25">Power without money at local level will not do any good. There is a lack of capacity, and building capacity is fundamental to progress. I pay tribute to all the people in local government in the United Kingdom, and in particular the UK Local Government Alliance for International Development, who are working to build links. My hon. Friend the Member for Northampton, North referred to some of those. I recollect that in one case&mdash;that of Daventry and Iganga town&mdash;the link came about through environmental health officers. There was a rubbish problem, and progress was made in dealing with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.2/26">Those two towns learned from each other. We make a big mistake if we think that we have all the answers. We do not. In Dhaka in Bangladesh plastic bags have been banned, and the cacophony of two-stroke noise that assaulted me the first time I went was missing on my return in November because all the three-wheelers have been converted to using liquefied natural gas.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.4/1">Uses of RAF Stafford have until now included a number of the air combat service support units&mdash;everything from motorised transport to catering&mdash;defence storage and distribution, tactical supply wing, engineering wing, mountain rescue, Ministry of Defence police and fire contingents, and cadet training, including Army cadet training since the Territorial Army centre in Stafford was sold under the strategic defence review. Recently, another Government Department, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has announced that it will locate a new decontamination service serving the whole of the UK at RAF Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/2">RAF Stafford enjoys the full support of its local community. The base has existed for 60 years. In 2004, the community celebrated the 50th anniversary of having granted RAF Stafford the freedom of the borough. If RAF Stafford was unpopular locally, my constituents would not be so worried about losing some or all of the base's activities. In fact, it is very popular. In 2004, I started a petition to allow residents to express their support for RAF Stafford, and 5,000 people signed in three weeks. I presented that petition to Parliament. In time for this debate, I have another petition that I hope to give to the Minister. It was collected by local trade unionists. They simply stood in the market square in Stafford on three Saturdays in January, and they tell me that more than 2,000 local residents signed their petition in support of keeping the storage and distribution centre at RAF Stafford open.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/3">RAF Stafford also takes a full part in civic occasions. That includes Remembrance day parades and battle of Britain civic services, which are always well supported by civil society as well as the military community. As many of the jobs at RAF Stafford are civilian, many local people work there. Many of the uniformed personnel also own houses locally, and when they retire from RAF Stafford, many of them settle locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/4">The MOD continually reviews the way that services are configured, rightly seeking to ensure that we retain the best operational capability and value for money. However, I say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that the complete closure of the Stafford base would cause disastrous damage to our local economy. In round figures, about 900 civil servants work at RAF Stafford, along with 500 uniformed personnel engaged in logistic support&mdash;although they soon leave us&mdash;and 250 more uniformed personnel in tactical supply wing. It is not, of course, a main operating base; it does not have a runway.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/5">I do not want to dwell for long on the decision to move the air combat service support unit's logistics military personnel&mdash;there are about 450 of them&mdash;from Stafford to Wittering. That decision will be put into effect in March. As the Minister knows, he took that decision against my wishes, but I can at least say that there is a strategic rationale for moving the support units closer to the front-line forces that they would be expected to deploy with in the event of future rapid deployments. It also assists in training for operations between deployments if they are located near to each other. However, when the decision to move them was taken, there were forecasts of large financial savings, but I think that he could now confirm that those savings have not materialised. Perhaps that provides a salutary lesson for the Minister, as he has similarly been told that the Army's plans now for the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency will save money.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/6">The tri-service working is now very apparent at RAF Stafford in respect of storage and distribution. Whenever I visit, I see air, Army and naval stores and equipment there. It was very different before 1997, when there were separate stores and distribution arrangements for each service. As the RAF rationalised its storage and distribution arrangements, RAF Stafford eventually became the only remaining RAF base for those activities. You know very well about that, Mr. Martlew, because when the RAF had got down to the last two possible bases, one was Stafford and one was in your constituency at Carlisle. Stafford became the last one. Then along came tri-service working, and rationalisation has now started again. Today, the storage and distribution services at RAF Stafford form part of the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency, which in turn is part of the Defence Logistics Organisation. Stafford is run jointly with similar activities at the Army base MOD Donnington. All the storage and distribution workers at Stafford are civil servants.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-21">21 July 2005</phrase>, the Ministry of Defence announced its decision to close the operations at Stafford by December 2007, so ending the last RAF-specific contribution to the agency. The centre for such operations in future will be the Army base at Bicester. My local churches forum described this as an unfortunate decision. I found it curious, given that Stafford carries out 80 per cent. of the current operations of the agency, has achieved the best efficiency performance in the agency and has the only high-activity storage and distribution centre in the whole of the agency. Indeed, the business plan for taking most of the work to Bicester involves building a brand-new high-activity centre to replace the existing efficient one at Stafford, which presumably will stand empty after the transfer has taken place. There are echoes of the duff advice that the Minister was given over the savings to be had by a move of the air combat services support units to Wittering.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/8">I am pleased that the review of DSDA as a whole resulted in a decision to keep the storage and distribution operations in-house and to grant enhanced agency status. However, as a consequence of the decision on job losses at Stafford and, in reality, because of several other decisions involving civilian MOD job losses around the country in recent months, the trade unions are campaigning for a change of direction. In the case of RAF Stafford specifically, they are asking for a review of the decision to end storage and distribution operations at Stafford, and are presenting a case for continuing to make productive use of the high-activity storage and distribution centre, which is supported by an engineering enclave.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/9">On the proposal to retain the high-activity centre, I simply point out that the midlands is an acknowledged leader in logistics in the United Kingdom&mdash;understandably, given its location in the centre of the country. As the Minister saw when he visited RAF Stafford&mdash;it really was as long ago as September 2004, although it seems like yesterday&mdash;equipment comes into Stafford from all over the country all the time, and goes out to other MOD locations all over the UK on a daily basis. When I visit the Argos and Exel logistics operation at Acton Gate in my constituency, which is a comparable operation in the private sector, I am reassured that the midlands offers the same high standards in logistics in both the public and the private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/10">On the future for some 300 engineering workers at RAF Stafford, the Minister may know that twice in two years announcements have been made that have left them completely in the dark about their future. It would be a positive end to a worrying roller-coaster ride if they could be reassured about their future and, more generally, about the situation at RAF Stafford. One employee asked me to remind the powers that be, as he calls them, how loyal and supportive employees at Stafford have been to their colleagues in the MOD and Her Majesty's Government. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/11" class="indent">&quot;Operation TELIC saw us not only meet all our operational requirements but also take on board several efficiency initiatives which were undertaken willingly and with great success&mdash;we proved ourselves to be the best and still are and we are very proud to be so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/12">That reminder about Operation Telic caused me to review the National Audit Office report for Operation Telic. I am sure that the Minister will confirm the finding that the well-publicised supplies shortages that arose at that time related only to in-theatre operations. In fact, the NAO report on page 17 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/13" class="indent">&quot;Operation TELIC required a massive logistic effort to be made by personnel and organisations from across the Department and the three Services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/14">On page 3 it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/15" class="indent">&quot;The logistic effort for the Operation was huge and key to success.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/16">The result was that twice the material was delivered to the theatre of operations in half the time, as compared with the previous 1990&ndash;91 Gulf war. When I visited during the period of maximum effort, I met workers who were turning in to work seven days a week to make the operation a success.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/17">Local people have responded as constructively as they can to the announcements by the Ministry of Defence, especially the one about ending storage and distribution operations at Stafford. I recently joined other concerned interests in Stafford such as the local councils and the regional development agency, Advantage West Midlands, to form a taskforce to co-ordinate the local response. It is not a matter of my asking the Minister what he can do to help us. We are doing what we can to help ourselves locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/18">The Minister knows about that because he kindly met a delegation from the taskforce that I brought to see him on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-08">8 September 2005</phrase> and I was grateful for his co-operative responses. One of his decisions as a result of that meeting was to allow access to the civilian work force of Stafford by Jobcentre Plus and that has been helpful. It is proving extremely useful in building up support for those who will lose their jobs by way of training, advice and help with searching for jobs. The Minister also agreed that a representative of Defence Estates could support the taskforce and we have since met representatives of the Ministry of Defence as a result of that decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/19">The Minister knows that we have a loyal and long-serving work force at RAF Stafford. Many of those who will lose their jobs have worked there for a long time and are over 50. They are learning that they will be disadvantaged in the redundancy package allowed to them because they are over 50.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/20">I note from my correspondence with the Minister that the rules of the scheme are clear, but is there no help that could be given to workers aged over 50 who are facing sizeable financial losses? There is also a rule that help with retraining is not available more than three months ahead of redundancy. It would be helpful if the Minister could override that rule and say that workers at RAF Stafford who are threatened with the loss of their jobs next year could have help with retraining this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/21">The other uniformed personnel remaining at RAF Stafford are the tactical supply wing, which is a vital part of every dangerous mission, as I have explained. They are virtually first to the front line and supply the fuel that keeps helicopters flying. They have had a base in Northern Ireland for more than 30 years. The head of that service is Joint Helicopter Command. They will stay at RAF Stafford for the foreseeable future, but it would be helpful if the Minister could tell me something about their presence in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/22">The question obviously arises as to whether there is a future for a military base at Stafford after these announcements. To be clear, Stafford people support our armed forces and want a presence in the county town. They support me strongly in seeking to persuade the Minister to agree to build up RAF Stafford with alternative military uses if current uses have to change. They also want continued opportunities for civilian jobs at the base.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/23">Opportunities are coming up to enable Stafford to be used for alternative military purposes. The Defence Medical Education and Training Service has been successfully built up again after the terrible hollowing out that occurred before 1997. There is a new hospital development at Birmingham, Selly Oak. I know that the service has been looking outside Birmingham but within its proximity for less costly accommodation for its headquarters and non-hospital activities. Stafford has been considered as one of a number of locations that might be suitable and I have been told that as many as 1,000 jobs are involved. I have provided the Ministry of Defence and the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency with a portfolio of evidence of the excellent clinical networks that are available at Stafford. There is a university on the doorstep with a school of health providing nursing training. There is an acute hospital trust that is willing to share training and laboratory work with the agency's headquarters. There is a mental hospital trust that is willing to form joint protocols on post-traumatic stress disorder investigations. There is a technology park next door to RAF Stafford with medical technology businesses that are at the forefront of development of medical technologies such as Sterilox Technologies International Ltd. Our ambulance service trust in Staffordshire is willing to do joint training with military personnel to assist them when they become civilians and need civilian qualifications later. Truthfully, I believe that the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency would benefit enormously from being plugged into those networks in Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/24">A new 22 Signal Regiment is being formed and the Army would be very welcome at Stafford. I understand that around 700 military personnel will be involved in that regiment. Given the highly technological nature of today's communications systems, there is, again, a glorious fit at Stafford with the neighbouring technology park, where several graduate IT and communications businesses were started. The university has an international reputation for computing sciences and a growing department for media technology studies. In the longer term beyond those opportunities, there is talk of the Army developing garrison town settlements and Stafford might fit well with that development. Its edge-of-town location, good communications with the rest of the country and supportive civilian population make it a good choice, in my book. Local media reported positively on the Gurkhas visit to Stafford. I do not know if the Minister knows anything about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/25">Such emphatically military uses will not provide anywhere near the number of civilian jobs that RAF Stafford supports in its defence, storage and distribution operations. That is why I ask the Minister to look at the trade unions' case for saving some of the storage and distribution, and engineering jobs at Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/26">The taskforce that I helped to set up makes a great case for buying from the Ministry of Defence a portion of the camp's land that immediately adjoins the successful technology park. We believe that we can quickly raise the money to pay the full asking price for that land, and we know that businesses are interested in having premises there for light industrial and further technological uses. Can we therefore not go through a tortuous MOD process that leaves off taking a decision about sales until every other decision has been taken? Businesses are taking their business decisions now, and we need to know whether we can offer them land at that valuable location. It even makes sense that the MOD should have the capital receipt from the sale and plough it back into making the remainder of the site more amenable for the other users who are under consideration so that everyone wins.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/27">I do not usually quote my local daily newspaper, the <i>Express and Star</i>, because it is not usually that supportive, but last week in an editorial it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/28" class="indent">&quot;We must hope that the Government will listen and respond positively to the case being put for the threat to Stafford jobs to be lifted. If the Government is not prepared to give a stay of execution to the civilian jobs it is imperative that alternative military use is found for the base.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/29">That is a fair summary of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/30">The military activities carried out at RAF Stafford are all vital to the efficient and effective operation of the UK's armed forces, and the public of Stafford support the military presence in the county town and want it to continue. The announced losses of military and civilian personnel at RAF Stafford will harm our local economy unless we act decisively in response to the changing situation. We are doing all that we can for ourselves, but we need the MOD's co-operation. Retaining storage distribution and engineering capabilities at Stafford would help Stafford and be in the MOD's best interests. We would welcome the Defence Medical Education and Training Agency to Stafford and the clinical networks there would create two-way benefits for military and NHS clinical staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/31">We would welcome the establishment of a new 22 Signal Regiment at Stafford, and it would fit with our existing specialism in computing, IT and media technologies. An Army base at Stafford would be well received by local people and existing facilities at RAF Stafford could be adapted to meet the Army's needs. Our enterprising taskforce asks the MOD to allow us to buy a portion of land to enable us to provide alternative civilian jobs for those civilians who are due to lose their jobs at RAF Stafford next year. Clearly there is an agenda that we could all sign up to which would mean some success for everybody, but a lot depends on the response from the MOD. Perhaps that can start with the Minister's response to this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank him for providing me with the opportunity to speak on this important issue. I pay tribute to his tireless efforts in support of his constituents' interests at RAF Stafford. Once again, he has set out his case cogently and well.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/2">The changes that have taken place at Stafford and in the wider region are part of a much broader process of change in the MOD. We are determined to modernise and improve the delivery of support services and to make the best use of available resources to ensure that every penny counts for the front line. As part of our response to the Gershon review, the MOD is committed to making 2.5 per cent. efficiencies annually between the financial years 2005&ndash;06 and 2007&ndash;08. That equates to &pound;2.83 billion of efficiencies by April 2008. The savings from those efficiencies will all be reinvested in providing better delivery at the front line of defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/3">As part of the defence change programme, the Department has also committed to reducing the number of civilian posts by more than 11,000 and the number of military posts in administration and support by more than 5,000. Again, the savings will all be reinvested in the front line. If we do not make those savings, the front line will go without.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/4">I am aware of the impact on MOD staff employed in the west midlands of the various recent announcements related to the defence change programme, which covered areas such as training, logistics, repair and maintenance and the supply chain. I am also conscious of the continuing uncertainty about the long-term usage not only of the MOD estate at Stafford but of other sites in the region, and I understand the impact of that uncertainty on the local community. I regret that I am not in a position to remove it today.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/5">As my hon. Friend is aware, a number of separate strands of work are being undertaken in the Department that bear on future employment opportunities in the region. He alluded to them, and I shall comment on them later. Hon. Members may rest assured that when I am in a position to make announcements to the House, I shall do so at the first possible instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/6">Today, the Stafford site has two principal defence users, the RAF and the Defence Storage and Distribution Agency, which is part of the Defence Logistics Organisation. RAF functions at Stafford comprise the 85 expeditionary logistics wing, which provides logistics support to deployed operations, and the tactical supply wing, which supports the joint helicopter fleet and is under the command of the Joint Helicopter Command headquarters. Also, an engineering services function recently transferred from the RAF to DSDA, and the RAF museum reserve collection is situated on one of the outlying sites under lease from the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/7">Two current initiatives will affect future employment at Stafford. The first stems from our announcement in July 2004 concerning the creation of the air combat service support unit logistics hub at Wittering. I appreciate my hon. Friend's recognition of the rationale behind that decision, and I recognise his unhappiness that it went against Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/8">The build-up of the logistics hub at RAF Wittering is proceeding as planned, and includes the relocation of the 85 expeditionary logistics wing from Stafford. That move will result in a reduction of 59 civilian posts and the transfer of about 440 RAF posts. With the transfer of the 85 EL wing, direct RAF interest in the Stafford site will cease. The technical supply wing, which employs 210 RAF personnel, will remain, pending a decision on the future basing requirements of the support helicopter force.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/9">My hon. Friend referred to another part of the process of change, and spoke about the &quot;duff&quot; information that I was given. What happened was this: we were looking at RAF Scampton as a preferred base for the communications hub. When we revisited Scampton for site analysis, we discovered that such a move would have considerable cost implications. We then looked around the rest of the estate, and considered Stafford while doing so. However, because of insufficient domestic accommodation, that move would have been costly to the MOD. As a result, we have announced that RAF Leeming will become the centre. I do not accept that the information was duff. It was the best information at the time, and it was carefully analysed and revisited. If RAF Stafford had come out favourably, of course we would have made that decision accordingly.</p>

	<p pid="a.139.1/1">I hope that my hon. Friend and I have got that message across to the Minister. Given the amount of upset that such a reorganisation causes, it is sufficient if it happens once in a generation; that is better than twice. That is why it is essential that the Government carry the political parties of Northern Ireland along with them, rather than going head-on in defiance of the advice offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">In the context of overall public finance, local government spends a very small percentage of public money in Northern Ireland, yet it has come in for particular attention. So far, the Government have had very little to say about quangos. It will be interesting to hear whether the Government's proposals on them are as radical as their proposals on local government. Over the past 30 years, the lack of democratic accountability of those bodies has been disgraceful. It is absurd that those hand-picked by the Government to sit on one of those bodies should have more power than democratically elected politicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3">In Northern Ireland, over the past three or four decades the route to power and to effecting change has not been to get involved in democratic politics and to run for office; it has been to join a paramilitary organisation or sign up for a quango. One need only look at the list of those who have been on more than one quango to see what an industry it has become. Whatever else the Government do, the issue of democratising quangos must be addressed. Where there continues to be a need for quango-type arrangements, it is important that democratically elected politicians make up a majority of those on the bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">Much has been said about the potential for savings; little, however, has been said about the costs of setting up and operating the new structures. For instance, the five education and library boards will be reduced to one, but a raft of new bodies will be created. Furthermore, the bodies representing the Province's multitude of education providers are to remain, but with little discernible role. Health boards and trusts are coalescing, but a new tier of local commissioning is to be created. What will be the total for the setting-up and running of those seven primary care organisations?</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/5">In light of the Government's eagerness to create efficiencies and save money, one of the most absurd decisions coming from the RPA is that relating to the roads function. I come to this issue as a former Minister for Regional Development, with, I hope, some of the knowledge that that brings. As a Minister, I had the opportunity to meet, and on occasion visit, key individuals on road and transport matters in countries across the world&mdash;from Europe, from the USA and from as far afield as Australia and New Zealand.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/6">The unanimous view expressed to me&mdash;and I heard it from every individual that I talked to about the problems that they faced in relation to roads&mdash;was that we should be counting our blessings that we had a unified road service. Many of the difficulties that others faced arose from the fact that responsibility for roads in their jurisdiction had been splintered. The proposal in the RPA has all the hallmarks of doing something for the sake of doing it. In this debate, there is not the opportunity to discuss those matters at length, but I ask the Government to look into the issue again. I believe that the Government are giving the responsibility to local government just to be seen to be giving it more powers. It is not a sensible basis on which to proceed. Those in local government will not thank the Government for it when, if I can use the pun, they are further down the road. The proposal to give roads functions to local government will not create efficiencies, nor will it deliver a better service. The decision flies in the face of virtually every other recommendation in the RPA.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/7">One matter that the Government have not yet decided in relation to the process is planning appeals in Northern Ireland. One of the proposals during the consultation process was that, with planning matters being returned to local government, the Department would take over the appellate function from the Planning Appeals Commission in a manner that is broadly in line with England. I need not tell the Minister the difficulties that are faced in relation to planning and some of the decisions that are taken, but the one element of the process that attracts the highest level of respect is the Planning Appeals Commission. There is a suspicion that, because it has been too independent and done its job too well over the years, the Government are taking this opportunity to get appeals back to the Department. That is a mistake. Will the Minister take account of the views that were expressed during the consultation by those who have knowledge of that facet of planning?</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/8">Despite the initial announcement on the RPA, I believe that there is still time for the Government to think again about a number of the recommendations coming out of it. It must be clear to the Minister that by working with, rather than against, the political parties in Northern Ireland, it is much more likely that the Government will create arrangements that last another generation, rather than simply until devolution returns. I urge the Government to think again before embarking on a path that will ultimately be reversed, if it is ever fully implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1400" name="Peter Robinson">the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know of his concerns and his interest in the review of public administration. I understand what he said about this being a brief debate&mdash;I am afraid that the reply will be even briefer, given the time available, but I will do my best to do justice to the issues that he has raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/2">Initially, I will make some general comments. The decisions on the outcome of the RPA were announced by the Secretary of State in November. As the hon. Gentleman recognises, the programme of reform is challenging in health, education and, particularly, local government. He is quite right to say that local government is an area of particular controversy. It is worth reminding ourselves why we embark on these changes in the first place. As he quite rightly pointed out, the process was started in June 2002, during devolution, just prior to the Assembly being suspended. It was initiated by the Northern Ireland Executive and it had overwhelming support from the Assembly and its Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/3">All of us regret that, following that, devolution was suspended. It has fallen to direct rule Ministers to take the process forward and I do not think that any of us anticipated that we would be taking it forward to this stage. However, at every stage, the Northern Ireland political parties have been involved in the process, and until the Assembly is up and running that will be continue to be the case. Most of the hon. Members here today have met me on issues relating to education. I recall meetings on the RPA with all political parties, in which views were taken forward and comments on education were listened to and taken into account before final announcements were made.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/4">The devolved Administration, like the current Administration, recognised that Northern Ireland is hugely over-administered. There is unanimous agreement that government needs to be smaller in order to be effective. The review is also intended to ensure that taxpayers' money is not spent on bureaucracy and administration, but is redirected to front-line services for the public in order to get maximum value for money. Our view&mdash;I think that it was the view of the Assembly, as well&mdash;is that public services have to be responsive and accountable to the public, who pay for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/5">During the debate in the Assembly in June 2002, when the terms of reference for the RPA were secured, a colleague of the hon. Gentleman, Councillor Edwin Poots, MLA, made some comments that bear repetition. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/6" class="indent">&quot;as public representatives we serve the public. It is our duty to ensure that the administration exists to serve the public, rather than us . . . The review provides a unique opportunity to do that, and we must ensure that its outcome is a better, more efficient system that saves money on administration and delivers better core services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/7">We would all sign up to that and we are firmly of the view that the decisions announced in November will deliver it.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/8">The decisions announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and other Ministers who have been involved with this are a huge step in improving the development and delivery of public services. To that end, we have been true to the views expressed by the Assembly in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/9">The decisions radically streamline the whole Administration, whether we are talking about health, education, local government or public services. Those savings are not savings made just for the sake of it; they are made in administration to ensure that we have resources for front-line services. The hon. Gentleman said that it is important that we get it right, and I entirely endorse those comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/10">The review process has been highly transparent throughout, with very participative consultation involving key stakeholders, organisations, elected representatives and the wider public. There were two consultation periods, the latest of which was a six-month period. The review team had more than 80 different consultation engagements and meetings, which covered 300 different groups and approximately 1,000 individuals. There was also an extensive research programme, including academic papers and independent research on a wide range of relevant issues, surveys, focus groups and study visits. All that information is published on the review website.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/11">Ministers did not take decisions in a vacuum; they considered all the evidence presented, including that from all political parties. I challenge the hon. Gentleman: he said &quot;whether&quot; there would be a return to devolution. There will be a return to devolution and those issues will be taken up by local Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/12">The decisions were strongly evidence-based, particularly in relation to the seven-council model. I understand the concerns raised about that, but I am a little concerned sometimes that the debate is about the number of councils. During the meetings I had with the Northern Ireland Local Government Association when I was the Minister responsible for the environment, the question concerned the efficient, effective and economical delivery of local services. We have to consider the functions that we expect local government to deliver, prior to considering the number of councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/13">What are the functions, how can we best deliver those in the interests of public services and what number of councils can best deliver this model? All evidence pointed to the optimum number of councils being seven. No hard evidence presented counteracted that notion when Ministers made the decision. It is clear that councils need to operate on a much larger scale to maximise the benefits. The hon. Gentleman recognised that; I do not think that he was trying to defend a 26-council model. If we are to maximise the benefits by transferring functions to local government, we need to ensure that there are large enough councils to do that. It is not just a question of efficiencies, it is about increasing the role of local councils and councillors and extending their functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.0/14">There was broad support from across Northern Ireland for the seven-council model. Of the 113 responses to the further consultation document that indicated a preference for the number of councils, 62 per cent. supported seven and 18 per cent.&mdash;almost exclusively made up of those in the political establishment&mdash;supported 15.</p>
