<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-22.16.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1307" speakername="Nigel Waterson" colnum="16"  time="010:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/halltext/50222h01.htm#50222h01_spnew10">
	<p pid=".16.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/794" name="David Chidgey">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mr. Chidgey)</phrase> on securing the debate and apologise for missing the first couple of minutes of his speech, owing to the weather.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/2">The subject is important and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1311" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb)</phrase> said, we keep returning to it. The reason is not simply that such tragedies occur fairly regularly, but that there is still massive uncertainty over compensation. I recently had the opportunity to meet some of the APW workers affected, when they came to lobby us. As we know, many of them&mdash;perhaps most&mdash;look to lose some 80 per cent. of their pension rights. Our hearts go out to them, particularly those in the cases that various hon. Members have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/3">It is heartening that this debate has been so well attended, with contributions from hon. Members in all parts of the House, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1067" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, my hon. Friends the Members for New Forest, West (Mr. Swayne) and for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis), <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/851" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham)</phrase>, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" name="John Randall">the hon. Member for Eastleigh. My hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> would have liked to participate, but, as has been said, he has other business in the House.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/4">The FAS has, to put it mildly, a chequered history. In a letter in <i>The Times</i> today, that redoubtable campaigner and former Government adviser Dr. Ros Altmann describes it as being responsible for a &quot;cruel deception&quot;. As time goes on it becomes difficult to disagree with that judgment. In his opening speech setting out the background to the APW issue, the hon. Member for Eastleigh described the real effects on real people in yet another failed scheme of the vagueness&mdash;I think that that was his word&mdash;around the rules for the FAS.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/5">The hon. Member for Northavon may or may not be right in accusing the Government in stalling over the FAS, but the Minister cannot argue that the Government have been quick to set out the eligibility criteria for taking advantage of it. As we know, it had a troubled birth: it was produced in a hurry in May 2004, when the Government were in a tight corner on the legislation. However, one would have thought that, by now, we would have significantly more detail about how the scheme will operate.</p>
	<p pid=".16.0/6">The hon. Member for Northavon talked about the price tag, but that is one issue that we cannot lay at the Minister's door. Although this is a dynamic and ongoing situation, with schemes failing as time goes on, the price tag is, bizarrely, already known. It is the only thing that has been clear from day one, because the Chancellor coughed up &pound;400 million&mdash;not a penny more&mdash;to provide for the financial assistance scheme. That was long before the Government did any research into how many people would be affected, let alone into the ongoing dynamics behind cases such as that of APW.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-22.24.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1031" speakername="Jacqui Lait" colnum="24"  time="010:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/halltext/50222h02.htm#50222h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".24.1/1">I am grateful to the Minister for Pensions for finishing early and look forward to an expanded explanation from the Minister for Housing and Planning, who has responsibility for London. I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss the issue and know that my constituents are grateful that I have the opportunity to raise it on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/2">You may not know much about Beckenham, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I am not sure that the Minister does, although he represents a south London seat&mdash;one needs to take out one's passport to come to Bromley. I will describe my constituency so that he appreciates the pressures that it is under.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/3">Beckenham is part of Bromley borough, the largest borough in London in terms of acres&mdash;or should I say hectares. Bromley's slogan has long been &quot;Green and clean&quot;, and half of it is designated as green belt. Beckenham is primarily suburban, with the area around Crystal Palace more like an inner city. The area developed from villages that were surrounded by large estates into an area of primarily large Victorian and Edwardian suburbs, with large family houses on large plots. Those are typical of late 19th and early 20th century buildings. Some of the gardens were sold off to become smaller family houses in the 1920s, 1930s and 1950s. Many of the mansion houses were turned into flats. Obviously, there was bomb damage in the second world war.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/4">Since the 1960s, there has been further development of those Victorian and Edwardian plots into town houses and blocks of flats, which have met the increasing demand for one or two-bedroomed properties as families have fragmented and our parents have lived longer. Alongside the privately owned houses, there is a lot of social housing that is indistinguishable from the surrounding buildings. There are large areas of substantial four to six-bedroom houses as well as many semi-detached properties.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/5">In recent months, residents have voiced their concern to me, to councillors and to the local papers that the pace of development has speeded up. They feel powerless and without a voice, despite the best efforts of their many vocal residents associations. They believe that their environment is changing irrevocably. They do not like that and feel that neither they nor the council can do anything to stop it. Yesterday I received an e-mail from a constituent who lives in the same road as I do. It reads:</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/6" class="indent">&quot;I am appalled at what is happening to Beckenham with regard to more and more single family homes being torn down and replaced with apartment buildings. The new builds are not providing off-street parking. The volume of traffic has increased, and commuters park in the streets around Beckenham Junction making it miserable for those of us who live in these streets. I enjoy living in Beckenham&mdash;but only just&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/7">That is the authentic cry of despair of a local resident.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/8">Residents also criticise Bromley council for not preventing developments although, in fact, many planning applications are overturned on appeal, so it is not the council's fault. Indeed, Bromley has one of the highest rates of appeal to the planning inspectorate. Bromley council has a historic commitment to provide 8,650 units between 1992 and 2006. Its current agreed housing target, set out in the unitary development plan, is for 11,450 units between 1997 and 2016, with an average annual target of 573 units. It is sad to call houses units, but that is a quick way of describing a wide variety of dwellings. Originally those figures, derived from the London housing capacity study of 2000, were regarded as capacity figures, as opposed to minimum targets.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/9">It would be remiss of me not to make it clear that the borough has a waiting list for social housing&mdash;just in case the Minister gives that as the reason for the imposed minimum targets. In my surgery, second only to immigration cases are appeals to be housed, and I am sure that I am not alone in finding that. Bromley is on target to provide 2,300 houses by 2016, and with the reduction to 15 in the number of units that would need to include social housing, we expect a higher density to be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/10">I am obliged to Stuart McMillan, the chief planner, and Claire Glavin, the planning policy planner, at Bromley council for advising me on the technicalities that I am about to describe. They tell me that the capacity figures have become minimum targets because section 38(2) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 defines the development plan in Greater London as</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the spatial development strategy and the development plan documents (taken as a whole) which have been adopted or approved in relation to that area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/12">Section 38(5) specifies that if a policy contained within a development plan&mdash;including, for example, the London plan and the UDP&mdash;conflicts with another policy in the development plan, the conflict must be resolved in favour of the policy contained in the last document to be adopted. That sounds like an obscure mathematical formula, but I am sure it is not. The London plan is considered to be the last up-to-date adopted plan because the revised deposit UDP is still progressing through to adoption. That appears to be how the capacity figure has become the minimum target.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/13">One of the excuses for changing the capacity figure to a minimum target is that housing completions are falling short of the planning permissions given by the council. That is no consolation to my residents, but it appears to be the basis on which the housing inspector, in her part-report on the UDP dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-25">25 August 2004</phrase>, has insisted that the borough is 1,000 dwellings short in addition to the agreed total of 573 units each year. She has therefore gone back to the bad old ways of predict and provide, rather than taking the Government's preferred approach of plan, monitor and manage. If developers think that they can sell only 76 per cent. of the 573 units, even when they have been given planning permission for 110 per cent. of those units, then the inspector is challenging the market&mdash;not an approach that this Government allegedly espouse.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/14">In a recent application form for a conference on historic suburbs run by the Institute of Historic Building Conservation and supported by the Government's own English Heritage, it was said that suburbs are</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/15" class="indent">&quot;an integral and equal part of great towns and cities and have a crucial role to play in regeneration and development. They can engender fierce loyalties and intense civic pride yet their conservation is often misunderstood or sidelined.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/16">Bromley council well understands the needs and aspirations of its suburbs. Its policy on housing design states that it</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/17" class="indent">&quot;will resist designs which are out of scale or character with the surrounding area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/18">On residential density, it states:</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/19" class="indent">&quot;on sites of 0.4 hectares or more, the council will normally expect schemes not to exceed the existing density of the immediately surrounding area except on sites within town centres and on sites where the immediately surrounding area has no readily identifiable residential character.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/20">Where possible, the council is already giving planning permission using brownfield sites to allow development of higher densities, often against the wishes of local residents who actively prefer the lower densities in which they have opted to live.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/21">In the town centres in my constituency, including Beckenham and Penge, buildings tend to be up to five storeys high, and hence are denser, in compliance with the council's own planning guidance. In the tree-lined residential streets, buildings are not more than four storeys high, or roughly up to the tree line. We have some very pleasant streets and wonderful trees, and the streets often have wide grass verges in addition to pavements.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/22">However, Beckenham faces a new threat from density. Close to Beckenham Junction station, and defined as being in the town centre, the British Railways Board built a seven-storey block of offices back in the 1960s which has lain empty for some 10 years. In the seven years or so that I have represented the constituency, its dereliction has been of more and more concern to residents and council alike. It is now being developed into flats, which is welcome, but the problem is that it is seven storeys high.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/23">As someone who lived on the 39th floor of the Barbican in the City of London for seven years, and within the Barbican in other properties for a total of 10 more years, I cannot be accused of not enjoying high-density living. However, people do not move to the suburbs to enjoy high-density living. They move there because they like to be surrounded by space, enjoy and are proud of their gardens, and appreciate a degree of peace and quiet that is missing from city centres. I can confirm that Beckenham during the week is quieter than the City of London at the weekend.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/24">A major change seems to be on the way because the seven-storey precedent has been set. Already, within 50 m of the block of offices, another seven-storey residential building is under construction. However, it is in a pleasant residential street, where Bromley borough council's own planning guidelines suggest that it should be no more than four storeys high. If I were to be nimbyist about this, I would not admit that it is the street in which I live, but it is. I live within 50 m of that new development, and if my worst fears and those of my constituents are realised, I can well understand and sympathise with neighbours who are unable to resist the siren call of their bank accounts when approached by developers seeking to build yet another seven-storey block. Once the precedent has been set, we have discovered in our borough that it is extraordinarily difficult to resist such developments.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/25">In Shortlands, another area of Beckenham, a developer has assembled a series of back-garden plots where none have been developed before. So far, the council has resisted that development. We hope and pray that it will continue to be resisted, but it is extraordinarily difficult. Developers may go to appeal and be turned down, but they go away, rethink their case and return to have another go. They persist until the precedent is set, and once it is set, we will lose control over the development of a street. I am surrounded by examples of that in Beckenham. When one Edwardian or Victorian house is sold&mdash;I do not blame the people who sell their houses, because it is difficult not to accept a bonus on the value of one's house&mdash;the rest fall like dominoes and the whole area changes.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/26">It is not beyond the wit of any of us to understand that the pressure will soon be on to build more tall buildings in that pleasant residential area which are well over the level of the tree line, despite the council's insistence that in residential streets the height of buildings should be only up to the tree line. Within a few years, the whole complexion of the area could change dramatically. Yes, it will provide higher-density housing, but the character of the surrounding area will have been destroyed. The council's carefully thought-through policies will have turned to dust and the pressure on schools, roads, rail transport&mdash;Bromley is well provided with rail links and I think I hold the title of the MP with the most railway stations in a constituency, with 13&mdash;and health services will be intolerable.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/27">A new senior school has just been built in Bromley to meet the demand for high-quality education in the borough. If the borough has to follow the demands of the inspectorate, the Mayor's London plan and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's figures, the infrastructure is also needed. However, there is no land because of the demands imposed by housing. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/973" name="John Horam">the Member for Orpington (Mr. Horam)</phrase> raised that point with the Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/818" name="Yvette Cooper">the hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, in his Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase>. He pointed out that the Environmental Audit Committee, of which he is a distinguished member and was the first Chairman, has been astounded that no Department has carried out an environmental impact assessment of the house building targets that are being imposed not only in Beckenham and the wider borough of Bromley, but all over the country.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/28">The inspector at the unitary development plan inquiry recommended releasing some sites from the green belt, metropolitan open land, urban open land or employment designations after carrying out a sequential test. As a Scot growing up in Scotland in the 1950s, I witnessed what happens when housing is built without any care for the impact on the environment. I saw Easterhouse being built. Everybody uses it as an example of what happens when house building goes wrong. Houses were built, but there were no shops, no pubs, no churches, no community facilities and no schools. The reverberations on the families trans-shipped there by Labour-run Glasgow council are still being felt today, 50 years later. Although I do not for a minute expect such a drastic change of character in Bromley, it is an awful warning of the impact of ill-considered housing changes.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/29">It is important to my constituents that they live in a green and clean borough. When representatives of the Copers Cope area residents association heard that I had secured this debate, they rang me up to say how glad they were that I would be raising their concerns. The London borough of Bromley residents federation wonders how we can build a better Bromley when the density of housing imposed by the Government and the Greater London authority is being increased.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/30">The council is so concerned that, despite its overwhelming Conservative majority, a cross-party select committee&mdash;almost unique in the history of the Conservative-run Bromley borough&mdash;is being set up to inquire into the threats posed by the new residential developments proposed by the Mayor and the Government. Will the Minister assess the harm done to the democratic process when the Government impose housing targets without the agreement of the local community? He should look again at the imposition of targets, rather than agreed capacity levels, ensure that one Department or another carries out an environmental impact assessment of the imposed new housing, and give control over planning back to local councils.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/31">The backlash that I am witnessing as a local MP to the changes to the suburbs and constituency of Beckenham causes me grave concern about the health of the body politic. It should concern the Minister, too, as a democrat. I seek his assurance that he will look again at the change from a capacity figure for housing to a minimum target, and ensure that Bromley looks forward to being in control of its own housing policies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-22.28.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" speakeroffice="The Minister for Housing and Planning"  colnum="28"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/halltext/50222h02.htm#50222h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".28.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1031" name="Jacqui Lait">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)</phrase> on using this opportunity to secure a debate on overdevelopment in Beckenham. I note that three weeks ago the borough of Bromley debated a motion that more or less rejected the housing target in the London plan. The motion disputed that there is such housing need and asked for it to be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid=".28.0/2">The borough's attitude to housing provision concerns me. Housing figures are not made up out of thin air. They are based on real people's needs. If we deny those needs, we harm only ourselves, our families and our communities. Part of my understanding of community is the importance of maintaining family links, which means at least allowing for the possibility of families living reasonably close to each other. If we reject the case for new housing in a locality, our sons and daughters will not get on the housing ladder locally. Why deny them that opportunity? The need for new housing means that the problem of affordable housing will grow, as will homelessness. The economic vibrancy of our towns will also be stifled.</p>
	<p pid=".28.0/3">Housing figures are not imposed&mdash;if that is what the hon. Lady suggested&mdash;by Government or regional bodies such as the GLA. That is a myth. The starting point for working out our housing needs are population and household projections, which are policy neutral. Population projections are carried out by the Office for National Statistics, the expertise and impartiality of which are beyond question. Those figures enable us to get a grasp of the scale of what we face in the future. Experience has shown them to be fairly accurate, and they have proved useful for decades to get an idea of future regional housing needs. Indeed, the Opposition supported that methodology when they were in government.</p>
	<p pid=".28.0/4">Local authorities then work out what their area can sustain. Their housing capacity studies enable them to identify supplies of potential brownfield sites over the next 10 to 15 years. Each authority then agrees those capacity figures. The last set of figures was assembled by the London boroughs in 1999, and published by their representative body, the London Planning Advisory Committee, in 2000. Regional planning bodies use all that information to apportion housing figures between authorities. In London, those figures were subject to a wide-ranging public examination in 2003 and endorsed by an independent panel.</p>
	<p pid=".28.0/5">Bromley supported the last housing capacity study. It was even on the steering group. It included the housing figures for those capacities implied in its plan, and then consulted on them and took them to an inquiry. Clearly, the inspector's report on the UDP raised some important questions for the borough. She did not say that the green belt should be built on, but prompted Bromley to demonstrate the site supply that it said was available. She suggested that the borough should face up to its affordable housing needs, and proposed that density levels could be increased to reduce the threat to greenfield sites.</p>
	<p pid=".28.0/6">It is for Bromley to decide what to do now. It cannot pretend that its housing-needs problem and the London plan do not exist. Its members cannot pretend that they are not part of London or the south-east&mdash;a region that is commonly recognised to be under a great deal of housing pressure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-22.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/962" speakername="Keith Hill" colnum="29"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/halltext/50222h02.htm#50222h02_spnew2">
	<p pid=".29.1/1">I appreciate the hon. Lady's point, but I shall go on to argue&mdash;if there is time&mdash;that it is imperative that Bromley proceeds to meet its commitments on housing capacity, because there is no point having local plans that have been properly consulted on and independently tested sitting on the shelf and not put into practice.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/2">The Government are keen to make home ownership more widely available and to ensure that sufficient affordable housing is provided. We are considering how to respond to Kate Barker's recommendations on increasing housing supply. In the meantime, all current commitments to housing supply must be honoured. The Government, the GLA and the Association of London Government have launched a housing delivery plan for London, part of which involves looking at the areas in which housing completions have fallen, and working out what measures various parties can take to deal with that. Bromley was such an area from 1997 to 2001, and I am glad to say that the council has been most co-operative in considering what can be done. It worked with the Government office for London to produce a housing action plan, which examines how to overcome obstacles to new housing so that the problems that Bromley claims exist can be addressed. The Government are using this process to ensure that all the wider infrastructure issues that the hon. Lady identified, such as health, education and transport, are co- ordinated with the borough's housing needs. What we need now is for Bromley to start putting that housing action plan into practice.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/3">The hon. Lady specifically mentioned what she terms &quot;overdevelopment&quot;. I hope that she will accept that that expression can be both unclear and somewhat subjective. Government guidance is very clear about how authorities should plan for new homes. The guidance on planning for housing&mdash;planning policy guidance note 3&mdash;establishes that the first aim is for authorities to focus new development, wherever possible, on brownfield sites. That is the most sustainable choice. In London, some 90 per cent. of all new development is on brownfield sites. That is a fantastic record. That also holds true in Bromley, where the figure is about 93 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/4">PPG3 says that greenfield development is allowable, but only where brownfield sites are completely unviable or simply not there. It is also clear that authorities should be developing policies in their plans to ensure that the most effective use is made of existing brownfield sites. Opportunities for new development should not be wasted with low-density schemes, especially when those are in accessible areas. Not only will low-density developments not work towards building sustainable communities, they will exacerbate the need to release greenfield sites.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/5">Unfortunately this is one area where Bromley could do much better. Average London densities are around 53 dwellings per hectare. In Bromley the rate is only about 28 dwellings per hectare. Bromley seems unwilling even to achieve the average for outer London boroughs, which is 40 dwellings per hectare. This means that Bromley itself is causing a lot of the pressure on greenfield sites. It should not blame the Government or the GLA for that.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/6">I hear what the hon. Lady says about some of the recent developments in Bromley being ugly, or out of scale, and that densities in the town centre are unacceptable. I cannot comment on individual cases, but I would not seek to deny that some developments have left much to be desired. However, there is a positive and creative way to address that. Good design can help to ensure that higher densities blend in and even enhance an area. Some of the most attractive and valued parts of London, such as Chelsea, are at surprisingly high densities. Planning guidance is clear that new developments should be in scale with their surroundings and design qualities should be of a high standard. It is open to local planning authorities to reject applications on grounds of scale and design. Indeed, as Planning Minister I have frequently drawn attention to these powers. There is some evidence to show that planning authorities are increasingly willing to use them. Ministers have also been willing to sustain those judgments.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/7">The Government have produced many excellent good practice examples that show what can be done without compromising or damaging the character of an area, which is the usual criticism of density. Authorities should not dismiss higher densities in a knee-jerk reaction. They need to explain to their communities what opportunities are available. There is a leadership role to consider.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/8">The hon. Lady also raised the threat to the Bromley green belt. I have already pointed out that through the housing capacity study, and its plan, Bromley has maintained that it has sufficient brownfield sites over the lifetime of the plan to accommodate the future housing needs of its own community, but if Bromley now concludes that it cannot do this, and needs to release greenfield or green belt sites, it will be for Bromley to make the case for it. It should only happen once other options have been fully explored, such as increasing the number of high-quality design and greater-density homes. Only then should greenfield sites in the most sustainable locations be released.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/9">The Government are very supportive of the green belt policy, as set out in PPG2. Indeed the policy remains unchanged from that of the previous Conservative Administration. There are no proposals to relax it and it is as strong as ever. Indeed, our target is for each English region to maintain or increase the current area designated as green belt in local plans, even in regions containing housing growth areas. Between 1997, when the Government came to power, and 2003, the size of the green belt nationally increased by more than 19,000 hectares, with a further 12,000 hectares proposed in emerging plans. Under this Government, the amount of green belt land being developed has fallen when compared with that allowed for under the Conservatives in the 1980s and 1990s, and we propose to strengthen the green belt policy even more. We will shortly be consulting on a new green belt direction, which will require inappropriate planning applications to be referred to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/10">The London plan was adopted last year and, as programmed in that plan, a review and another housing capacity study are under way. The Greater London authority is hoping to consult on the emerging strategy next year and we understand that Bromley is contributing to the new capacity study. However, the new plan is for the future, and boroughs need to respond to the existing London plan, which addresses today's needs.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/11">We face serious affordable housing problems and we should not play petty politics with people's need for decent homes. There are some fantastic opportunities and we should work together to address London's housing needs in a way that protects greenfield sites and promotes sustainable development. I sincerely hope that the hon. Lady will encourage her local authority, Bromley, to face up to its responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".29.1/12">Sitting suspended until Two o'clock.</p>

	<p pid=".37.2/1">This is an appalling story of an arrogant state and innocent young men; a story of a state that believed it was acceptable to experiment on its own citizens without giving them proper information to enable them to agree to what was going on; and a story of utter innocence and trust. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/933" name="Patrick Hall">the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall)</phrase>, who very ably opened the debate, reminded us, it was an age in which people implicitly trusted authority. That trust was betrayed.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/2">I would like to speak principally on behalf of my constituent Ken Earl, and set out the picture that emerges from what happened to him, initially in his own words. In a letter to me he says:</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/3" class="indent">&quot;When I was called up for my National Service in January 1952, I was a student actor with a repertory company in Folkestone. I was eighteen years old and had been educated at the Harvey Grammar School, also in Folkestone . . . I had decided that it was to be an actor's life for me and I was a reluctant conscript when summoned to the RAF. Since the age of fourteen I had been an enthusiastic member of the . . . St. John Ambulance . . . so after my recruit training, I decided to be a 'medic' for two years. Unlike some others, I had not received any gas instruction during training, had not been issued with a gas mask and as a 'medic' at an RAF hospital I did not do guard duty. I was eventually stationed at Wroughton RAF Hospital, Swindon, Wiltshire. I enjoyed my job and soon I was flying from RAF Lyneham to the Middle and Far East to pick up wounded and other sick patients. I was happy where I was and I did not have any urge for a change. However, sometime in April 1953, I saw an item of interest on our Hospital notice board . . . 'Volunteers wanted to help find a cure for the common cold. Those participating will receive extra pay and a weekend pass'. The extra pay and the leave were what made me decide to apply. I was not worried about the cold as I seldom caught one. However, National Servicemen were always hard up, we received far less money than the regular airmen and when I did get a pass, I had to hitchhike all the way home to Maidstone and then do the same for the return. I had a girlfriend in Maidstone, who I eventually married, and I wanted to get home to see her. That in a nutshell is how a young country boy came to go to CDEE, the Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment at Porton Down. I hadn't read many newspapers in my life, I had never seen a television programme and like the other lads with me I was extremely na-ve. On <phrase class="date" code="1953-05-02">2 May 1953</phrase> I walked through the gates at Porton where I met nineteen other airmen from different units and all between the ages of 18 and 25. I was a senior aircraftman, I was the heaviest of all the men there, I was extremely fit and well and at that time I played rugby for my station and I was a keen weightlifter. We were all put in one billet, a wooden hut . . . <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-02">2 May</phrase> was a Saturday, and is remembered as the day of the Stanley Matthews Cup Final. Nothing happened on the Sunday . . . Monday . . . we were split mainly into groups of six and taken to a building for what can only be described as anthropometrical tests. This is a comparative study of the sizes and proportions of the human body. Not a medical . . . in my job I had helped carry out plenty of medicals. The tests involved taking measurements: height, weight, body shapes, a lung capacity test . . . We had a series of rubber patches stuck on one of our upper arms and a blood sample was taken. My group, there were six of us, were then marched to a low brick built building with glass panels to one side. There were two men in charge of the test and they were wearing white coats. They told us to roll up our left battledress sleeve to the elbow, and then they tied two pieces of khaki material, one on top of the other, to the inside of our forearms. We were then issued with respirators and instructed to put them on and told not to remove them until they told us to do so. We entered this building, which I now know to be a gas chamber, and the doors were sealed. The two technicians who I thought at the time were doctors entered with us, they too were wearing respirators. We were seated at a small table in the centre of the chamber and I am now aware that my place in the middle was seat number 4. One of the technicians then proceeded to drip . . . a colourless liquid onto the material on our left forearms. I now know that we each received 20x10 mg drops which I thought at the time and in my ignorance was a cold virus or vaccine but I now know was 200 mg of the lethal nerve agent sarin (GB). Today this chemical is known as a weapon of mass destruction! I had not been told anything and did not give my informed consent to this contamination. Never having worn a respirator before I became very hot and claustrophobic, of course the sarin was playing its part too and the climatic chamber was heated. How I lasted half an hour in this state I will never know and I still cannot travel on the underground to this day without a feeling of panic. After half an hour we were released gasping and spluttering into the open air. It was a beautiful May morning. We had the material taken from our arms, were told to run around a bit and then to remove our respirators. A second blood sample was taken.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/4">   *   </p>
	<p pid=".37.2/5" class="indent">Two days later on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-06">6 May</phrase> another six young airmen entered this chamber and sitting in my seat that day was LAC Ronald Maddison. He died an agonising death within 45 minutes of being contaminated.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/6">   *   </p>
	<p pid=".37.2/7" class="indent">My red blood cholinesterase depression was 34 per cent., Maddison's was 99 per cent. at post mortem.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/8">   *   </p>
	<p pid=".37.2/9" class="indent">The Porton scientists believed before his death that 100 per cent. depression would be fatal and they had already had cases of over 80 per cent. who had been hospitalised.</p>

	<p pid=".37.2/11" class="indent">Oliver Slater, a man in the chamber with me on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-04">4 May</phrase>, had a 90 per cent. depression and this critical figure was ignored by the scientists. They went ahead two days later and killed Maddison.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/12">   *   </p>
	<p pid=".37.2/13" class="indent">Only twelve were tested with 200 mg that week, my group and Maddison's group and of those twelve only five of us have reached three score years and ten. The other seven have died prematurely.</p>

	<p pid=".37.2/15" class="indent">Only ten days before we arrived at Porton, a young soldier had collapsed in an experiment with 300 mg of sarin, his breathing stopped but he was resuscitated. He was still very ill in the Station Hospital and on the day that Maddison died, his cholinesterase depression was still 85 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/16">   *   </p>
	<p pid=".37.2/17" class="indent">I was not told what the scientists were doing or whether there could be any long-term ill health from this so-called cold test.</p>

	<p pid=".37.2/33" class="indent">I didn't find out what had really happened to me at Porton until I read in a newspaper in 1999 about the Police Inquiry . . . My health since that time has often been poor unlike the rest of my family. I believe my nervous and immune systems have been damaged. I have suffered urinary tract problems since 1954, the year after the experiment.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/34">   *   </p>
	<p pid=".37.2/35" class="indent">I suffer from numerous skin problems. I believe these have been brought on by the skin contamination with sarin. These include: Seborrhoeic eczema&mdash;Scalp scaling&mdash;Nasal rash&mdash;Pitted nails&mdash;Erythema&mdash;Pruritis&mdash;Scaly areas on hands&mdash;and a Basal Cell Carcinoma on the opposite side of my forearm to the sarin application which has been surgically removed.</p>

	<p pid=".37.2/48">   *   </p>
	<p pid=".37.2/49" class="indent">I have multiple hepatic cysts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/50">That is the story of a young man of 18 who was reluctantly conscripted to national service, who began to enjoy the work and who was comprehensively betrayed by his country and by those who ran its armed services and the experimental centre at Porton Down. I am outraged when I am told that there is no documentary evidence that the subjects thought that they were going to get a common cold. If they were not told that they were going to get a common cold, we have to conclude that they are all lying, that they have formed some large conspiracy in which they have agreed to falsify what happened at that time and that in concert with one another they have fabricated evidence in order either to claim compensation or to receive an apology. That seems an extremely serious allegation.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/51">If there is no such allegation, we must accept the individual statements from witnesses that they thought that they were participating in cold research. Why did they think that? They are clear that it was in the notice. They may have picked up a great deal by rumour. However, it is extremely clear that no proper explanation was given to the young men when they went to Porton Down. It is a disgraceful story and a disgraceful episode in our past. Now, only a handful of Porton Down veterans remain. Surely the time has come not merely to apologise but to compensate for what was done.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/52">Even if they have suffered no ill effects&mdash;although clearly they believe that they have&mdash;what was done was so unacceptable that compensation should be paid by way of an apology. I deeply regret the attitude of the Government, although they are not the only ones involved in this and I would not suggest that they were, in trying to maintain the fiction that those people did not believe that they were going to assist with research into the common cold. There are times when Governments should say, &quot;Wrong was done,&quot; even if the matter was in the past. If living beings are still affected by the wrong that was done, they should receive justice. All we are asking for is a common courtesy, the sense of fairness for which this country used to be renowned and, above all, a recognition that innocent young men, who trusted authority, were betrayed.</p>

	<p pid=".46.2/1">This has been an emotional but fairly well reasoned debate, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/933" name="Patrick Hall">the hon. Member for Bedford (Mr. Hall)</phrase> on having initiated it.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/2">I pick up from the previous Adjournment debate introduced by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1266" name="Robert Syms">the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms)</phrase>. As I understand it, the ministerial response went something like this: most people know Porton Down and therefore when going there have certain expectations; most probably knew the nature of likely tests conducted there; and, so far hitherto no clear connection has been established between the health problems that have subsequently shown up among veterans and the exact treatment that they received at Porton Down.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/3">I got into the issue through a constituent, Mr. Kenneth Burns, who was an army chauffeur and one of those who thought that he had volunteered to assist with common cold research. He certainly did not know what Porton Down was for, and he certainly did not know the nature of the research conducted on him. When asked to put on a gas mask, he was apparently told, and I believe him, that he was there to test whether the masks chafed&mdash;not because it was a necessary part of the experiment. None the less, a bigger dose of sarin was inflicted on him than killed Ronald Maddison. Mr.   Burns described to me the departure of Ronald Maddison and the suspicious way in which his corpse was disposed of.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/4">If I accept that over a period the causal link between the tests and subsequent ill health is difficult to establish, that the intentions of the people at Porton Down were honourable, that the risks were expected to be low, the research worthwhile and the wider benefits considerable, that the volunteer programme was justifiable, and that the current Government act in good faith when commissioning epidemiological studies and providing information, it remains the case that my constituent and others' constituents were exposed without their consent to a process that could have killed any one of them and certainly killed Ronald Maddison.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/5">If anybody other than a Government put at risk the health of an individual in that way, there would at the very least be a case for damages, and in all probability a criminal prosecution would not be out of place either. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1317" name="Ann Widdecombe">the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe)</phrase> pointed out well, Porton Down can be defended against that specific charge, and I have made it as specific as I can, only by branding as liars hundreds of serving soldiers who were informally briefed if not formally told that they were in fact engaged in cold research.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/6">I met my constituent almost by accident. I was just out canvassing that day. He did not seek me out with a thirst for compensation, and I believe his side of the story. It may be said that veterans have a motive for telling their story in their way, but it may equally and probably more forcibly be said that the Ministry of Defence has a bigger motive, because behind Porton Down may lie other stories related to different incidents&mdash;Korea, the Gulf war and so on. We may be on the verge of opening an ugly can of worms. Why else would the Government challenge an inquest decision arrived at fairly?</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/7">Being casual with the lives of soldiers belongs to the past, and we all agree on that. However, there may be something worse than that, which is pretending to maintain better standards, and in doing so, stringing out investigations while awaiting the death of the complainants.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/8">It has already taken 50 years to get the truth about the Maddison death, and there can be little excuse for further delay. The Government can either make restitution and acknowledge errors or brand a host of perfectly decent veterans as liars&mdash;there are no comfortable choices left.</p>

	<p pid=".55.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate. We take the issue of fire services very seriously in the west midlands. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1193" name="Geoffrey Robinson">the Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> will speak for about 10 minutes, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/691" name="Bob Ainsworth">the Member for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth)</phrase> also supports us. It is recognised that he cannot take part in such debates because he is a deputy Chief Whip, but that is not generally understood outside the House, which is why I wanted to make that point.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/2">There is considerable concern in Coventry about the West Midlands fire and civil defence authority's proposals, known as integrated risk management policy. Our town looks as if it will bear the biggest brunt in the reductions in the levels of service provided. I notice that other west midlands MPs are present, and they are probably in a better position to say how the changes will affect their authorities. However, I hope that they will support the Coventry MPs in highlighting some of our concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/3">The issue is complicated, and in half an hour we cannot cover all that we would want to&mdash;we could spend two or three hours debating the subject. We want to highlight some of our concerns, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West will pick up on some of the points that I make. At the end of the day, it is a team effort from the MPs representing the three Coventry constituencies.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/4">The proposals would reduce the number of fire engines available between 12  am and 8  am, and we have considerable concerns about how cover would be provided or supplemented if there were major incidents in both Coventry and other parts of the west midlands. My hon. Friends and I have had discussions with the fire authority, and although the proposals look good on paper, they are only theory and have not been tried out. I, for one, would like to see that happen. The theory looks okay but, as everybody knows, it is in practice when the difficulties start.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/5">We also had discussions with the firefighters. They are the people on the ground who will have to deliver the service and who really know what effects the proposals will have. We took on board some of their arguments and raised their concerns with the fire authority. As my colleagues and other west midlands MPs know, we have also had discussions as a west midlands group of MPs. That group met not only the trade unions, but the authority and its chairman. I am also aware that Coventry city council will debate the issue tonight and, as I understand it, may reach a conclusion about what it thinks about the proposals. A lot of things are happening as a result of our concerns.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/6">It is also only fair to point out&mdash;this surprised me and, I am sure, some of my colleagues&mdash;that there had not been any real discussion between the authority and trade unions. My experience tells me that if someone is going to effect change, they have to involve people from the workplace&mdash;in this case, the firefighters themselves. Enlightened management often find that people from the shop floor can make a tremendous contribution, pointing out where proposals are workable or not.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/7">The West Midlands fire service is probably one of the most efficient in the country. It is not our intention to knock it in any way. However, it is our intention to represent the concerns and fears of the people of Coventry about the proposals. I hope that when the Minister replies he will bear that in mind. However, we also want assurances that the remaining appliances will not increase the risk to occupants of properties and to businesses and their employees&mdash;and, equally importantly, to firefighters and the public&mdash;as a result of any implementation of the proposals. We also want to know what effect the removal of the pumps and fire engines will have on standards.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/8">There is also the problem of community fire safety. That needs to be evaluated before any appliances are removed, particularly in high-risk areas. At present, throughout the west midlands, 62 appliances are regularly risk-assessed and tested. That has been done by chief fire officers since 1947 and Her Majesty's inspector, who carried out an evaluation as recently as 1992. The 1985 national standards of fire cover provided higher levels of service than those in the authority's integrated risk management policy plan. We found that interesting because standards seem to have changed.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/9">We are also concerned about the level of service provided in inner-city areas. Brownfield sites have now been used in inner cities, often for high-rise flats. Some cities have had successful millennium bids, such as the millennium proposals in Coventry which have created not only more flats in Coventry city centre, but a higher density of them. That is one of the things that happens with brownfield sites. We are certainly concerned about those areas.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/10">When we send firefighters into such areas, given the changing circumstances, we have to take on the issues concerning their safety, although nobody wants to be too emotional about that. In fact, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister stated that fire deaths rose by 6.5 per cent. in the first three months of 2004 compared with the same period in 2003. Fire-related injuries rose by 4   per cent. over the same period and fires increased by about 9 per cent. So the number of fires is increasing, which means that risk is increasing.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/11">The west midlands operational procedure note 23 states that the predetermined attendance for fires in high-rise buildings is four appliances and one pump. Under the current proposals, that would leave Coventry covered by one fire appliance between 12 am and 8 am. There are some serious concerns about how the proposals will affect us. However, I would have thought that other MPs from around the west midlands would listen closely to what I am saying and apply the same tests to the level of services that they might get as a result of the proposals.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/12">I know that the Minister's powers are limited, but I hope that he can reassure us. The situation is serious, and the proposals are being taken seriously. Overall, we need to consider the fact that it would take well over 18 minutes for a vehicle to travel in the night from Hunts Hall, on the outskirts of Birmingham, to Coventry&mdash;a lot more than the time that is proposed.</p>

	<p pid=".56.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the essential problem is that the proposals are a step into the unknown? I would feel much more comfortable if I could be sure that the rationale for such decisions will be made clear by the West Midlands fire authority, and that they will be subject to a regular review and independent scrutiny so that we can find out whether our fears are justified. We need to know whether there are unintended consequences. Would not it be step forward to have a clear rationale, and decisions that are subject to review and independent scrutiny, so that we can see the total picture?</p>

	<p pid=".57.3/1">I, too, am grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting this debate and to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/833" name="Jim Cunningham">the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham)</phrase> for securing it.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/2">One thing that has been stressed in all the discussions with the Fire Brigades Union and the management association is that this proposal has nothing to do with the overall discussions. Negotiations are still taking place between management and firemen on delivering the productivity deals that were inherent in the original settlement of the dispute a couple of years ago, in which my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister was so instrumental. Those discussions are ongoing, but we are told that the issue of the night shift from midnight until 8 in the morning is separate from the productivity negotiations, which inevitably will involve changes to shift patterns and working practices, and delivery of the efficiency savings that were at the basis of the arrangement reached between the Government, the Fire Brigades Union and the Local Government Association.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South said, and as other hon. Members indicated in interventions, it is difficult to understand the motivation for interim changes to night cover. It is said that those are purely issues of security, but it is hard to reconcile that with the fact that security performance is extremely good, integrated risk management is an unproven concept, and any change that is made must be done with great care and on substantial evidence. Indeed, the change should be divorced from questions of efficiency, productivity, shift patterns, payment systems and so on, given that it deals with life and death. However, it just does not seem to be correct&mdash;it does not ring true&mdash;that the two are entirely divorced. It is clear that cost savings are at the root of the proposals for the change in night coverage from 12 till 8 am. If there were not savings, the changes would not have been proposed. Let us not be too coy about this: at the root are cost savings, which may be right or wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/4">The problem, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South alluded, is that it is, for various reasons, difficult to have a pilot scheme in, for example, a hospital. It might even get in the way of hospital activities that do not involve acute emergency operations. I accept that a pilot scheme might make sense in some hospitals&mdash;I argued, for example, for the change to foundation hospitals.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/5">A pilot scheme might make sense if we could conduct it without risking life and limb, and without putting at risk things that none of us would want to put at risk. If we try to run a pilot scheme that involves changes to night security and puts people at risk, we run the risk of proving that the pilot scheme was wrong and that people have died unnecessarily. I do not believe that anyone in the House, and in particular in this Chamber, would remotely want to be put in that position, so the fundamental question is: how well proven is it that the proposed changes will not endanger life? I do not know, but I would always err on the side of caution. We are assured that it has nothing to do with cost, but we should not embark on a course that drastically reduces night cover without hard evidence and the assurance that such a reduction will not unnecessarily endanger life. That is critical.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/6">Other hon. Members who represent west midlands constituencies are also in the Chamber today, and it makes sense to cover the whole area, but I shall be slightly partisan and restrictive for a moment. I believe that Coventry is particularly concerned about being unnecessarily exposed when it comes to night coverage. I know that illustrations are not appropriate, but the west midlands is largely ham-bone shaped, and Coventry is at the tail end. There is gap between Coventry and the nearest stations&mdash;Bickenhill, Sheldon and Solihull&mdash;of about 10 miles, which is 15 minutes, and it is clear that Coventry is exposed. That is why we are pleased to voice our concerns in a debate on the wider context of the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/7">There was an arson attack last year on Britannia Tyres in my constituency in the early hours of the morning, at about 2 am. It took 18 minutes for an emergency fire engine to get from the nearest centre, which I believe is Solihull. It usually takes only 10 minutes to cover that distance, but such a concept is not easily fixed in stone and cannot be relied on absolutely. There were no deaths, but great financial damage and insurance costs were involved. Nevertheless, lives could have been lost, as they are more often than not. We know that 37 per cent. of fatal incidents occur in this period. That is the situation, but it will worsen if we implement the reductions that will hit Coventry proportionately more than the rest of the west midlands.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/8">I did not intend to argue specifically for Coventry, but for the whole of the west midlands. It is a cop-out for hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber to claim that this is purely a question of safety. At the heart of the matter are the overall arrangements for making cost savings and efficiency gains, to which they have committed themselves. It is putting the cart before the horse to change one part of that.</p>
	<p pid=".57.3/9">In many ways, night coverage is the worst, most exposed and most dangerous part of the package, and is separate from the rest of the package that still has to be negotiated. However, if that is what both sides want, my unequivocal view is that we cannot agree to it as parliamentarians until the overall situation is settled, because there are no proven systems behind it and no proof that we are not embarking on a course that could put lives in danger. Perhaps savings can be found elsewhere, perhaps they are not necessary, or perhaps the overall pattern of new shifts and costs can be otherwise arranged, but to prearrange things that affect the most sensitive and delicate of all the things that affect us&mdash;that is, human life&mdash;is dangerous and quite wrong. Surely what we need to do is to get the package right and, as part of that, ensure that night safety is properly taken care of.</p>

	<p pid=".59.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/833" name="Jim Cunningham">the Member for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham)</phrase>, accompanied by my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry, North-West (Mr.   Robinson) and for Coventry, North-East (Mr. Ainsworth), on securing this debate. We also heard contributions from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1062" name="Stephen McCabe">the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1115" name="Andrew Mitchell">the hon. Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>. Clearly the issue is of concern, and it is right that Members of Parliament have this opportunity to raise their concerns and champion the cause of their constituencies. My hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, North-West should not apologise for standing up on behalf of Coventry&mdash;it is his job to do that, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/2">The overriding objective of the fire and rescue service is to save lives. Thanks to the Government's partnership with fire and rescue authorities, as well as with other key stakeholders, the fire and rescue service is changing for the better&mdash;better for the communities that it serves and for those who work in it.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/3">Hon. Members will know that the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 came into force on <phrase class="date" code="2004-10-01">1 October 2004</phrase> and is the first substantive piece of fire legislation in the past 50 years. It puts the prevention of fires at the heart of the Government's agenda for improving the fire and rescue service, an important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry, South. The Bill does so by, for example, creating a new duty to promote fire safety, as well as by providing flexibility for fire and rescue authorities to work with others in the community.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/4">The 2004 Act also gives statutory force to a fire and rescue national framework, which sets out the Government's priorities and objectives for the fire and rescue services and what fire and rescue authorities should do to achieve them. The national framework also sets out the support that the Government will provide. The framework provides strategic direction from central Government, while ensuring that authorities continue to make local decisions. The 2005&ndash;06 fire and rescue national framework was published on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-06">6 December 2004</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/5">Integrated risk management plans have been at the core of my hon. Friends' contributions. The idea of prevention and local decision making is also at the heart of the move away from inflexible national standards towards locally determined integrated risk management plans. Since April 2003, the introduction of integrated risk management plans has allowed fire and rescue authorities to target resources to address local risk, as well as to make effective use of their resources in preventing fires. The introduction of integrated risk management plans has given the senior fire and rescue service managers what they have long sought: the flexibility to make decisions about fire cover based on existing and potential risks to their communities, within a strategic framework set by locally elected members.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/6">Integrated risk management plans, including those belonging to fire and rescue authorities in the west midlands, are about reflecting local needs, targeting resources at locally identified risks in a cost-effective manner, and identifying the ways in which a fire and rescue authority can work in partnership with other authorities and agencies to deliver improved public safety. Crucially, that must be a process of consultation. Documents must be published and everyone&mdash;Members of Parliament, members of the public, employees and others&mdash;must have the opportunity to contribute to the proposals that fire and rescue authorities publish. I understand that the West Midlands fire and civil defence authority completed its consultation on a year 2 integrated risk management action plan on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase> this year.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/7">I sincerely hope that the views and concerns expressed today have been articulated in that consultation process. I am sure that that has happened. On the basis of the documents put out for consultation, which has now been completed, those issues and concerns will have been heard loud and clear by the West Midlands fire service.</p>
	<p pid=".59.0/8">One issue raised was the involvement of trade unions in the consultation process. It is, of course, an important responsibility of the fire and rescue authorities to consult publicly on their integrated risk management plans. It is important that all the trade unions involved, including the FBU and many others, have the opportunity to engage in that consultation. I sincerely hope that the very important opportunity for those organisations to make their views known was taken up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-22.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" speakername="Lembit pik" colnum="63"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050222/halltext/50222h05.htm#50222h05_spnew2">
	<p pid=".63.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is correct. The system does not allow for a proper balance between risk and safety measures. As a result, there are ridiculous regulations for many activities and, possibly, a degree of under-regulation for others. We must find a way to prevent the cost of defending against spurious claims from always resting on the defendant. Volunteers in all their guises, from youth work volunteers to landowners who offer their facilities, must have protection from litigation. We need to take litigation out of our culture.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/2">At the heart of the issue is our approach to risk. I return to the difference between risk elimination and risk management. By not managing risk appropriately, we lose the social, economic and personal positives that reasonable risk-taking can bring. By treating risk as a kind of social asbestos, to be eliminated at all costs, we forget that an element of risk is a good component of all our lives&mdash;and outdoor activities are a perfect example of positive risk. In a report published in April 2004, the National Foundation for Education Research found that outdoor activity programmes improved young people's confidence, self-esteem, inter-personal and social skills, behaviour, self-image and fitness. Further, those positive effects were shown to be long lasting. Outdoor activities, therefore, improve subsequent behaviour. Other countries know that. Peadar Cremin, principal of Mary Immaculate college in Limerick, saw that at first hand in Denmark. At one pre-school play group area for children aged from six months to six years, the kids were playing outside on a sort of mini mountain, running up and down in a remarkable fashion. No adult was outside watching over them. Peadar was told that the Danish recognise the benefit of risk as a teaching tool. The Danish believe that that is a good way to help to generate a sense of personal responsibility that will last a lifetime, and I agree. However, in spite of the clear benefits of healthy risk taking, as I said before, the NASUWT, Britain's second-largest teaching union, advises its members against taking students on trips.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/3">I have suffered at the hands of risk. In 1998, I fell 30m, when my paraglider deflated over a Welsh mountain. I broke my back in 12 places and smashed my ribs, sternum and jaw, and I pay tribute to the NHS and the hospitals in Llanidloes, Shrewsbury and Gobowen hospitals for their life-saving efforts. A local Conservative said after my accident that I was 10 ft short of a by-election. I probably was. Never let it be said that Conservatives do not care. Despite my accident, I absolutely oppose a ban on paragliding. To ban it would deny the right to enjoy the sport, in all probability without the same consequences as mine. Besides, that experience taught me more than I can say. It underlines Professor Heinz Wolff's assertion in a lecture to the all-party group on adventure and recreation in society, of which I am co-Chair, that</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/4" class="indent">&quot;we have a biological need for risk&mdash;especially present in young people&mdash;but essential to all. If not managed well by society by providing enough legal risk&mdash;in schools, sports clubs, the arts and social &amp; family environments&mdash;this need for risk will become mismanaged and cause risk-seeking behaviour by individuals&mdash;antisocial, criminal or simply unhealthy. A Risk in Time Saves Crime!&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/5">He added:</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Risk prevention for the few means waste creation for all. As resources are finite, society must therefore set priorities based upon which risks are most important. The current attitude of society to many forms of risk is totally irrational, scientifically indefensible, and economically damaging: pre-occupation with safety dissipates a significant amount of national resource.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/7">Rather than spending time and money prohibiting and then policing an activity, why not engage with it proactively and make it safer? By managing risk rather than seeking to eradicate it, we can harness the benefits of adventurous activities.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/8">I welcome Government plans for school trips, but they need to consider the over-regulation of everyday life as a whole. Let us give people back their freedom, accepting that some of it will also mean giving people the right to make a mistake or to have an accident. That is what was promised regarding swimming, where at present in life-guarded pools, four-to-eight-year-olds have to be accompanied by one adult for two children. It means that more kids may drown because they never had the opportunity to learn to swim due to the strictness of those regulations. The Government are thinking the right way; I am asking them to think that way on a wider scale.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/9">Reshaping our attitude to health and safety is to recognise that our world cannot be risk-free. We lose if we sacrifice healthy and beneficial activities for the unattainable goal of absolute safety. It is Professor Wolff's firm view that in the diet of life our Government thinking is causing deficiencies in one vitamin: vitamin R, for risk. Risk, when taken in sensible doses, is the difference between sterile, anodyne and artificial living versus the chance to learn, accomplish, feel alive and even to love. Is the Minister brave enough to give us back our vitamin R?</p>

	<p pid=".66.0/1">This is a timely debate. I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> for offering me the opportunity not only to try to set the record straight on behalf of the Government, but to counter the idea that the drift in society that he outlined is Government inspired. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/751" name="Julian Brazier">The hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> has long campaigned on the issue. Last year, he had a private Member's Bill on the promotion of volunteering, in which this subject would have featured. He will be aware that Home Office Ministers were broadly sympathetic to the overall aims and objectives of his Bill.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/2">We very much wish to endorse the valuable contribution that outdoor pursuits make to a healthy society, to the rural economy and to the well-being of people in the United Kingdom. Indeed, in another debate, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/743" name="Tim Boswell">the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase> and I had a friendly discussion about fast bowling and cricketing, another sport that is not without risk. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire is known for his passion for dangerous pursuits and he described some of the consequences that can result from those. Indeed, I should like to have considered myself a keen horsewoman. There is nothing like the sheer exhilaration of riding flat out on a horse. It is a potentially dangerous occupation, but none the less exhilarating, and one that I would not have missed for the world.</p>
