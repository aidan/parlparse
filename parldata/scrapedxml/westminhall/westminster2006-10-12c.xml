<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.145.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" colnum="145"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0001.htm#06101253000239">
	<p pid="c.145.2/1">I am pleased, Mr. Amess, to be under your chairmanship. I hope that neither I nor members of the Select Committee on International Development, which I chair, will cause you any trouble. I hope, too, that you will find the debate interesting. It is important and, I suggest, timely.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/2">The Committee's presence demonstrates that we are pleased to have the opportunity to debate the report. In April, when we produced it, the situation was tricky and a little disappointing. It is now considerably worse inasmuch as the talks are suspended, time is fast running out and even the political will to find a solution seems almost invisible, and certainly unclear when it comes to utterances, never mind activities.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/3">The importance that the Committee attaches to a successful outcome of the Doha round&mdash;by that, we mean one that favours developing countries&mdash;cannot be overstated. It goes much further than simply securing a development round. If the Doha round of trade negotiations does not deliver a deal for developing countries, not only will it be a betrayal of the world's poor, but it will prejudice the very foundations of and justification for free trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/4">In a separate report earlier this year, the Committee argued the case for having an expanding private sector in developing countries as an essential component of poverty reduction. However, that in turn requires the opening up of trade possibilities as well as developing the capacity to trade. In other words, if a country does not have the opportunity to access markets, it will not be able to develop its private sector. We concluded that if such countries could not develop the private sector, they would not succeed in reducing poverty.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/5">Earlier this week, I attended a lecture at the Royal Society at which David King, the Government's chief scientific adviser, projected that gross domestic product for Africa in 2050 will be less than that of the United Kingdom. The whole of Africa will be generating less wealth in 44 years' time than the United Kingdom will be. That is entirely unacceptable, and it reinforces the need for trade, aid and development all to be working in the same direction. David King also predicted that Africa will have fallen behind in the green revolution&mdash;a change that has enabled many other developing countries to feed their expanding populations, as well as achieving economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/6">I am sorry to say that that reinforces somewhat the hypocrisy&mdash;I cannot find a gentler word&mdash;of the United States and the European Union in lecturing the developing world about free trade while applying the regressive protection of their own agriculture sectors and demanding conditions for liberalisation. Economies that still champion the Monroe doctrine and support agricultural subsidies are not well placed to offer leadership. The developed nations, notably the EU and the USA, have talked one way and walked another, and they seek to pass blame back and forth between them.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/7">Although the Committee welcomed the Government's success in securing a commitment to policy space in the G8 communiqu&eacute; under the British presidency, we believe that they have failed to use our presidency effectively to break the logjam. In particular, the Government allowed the EU to make conditional proposals on non-agricultural market access, and did not demur when benchmarking was tabled by the EU, both of which actions contradict the spirit of a development round. I am glad to say that benchmarking did not make much progress.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/8">In that context, I refer to paragraph 39 of our report, which quotes evidence from Sheila Page. She said:</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/9" class="indent">&quot;If we believe that liberalising the EU will benefit the EU, to say that we will not do it unless someone else does something first makes no economic sense. It certainly does not make development sense to tell developing countries, you must do what we consider sensible or we will not help you in other ways.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/10">If we believe that it is a good thing to do, there should not be any conditions. At paragraph 42, we say that the UK should have rejected the benchmarking proposals. That would have allowed us to avoid what was a wasteful distraction.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/11">I repeat that if we are to have a real development round&mdash;one that people can understand&mdash;the least developed countries would have 100 per cent. and unconditional duty-free and quota-free access to our markets. That, I believe, is what people understand the development round to mean. That should be accompanied&mdash;I accept that this is more qualified&mdash;by the recognition of these countries' need for policy space. The Committee debated that, and some would argue&mdash;I concur&mdash;that policy space has to be time-limited and case-dependent. The purpose of that policy space is to allow those countries to achieve free trade competitiveness, and to recognise that small, weak, poor countries cannot immediately step up into the international marketplace and expect to compete on the same terms as the established, developed economies.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/12">The Committee was also concerned, and remains concerned, that the EU wanted to designate up to 8 per cent. of its products as sensitive, and therefore eligible for continued protection against the weakest economies. A World Bank analysis suggested that even 2 per cent. would virtually eliminate the poverty impacts of a Doha agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/13">When we published the report, I said:</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/14" class="indent">&quot;If this is to be a development round then the EU should not make its offers on agriculture or wider market access to the EU conditional on reciprocal non-agricultural market access, services or anything else. A true development round gives developing countries unconditional access to developed countries' markets for the widest range of products.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/15">Similarly, if we are to agree to an aid-for-trade package, it should not be considered as part of the aid budget&mdash;I fear that the Minister will probably tell us it will be&mdash;but as an investment by the UK and the EU in developing stronger trading partnerships with emerging economies, to everyone's mutual long-term benefit.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.2/16">If the current round collapses or goes into deep freeze, it seems likely that trade patterns will be determined by bilateral agreements rather than multilateral ones. That would be a negation of free trade; it tends to mean some developing countries getting more favourable treatment than others. In addition, it means that when the agreements come to an end, which must happen, there will be further pain and disruption. Indeed, the Committee took evidence on that with the sugar regime.</p>

	<p pid="c.147.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. It is not simply the timing of bilateral agreements. By and large, the big power holders in those bilateral agreements will beat down the poorer ones, so it will always be an unequal relationship from which the poor will lose. Bilaterals are bad news for poor countries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.147.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" speakername="Malcolm Bruce" colnum="147"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0001.htm#06101253000241">
	<p pid="c.147.1/1">That is a telling point. Indeed, Mr. Amess, you will have heard that the degree of agreement among the Committee is such that we can call each other our hon. Friends. We are good colleagues and friends.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/2">The high hopes that the trade talks would be a development round&mdash;it was described by Pascal Lamy as a round for free for the poorest countries, giving them market access without reciprocal concessions&mdash;now look pretty jaded. Some people, including Pascal Lamy, are saying that there may be a brief window to secure a deal after the US elections next month and perhaps in February next year. Frankly, it is difficult to be optimistic, given the lack of progress to date over a much longer time scale.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/3">The greater concern is that, because nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, less developed countries may feel pressured into making concessions to secure what is on the table now. Evidence from some countries is that that is the case. That demonstrates the point made by the right hon. Gentleman: it would effectively amount to an unholy alliance of the developed countries and the larger developing countries, to the detriment of poor countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/4">There are those who welcome the current impasse on the Doha round. For example, War on Want says that resuming negotiations is now the worst possible option, and Christian Aid says that simply resuming talks on the same basis as before would be a mistake. However, Pascal Lamy, the World Trade Organisation director general says that if the talks were not resumed</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/5" class="indent">&quot;All of us would pay...the breakdown of negotiations would cause for great celebration within the protectionist ranks&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/6">He adds:</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The pity in all this is that what is on the table now constitutes greater progress in rolling back farm subsidies and tariffs than anything seen before in global negotiations...powerful tariff cutting formulas that were on the verge of agreement would have opened global markets as never before&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/8">However, somebody in the developed world has to take a lead at this time. Ministers and Commissioners say the right things, but we are currently at a standstill. The <i>Financial Times </i>speaks of</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/9" class="indent">&quot;a faintly silly game of competitive concern for the revival of Doha, with ministers and officials dashing around the globe ostentatiously holding meetings to prove their commitment to the trade round that their intransigence has just brought to a shuddering halt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/10">As I have said, the situation was difficult when we published our report in April, but it is much more serious now. If trade negotiations move from the multilateral to the bilateral we will, as the <i>Financial Times </i>again observes, replace the rule of law with the rule of the jungle. Rather eloquently, it says:</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The WTO<i></i>talks are a loom that weaves thousands of mercantilist strands into a tapestry of free trade.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/12">That is a sentence worthy of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> at his most florid.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/13">I welcome the fact that the EU has exercised a moratorium on any new trade negotiations&mdash;bilaterals&mdash;since the beginning of the Doha round. Frankly, if that moratorium has ended&mdash;there are those who call for it to end&mdash;I suggest that that is a signal of the beginning of the end for the possibility of EU leadership in multilateral free trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.147.1/14">I hope that the Minister will agree that such deals are not just, as some people think, second best in the absence of a WTO deal; I repeat that they are ultimately the negation of free trade. Despite the rhetoric, the EU and the USA do not have a credible track record on free trade. Therefore, the test now is not who blinks first, but whether the EU can stop blaming the US and unilaterally break the deadlock with a bold new initiative. Will the Government be prepared to put their head above the parapet and make such a demand? If nobody does, it is not just the developed world that will lose the Doha round: free trade will be the casualty and we will all be the losers, rich and poor alike.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.148.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="148"  time="014:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0001.htm#06101253000242">
	<p pid="c.148.0/1">We have one last chance to save the talks before the US President's trade promotion authority runs out. The window of opportunity will come after the mid-term elections, and frankly it will last weeks rather than months. Unless a draft deal goes back to Congress very early in the new year, the trade promotion authority will have ended before there is an opportunity to approve the deal. If there is no trade promotion authority, there is no deal. Whatever the US President or the US Administration via their trade representative might negotiate, it would be torn to shreds in a protectionist Congress&mdash;everybody involved in the talks knows that.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/2">I urge the Minister and the Government to press the European Union vocally to make the most of this last opportunity. I simply ask: is the EU preparing a new offer to be publicly presented after the mid-term elections? We will not reach a deal in the WTO as a whole unless there is substantial movement both by the EU on the common agricultural policy and by the US on farm subsidies and on other agricultural protection measures, particularly in relation to cotton. There is no point having timid talks unless there is a bold offer to break the deadlock&mdash;it needs to be bold and to happen very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/3">Deep in my heart I am pessimistic, although I hope I am wrong. Hon. Members need to ask and debate what the contingency is if the talks grind to a halt and fail or remain in deep freeze for several years to come. First, we need to learn the lesson that the stricture for this round that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed has been a recipe for failure. When the Committee was in Washington DC and met the US trade representative, that formulation was used to justify the lack of movement by the US. The US said that it had made an offer, and until others responded in a way that was acceptable to it, progress would not be made, and that progress could not be banked in one part of the negotiations while discussions continued in another, because nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/4">Anybody who has been involved in any kind of negotiation knows that a deal is built up incrementally. I spent a number of years as a full-time trade union official negotiating deals on pay and conditions for a range of health service staff. A deal was not created by a flash of inspiration on both sides of the negotiating table at a single point in time: a deal was put together in parts. In order to encourage and put together a WTO deal in obviously difficult negotiations, involving 130 parties, success needs be announced part by part. I do not see any reason why a deal cannot be reached and banked on agriculture when further deals have been made in other parts of the negotiations, for example on non-agricultural market access. If, as I suspect, the talks remain dormant for two or three years until, to be blunt, there is a new President of the US and a new President of France who are not out to sabotage them, we need to use the time between now and then to ditch the doctrine that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. If we do not do that, the talks will have little more chance of success in two or three years' time than in the past two or three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/5">Within the EU, the British Government have taken a position against conditionality with offers. We have taken the view that reducing tariffs and quotas, and increasing market access, is not something that harms the country or group of countries that do it; it is put into the negotiations because it benefits us and our trade partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/6">It is unfortunate that a clear majority in the EU does not accept that non-mercantilist approach to trade negotiations, but what we are arguing is right. Yes, of course transitional arrangements need to be provided for developing countries with fragile economies as they liberalise. A big bang is not helpful to the least developed countries, but the principle is right. If we sincerely believe that trade liberalisation will help to raise the incomes of poor people in poor countries because they are able to sell the product of their labour internationally in places in which they were hitherto unable to do so, we must use the time between now and whenever a global deal is made to put that principle into practice by changing the policies of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/7">We cannot unilaterally change the trade policies of the United States or Japan. I wish that we could, but we cannot. That is the problem with these negotiations, but we, as a leading country in the European Union, can press for and, I hope, achieve changes in our European Union policy. That has been done before. The &quot;Everything but Arms&quot; agreement was introduced before we got to this round of trade negotiations. It was introduced for the right reason: it increased opportunities for poor people from poor countries to sell their goods&mdash;primarily agricultural products&mdash;to a European market. We need to go further unilaterally by tearing down the barriers. To use the words of my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment when he was the Minister for Trade and gave evidence to our Committee, we need to &quot;kick open the door&quot; that keeps the goods of poor people from poor countries out, and we can do that in the EU by ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/8">We have a package agreed in the EU to phase out export subsidies by 2013, conditional on reaching an agreement in the Doha trade round. It is the right thing for the EU to do, and I am sure that it is the right thing to do for the countries where we have been dumping subsidised agricultural produce and undermining local markets and the livelihoods of local farmers. It is possible for us to ensure that we unilaterally phase out export subsidies by 2013, or by an earlier date, if that is feasible, simply because we choose to do so. It would be to our benefit to do so and it would be to the benefit of some poor farmers in poor countries if we did so.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/9">We can unilaterally, if we choose to do so, make further progress in modifying the nature of subsidies under the common agricultural policy and reducing subsidy levels overall under that policy, so that farmers who are producing unsubsidised agricultural produce in Africa who have open access to our markets will be competing more nearly on a level playing field; in other words, competing with less highly subsidised agricultural produce produced in Europe. Those are things that we can do by ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/10">I hope desperately that this window of opportunity can be used to achieve progress in the round as initially intended, but if that is not possible, the greatest betrayal would be for us simply to walk away from the trade agenda and not to do what it is in our power to do unilaterally within the European Union to promote development and the attainment of the millennium development goals. I am talking about achieving that through our own unilateral actions on trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.0/11">Let us remember why this kind of trade round was launched at Doha. It came just a couple of months after 9/11, when there was a feeling throughout the world of global solidarity and a recognition in the rich world that if we do not promote development and create opportunities for economic development in poor countries, we create, at least in some poor countries, failed states within which terrorism can thrive and terrorists can find sanctuary, rest and recuperation for their operatives and money laundering facilities from a poor but compliant Government. It was because of that recognition that the big power blocs of the western world agreed that the priority of this trade round should be to deliver a development agenda for the poor. However, that has been forgotten. The round so far has failed and may fail in the short term, although I think that in the long term an agreement will be made. However, that is not an excuse for us in Britain and for the EU to forget that we can reform trade to benefit the poor unilaterally, and we must do so. That is in their interests, but it is also in ours.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.151.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" speakername="John Bercow" colnum="151"  time="014:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0001.htm#06101253000243">
	<p pid="c.151.0/1">It is a pleasure and a privilege to take part in the debate, and I begin by paying tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" name="Malcolm Bruce">the right hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Select Committee on International Development, for his work in bringing about the report, to which all members of the Committee have signed up.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/2">I am sad to say that, on the strength of experience, I am inclined to agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">the verdict of the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase>. I fear that his pessimism is all too justified, because we do not have to look into a crystal ball when we can read the book. That said, we have an overriding obligation to try to rescue the Doha development round, and the British Government have an important role to play in that process, in the hope that some sort of arrangement can be fashioned, the net effect of which will be to reduce the poverty of the poorest at the expense&mdash;let us be explicit&mdash;of some necessary and considerable sacrifice by the richest.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/3">In the brief time available, I should like to focus on a couple of points. First, both because it is significant on its own and because it is emblematic of the wider problem with which we are wrestling, I shall talk about duty-free and quota-free access. There was a widespread hope and a partial commitment that 100 per cent. duty-free quota-free access would be provided for the least developed countries to export their produce and to reduce thereby their destitution.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/4">In fact, we got something rather different. We got&mdash;principally on the ultimate insistence of the United States that it was thus far and no further&mdash;an agreement only to 97 per cent. The significance of that can hardly be overstated. It would be easy to be beguiled by the rhetoricians, the spin doctors and the press release merchants&mdash;of whom a plentiful supply was in evidence in Hong Kong in the delegations both of the United States and of the European Union&mdash;and to suppose that 97 per cent. was really quite good. I might be thought rather churlish to suggest that the cup was half empty rather than half full. In fact, the situation is worse than that. The cup is not just half empty; there is scarcely any water remaining in it.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/5">Let me explain why I say that. If we think about the 3 per cent. that has been protected, we see that we are in practice talking about somewhat more than 300&mdash;probably nearer 330&mdash;product lines that are exempt from the duty-free quota-free access arrangement. Are they a purely incidental and arbitrarily chosen 330 lines? Is it a matter of happenstance whether or not a line is included in the agreement? No, that is not the case at all. Those that are excluded and fall within the 3 per cent. have deliberately been put into the exempt category to satisfy the selfish commercial interests of states that are much more powerful, principally the United States and the European Union&mdash;a collection of states&mdash;and, to a considerable degree, Japan.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/6">Just reflect on the facts. Under the agreement, unless it is amended and improved, the United States will still be able to resist the export of textiles from Bangladesh, and Japan will be able to resist the export of rice from Cambodia. So far as Bangladesh is concerned&mdash;to pluck out one important example&mdash;about 20 to 25 product lines account for two thirds of its exports. When one reflects on those limited but important statistics, one recognises just how desperately damaging it is that the agreement so far is for only 97 per cent. and not 100 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/7">I have flayed the United States, and I make no apology for doing so, because it has taken a thoroughly selfish and irresponsible approach thus far to the negotiations, but let us not suppose for one moment that the European Union can or should be let off the hook. The Chairman of the Select Committee mentioned the EU's original insistence on large numbers of sensitive products. I think that the figure has sharply fallen since then, but even now the European Union is positing a scenario in which a significant number of products shall be judged to be sensitive so far as it is concerned, and developing countries will therefore not have an opportunity to export them. That is wrong. If we are serious about trade reform, about a development deal, and particularly about a pro-poor outcome, which was the whole rationale behind this set of negotiations in the first instance, we must resolve to secure a far superior outcome to the unsatisfactory mish-mash which is currently on the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/8">Secondly, I am disappointed that far too little attention was paid to the subject of special and differential treatment. I think that the Committee also felt that an opportunity was lost. When reflecting on this subject, we have to adjust our mindset to the context of the totality of the negotiations. In this day and age, in the light of industrial development around the world, it is a mistake to view the debate as consisting of a Manichean divide between the forces of good and darkness, or even between the forces of developed and developing countries. That is part of the debate, but it is a simplistic characterisation because there is a world of difference between the position of India, China, or, indeed, Brazil, and the circumstances faced by Bangladesh, Ethiopia, or, dare I say it, Benin, Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad. If we are to create equitable and sustainable deals which respect the different circumstances of developing countries, we in the international community must be prepared to roll up our sleeves and attend politically, but, more importantly, intellectually, to the different circumstances faced by a range of countries. On that basis, we can come to arrangements which on the whole favour the poorest and the poorer, rather than the richest or richer.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/9">My third point is that although there is a desperate threat of insecurity, collapse into failed states, internal conflict, and the acquisition of small arms and unregulated circulation of such weaponry, which kills something like 400,000 people around the world each year, there is also an ultimate threat of terrorism. I have made the point before, and I make no apology for repeating it, that if as a matter of calculated policy we exacerbate the plight of the poor and increase the gap between them and us, it is only a matter of time before a proportion of them decide to pursue another route to redressing the balance. They may do it voluntarily, or they may find themselves being used by others, but it will happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/10">There is another danger, which is a less apocalyptic scenario than that which the hon. Member for City of York validly articulated, that we will make next to no progress in the pursuit of the millennium development goals. There is a danger, in the international development debate, that we end up discussing these issues in a compartmentalised fashion. In the conduct of domestic politics, it is often said that we need joined-up government; the Government say that they are delivering it, and we sometimes claim that they are not, but there is a regular debate about it. We need a similar approach to the formulation of policy on international development.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/11">It is no good the European Union, the United States, Japan and others patting themselves on the back and feeling some sense of vindication, and perhaps of collective altruism, that they are doling out substantial sums of taxpayers' money, the better to assist the poorest countries in the world, if they pursue trade policies which go in precisely the opposite direction. The danger is even greater when trade massively exceeds aid in volume&mdash;as we frankly know it does. Realistically, it always will. If we continue to operate in that way, we will be giving $1 with one hand and taking probably nearer to $6 with the other. I think that those are the sorts of denominations in which the debates should be conducted. There is a hugely greater sum involved with agricultural turnover than with the contributions made by OECD states in the form of Government assistance to the poorest countries in the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/12">My final point, in expressing the hope that what looks like a calamity might be prevented, is that there is no moral equivalence between the position of rich countries pursuing unfair trade&mdash;hugely subsidising their own produce and dumping the surplus on the poorest people on the planet&mdash;and developing countries declining wholly to agree, or, perhaps, to agree at all, with the demand from the richest countries on earth that they should open their markets. The richest countries on earth are perfectly entitled to take the view that markets should be opened for services and the like, but developing countries are perfectly entitled to take the view that they do not want to do so because they prefer for substantial periods to enjoy policy space to build up their own domestic markets and to pursue their priorities. They are also entitled to take the view that they will consider doing so over a graduated period, depending on their economic strength, or when they have had the Doha offer which they thought was the whole purpose of and rationale for the negotiations in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.0/13">I do not like the fact that sometimes people, particularly people in the western world, become so embroiled in the minutiae of the negotiations, or, in a professional capacity, are so stuck within the interstices of the system, that they can genuinely find themselves persuaded that it is really a question of a bit of give and take on both sides, and that if we are to consider abandoning or heavily reducing our agricultural subsidies, it is only reasonable for us to say to developing countries, &quot;You've got to give us something in return&quot;&mdash;the principle of the quid pro quo. I confess that I do not accept that principle. It seems to me that in the conduct of international trade, ethics do not have much to do with it, but they should. As well as a healthy dose of realism, which should of course inform any constructive approach to political negotiation, we should not lose sight of the need for a decent dose of idealism. It is wrong for the European Union massively to subsidise its agricultural produce in a way that hugely distorts trade and makes poor people in developing countries still poorer, and we should commit, within a specified, and preferably short, timetable to stop it. If we are then able to persuade other countries to give something to us in recognition of our contribution, so be it, but we should stop it in any event.</p>

	<p pid="c.155.2/1">As the Chairman of our Committee said in introducing the report and as other hon. Members have said, things have moved on since it was presented in April. The negotiations have been broken off and elections are looming in America. Moreover, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> said, there is also an economic factor.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/2">To pick up on some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">the remarks made by the hon. Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase>, the economic context in the west is worsening. Hon. Members may have seen an article in the financial press yesterday stating that wheat prices in the US have hit</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/3" class="indent">&quot;a 10-year high...on fears of a further decline in global wheat production&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/4">at a time when stockpiles are at a 20-year low. The article continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The latest rise is expected to lead to higher food prices, affecting bread, breakfast cereals, pizzas and pasta&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/6">throughout the western world in the next 12 months. I read that out simply because there is a debate on climate change on the Floor of the House and because there is now pressure on food prices following the failed harvest in Australia and drought elsewhere. Who will pay the highest price in that worsening context? As ever, it will be the poor of Africa. They will not get a chance to catch up as wheat prices increase and the rest of us scrabble to keep our heads above water.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/7">Since the 1970s, when pressure built up for aid, and the 0.7 per cent. target was first established, it has always been recognised that the real key to development would be fairer trade, not aid. There was a wonderful cartoon of a Mexican peasant facing a well-dressed business man who was holding a teaspoon out to him with the word &quot;aid&quot; written on it. However, the business man's other hand was round the peasant's windpipe and emblazoned on his arm was the word &quot;trade&quot;. That has ever been the situation: a little teaspoon of aid cannot make up for the stranglehold on the windpipe of international trade. We should not resile, therefore, from insisting that trade and development go together, even if that seems to move back from an international agenda.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/8">Over the past few years, there has been real progress on aid and debt cancellation, not least by this Labour Government. However, all the pressure that built up around the immensely popular Make Poverty History campaign, with the focus shifting to trade justice, is in danger of evaporating, not only because of the complexity of the issue, but because of the disillusionment about the Doha round.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/9">Following the second world war, and even before globalisation became a major economic theme, it was generally recognised that there was a need for an international, multilateral, rules-based trading system, and that was the whole point of the general agreement on tariffs and trade. In 1995 the World Trade Organisation was set up. Encouragingly, it shifted the focus a little later by suggesting that we work towards establishing trade rules that worked for the benefit of those who were locked out of the economic system&mdash;the world's poor. It set out on purpose to enable poorer countries and their peoples to break into the dominant world economic trading system.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/10">However, the rounds of talks, as we have debated endlessly in parliamentary Question Time, have repeatedly broken down. They have become enmeshed in the most incomprehensible arguments about intellectual property rights, investment measures and special product exemptions, and everything has been buried under complex acronyms, such as NAMA&mdash;non-agricultural market access&mdash;and the rest of them. Those of us who pay attention to the detail get stuck into the debate, but such problems are leading to increased disillusionment in the outside world, with people wondering whether the talks can ever deliver any change or justice for the poor. That generates disillusionment among those of good will, who believe in building, not an anything-goes free trade system, but a fair-trade, rules-based system that would at last be weighted in such a way as to deliver basic economic justice to poor people and their countries. There is now despair that that cannot possibly happen. As a result, we will lose all the pressure that built up around the Make Poverty History campaign, and people will believe that politics cannot change the world and nothing can be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/11">There is therefore some onus on us as politicians, on Governments and on international bodies to tackle the agenda before us, even at this late stage. The Doha round is in suspension and is proving to be the most deeply disillusioning round of all time. It is not only blocking development progress, but making things worse by leaving a vacuum. Into that vacuum will move the bilateral agreements, which will increase inequality between the powerful and the poor trading countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/12">During the development rounds, we talked about the limited negotiating capacity of the poorer countries, but that problem will be magnified in bilateral negotiations, when those countries will try simply to negotiate on a product-by-product basis. They will have no chance at all of getting a fair deal. &quot;Bilateral&quot; will mean that the poor will get poorer.</p>
	<p pid="c.155.2/13">In general it is recognised that poorer countries lost ground in the last negotiating rounds. Since 1994 the world trading system has reinforced the position, reach and access of the powerful, not the poor. Things have gone the other way. Deadline after deadline has passed and the Doha round has shown no sign of a development breakthrough.</p>

	<p pid="c.159.2/1">This question of the consequence of failure is important. While I agree with the right hon. Member for Gordon that no deal&mdash;the collapse of the talks&mdash;would be a lose-lose scenario, does the hon. Lady accept my view that there is a huge difference between the loss to be sustained by the richest countries in the world, which is a lesser increase in wealth, and the loss to be sustained by the poorest ones, which is to be a continuation, and probably an intensification, of grinding poverty?</p>

	<p pid="c.159.3/1">I fully accept the hon. Gentleman's argument. However, the west will lose a major political battle in these talks, not an economic one, because if we do not hold to the virtue of multilateral talks, we set an unwelcome precedent in terms of the entire politics of global security as well as global economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/2">As I said, the fact that we failed to emphasise the win-win situation entrenched the lack of political momentum. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1673" name="John Battle">my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (John Battle)</phrase> mentioned, we might be talking only about 3 per cent. of our economy being adversely affected by these talks. If we are simply to be seen as losers and not necessarily net gainers, where is the apparent incentive for politicians to trudge through long years of hard negotiation to come out with not very much to produce to their citizens and electorate? We must reassess on which basis we look forward to these talks in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/3">There needs to be much more talk about creating more jobs in the global economy as a whole, rather than trying to rectify a trade imbalance between north and south, if we are to give that incentive. The hon. Gentleman appropriately discussed the moral argument, and I agree that a strong moral imperative exists, but the realpolitik is that we have to produce the incentive to encourage members of the international community to reassess their positions at these talks. In the past 30 years, there has been a growing disconnect between employment rates on the one hand, and economic growth on the other. That inevitably leads to a rise in protectionist sentiments if unemployment levels remain high or the perception is that further liberalisation may increase unemployment. The rise of the Chinese economy in particular has helped to increase those fears.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/4">We must give a much higher priority to policy coherence between trade and labour sectors of government, so that more aid for trade is directed at labour market preparedness and providing greater social protection for emerging economies. If people are being asked to take the risk of moving from one sector of employment, such as subsistence agriculture, to industrial production of agriculture or to industry, for example, we are asking them to take a great risk in their own lives and those of their families. If there is no form of social protection at a basic level, the political reality is that people will be strongly opposed to taking that risk in the first place because they know the consequences of something going wrong. There is growing evidence that the use of cash transfers as a part of a comprehensive social protection system can play a key role in reducing absolute poverty and the vulnerability and risk element in rapidly changing economies.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/5">Yesterday, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> attended a meeting of the all-party group on debt, aid and trade, which I chaired. We took part in a briefing arranged by Oxfam on the next round of the European Union economic partnership agreements. We cannot see them in isolation from what is going on in the World Trade Organisation negotiations. I want to summarise the interesting remarks made by the Rwandan ambassador, who said that what they need to develop their economies is investment in infrastructure&mdash;transport, energy supplies, water, research and so on, but under poverty reduction strategy paper rules they are severely limited in taking on additional borrowing. He said:</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/6" class="indent">&quot;We can't get grants, and aid money&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/7">from western donors</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/8" class="indent">&quot;is focused on hospitals and schools. If we don't have the infrastructure, we can't compete against richer nations or cope with further liberalisation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/9">The Committee has just produced its own report on private sector development. It has become increasingly important that the sequencing of any trade liberalisation for the least developed countries must be accompanied by the opportunities for genuine improvement in economic infrastructure. We also need to focus on creating viable alternative streams of Government income to replace that lost by reductions in tariffs. I know that the Department for International Development is already carrying out work in the countries in which it operates and is helping in terms of customs and revenue reforms, but this needs to be done at a much greater level by all the international donors.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/10">The international community must take a robust approach both nationally and at an international level on issues that severely restrict fair trading at a global level, and, as a result, employment creation, be they capital flight, tax avoidance or, in particular, the widespread and pernicious mispricing of exports and imports to shift profits out of a country. It is estimated that the aid flow of $25 billion, mostly to sub-Saharan Africa, is dwarfed by the $50 billion that the region loses in capital flight. We need to reassess where the money is going and where it is escaping from if we are to give the LDCs the chance to trade on fair terms.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/11">It is understandable that many of those countries are cautious given their past experiences of forced liberalisation and the one-size-fits-all policies imposed by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund in the mid-1980s and 1990s. As recommended in the report, the Government need to press for the WTO to promote a system of independent, impartial and publicly available economic analysis of the effect of different proposals on different countries and groups, so that decisions can be made on the basis of the fullest information being available to all parties at the negotiations, regardless of their wealth or size.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/12">The reluctance of western nations, including the EU and the USA, to reduce substantially their trade barriers remains the biggest negotiating hurdle. Those protectionist sentiments run deep; we need only witness debates in the US Congress and Senate to see that such sentiments are increasing, rather than decreasing as the years go by. That promotes the pessimism about any hope of a realistic settlement in the next few months. We should not speak about having an ambitious development-oriented agenda while offering only a small fraction of our own markets. We need to be much bolder and braver if we are to create a fairer global economic market and one in which we can all form a part.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/13">The WTO has a lot of faults, some of which we mentioned in our report and in our comments today, but it is a unique international structure because it is based on one member, one vote. It is quite different from the World Bank, the IMF and the permanent United Nations Security Council. The growing shift in power to the new and emerging world economies as the talks have progressed has changed the nature of the negotiations as they have gone along. The G20, consisting of India, China, Brazil and some of the middle-income developing nations&mdash;if I can put it that way&mdash;has emerged. I remember that at Cancun everyone thought it was a temporary phenomenon that would last only for a few months and that it was simply a case of nations getting together on a very informal basis, but it has formed a resilient trade negotiating bloc within the WTO. It represents the shift in economic power from the north to the south, and that is inescapable; it will happen. It is about time that western nations faced up to that fact economically and came to terms with it.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/14">It has been mentioned that the G20's priority might be different from that of the G90, although it must be remembered that there are more people in absolute poverty in India than in the whole of Africa. So the G20 has considerable problems with which to deal, but a new political economic order is developing in the world. We must be able to reach out and accommodate and to work with such countries to achieve fairer trade for all.</p>
	<p pid="c.159.3/15">In the short term, it would be helpful if larger member states could avoid sniping at each other. If they could concentrate on getting at least some of the agreed negotiations on giving better access to LDCs&mdash;the aid-for-trade package has been mentioned&mdash;that would at least keep the multilateral concept on the road. That is important politically, if not economically in the short term, if we are to reach a better agreement that more fully represents the needs of developing nations, although that might be two to three years down the line.</p>

	<p pid="c.162.0/1">I apologise, Mr. Amess, for missing the first few minutes of this debate. I was unavoidably delayed and sent you a note asking you to apologise to the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/2">This is not the first time that we have debated the World Trade Organisation and I suspect that it will not be last. Unless we get right the WTO final resolution, if there is ever to be such a thing, the levels of poverty and the imbalance of power and wealth in the world will get worse, not better. As things are now, the situation for the poorest in the world is getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/3">I was interested in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1987" name="Ann McKechin">the reference made by my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin)</phrase> to the shift of power between the negotiating blocks of the traditional western powers&mdash;the EU and the United States&mdash;and development of the group of 20. That is a significant and important development. It has created success as well as problems. It shows that there has been growth in the economies of what were very poor countries, but also that they are prepared to combine to develop their own agenda&mdash;for example, with Brazilian soya, and so on&mdash;often at the expense of the poorest countries or the people in those countries. There are many very poor people in Brazil and even more in India, and I am not entirely sure that their interests are being represented by the agribusiness interests that dominate their Governments' national negotiating stance.</p>
	<p pid="c.162.0/4">The point that I want to emphasise&mdash;perhaps the Minister will say something about it&mdash;is what we are doing to ensure that in the negotiating round the representatives of the very poorest countries, which are mainly African countries, get a reasonable hearing. I was not in Hong Kong, but I have talked at length to those who were and it seems that the representatives of a number of poor African countries went to Hong Kong, attended the opening session, spent a great deal of time sitting around and talking to any non-governmental organisation that happened to pass by, and took little part in any negotiations but were invited in for the final collapse to learn that their needs had been ignored during the previous several weeks. It is not for us to create a colonial system to ensure that they are represented in a different way, but it is up to us as part of the negotiations to recognise that those countries have an even more legitimate voice than anyone else and should have been heard because this was supposed to be a development round. We should bear that in mind.</p>

	<p pid="c.164.0/1">I was with the hon. Gentleman in the Congo during the elections. Does he agree that whatever the outcome of a WTO round, the EU has it in its power to abandon export subsidies&mdash;to stop exporting produce that has been subsidised in a protected EU market? We have the ability to abandon that on our own and it does not have to form part of the negotiations. Let us hope that we get a deal and that it forms part of the negotiations, but if we do not, does he agree that our Government should be pressing for those exports subsidies to be abandoned unilaterally by the EU?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.165.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" speakername="Susan Kramer" colnum="165"  time="015:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0003.htm#06101253000263">
	<p pid="c.165.2/1">The Germans, too. The game has been played to protect aspects of the farm vote, or certain sectors of the manufacturing vote. It has not been played to take a stance because core and critical economic issues were at risk. Ultimately, that is a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.2/2">Like others who have spoken today, I must stand apart from the NGOs, which have sometimes viewed the collapse of the Doha round with some satisfaction. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1987" name="Ann McKechin">The hon. Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin)</phrase> tackled the NGOs' view that no deal is better than a bad deal, pointing out that we are looking at a formula for a regression to protectionism. That is echoed not only in the NGO world, but in developing countries. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1993" name="Malcolm Bruce">My right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase>, the chairman of the Select Committee on International Development, pointed out that it is a loss not only for the developed and developing world, but for free trade. The momentum and the arguments for the benefits of free trade have been brought into disrepute, and that puts at risk all who believe that an enterprise culture is essential to our economic development and that of some of the poorest countries on the planet. However, the NGOs' view is understandable.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.2/3">Thanks to CAFOD, I visited Geneva and talked to many of the leaders of the different G groups, the G30, the G90, the least developed countries group and the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries group. They were attempting to get involved in the negotiations that were part of the Doha round. During May and June, each leader told me that the issues on the table were those that mattered to the EU and the US. The agenda was theirs. Most discussions seem to have been about sensitive, state products, which were for developed not developing countries. Many discussions happened in what was thought to be a breakthrough context: the green room. However, it has no agenda and no public report follows. Typically, one representative member of the LDC group, or similar, is invited to attend, but has no status in the discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.2/4">One could see that what was initially sold as a developing-country round&mdash;including the contract whereby the developed world would finally tackle developing issues, promote trade in advance in developing countries, and move towards a trading network that would give them new opportunities&mdash;would be sidelined and tagged on the end of the agreement. As for the non-agricultural market access issues, which are huge and complex, no one had even started on them. That was in June and early July.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.2/5">I am an unapologetic free trader. In the early days of Doha we had the potential to set free trade as the ultimate goal while providing within it a structure and framework for developing countries to build their trading capacity so that they, as well as the developed countries, could use that free trade effectively. It is crucial to recognise that that goal would never have been achieved by Doha alone: with it there would have had to be aid for trade and a series of other agreements and structures.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.2/6">I urge the Government to examine whether they can revive the Doha trade round, but I do not have a great deal of hope. One of the worst possible outcomes would be a terribly compressed negotiation period and a repeat of the past experiences whereby the agenda of the US and the EU has dominated until the last 30 seconds and the development agenda dragged in only at the very end. The strategy must be to get from the US Government an extension of the fast-track process rather than to squeeze the Doha negotiation into the period between the end of the congressional elections and January. I believe that six months' notice must be given to Congress of a Bill using the fast-track process, so that would be near impossible.</p>
	<p pid="c.165.2/7">Our Government are said to have a special relationship with the United States and they have in many senses put themselves on the line for George Bush. Doha is surely a matter on which they ought to be able to get a Republican President to spend some political capital, at least after the congressional elections are over. I do not have a great deal of hope, but that is a strategy that I hope the Government will at least attempt to pursue.</p>

	<p pid="c.171.0/1">What the right hon. Gentleman may not be aware of&mdash;there is no reason why he should be&mdash;is that most of the crops that the farmers in my constituency grow are vegetables and are non-subsidised anyway. However, engaging with some of those subsidies would involve reform of the common agricultural policy and putting a greater emphasis on environmental sustainability&mdash;that is where we get into the complexities of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the discussion between the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham. There is some defence for subsidies in certain cases, whether for hill farmers or for environmental purposes, which might negate the impact that the right hon. Member for Leeds, West discussed.</p>
	<p pid="c.171.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman was also right to highlight the conflicts between the United States and the European Union and, in my view, the loss of sight of the initial purpose of the whole round, which was to help developing nations and the poor around the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.171.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1987" name="Ann McKechin">The hon. Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin)</phrase>, in a typically knowledgeable contribution on this issue, was concerned about the clock being turned back and highlighted the danger of protectionism. I agree with her that there is an increasingly prevalent view about the necessity for greater protectionism. I think that that is a function of a view that has become ingrained in many developing countries, according to which the developed world cannot trusted to follow through the development round. That comes out of the Uruguay round, which was detrimental to developing countries. Developing countries no longer believe that the developed world is genuinely interested in helping them to facilitate and grow their trade. She also quite rightly mentioned the importance of China in the discussions.</p>
	<p pid="c.171.0/4">The hon. Member for Islington, North highlighted the necessity of talking to the poor, and he is absolutely right. All too often we can become engaged in ministerial meetings and discussions at a high level, while forgetting about the need to listen to people on the ground, whether in the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique or elsewhere. He also quite rightly highlighted tariff escalation, the best example of which is the export of Chilean tomatoes into the United States. If Chile exports raw tomatoes, the tariff is 4 per cent. If it adds value and converts them into tomato ketchup, the tariff is 28 per cent. It cannot afford to do that, so the adding of value must take place in the United States. That is a total disgrace, and the World Trade Organisation needs to focus on such issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.171.0/5">The hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to hear that I did not agree with what was almost a promotion of protectionism on his part. His argument that the developed world had started behind protectionist barriers is somewhat disingenuous. I am sure that he knows his economic history; the developed world really started to accelerate in wealth creation and economic growth when protectionist barriers were removed and it started to trade freely throughout the world.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.172.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="172"  time="016:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0004.htm#06101253000278">
	<p pid="c.172.2/1">Tempted though I am, I do not want to get drawn into Japanese economic history, except to say that we Conservatives recognise the necessity for a transition period and sequencing to allow developing nations to grow their industrial bases. That is the key to their ultimately joining the international trading system and alleviating poverty far faster than they would by exporting agricultural produce alone.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">The hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> was right to mention economic partnership agreements. As the hon. Member for Glasgow, North said, yesterday she and I were at a meeting with African representatives who are very concerned about EPAs and the damage that they may cause their growing economies and prospects for job creation. The hon. Member for Richmond Park will be pleased to hear that her conversation with a representative of the Windward Islands was the same as the one that the hon. Member for Glasgow, North and I had with a representative from Barbados. Consideration has to be given to small island states and landlocked countries, which have problems generating international trade and getting their produce to markets.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/3">We Conservatives recognise that trade is the best way to lift people out of poverty. We agree with the World Bank that current trade restrictions are the biggest impediment to economic advancement and poverty reduction in the developing world. We support the Doha round and its specific development agenda, and, like other Members, we are extremely disappointed that it seems to have run into the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/4">We also acknowledge that the benefits of trade are numerous and varied; it contributes to faster growth, cheaper imports and new technologies and it enables Governments of developing nations to generate revenues and reinvest in infrastructure and essential public services.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/5">The British agenda is a cross-party one; collectively, we all want poverty in the developing world to be alleviated and the developing world to join the international trading community. As the hon. Member for City of York rightly pointed out, progress has been made on aid and debt, but there is an enormous way to go on trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/6">The Doha ministerial declaration clearly stated that</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/7" class="indent">&quot;International trade can play a major role in the promotion of economic development and the alleviation of poverty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/8">It promised to put the needs and interests of citizens of developing nations at its heart, but, as hon. Members have said, that seems to have been lost in the detail of the conversation and the negotiations that have taken place. It is now widely accepted that the millennium development goals will not be met in anything like the time scale envisaged without a successful and development-focused round of trade talks.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/9">We all know that things have stalled due to the intransigence of the European Union and the United States, which both need to bear responsibility for the failures. I should like to highlight one or two of their highly cynical moves.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/10">The US offered to end export subsidies by 2010, and that may appear very generous. However, it does not amount to much. The US provides very little by way of export subsidies; instead, it relies on export credits and food aid in kind. As I hope the Minister will be aware, food aid in kind has exactly the same impact as export subsidies, as it helps farmers find a market for their excess production.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/11">I have another example. The EU offered to cut payments to farmers by 70 per cent., contingent on other reductions from other major countries. That offer includes a 50 to 60 per cent. cut in the highest import tariffs and smaller cuts in lower tariffs, giving an average of 25 per cent. The EU also offered to end export subsidies, but did not offer a date. Again, on the surface that appears extremely generous, but if we look at the detail, we see that the EU will not have to reduce the amount of money that it pays to farmers by a single euro. The EU offered to end export subsidies, which comprise only 3.6 per cent. of the common agricultural policy. Such highly cynical moves need to be exposed for what they are&mdash;a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/12">I do not want to repeat the very good point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham when he highlighted the importance of duty-free and quota-free agreements, but I should like to make two additional points to build on what he said. First, as I am sure he is aware, the 3 per cent. that he mentioned is supposed to apply only for a transitional period. However, that transitional period is indefinite and will go on into perpetuity unless it is specifically stopped. What really strikes me is that 98 per cent. of Bangladeshi exports are in textile manufacturing. If the 3 per cent. figure were agreed to, that would have a significant detrimental impact on the Bangladeshi economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/13">As other Members have mentioned, steps must be taken on the special and sensitive product exemptions. The right hon. Member for Gordon cited the World Bank analysis that even if 2 per cent. of products from developed and 4 per cent. of products from developing countries came into that special or sensitive category, that would virtually eliminate the impact on poverty of the Doha agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/14">Many hon. Members have rightly mentioned the importance of aid for trade. The commitments on that are welcome. Will the Minister will say whether aid for trade will be within the umbrella of the already existing budgets, or in addition to them? It is essential to get over the supply-side constraints&mdash;whether they be in respect of electrification or water supply&mdash;to enable developing countries to generate the industrial base and wealth creation that they require. There is concern in the developing world that the international donor community's focus on the public services of health and education, worthy and important though they are, is distracting from the vital issue of putting more money into infrastructure projects.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/15">Other hon. Members have talked about NAMA&mdash;non-agricultural market access&mdash;on which an enormous amount more needs to be done. I have a quick question for the Minister. The ability to decide sequencing and transition on a case-by-case basis may be limited by existing WTO agreements. Will the Minister explain whether that is the case or whether there is sufficient flexibility to ensure appropriate transition phases and sequencing in market liberalisation?</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/16">Members have rightly mentioned benchmarking. There seems to be a contradiction, which is highlighted in the report, in what UK Ministers are saying about the importance of and necessity for benchmarking. It would be helpful if the Minister clarified the Government's view on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/17">There are significant other barriers that need to be overcome in respect of the infrastructure, roads and railways and financial conditions. Furthermore, Governments often follow short-sighted policies such as controlling interest rates below exchange rates, granting subsidised credits and keeping exchange rates artificially low. There is also the regulatory environment; there are serious barriers within African regions that I hope the Minister is trying to address.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/18">For example, the average tariff for importing agricultural produce from one African nation to another within sub-Saharan Africa is 34 per cent. It is 21 per cent. on other products. Those tariffs must be reduced, but in the context of ensuring that sufficient revenue goes into particular sub-Saharan African Governments' coffers to enable them to provide the public services and all the other enhancements that we want them to provide.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/19">Limited technological transfer needs to occur. Part of that comes out of the agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights. That needs to be more flexible, and there is a need for greater capacity on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/20">I shall conclude, as I want to give the Minister plenty of time to wind up. It has been said that the United States and Europe have perfected the art of arguing for free trade while simultaneously working for trade agreements that protect them against imports from developing countries. As they have in the past in other areas, the British Government must take the lead in urging the EU and the rest of the world to do more to reach an agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/21">The Minister may have gathered that there is some pessimism in the Chamber today, across political parties. As the agreement is an urgent priority, I ask for three things to be done. First, the Prime Minister should be persuaded during his last few months in office to become re-engaged in trying to drive an agreement through. Secondly, the UK should urge the EU to reform the common agricultural policy further and faster by abolishing all production-linked subsidies, by scrapping import tariffs and by removing all export subsidies. The Minister should consider the suggestion made by the hon. Member for City of York that that will happen with or without WTO agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.172.2/22">Thirdly, pressure must be put on the EU trade commissioner and member states to enable movement in the agricultural offer from the EU. That would enable other key players to make offers in manufacturing trade and services, thereby unlocking the Doha round. Failure successfully to conclude the round would be detrimental to the developing world, to free trade, to wealth creation and, ultimately and most importantly, to poverty alleviation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.179.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="179"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0005.htm#06101253000287">
	<p pid="c.179.1/1">A number of surveys and analyses have been undertaken by a variety of organisations on what the benefits might be of a good Doha round. For example, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development has suggested that a good outcome to the NAMA negotiations might generate gains of up to $100 billion. Similarly, the OECD has suggested that cutting tariffs and subsidies in agriculture and NAMA by 50 per cent. would generate gains of $44 billion. Research and analysis has considered possible scenarios for the Doha round, and they all show that the gains would be hugely significant in making progress towards the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.1/2">To return to the question of UK spending on aid for trade, we have made commitments before. Just before the IMF and World Bank annual meetings in Singapore, my right hon. Friends the Chancellor and the Secretary of State announced a new forecast for our spending on aid for trade, and we expect to see spending increase by some 50 per cent., to about $750 million, by 2010. That reflects a definition of aid that includes economic infrastructure, transport, energy, ports and communications, as well as support for capacity building work&mdash;the customs improvements&mdash;to which I referred.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.1/3">The second factor that offers an opportunity for progress&mdash;it would help the Doha round outcomes but it stands in its own right as it, too, will be crucial in ensuring that economic partnership agreements are development-friendly&mdash;is if we move forward on the rules of origin in trading arrangements. They are crucial for developing countries because they determine the real level of market access that an agreement can provide.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.1/4">Rules of origin made under the EU's current trading scheme are completely out of date, are complex and unnecessarily restrictive, and they impede developing countries in benefiting from the trade agreements. We want simpler and more liberal rules of origin, so that developing countries can source the materials that they need from other developing countries without losing their eligibility to trade those goods into our markets. We are determined to work with other member states in the months ahead to speed up the European Union's review and to seek implementation of the findings of that review, regardless of the state of progress on the Doha round.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North was the first to mention economic partnership agreements. Whatever happens on the Doha round, there is a separate track of negotiations for economic partnership agreements. Those negotiations have their own energy and deadlines, but they are nevertheless related to the Doha round because of their importance.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.1/6">Properly designed, EPAs have the potential to deliver genuine economic benefits and to contribute seriously to poverty reduction in African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. However, I must add a number of crucial caveats to that statement. The development potential of EPAs will be realised only if ACP countries make their own decisions on how and when to open their markets, in line with their development plans. That is the sequencing point referred to by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness. We will not support the forcing of liberalisation on developing countries through either trade negotiations or aid conditionality.</p>
	<p pid="c.179.1/7">We are also clear that three of the so-called Singapore issues&mdash;Government procurement, investment and competition&mdash;must be dropped from the EPA negotiations unless the negotiators of the ACP group specifically request their inclusion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-10-12c.180.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="180"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm061012/halltext/61012h0006.htm#06101253000291">
	<p pid="c.180.3/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows&mdash;he is an enthusiastic supporter of the European Union&mdash;the reality is that we are one of 25 member states. The negotiating position of the European Union is therefore achieved through negotiation and, in the end, a consensus position. We cannot just put our documents on the table and expect every other member of the European Union to roll over instantly and agree with our position. If only that were the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.3/2">However, we are using the document that we published in March 2005 on EPAs to make the casefor development-friendly economic partnership agreements. At the heart of what we think a development-friendly EPA should look like are more liberal and less complex rules of origin and, crucially, maximum flexibility as regards developing countries' own market opening. That means, in our view, duty-free and quota-free access to EU markets for all ACP countries, not just the least developed countries that currently have such access.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.3/3">There is no substitute for an ambitious and successful outcome to the Doha round. Considerable progress has been made, but there is undoubtedly more to do. We will use every opportunity that we have as a Government. A range of Ministries are engaged in discussion with our partners, from my Department right up to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. We will continue to press for change and the deal that we want. I hope that the pessimism, understandable as it is at this point, will in the end turn out to have been misplaced.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.3/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.180.3/5" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at two minutes to Five o'clock</p>
