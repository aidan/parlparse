<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.249.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="249"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h01.htm#51207h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.249.3/1">Not having expertise in housing, my attention was drawn to the housing benefit pathfinders for three reasons when they were announced in 2002. First, housing benefit issues featured in my Redcar constituency surgeries. The system appeared to be complex and administered slowly, and people were getting into trouble because things were taking so long. However, there is no particular reason to think that Redcar council is poor at dealing with such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/2">Secondly, I thought of what I shall call the impact of the system on South Bank&mdash;a wonderful community in the old-fashioned sense in my constituency. Everyone knows each other and, although they might not all love each other, there is a strong sense of belonging to the town. Victorian terraces were built adjacent to a nearby steelworks, which has long since closed down and been demolished, although I am happy to say that we still have a strong steel industry in the constituency. When someone dies or a void occurs for one reason or another in those Victorian terraces&mdash;people might move out of South Bank to get off-street parking and a garden, which, one guesses, are major features missing from such areas&mdash;that void is hard to fill. There is no obvious market for those houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/3">As the voids increase in number, the houses are bought in job lots by absent landlords. People in Redcar always say that the landlords live in London, from where all evil emanates. The houses are let on the sole condition that those who rent them are on housing benefit. The landlords have never seen the houses, let alone ever been to South Bank. They have no intention of maintaining the property and no interest in the conduct of the tenant, who often, since he is lives a hard-to-fill area, has probably made himself less than welcome elsewhere. No good from that syndrome comes to the people of that good old-fashioned community in South Bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/4">It is slightly ironic and very odd that the remoteness of the method of paying for rented accommodation&mdash;in housing benefit&mdash;seems to contribute to that. The money is paid by Redcar council and goes to London, many miles away, and neither the landlord nor the tenant has any interest in or connection with the community. I accept that the argument is slightly overextended, but I began to perceive housing benefit and how it is paid as capable of damaging such a community.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/5">The third reason for my attention being drawn to the project is that Middlesbrough was invited to be a pathfinder. Although hon. Members might think that it is famous for its football club, its real claim to fame is that it is next door to Redcar. Middlesbrough declined that opportunity, because the same voids exist on both sides of the border between Redcar and Middlesbrough, and it was feared that, if people in Middlesbrough received generous amounts of money in their hand, the effect on the rented market in Redcar could be damaging. There would have been a flight of tenants to the pathfinder area, so, for that reason, Middlesbrough&mdash;and, for all I know, others&mdash;declined that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/6">Although I followed that argument, I was sorry that I had no closer prospect of seeing how such a pilot scheme would work. However, others have been monitoring these schemes and it is possible to see some emerging passions. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I apologise, I mean patterns. There is not much passion on a wintry December morning in Westminster Hall.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/7">I should say for the sake of clarity that I am not a housing expert, but let me explain how the new local housing allowances work. Instead of an individual valuation being done on each property, the allowances are paid on the basis of the average rent in a broad rental market area. The average rent is calculated by the Rent Service&mdash;as I understand it, on the basis that each broad rental market area has at least two distinct residential areas. It takes off the lowest and the highest rents, and averages out the remaining rents. That is reviewed monthly and, in greater depth, quarterly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.251.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="251"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h01.htm#51207h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.251.1/1">Yes, I am aware that there have been some withdrawals and that there might be some potential withdrawals. I imagine that the situation with vulnerable tenants would be worse if we were considering this system in the social rented sector, which I will come to in due course. I acknowledge that what my hon. Friend refers to has been something of a feature, although things have not been as bad as was expected at first. The point is that if the money is no longer paid directly to the landlord, the landlord has less guarantee of its receipt and less certainty that his income stream will continue uninterrupted.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/2">The pilot schemes have been observed by the Department for Work and Pensions, Shelter, to which I am indebted for its report &quot;On the right path?&quot;, and Citizens Advice&mdash;I have had a chance to read its report, &quot;Early days&quot;. I am also indebted to the National Landlords Association, with which I had a conversation earlier this week. It represents about 7,500, mainly smaller, landlords. Of course, we are considering the pilot schemes about half way through the two years&mdash;they have been running for a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/3">The first thing that drew my attention to the schemes was the issue of complexity in processing and the delays in getting housing benefit. It appears that, broadly speaking, that has improved, although there are some staggering figures. In Edinburgh, it takes 38 days less to process a local housing allowance application than it took to process a housing benefit application before the pilots. In Leeds, however, processing seems to be taking 35 days more.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/4">There are some extraordinary results, but, by and large, it seems that the processing is being done more quickly. That is significant because delay can lead to debt and bank charges. It is important to have a bank account so that the money can be paid in and the direct debit can go out. That complexity needs addressing. For example, Post Office card accounts cannot have direct debits, so one has to get a proper bank account, although identification is sometimes a difficulty. It is a key point that the administration of that benefit should be done quickly, and there are signs that it has improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/5">I am told by the National Landlords Association that landlords tend to make a business decision about whether to rent in the housing benefit sector. If they decide to do so, they accept that they will get the rent monthly in arrears, not up front. However, they think it will be paid steadily once they have started to receive it. Clearly, therefore, processing delays will now become more of a factor in blocking landlords' willingness to go along with housing benefit tenants, because landlords have no ultimate guarantee. That guarantee was their payback for waiting for processing delays to work their way through in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/6">There is a default position: if a tenant is eight weeks in arrears with their local housing allowance paying the rent, it is resolved back to being paid into the hands of the landlord rather than those of the tenant. I have referred to the extent to which Leeds has increased the processing time&mdash;on average, it takes 69 days. That is very nearly 10 weeks, which means that, theoretically, anyone who applies for local housing allowance in Leeds will, by not having paid their eight weeks' rent, default before they even start. That is not a good way to start a new relationship with a landlord. That is worrying and it points up the fact that delays in administration must be conquered, although they are going in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/7">Next year, as a consequence of the Housing Act 2004, there will be one or more tenancy deposit schemes, which I imagine will become more important, granted that payment is not so easily guaranteed under local housing allowances. My understanding from Shelter is that the demand for tenancy deposits has increased from 66 to 75 per cent., presumably so that landlords might feel more reassured that at least that money is available. If the fear is of a flight of landlords&mdash;granted the lack of guarantee in the local housing allowance&mdash;it is important that tenancy deposit schemes are up and running quickly to reassure landlords and forestall any flight from the housing benefit sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/8">A tenancy deposit scheme does not make it any easier for a person who does not have any money to find the deposit, but I am clear about the fact that the homelessness directorate of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is encouraging local authorities to fund deposit guarantee schemes. They will be important in giving people the flexibility to move, following their local housing allowance. That will also give some support and encouragement to landlords. It is important to process quicker, and that the guarantees from a deposit scheme come into play fairly quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/9">There is already some evidence of flight by landlords from renting to the housing benefit sector. Shelter noted a slight upward trend in landlords advertising, &quot;No tenants on housing benefit.&quot; Its deeper research showed that there are more landlords who, although they do not advertise that they will not have people on housing benefit, do not take on such applicants. One landlord in four is not happy to take someone on housing benefit, apparently, but Shelter did not register that as representing a significant increase in the rate of refusal of housing benefit tenants as compared with the situation before the introduction of the local housing allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/10">The National Landlords Association says that there has been no flight from letting to housing benefit tenants within the organisation. However, Department for Work and Pensions research, published on <phrase class="date" code="">3 November</phrase>, pointed to a marked withdrawal by corporate landlords, whose numbers are small but whose portfolios are large. Individual landlords noted an increase in demand for letting, presumably as a consequence of the withdrawal of some corporate landlords. The general estimate across the three reports to which I have referred appears to be that about 10 per cent. less property is available for the housing benefit sector. That would be serious if it were replicated nationwide.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/11">I want to discuss another element of that. Something that might help to resist further flight by landlords is the injection of better choice into how local housing allowance can be used. At the moment, it must be paid to the tenant and there is no real choice of having it paid direct to the landlord, although there is the default position that I mentioned: if someone has not paid their rent for eight weeks, it is automatically redirected to the landlord.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/12">There is a test of vulnerability, however, and if someone is vulnerable due to some external factor, or has a history of not paying rent or already has debt, the money can be paid direct to the landlord if the local authority so certifies. However, that removes an element of choice, and because part of the point of the scheme is to give people choice and to make them exercise responsibility over their finances, it seems incompatible that tenants do not have the choice of having money paid direct from the local authority to the landlord. Perhaps that should be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/13">Of course, tenants must be protected from there being conditions in the leasing agreement requiring their rent to be paid direct, and we must resist any prospect of landlords pressurising tenants into having the rent paid direct, but it is likely that that could be achieved, perhaps through a balancing mechanism established with the local authority. We picture landlords as dreadful people, but that is often completely false, and tenants and landlords have a close relationship and are on good terms. The ability to guarantee the landlord the rent on the basis of personal choice, sanctioned by the local authority, might further empower tenants and, in addition, give landlords some guarantee and perhaps impede any further flight.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/14">I understand that a growing sector of landlordism these days consists of relatively young people who buy a property to let, considering it their security, rather than paying into a pension fund. In such circumstances, if there is no guarantee under the local housing allowance that the rental income will be paid regularly, the landlord's mortgage may be undermined and they might be put in real difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/15">At the moment, if someone cannot pay rent regularly because they are vulnerable, it can be paid direct. If someone will not pay, or just does not want to pay, there is no way of having rent paid direct to the landlord. I am indebted to the Library for putting together a press pack for this debate, which contains a good deal of information. It refers in particular to the Grimsby area, where some people allegedly spent their local housing allowance on drugs, beer or holidays in Spain, although I do not know why there is a reference to Spain in particular. Such things will happen from time to time, and tenants are more vulnerable if they are susceptible to temptation of that sort, but if payments were made direct, at least they would not be without a roof when they returned from Spain. The element of choice needs to be looked at and perhaps adjusted in the mutual interest of tenants and landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/16">Rent can be paid direct now if someone proves their own vulnerability, which is a curious notion. It is self-evident that the most vulnerable people will be least able to demonstrate their vulnerability. Requiring someone who is vulnerable but completely compos mentis and together to go to their local authority to try to prove that they are sufficient of a fool that they cannot manage their own rent is also curious. The test of vulnerability is odd and needs to be reconfigured.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/17">There is a report in the Citizens Advice research on the project of someone who wanted to have her rent paid direct and to admit that she was vulnerable because, historically, she had been unable to manage her finances well. However, she was too afraid to do that because she thought that social services might use it as leverage and a reason to take her child away. One can imagine how such concern could arise. That shows that better criteria are necessary if rent is to be paid direct, if that is what people want and it is in everybody's interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/18">The new system does not appear to have caused significant rent inflation, although it seems fairly rational to say that there should be some rent inflation if the local housing allowance is worked out as the average rental and is higher than rents that are being demanded. Some landlords have increased their rents to local housing allowance level, but there do not seem to have been significant affordability issues for tenants&mdash;although I hear what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> says about a pathfinder he observed&mdash;and, according to the reports, homelessness does not appear to have increased. There has been a 93 per cent. take-up of bank accounts, which must be a good step towards financial inclusion for a lot of formerly excluded people.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/19">This scheme has been well resourced. The local housing allowances have been decent and, in many cases, the pathfinders have also involved contracts with advice agencies such as citizens advice bureaux&mdash;smoothing the way with landlords, explaining why there are delays, and helping applicants to get their processing done and to get a bank account. Without that, it seems highly likely that the scheme would have been significantly less successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/20">With those few adjustments, the scheme is broadly to be welcomed. I am interested to know what the Minister and other hon. Members think of such possible ways of preventing a disastrous flight from the supply of housing. Over time, I hope, people will become more responsible with their money due to this mechanism, although I do not know how the problem will evolve.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/21">That sector involves some 500,000 people on housing benefit; the social rented sector involves another 3.5 million people. I understand that there is an intention at least to consult on, or perhaps to pilot, rolling out local housing allowances in the social rented sector. I am interested to hear what the Minister has to say, because there is a much higher proportion of vulnerable people in the social rented sector. Pensioners, for example, are vulnerable for a range of reasons&mdash;it is not that they are profligate, particularly&mdash;and as people age and become weaker and less able to manage their affairs, it is key that they should not fall into debt for any such reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/22">There are a lot of vulnerable people generally in the social rented sector, and major landlords in it fear that the lack of a guarantee could compromise rental income streams for registered social landlords, which would increase borrowing costs over the long term and perhaps cause difficulty. There may be stronger reservations about rolling out the scheme into the social rented sector, and I would be pleased to know what others think.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/23">In my much-loved South Bank in the Redcar constituency, a lot of people who own houses are poor none the less, but they get no significant support with their housing costs. They certainly do not get such a benefit. Is not that an anomaly, particularly in such a setting, where people do not have a great deal of capital value protecting them? In derelict housing market areas such as the one I have described, capital values just collapse, so it is not as if people have property that they could realise in order to support themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.1/24">I broadly welcome the local housing allowances. I hope that they will be rolled out soon, and that Middlesbrough and Redcar will be included. For the reason that Middlesbrough chose not to become a participant in a pathfinder, it is important that there is some systematic way of rolling the schemes out so that availability in one local authority does not damage the housing market in an adjacent authority.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.255.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="255"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h01.htm#51207h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.255.2/1">We are grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> for raising this subject this morning. She said that she is not a housing expert, but, if I may say so, she did jolly well. I am not a housing expert, but as I was a Minister with responsibility for housing for 10 years, I was one&mdash;or I certainly hope that I was. It is residual memories of that experience that prompted my interest in this morning's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/2">The hon. and learned Member for Redcar is right to raise this subject, because many in this Chamber know that in the early 1990s an apparently innocuous change to housing benefit was passed and was implemented on <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> of a given year. Shortly afterwards, our postbags were full of complaints and the whole system had to be revisited. In a moment, I will say a word or two about a reform that has some comparison with the one we are discussing: the community charge. I put down a warning to Ministers about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/3">This debate is being responded to by a Minister from the Department for Work and Pensions, whose presence I welcome. There is inevitably some tension between the DWP's view and that of Housing Ministers when it comes to housing policy, particularly when the payment for housing policy comes not from the Housing Minister's budget but from someone else's. I hope that the Minister will be able to say that he speaks as one with his colleagues in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, who have responsibilities for housing policy. There have been tensions in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/4">I want to pick up a point that the hon. and learned Lady raised at the end of her remarks about the Government's intention to roll this scheme out to registered social landlords. The arguments for doing so are weaker than they are in relation to the private rented sector, because extortionate rents are not being underpinned and there is no need to require people to shop around.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/5">I hope that the Minister will consult those who provide the funding for housing associations&mdash;the Council of Mortgage Lenders and other institutions. They are interested in the cash flow of housing associations, to whom they advance funds. If, for the sake of argument, there was evidence that the scheme might slow down the cash flow and have some impact on bad debts, that would not stop them lending to housing associations, but it would affect the rate at which that lending was made. That would in turn have an impact on the output of social housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/6">The Joseph Rowntree Foundation pointed out last week that fewer new social houses are currently being built than at any time since the 1920s. I do not think anybody would want to introduce a policy that further reduced the supply of social rented housing. I hope that the Minister will give an assurance that if the Government are to roll out the scheme to the RSLs, they will consult mortgage lenders and others to ensure that it does not damage the supply of such private rented housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/7">I have had informal consultations with the housing association in my constituency, Testway, which is a large-scale voluntary transfer organisation. I discussed the matter with tenants and the housing association. They are concerned about t the impact if the policy were to be rolled out to social landlords. I agree with what the hon. and learned Lady just said about the potential disadvantages if that were to be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/8">I mentioned a moment ago that the policy had something in common with the community charge. Before the community charge was rolled out in England, which, I hasten to say, I voted against, those on low incomes had 100 per cent. of their rates paid direct to the local authority. They were not troubled by the rates. When the community charge was introduced, they were asked to pay roughly 10 per cent. They got that through their benefit and what they received was based on the average.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/9">The theory was that that would act as an incentive to vote for prudent local authorities, so that the average that they received left them in pocket if they had a prudent local authority. The policy was not a thundering success. It failed mainly because it was regressive. People should not forget the administrative chaos that accompanied the introduction of the community charge. The money was paid through their benefit to people on low incomes&mdash;they got their 10 per cent.&mdash;but it did not find its way to the local authority, because it had other priorities and there were lots of bad debts. There is a risk of that particular feature of the community charge being replicated in this particular social policy unless precautions are taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/10">Another point I want to make is that if one listens to the policy of the Government, one would think they were keen on choice. In their education and health policies, parents' choice and patients' choice are key elements. However, this policy removes choice, as the hon. and learned Lady said. People will have no choice. Instead of people opting to have their rent paid directly to their landlord, the money will be given to them, unless they can prove that they are vulnerable. To that extent, this sits uneasily with the vocabulary of the Government, which is pro-choice, because this is a social reform that removes choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/11">The hon. and learned Lady also mentioned the potential impact on the supply of private rented housing. One of the housing policy successes of the past 15 years has been the revival in private renting. There has been all-party agreement on the tenure form&mdash;the assured tenancy. The percentage of housing stock that is privately rented has shot up; speaking from memory, I would say that it has risen from about 5 per cent. to well into double figures. It would be sad if that revival were arrested because a change in the way housing benefit was paid led to private landlords withdrawing from the market, particularly in respect of the supply of houses to those on low incomes who for whatever reason are not a priority with local authorities, but who can currently get good quality accommodation from the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/12">The community charge ended with the downfall of the then Prime Minister. I do not know whether the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is hatching a sinister plot to bring forward the departure of the present Prime Minister by steaming ahead with a social policy that will have the same outcome, but he and his colleagues would be well advised to think it through before they steam ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/13">My final point comes from helpful analysis by the citizens advice bureaux. They made a clear recommendation about the rate for the under-25s, who have a lower rate in respect of entitlement. Is the Minister minded to accept that recommendation? Does he smile sympathetically on it?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.2/14">To pick up a point of the hon. and learned Lady, a lot of resources went into the pathfinders. I expect that that helped to minimise the damaging fallout from the policy. Unless the same amount of resources is invested in the roll-out of this scheme, and unless the allowances are pitched at a fairly generous rate, the outcome now will be worse than in the pathfinders. If the Treasury has anything to do with this&mdash;I am sure it will&mdash;it will be anxious that the average rate is not pitched at too high a level. There will also be some drift, as the hon. and learned Lady said, and in respect of local rents what is the average will become the floor. What is the Minister's reaction to the CABs' sensible recommendations? Will he give an assurance that if and when this scheme is rolled out, the CAB recommendations will be an integral part of the roll-out policy?</p>

	<p pid="a.257.0/1">It is always an hon<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">our to follow the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, who spoke with obvious authority and experience as a former Housing Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> for securing the debate, and I am grateful for being allowed to speak briefly in it. Her constituency is next door but one to mine&mdash;just a brief hop over the Tees&mdash;and the experiences of her constituents in Redcar are similar to those of mine in Hartlepool. I want to touch on two areas that she mentioned&mdash;the scheme's effect on antisocial behaviour, and the need for financial inclusion and the subsequent education of people to help to promote that&mdash;although I will not be able to deal with them with her assurance and eloquence.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/3">The housing benefit pathfinder scheme promotes fairness, simplicity and transparency in the benefit system. It promotes financial responsibility for the tenant on housing benefit, but&mdash;this is crucial&mdash;also imposes a degree of responsibility on the landlord, which the traditional housing benefit does not. There is a requirement under the pathfinder scheme to make the landlord, for his or her own financial gain, ensure that the housing benefit has been received from the tenant and to chase the matter up if the rent has not been paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/4">In my constituency, as in Redcar and many other northern industrial towns, decent areas have been destroyed by absentee landlords who do not know where Hartlepool is, let alone where in the town their particular property is located. Those landlords could not care less about the social repercussions of putting&mdash;let me be frank&mdash;antisocial scum in an area, thereby blighting the lives of decent residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/5">I hold weekly constituency surgeries. Last Friday, a couple came to see me. They had lived in their property for some 40 years; they had raised their children there, and they now enjoyed their grandchildren coming to visit. In the past two years, private absentee landlords&mdash;from where, I am not certain, although I am tempted to say &quot;that there London&quot;&mdash;have bought the properties on either side of the couple's house. Now, day after day and night after night, this decent man and woman have to put up with 24-hour drug-dealing, noise and threats of violence. Accompanying that is the terrifying ordeal of their neighbour banging the walls all night and threatening to kill them, although they have not even met.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/6">This couple now want to move out of their home of 40 years, because they are frightened of possible repercussions should they complain about these antisocial tenants. They are not the only ones. I could mention a range of areas in the centre of Hartlepool, populated by good people who wish to improve their community by participating in such groups as the West End and Hartwell residents' associations, but whose areas are being damaged when a thoughtless and often absentee landlord puts&mdash;again, let me be frank&mdash;all manner of yobs into their property. That is not right.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/7">I passionately believe that landlords have a responsibility to ensure that their tenants respect their neighbours and the community in which their property is rented. I want the pathfinder scheme to be extended to my constituency, so that those committing criminal and antisocial behaviour get it into their heads that they cannot go around taking the mick out of decent people&mdash;or worse, making those people fear for their personal safety&mdash;but that if they do, they stand a good chance of being evicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/8">Should the landlord be forced to take a greater role and assume more responsibility for getting the rent, that will have a positive impact. I know that residents in those areas of Hartlepool that I mentioned would like the landlord to be required to visit their property to receive rent, checking that the property is in good repair and that no antisocial behaviour is taking place. I accept that that may be impractical in many cases, but I see benefits to the community even when a direct debit or standing order is used. The tenant can stop that payment if financial resources are tight. The landlord therefore needs to maintain some awareness of the tenant and his or her behaviour, which has not previously been the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/9">I want to convey that main point, but will finish by saying that we need to provide additional financial education for tenants participating in the pathfinder scheme. The aims of the local housing allowance, as outlined by the Government, are generally to be supported. The scheme simplifies complex housing benefit regulations and, importantly, provides an element of fairness, which had hitherto been lacking.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/10">Tenants in the same area and in similar circumstances, for example, receive the same amount of housing benefit based on a set amount, rather than the amount of rent paid. Crucially, the tenant in receipt of the reformed local housing allowance is also provided with some personal responsibility. It should be made clear that the payment that enables a person to live in a property is not plucked out of fresh air, but comes with a degree of financial control and responsibility. That should help the person, where applicable, to make the transition away from benefits altogether and into employment, which is good for the individual and good for the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/11">I am gladdened by the findings in the DWP evaluation, which show that most pathfinder claimants have a bank account or have been able to open one. Overall, six in 10 claimants who are paid housing benefit directly under the local housing allowance are paid via an automatic system of some sort. The pathfinder evaluation also demonstrates impressive financial control from tenants: across all pathfinder schemes, nine out of 10 remained up to date with their rent for about 10 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/12">Nevertheless, I wonder whether the evaluation findings contradict all other known evidence regarding financial inclusion. As my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar pointed out, being out of work and on benefits enormously increases the risk of financial exclusion. Some 25 per cent. of those people&mdash;at the poorest end of society&mdash;have no access to a current account. I was a member of the Consumer Credit Bill Standing Committee, and I am aware that the poorest in society are, for example, excluded from discounts for direct debit payments because they have no bank account, while affordable short-term credit is replaced by money sharks offering interest rates of 100 or even 1,000 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/13">Being financially excluded can cost, and the most deprived pay the price. That is why there is a genuine need for substantial financial education for those tenants participating in the pathfinder scheme to ensure that the risk of financial exclusion and deprivation is minimised. In general, I welcome the pathfinder scheme. It is fair, it simplifies the system, and it promotes responsibility on the part of the landlord and the tenant. Despite the teething troubles that my hon. and learned Friend so eloquently pointed out, I am keen for the scheme to be implemented in Hartlepool as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.0/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Shelter with regard to this restriction. He will also know that the CAB has said that it is regrettable that the research evaluating the impact of the LHA to date has not said anything about the impact on under-25s. It would be useful if the Department published research on that. Does the hon. Gentleman agree with that view, which is evidently a sensible one?</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.261.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07b.261.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.261.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="261"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h01.htm#51207h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.261.1/1">I agree with that point. Publication of more research on the impact of the single room rent on under-25s and how it has worked in the pathfinder areas would be useful. It is an important part of the debate and one that the Bill on reforming housing benefit should take forward, to provide greater fairness for under-25s.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/2">The hon. and learned Member for Redcar also referred to deposit schemes&mdash;schemes to support people making deposits. Raising a deposit can be a major barrier to people moving into rented accommodation. I suppose that part of the idea behind the LHA is that the landlord need not necessarily know that someone is on housing benefit, but if they are not able to raise a deposit, that is clearly impossible. Supporting or encouraging rent deposit schemes is a sensible way forward, and I was pleased to hear the hon. and learned Lady's comments about the ODPM encouraging such schemes. I would be grateful if the Minister would reinforce or amplify that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/3">On complexity, it seems that the LHA can speed up the processing time for private tenant claims. However, it is also the case&mdash;this seemed to be confirmed by the evidence that we heard in Lewisham&mdash;that the time taken to make checks on vulnerability can, for those people who seem to have the status of being vulnerable or who suggest that they are vulnerable, counteract the savings in assessment time.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/4">The DWP evaluation found no significant improvement on error and fraud as a result of the change to the LHA. Rent-based fraud seems the most likely to be tackled, but claimants keep the difference between the LHA and their rent if there is any. Savings, in that sense, are unlikely. We welcome the announcement in this week's pre-Budget report that more funding will be provided to reduce housing benefit fraud by reviewing or visiting at least 50 per cent. of claimants each year. Will the Minister tell us what the overall funds are? When will benefit authorities find out how much they are likely to get in future years so that they can start planning how to undertake this work?</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/5">A further question concerns how difficult it is for claimants to understand what they will receive. The LHA should make that simpler, although there is still a degree of complexity to do with the number of rooms, which particular broad market area someone lives in and so on. I welcome reports from the pathfinder authorities suggesting that claimants find understanding their likely entitlement much easier.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/6">The question of the incentives to work or otherwise is an important one. It crosses the whole gamut of welfare and benefit reform that the Government are proposing. Removing disincentives to work and increasing incentives to work through the benefits system is an important and worthwhile objective. The DWP website suggests:</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Greater certainty about what in-work benefit they could receive is expected to help tenants bridge the gap between being out of work and taking a job.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/8">So far, there is little evidence in support of the DWP's claim in the evaluation from the pathfinder areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/9">One of the major disincentives in the housing benefit and council tax benefit system is the tapers: there is a 65 per cent. taper for housing benefit and a 20 per cent. taper for council tax benefit, leading to an overall benefit withdrawal rate of 85 per cent. In my experience, from people coming to my surgeries, the rate at which those benefits are withdrawn acts as a significant disincentive to work. Will the Minister be addressing that issue in any proposals to be introduced?</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/10">Encouraging people to take more personal responsibility for their own finances and for paying their own rent is a laudable objective. Clearly, as has been said, the ending of direct payments to landlords in the vast majority of cases, except where vulnerability is an issue, is perhaps the most controversial part of the reforms. It is opposed by several organisations. In Lewisham, there has been a 20 per cent. increase in the amount of unrecovered overpayments due to direct payments to landlords. While increasing responsibility and financial management skills is an excellent aim, which we support, it is still unclear whether the pros outweigh the cons in this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/11">Some pathfinder boroughs are accepting any vulnerability requests without making checks, as a way of speeding up the processing of vulnerability claims. That may well be the best approach for authorities to adopt in practice, but I would be grateful if the Minister could describe the rules for the best way of dealing with vulnerability claims in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/12">I want to raise one or two other issues, first with regard to the broad rental market areas. There are concerns in some areas that it is still a blunt tool, and that more account must be taken of local variations. So far in the pathfinder areas, we have not seen any sudden increase in rents to match local housing allowance levels, which was one of the fears. However, there is evidence that some stakeholders see signs of it happening through a creeping effect. Given that the LHA is based on market rents, the effect could be to push rents and the LHA higher over time. I hope that that will be carefully monitored. The Minister may want to say something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/13">As the hon. and learned Member for Redcar said, a number of private landlords were reported in the Department's evaluation as saying that they should take on fewer housing benefit claimants, believing that payments to tenants under the LHA would lead to rent arrears. It is worth noting that that is the landlords' perception; there is not a great deal of evidence to support it. However, following a national roll-out of the LHA, what action does the Minister propose to take to prevent that response from landlords?</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/14">There is an issue about the high level of failure by local authorities to make interim payments within 14 days. That failure is unfair on claimants, and it can lead to debt and homelessness. The Government must ensure that there is sufficient sanction in place for those authorities that fail to make interim payments, so that people are not left for a long period&mdash;perhaps while a vulnerability claim is being assessed&mdash;without any payment whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/15">The question of the funding of the roll-out of the LHA has also been raised. Shelter suggested that the &pound;180 million allocated by the Treasury for national roll-out is not enough. Will the Minister confirm that that figure is correct? Will he also describe how that funding will compare with that received by the pathfinder authorities, once it is shared throughout the country? Was the figure derived from the DWP's evaluation of costs required by pathfinder authorities, or was it just what could be squeezed out of the Treasury?</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/16"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> made the point about the conflicting priorities of the Treasury and the Department. If the roll-out happens nationally, it will be important to ensure that funding is made available to deal with some of the problems that have arisen, and not least to continue the funding for advice services. They have been running with citizens advice bureaux and so on in pathfinder areas, and in Lewisham and in other areas they have been valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/17">Will the Minister confirm that although there are no firm plans to roll-out the LHA to the social rented sector throughout the country, consideration is being given to a pilot? Will he confirm that there will be no roll-out to the social rented sector throughout the country without further primary legislation or a debate and a vote in the House of Commons? That is clearly a matter of concern to housing associations and other landlords in the social rented sector.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.264.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="264"  time="010:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h01.htm#51207h01_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.264.2/1">It sounds pretty much like a collapse to me, and the reason for it is the one that the hon. and learned Lady gave. There were worries that tenants would come in from outside to take advantage of the relatively favourable terms of the scheme. That alerts us to a point that was made by my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire, which is that, in all areas of legislation, as many of us know from other areas, there is such a thing as the law of unintended consequences. The pathfinders must be examined extremely carefully because&mdash;I do not say this in an unhelpful spirit&mdash;they may bring about unexpected consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/2">It seems reasonable in practice to try to simplify the system by paying a standard allowance that will allow tenants to shop around in search of rents. That is certainly the view that we expressed when the pilots were first announced. As the Minister knows, Beveridge called a chapter of his report &quot;The Problem of Rent&quot; and debated whether rents should be subsidised individually or whether there should be standard allowances. In fact, he came down in favour of standard allowances, so the Government are trying to get back to the original spirit of Beveridge. However, theory is only theory. What really matters is the practice and that is where the evidence from the pathfinders is a bit ambiguous.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/3">The Minister will have read the Citizens Advice report, &quot;Early days: CAB evidence on the Local Housing Allowance&quot;, which the hon. and learned Member for Redcar and others alluded to. Citizens Advice states that the</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/4" class="indent">&quot;report raises a number of concerns which must be addressed before the reforms are rolled out nationally&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/5">Shelter is concerned about aspects of the new scheme and the National Landlords Association has specific reservations. Many of those reservations have been aired this morning, but perhaps only one is overwhelming. It falls into two interlocking parts.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/6">First, if the scheme were rolled out nationally, some vulnerable tenants would spent some of the money that is paid up front, as the hon. and learned Member for Redcar said. Landlords would not get their money, legal action and homelessness would follow, and landlords would withdraw property from the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/7">Secondly, that outcome could be avoided if the Government were to replicate the apparently favourable terms of the local housing allowances: generous standard rates and the provision of, for example, money advice services, which have been a feature of local housing allowances. The problem for the Department and the Minister is that that might be too expensive for the Treasury to bear. That is the dilemma with which the Minister is wrestling.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/8">The Citizens Advice report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/9" class="indent">&quot;We question whether the procedure is sufficiently robust to cope with a national roll out&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/10">and a previous Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, was sceptical about the practicality of rolling out the pathfinders for broadly those reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/11">We were promised in the Queen's Speech in May</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/12" class="indent">&quot;legislation to reform support for housing costs.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class="date" code="2005-05-17">17 May 2005</phrase>; Vol. 672, c. 5.]</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> referred to that. On <phrase class="date" code="">18 May</phrase>, the Bill was described in no less a source than <i>The Guardian </i>as &quot;an early priority&quot;. So where is the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/14">We need to step back for a moment and look at what is in the Department's in-tray. There is the debate about the Turner report. Clearly, there is disagreement between Turner and the Department, and the Treasury. There is the debate about incapacity benefit. The Prime Minister's Office put forward eyebrow-raising proposals about vouchers, which, apparently, are being resisted by the Department. There is the debate about the Child Support Agency, which the Prime Minister has said is unsustainable in its present form. The Department has a lot in its in-tray.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/15">How big a priority for the Department is rolling out pathfinders, and to what degree does it think that such a roll-out is practicable? I hope that the Minister can give some guidance about that. Do the Government plan to introduce a Bill shortly after the Christmas recess, or have they concluded that more evidence from the pathfinders is necessary? One point that it would be helpful for the Minister to clear up is whether any research will be done on the second wave of pathfinders, or whether results from the first wave will continue to be evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/16">The Department's initial research on the impact of the LHA in the pathfinder authorities was overwhelmingly positive, but Shelter's monitoring of the impact suggests that the evidence is more mixed. Does the Minister agree with that assessment? Can he guarantee, if the scheme is rolled out nationally, that tenants who receive standard allowances will receive the same assistance that has been available in pathfinder areas, such as the advice services that were referred to earlier? What implications does that have for cost? When will the promised consultation on applying the pathfinder model to social housing be published? There have been reports that it will be issued at the same time as the Bill. Can the Minister give us some guidance on that and rule out the possibility that the Bill will apply to social housing as well as the private rented sector? Clearly, that would clearly be premature.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/17">The overall challenge posed by housing benefit is daunting. In the last Work and Pensions Question Time, it was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who was here earlier, that</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/18" class="indent">&quot;housing benefit regulations consist of 967 pages, five parts, six schedules and 40 statutory instruments.&quot;&mdash;[Official Report, House of Commons, <phrase class="date" code="">28 November</phrase> 2005; Vol. 440, c. 12.]</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/19">The right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside described housing benefit as &quot;a nightmare&quot;. The cost of administering appeals has risen in each of the past three years, as I found out recently from a written answer, and is now more than &pound;2.3 billion. The number of appeals has risen in each year since the appeals service assumed responsibility in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/20">The Department has a target to reduce fraud and error from its 2002&ndash;03 levels by 25 per cent. by March 2006. When I asked the Minister during a recent debate on fraud and error whether he was confident that the Government would hit that target, he was unable to confirm that they would. Perhaps he will say something about that today.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/21">Choice is one of the key words of this debate. The Government argue correctly that the pathfinders extend choice, because paying the allowance at a certain rate enables recipients of housing benefit to shop around. Clearly, that is what is meant by &quot;choice&quot;. However, as the hon. and learned Member for Redcar and my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire said, the pathfinders do not give choice in one crucial respect, which is that the tenant does not have the choice to receive housing benefit direct or have it paid to the landlord. As other hon. Members have said, if the Government want to build on the choice principle, they could go in that direction, particularly since passing the vulnerability test, to which the hon. and learned Member for Redcar referred, is rather complex.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/22">The Government want to simplify the system, which they are doing by looking to pay the flat rate, but they are building in other complexities by making special arrangements to assess vulnerability. As the hon. and learned Lady said, many tenants will not want to approach the authorities and say, &quot;Hey! I'm vulnerable. I can't manage my own finances.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.264.2/23">Perhaps the Minister will say whether it is possible that, rather than introducing a Bill, he will want to see a further roll-out of pathfinders.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.2/1">This has been a good and informed debate, prompted by the excellent contribution by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>, who does not describe herself as an expert but who sounded perilously close to being one. The subsequent contributions were also of a high calibre and rightly so, because this is an important subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/2">It might be helpful if I clarified where we are with the proposal, because almost everyone who has spoken has touched on that. Pathfinders have been running for a couple of years in some cases, although some were initiated much more recently, and we are regularly evaluating their experiences. To date, my Department has published seven documents covering different aspects of that evaluation. We are doing this with a high degree of transparency. A lot of people are closely following the policy as it evolves.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/3">We have said many times that the evaluation of the pathfinders' experience will continue into next year, so we will be issuing further information as we go forward, learning from their experience. We also made it clear in the Queen's Speech that during this Session we would introduce legislation to deal with the reform of housing benefit. The context of where we are should be pretty clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/4">As well as doing our own independent evaluation of the pathfinders, we are listening carefully to the representations coming to us from all other interested bodies and organisations. I pay careful attention to publications issued by Shelter and the citizens advice bureaux. We are listening carefully to the landlords organisations, too. As well as my listening to those representations and taking on board what is being said, the pathfinders are receiving information from the organisations in their localities. Extensive information and assessments are coming to us and it is important that we consider everything that we learn. Before moving to a national scheme, we must be sure that we have made the most of the pathfinders.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/5">I say on behalf of the Department that I am extremely grateful to the authorities that agreed to do the pathfinder work for us. It is invaluable. I meet them regularly and visit those areas in which they operate. They are doing a high quality job and it is proving informative for us as Ministers as we move towards setting up a scheme for wider implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/6">Many points have been made in the debate. I shall respond to some specific issues that have been raised, after which I shall deal with a few others more substantively because they were common to all contributions. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar was right to emphasise the problems with housing benefit. None of us would start from here if we wanted to come up with a scheme to support people in meeting their housing costs. The system is incredibly complicated and we must move towards simplification.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/7">My hon. and learned Friend asked whether there was a risk of a flight of landlords. The evidence from the pathfinders showed that that was not the case. Many landlords organisations were concerned about such matters at the outset and we have monitored the position carefully as the pathfinders have been rolled out. I wish to share with her the views that have been expressed recently by Blackpool, a pathfinder authority, about potential landlord flight to which she and other hon. Members have referred. A few weeks ago, its newsletter stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/8" class="indent">&quot;After the initial procedural changes at the point of going live with the LHA, we are content that our current practices are working well, and we even received praise by a number of landlords at a recent landlord training event. This is a massive turnaround as these same landlords were very sceptical about LHA when we first started talking to them in the summer of 2003. We have proved, that if you listen to landlord concerns and put procedures in place to reassure them then landlord confidence can be maintained.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/9">That is an encouraging response. It has been echoed by other pathfinder authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/10">My hon. and learned Friend then referred to worries about the element of the local housing allowance that concentrates on paying the benefit direct to the tenants, not the landlords. She encouraged us to return to the position that pertains whereby housing benefit is paid directly to the landlord. We want to get away from that because we are encouraging personal responsibility. It is part of the welfare reform programme, and another aspect of the reform that I have been monitoring carefully is its impact on those who had their housing benefit paid directly to their landlord, but who now, having switched to an LHA, receive it themselves. They are now responsible for ensuring that the rent is paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/11">We hoped that the system would have a beneficial impact, and evidence has shown that it has. We have published some research that merits careful examination. We asked people who were not in work, but whose housing benefit was being paid direct to the landlord, about their expectation of an eventual return to work. We found that a low level of anticipation that they would return to work within the next year or so. We took a similar group with a similar period of unemployment who lived in an area where we were piloting the LHA. They were receiving that allowance and had taken on the responsibility for managing their own finances and for making sure that their rent was paid. We asked them the same question: what was their expectation of seeking a return to work in the near future? A very substantially higher number said that they were seeking such a return.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/12">If there is to be this welfare effect of the reform, we must welcome it. It has been suggested that we should switch back to a situation where the tenants' relationship is entirely passive, and where they are not involved in handling the money or in taking responsibility for the payment of the rent. If we were to return to that situation, we might pay a price in terms of them not making the move of coming out of welfare and thinking of returning to the world of work. That is an important aspect of the reform, and I do not want us to lose it. I am trying to reassure my hon. and learned Friend that the early indications are that the impact of the reform is beneficial.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. and learned Friend for those comments, because I see that she is tying this matter to the issue of vulnerability, and to the current provision whereby we can switch back to making the payment direct to the landlord in instances of vulnerability. Let me reassure her and other Members who spoke on the matter that we are looking at this aspect very carefully in the evaluations, and I am receiving reports from the pathfinder areas specifically on how the vulnerability test is working. We are learning about that matter from our experience in the pathfinder areas. I will try to deal with the other points that my hon. and learned Friend raised more substantively, because other Members also raised them.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">The right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> took us on a trip back down memory lane to the great poll tax disaster. That is not easily forgotten. He also asked if my Department was in sync with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. It is of course true that responsibility for housing issues crosses the two Departments&mdash;that is certainly the case when the element of supporting the cost of housing is included. Some housing responsibilities lie with the ODPM and others lie with my Department. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that the two Departments are working closely toge<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">ther. My hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> raised the issue of tackling antisocial behaviour, and our two Departments work jointly on that all the time. Other points raised were to do with choice, which I have already touched on, and with the single room rent, which I want to deal with more substantively in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase>&mdash;it would be helpful if we could think of a shorter version of that constituency name&mdash;raised a series of points, some of which I want to pick up on in detail because other Members also raised them. He asked in particular about tackling fraud in respect of housing benefit, as he has done before. He asked about funding for local authorities to help with that, and he will be pleased to hear that, in consultation with local authority representatives, we have agreed changes to the way that money is allocated for anti-fraud activities. Local authorities will now get an all-in sum for administration and fraud that is notified up-front each year. This week, we issued a circular on that which I hope he and local authorities will find helpful. The hon. Gentleman said that he thought there was no evidence of an impact on work-readiness from the pilot authorities. As I have just said in response to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar, we have some encouraging evidence that there is a positive impact and are certainly looking carefully at that aspect of reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">The hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> rightly asked about the advice services at the time of rollout. We have put some funding into the pathfinder experience to support financial advice services. I have been looking carefully at how that has been working, and it has been very effective. We have taken on board the point that there needs to be some element of continuing support for financial advice, both for vulnerable tenants and perhaps for others at the time of national roll-out. It tends to be an initial need and does, of course, tail off. The more progress we make in broadening financial inclusion, the less need there is for such support. What we have seen in the pathfinder areas was a quick, high-level demand for that support, but it very quickly tailed off. Once those who needed support to get through the transition had done it, the issue was largely dealt with. So it is an important point, but one which we have taken on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/5">In the remaining time, I want to deal with some points that were common to all contributions. I return first to the views expressed by Shelter. I continue to be grateful for its close interest in the matter; Shelter's submissions are indeed helpful to us. Overall, the feedback from Shelter on the LHA has been quite positive, supporting the objectives of the new scheme. In its interim research report &quot;On the right path?&quot;, which has been referred to in our debate, Shelter concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/6" class="indent">&quot;many of the concerns expressed when the HB Pathfinders were set up have not materialised. The evidence reveals that removing the choice of direct payments to landlords has not led to an increase in homelessness . . . Likewise, the reforms have not, so far, lead to a widespread increase in rents&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/7">Shelter thus has reasons to be broadly supportive of the reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/8">While visiting Brighton recently to talk to Shelter about its experiences there, I was struck by the fact that one officer told me that if she was drawing up a wish-list of things that the Government should do to reduce homelessness, she would have put the LHA at the top of the list. We need to consider the effects, and Shelter rightly keeps testing us there. I can certainly assure hon. Members that, on this issue, we want to be confident of being right at the time of national roll-out.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/9">We also take seriously the response from the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux; it too has recently published reports on the LHA, which I have studied. I am heartened that NACAB is also generally supportive of the LHA and reporting that implementation is going relatively smoothly. I note the concerns that it has raised: difficulties for some tenants in accessing bank accounts, some concerns over direct payments and, again, the need for continued money advice. However, the evaluation is interesting in putting into context the issues around access to bank accounts. It showed that 95 per cent. of tenants now have a bank account&mdash;with a quarter of those tenants having opened their account specifically to receive the LHA&mdash;while there are no significant reports of tenants complaining about encashment charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/10">I now return to the issue of private landlord reaction, which I have already touched on briefly. First, I should make it clear that landlords have generally been supportive of the concept of local housing allowance. What they have objected to is the removal of automatic direct payment to landlords, which saves them having to collect the rent and reduces any risk of non-payment. Again, the findings coming out of the pathfinders are quite encouraging there. Secondly, the experience is that landlords have raised concerns and continue to do so. However, resistance has reduced markedly in the pathfinder areas now that the scheme is running smoothly. As I have said, many of the concerns raised now come from those not yet involved in the LHA. I assure hon. Members that we continue to listen carefully to the views expressed by landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/11">A couple of hon. Members raised the issue of the single room rent. I recognise that its abolition is a top priority for many stakeholders and hon. Members present. However, there is a fundamental principle of fairness and equity to uphold. Young single people under 25 have earnings prospects well below those of older people, and 60 per cent. of those who rent in the private sector who are not in receipt of housing benefit rent shared accommodation. It is not unreasonable to expect young people in receipt of housing benefit to share accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/12">I am aware that in some areas young people may have difficulty accessing shared housing, and that for them choice is limited. Extra help is available in the form of discretionary housing payments and flexible support from local authorities on a case-by-case basis. In LHA areas we have implemented a more generous shared room rate that more accurately reflects the accommodation available in the area. As we move forward with housing benefit reform we will continue to review the single room rent, to ensure that young people can access appropriate accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/13">A number of colleagues asked about rolling out the reform into the social sector. I appreciate that conditions in the social housing sector are very different from those in the private sector. We understand that. For example, we cannot pretend that social sector tenants always have the same degree of choice as those in the private sector, because they clearly do not. Differences such as those will need to be taken seriously in developing any proposals for reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/14">We should not shy away from reform in that sector just because it will be difficult and because the sector is so different. We need to address issues such as choice and fairness and we need to ensure that housing benefit keeps pace with our wider welfare reform agenda&mdash;for example, by ensuring that it supports our 80 per cent. employment target and does not act as a barrier to people returning to work. We are going to do this in discussion with the experts on social housing, which is why we will continue to proceed cautiously in developing this reform in respect of the social rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/15">Everyone who has contributed to the debate appreciates the immense complexity of the world of housing benefit. Local authorities who administer it also find it complex. While we are working on a more substantive and quite radical reform, certainly in respect of private sector accommodation, our eye is not off what we need to do in the meantime to improve the administration of housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/16">The Department is engaged closely with local authorities, trying to assist them in improving the processing of the benefit. We are supporting them with additional financial assistance; in fact, we have allocated &pound;180 million to support that. The vast majority of local authorities have taken up some of that support. Overall, the processing times on housing benefit are coming down.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/17">As my hon. and learned Friend and others have said, the performance is patchy. The average performance is markedly better; a couple of weeks have been taken off the average processing time for housing benefit. The Department asks authorities to achieve 34 or 35-day processing. The majority of local authorities have reached that. The laggards have caught up to some extent, but there are still many whose processing times are unacceptably long. I assure all hon. Members that we continue to concentrate heavily on that issue. It is not acceptable that processing times should be of that length; it creates problems for people trying to secure rented accommodation and support for it. We concentrate on that area at the same time as we are concluding our thoughts on the future roll-out of a reform to housing benefit in the private rented sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.1/1">Rural areas face problems with employment, housing, transport and health, but sustaining their communities can present them with particular challenges. Although my constituency is largely urban, it does have rural areas that suffer from all those problems, and I have constituents who want to see further progress made in tackling them.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/2">This Government have done more than any previous Government to invest in sustainable rural development with a range of measures, including help for rural transport, rural post offices and rate relief. I secured this debate to ask the Government to continue that important work with further support for the institution that so often represents the beating heart of rural communities&mdash;the rural pub.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/3">As the supermarkets tighten their grip on our shopping habits and as patterns of work and settlement keep changing, increasingly the village pub provides the main, and sometimes the only, focus for social activity in rural areas. Without such a focal point, the sense of community evaporates from rural areas, and that sense of community is essential for regeneration. Yet the rural pub is under threat. Some estimates suggest that six are closing every week. There are many reasons for that: drink driving regulations inhibit many from driving out into the country for an evening at the pub as they might have done 30 or 40 years ago; the extremely competitive prices charged by supermarkets for beer are encouraging some to drink at home instead of going out to the pub; and the changing composition of villages means that more and more people are commuting in and out of them. All those things challenge the viability of many rural pubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/4">Those problems are well known and a lot of good work has gone on to tackle them. The Campaign for Real Ale, for example, has been indefatigable in championing the cause of choice, and small breweries, to make all pubs more attractive to the discerning and committed consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/5">There are good examples of what can be achieved. Some pubs have been making themselves sustainable by diversifying into other areas, including prescription deliveries, DVD rentals, and even delicatessen and broadband facilities. There have been inspiring examples of villagers giving their pub a new sustainable financial basis by buying it as a co-operative.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/6">When, as the Minister with responsibility for small business six years ago, I set up the Small Business Service, I wrote into its remit that it should encourage mutual enterprise as an instrument of regeneration. I believed then, and still do, that such co-operation and mutuality can be an invaluable instrument of community regeneration. It is encouraging to see rural communities putting that into practice by supporting their local pubs in that way, but more needs to be done. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that his officials and those in the Department for Trade and Industry will work with the Small Business Service to ensure everything possible is being done to provide support for villages that might want to form co-operatives to run their local pub.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/7">The Minister will be aware of the role of the Pub is the Hub initiative, originated by Business in the Community, in spreading best practice. Again, I would welcome his reassurance that he and his officials, and those in the DTI, will work with Pub is the Hub to ensure that it receives the funding and other support to enable it to develop its work so all rural pubs can benefit from it. I should be grateful if the Minister could write to me by the end of March about the action that is under way in those areas, so I can reassure my constituents about the good work being done by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/8">I would welcome reassurance from the Minister about how the fairness, equitability and sustainability of the commercial environment in which rural pubs operate can be ensured. He will know that in recent years ownership of pubs has become increasingly concentrated. The top six so-called pubcos control almost 40 per cent. of UK pubs. He will also know that a year ago the Select Committee on Trade and Industry conducted a thorough investigation of their relationships with their tenants. I do not intend to rehearse all those arguments today, but I have some concerns that I shall raise with the Minister. Before I do so, however, I stress that I have no quarrel with the Select Committee's balanced conclusions about the trade-off between the so-called dry rent and the wet rent charged by the pubcos&mdash;the profit they make from contractually exclusively supplying beer to their tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/9">I recognise that some pubcos have moved some way towards addressing concerns about their relationship with tenants. The largest have codes of conduct which stress that tenants should take professional advice before entering into any contract, and their websites offer clear and helpful accounts of different business models available to potential tenants.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/10">However, there are still grounds for concern. Pubcos start from a strong position, first because there remains a strong demand for tenancies, not necessarily because a tenancy offers a viable living but because many people still dream of the rural idyll of running their own business in a pretty village. There are other attractions. The chief executive of Punch Taverns plc said earlier this year that taking on a lease with accommodation</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/11" class="indent">&quot;can appear a very attractive deal when house prices are so expensive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/12">Such a lease can also seem attractive because the entry costs into the business in that way are lower than taking on a free house.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/13">However, such attractions must not be an excuse for abuse of a dominant position in a contractual relationship, and there is certainly a price to pay for the low cost of entry. For example, I have seen detailed figures prepared by a successful and experienced publican in the Swindon area, who is now a contented tenant of a local brewery, but was previously an unhappy tenant of a pubco. Those figures suggest, among other things, that the percentage of gross profit taken by rent will be less than 10 per cent for a free house but more than 20 per cent. for the lessee of a pubco.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/14">The Trade and Industry Committee rehearsed the main complaints against alleged exploitation by pubcos a year ago, and some of the questions it raised have still not been properly answered. The Select Committee said that pubcos should insist</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/15" class="indent">&quot;as a condition of acceptance that tenants obtained all necessary professional advice. This should be one element of an industrywide code of practice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/16">The new code of practice is now out for consultation by the British Beer and Pub Association and goes a long way towards meeting that objective. That is important because Morgan Stanley, for example, found that 40 per cent. of prospective tenants took no legal advice before signing lease agreements, 42 per cent. said they were encouraged by the pubco to do so and 63 per cent. were not asked by the pubco whether they had done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/17">Obtaining such advice should ensure that tenants understand better what they are getting into, but that does not guarantee that pubcos will alter objectionable clauses. There are often two or three potential tenants pursuing the same lease, which puts them in a difficult position. It is a seller's market and the pubcos hold most of the cards. Some of the clauses that they put in their contracts are worrying. One, from a contract issued by one of the largest pubcos, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/18" class="indent">&quot;the tenant agrees to pay trading accounts and statements . . . on the dates specified by the Landlord&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/19">That is followed in the same agreement, which ties the tenant to buying beer only from the pubco landlord, by the statement that</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/20" class="indent">&quot;the landlord shall on the signing of this lease and from time to time thereafter supply the tenant with a pricelist of beers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/21">In other words, there is no contractual fetter on the landlords to prevent them from raising prices as often as they want and as high as they want, and demanding payment as frequently as they want. Those clauses are not subject to any test of reasonableness or tied to any increase in the pubcos' charges from the brewery. In this case, the pubco seems able to charge whatever it wants, whenever it wants.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/22">The pubcos frequently claim that their business model depends on their tenants prospering, and the argument is advanced that it would not be in their interest to bleed tenants dry. However, there is a difference between the extreme position of bleeding them dry and simply exploiting them by charging unreasonably high prices for the tied beer, secure in the knowledge that their tenants will often work extremely long hours to make the business pay, and swallow any disproportionate increases in costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/23">It is hard to avoid the conclusion that such clauses leave pubcos in a position where they can use their dominant economic position to exploit their tenants. That does not mean that the tenants will necessarily go bankrupt. They may survive by working hours, and at a standard of living, that no pubco director would accept, but survival can be consistent with exploitation and nothing in the new code of practice issued by the British Beer and Pub Association will prevent that, as far as I can see.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/24">The so-called wet rent, which is derived from the profit made on the exclusive supply of beer to tenants, is justified by the claim that it is partly offset against the rent charged for the premises so that such rent is competitive. However, I am also concerned about the so-called dry rent. The Trade and Industry Committee report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/25" class="indent">&quot;The industry could and should establish clear guidelines for the rent valuation process&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/26">with</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/27" class="indent">&quot;new national guidance for rent calculation . . . The profit assessment method of calculating rent should be carried out in accordance with national accounting standards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/28">However, the British Beer and Pub Association code of practice states that</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/29" class="indent">&quot;company codes of practice should, as far as reasonably practicable and possible, provide for the making available to the lessee of information relating to how the rent will be determined initially&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/30">which is not quite what the Select Committee recommended. It suggests that the fixing of rent and rent reviews will remain contentious, and, in the absence of the national standards suggested by the Select Committee, that there will still be scope for pubcos to exploit their tenants. Apart from anything else, the more vague and opaque the process, the more disputes over unjustifiably high rents and rent increases can be resolved only through litigation. How many tenants can afford to litigate against huge powerful pubcos?</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/31">Apart from the operation of the charges for tied beer and rent, I am also worried about the appropriate disclosure of information to tenants and potential tenants, which, again, was called for by the Select Committee. There are disturbing signs that the pubcos are not fully signed up to that. The Select Committee said that</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/32" class="indent">&quot;pubcos should advise their tenants of the average discount they receive&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/33">from brewers, and</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/34" class="indent">&quot;how this compares to the free market discounts available, and how much of this discount pubcos are passing onto their tenants&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/35">Enterprise, which is one of the largest pubcos, said in response that that was</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/36" class="indent">&quot;entirely irrelevant to the tenant's decision-making process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/37">I am baffled by that response. It hardly suggests that pubcos view their tenants as partners. Of course such information helps tenants understand the business model of their competitors and, indeed, the strength or weakness of their position in relation to their landlords. As such, it seems to be highly relevant to tenants' decision-making process. Of course, contracts with suppliers are subject to commercial confidentiality, but why could tenants not be bound by such clauses? It is not unreasonable to expect partners to share commercially important information.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/38">At best, tenants will not be able to invest in improving their facilities for the community that they serve if they are squeezed too hard. At worst, they will go out of business. That could be a personal disaster for the tenant and could damage the rural community that they serve, but the pubco faces less risk. For them, there will always be the option of liquidating the asset and turning the pub into, for example, housing. That distorted balance of power must be worrying for rural communities that depend on their pub.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/39">I recognise that the worries that I have expressed today may prove groundless. Pubcos may use the latitude in their contracts to behave fairly towards their tenants over the tied supply of beer, rent and other matters. They may consider that it is in their own interests to do so&mdash;but there is often no contractual imperative for them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.1/40">There are many reasons why it is hard for tenants to fight their contractual corner. The pub can remain a hub of village life only if it is a sustainable business, but sustainability is damaged by unfair exploitative relationships between pubco and tenant. The survival of the rural pub is too important to village life for the Government to abandon this issue. I hope that the Minister agrees that it is important for pubcos to be aware that public scrutiny of their relationship with their tenants will not disappear with their response to the Trade and Industry Committee report a year ago. I would be grateful if he could confirm that his Department and the DTI will continue to monitor the situation, and, if the problems identified by the Select Committee, some of which I touched on today, persist, that they will take any action necessary, including introducing a statutory code of conduct, if appropriate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.277.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="277"  time="011:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h02.htm#51207h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.277.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It reinforces his reputation as an excellent campaigning Member of Parliament who consistently raises issues of concern to his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/2">The future of pubs is of great public interest, nowhere more so than in rural settings where they not only perform the social function that they do anywhere else, but may be the only place in the community where the village can meet, trade, and, in one or two cases, even vote. I know from more than 10 years of living and working in Wiltshire that that county has a great many fantastic rural pubs. The north of the county, in particular, enjoys the beautiful setting of the landscapes that we associate with the Cotswolds.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/3">Some pubs, such as &quot;The Red Lion&quot; in Castle Eaton in my hon. Friend's constituency, offer the chance to have a relaxed drink in a beer garden on the banks of the Thames. I am sure that the wise voters of Swindon not only enjoy the local pub, but take advantage of some of the wonderful countryside around and about for a walk at the weekend. What better way to round off a nice Sunday walk in the Cotswolds than to enjoy a nice lunch and a pint of Wiltshire's fine Wadworth 6X in a rural pub? I enjoy a similar experience in my constituency on a monthly basis when the Red Ramblers get together and enjoy a good walk, political discussion and a fine pint of Dorset Badger beer at the end.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/4">Rural pubs play a crucial role in promoting local food and tourism. I was lucky enough to visit &quot;The Three Fishes&quot; in the Ribble valley this autumn. The owners not only served excellent food and drink in a quality environment, but positively celebrated the local sourcing of that food. The walls of the pub were decorated with photographs of the local farmers who supply the superb produce. That reconnection of consumers with producers is crucial to the future of rural areas as a whole. The work of &quot;The Three Fishes&quot; demonstrated the best practice in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/5">For all those reasons, I share my hon. Friend's concerns about the economic viability of pubs. If they are to continue as important community centres, vital parts of the tourism industry and, as he described them, the beating heart of rural communities, they need to continue to be a viable part of the rural economy. Evidence of their state of health is not clear. I heard what my hon. Friend said about the number of closures. On the other hand, an analysis of the interdepartmental business register indicates that there were about 12,000 public houses in rural England in 2003, employing about 50,000 people. The same analysis suggests that the number of pubs in rural England increased by 3 per cent. from 2000 to 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/6">I would add the caution that, although the analysis has not been carried out in sufficient detail to be certain, the growth in rural pubs appears to be largely in those areas with higher numbers of visitors, and we know from the same work that the number of independent pubs has fallen by 8 per cent. I have studied the report from the Trade and Industry Committee that my hon. Friend referred to and I am aware of concerns about the functions of the relationship between a limited number of pubcos and their tenants. There may be a relationship between the fall in the number of independent pubs and the state of the sector in rural areas in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/7">We live in a world of seemingly ever-increasing change. The changes affect every corner of life and inevitably have an impact on rural areas. Change can be viewed as a threat or an opportunity. The 2004 rural strategy sets out how the Government will support rural communities through the change. Both elements of the priority on social and economic regeneration are relevant to pubs in rural areas. At one level, rural pubs are simply businesses. They are important to the area of the economy that they serve. They operate in a free market and must respond to market forces, given the strengths and weaknesses that my hon. Friend describes. Government intervention should be a last resort and should deliver clearly defined public benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/8">The Government will support such businesses by ensuring that the business advice is tailored to meet local needs, including rural needs. I pay tribute to the work done in that regard by my hon. Friend when he was small business Minister. Officials from my Department work closely with the Small Business Service and representatives of the social enterprise sector to explore the best ways of meeting the objectives of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Yesterday, I talked to the Plunkett Foundation about some of these matters. Where appropriate, co-operatives should be encouraged in the running of pubs. I am happy to write to my hon. Friend to reassure him on that and the other points about which he wanted me to correspond with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/9">The Government allow councils to reduce business rates by between 50 and 100 per cent. for pubs that are the last retail outlet in the village. The Government's new licensing rules also provide good business opportunities for pubs. Rural pubs know their customers better than anybody else and we are giving them the freedom to offer the services that their customers want in a single licence. They need only the one licence to cover a range of activities and no longer have to make trips to court to renew licences or apply for new ones. They no longer have to apply for a range of separate permissions if they want to open longer for special events, whether it be for St. George's day celebrations or for late-night viewing of sporting events.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/10">As well as being businesses, rural pubs are often the focal point of village life&mdash; especially in those villages without a village hall or other centre. The Government want local communities to be empowered to control their own destiny. That includes keeping services that the communities consider important, including pubs as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/11">The Government support that social function. Public houses are explicitly recognised in planning policy statement 7 as one of a number of services and facilities with a role in sustaining village communities. Local authorities can refuse to grant permission for a change of use and thus provide an opportunity to keep a pub. The evidence suggests that this power has been successfully used on a number of occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/12">Beyond that basic protection, I am also interested in what more pubs can provide and are providing. Part of the challenge of running a business or providing a public service in rural areas is achieving a viable economy of scale. It is often achieved by diversifying a business and by co-locating services. Co-location can be good for the pub and good for the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/13">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Pub is the Hub initiative, which my hon. Friend mentioned in his speech. Pub is the Hub is an initiative of His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, president of Business in the Community, to encourage pub owners, licensees and local communities to support and maintain local services, and increase the viability of rural pubs. It was set up in 2001.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/14">Pub is the Hub is an independent advisory trust, and it is assisted by the rural action team of BITC, together with the professional pub and drinks industries and other Government and statutory bodies interested in using pub or other rural properties for the support and supply of social enterprise services.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/15">Pub is the Hub is a national body. It is able to co-ordinate activity, advice and industry training that requires pub experience, business aptitude and the raising of necessary funds to support adequately those activities, based upon the current six requests for help each week and more than 400 general inquiries each month via its website. I had a look at the website this morning, and it is very helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/16">Pub is the Hub is not a pub preservation group, but it seeks to encourage social enterprise and diversification where pubs can deliver commercial viability in supporting many rural services that are either under threat or may have recently ceased trading. The main aim is to encourage the co-location of other rural services, sharing overheads and costs, and thereby meeting the service needs of rural communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/17">One excellent example of a Pub is the Hub pub is &quot;The Beauchamp Arms&quot; in Dymock in the very north of Gloucestershire, the county adjacent to Wiltshire. In that case, an enterprising parish council had the imagination to grasp an opportunity when the last pub in the village was put up for sale. The council took out a public board loan and purchased the pub, which is adjacent to the village hall. The pub is managed by a management company, and a successful lottery bid, with the excellent help of the Gloucestershire rural community council, has led to the extension of the hall, using the land acquired with the pub.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/18">The community now literally owns the pub. Even during the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2001, the village rallied round and used the pub more to keep takings up. The Pub is the Hub website tells me that a number of community groups, such as the playgroup and the parents and teachers association hold meetings there, and there is a monthly lunch for Dymock's over-60s club. The landlord is keen to support other local businesses, and he sources as many of the bar meal ingredients as possible from local suppliers, including the local cheese maker and the butcher and baker from nearby villages.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/19">Dymock is not alone. Already 200 post offices are located in pubs in rural areas; 80 rural shops, convenience stores or bakeries are located in pubs. Fifteen village communities have purchased their own pub, as Dymock has, either as a co-operative or part of a group. A village, Heskett Newmarket, has even bought a brewery.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/20">Pub is the Hub is an excellent initiative. I am keen to work with it on expanding the concept and services like the co-location of post offices. A few months ago, one of my most senior officials spoke at its launch and has joined its national steering board. Its first meeting was on Monday of this week. I hope that that is a demonstration of DEFRA's support.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/21">I come now to the worries of the Select Committee to which my hon. Friend referred. We will continue to monitor the relationship between pubcos and tenants. I will make sure that my colleagues in the Department of Trade and Industry are aware of my hon. Friend's comments. The issue affects pubs everywhere, not only in rural areas. Over the past few years, I have worked with the British Beer and Pub Association and have found it to be an effective and professional organisation. My hon. Friend said that it has agreed to develop a code of practice and that that will be published soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/22">I am sure that my hon. Friend agrees that if we can urge the industry to resolve matters on a voluntary basis, that is better than the Government imposing a solution. I am equally sure that he, the Select Committee and the DTI will monitor events closely, as will I. I wanted to make that clear because the issue is important. I shall, in particular, be examining the problems of exploitation to which my hon. Friend referred in the working hours of publicans and the transparency of rents&mdash;the whole arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/23">The debate has been worth while. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for introducing it. It has given me a welcome opportunity to respond on something for which I am responsible. Usually in this Chamber, I am responding on behalf of my noble Friend, Lord Bach, on issues for which he responsible. I shall write to my hon. Friend about the issues about which he was particularly concerned during the time frame that he described. I am most grateful to have had the opportunity to focus on such a crucial bedrock of rural communities&mdash;the local pub. The Government are committed to working with the industry to ensure that the sector remains healthy and that the opportunities to embed local pubs in the community through social enterprise can be grasped.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.281.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" speakername="Daniel Kawczynski" colnum="281"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h03.htm#51207h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.281.1/1">I should like to begin by apologising for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>. He particularly wanted to be present, but he is involved in a fisheries debate in the main Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">I am pleased to have secured this debate. It has created a great deal of interest in my Shrewsbury constituency. Flooding is a serious issue; it has affected our town for many years. I have not come here to criticise the Government at all. There is a new spirit, and I want to follow my new leader's policy of co-operation with the Government when co-operation is required and appropriate. I wish to use the debate merely to inform the Minister of certain things that are happening in Shrewsbury, and to urge him to act on certain proposals in Shropshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">Shrewsbury was flooded terribly in 2000, and the Prime Minister duly came to the town, along with the Deputy Prime Minister. They went around in their wellington boots to see what the problems were. There was a great deal of media coverage; the press and TV were there. The Prime Minister promised that he would help Shrewsbury in respect of flooding. That was on the front page of all the newspapers: &quot;Prime Minister promises to help Shrewsbury to prevent flooding in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/4">I must say that some progress has been made, but in Shrewsbury all there has been is a small flood defence in a place called Frankwell, which protects the council offices and 80 homes. The people who work in the council offices are fine, and the people who live in the 80 homes near the council offices are protected. However, large parts of Shrewsbury continue to flood, such as the areas by the English bridge. I met residents there in 2003: young couples with buckets in their hands trying to save their homes from flooding. They were in great distress. Our football stadium on the Gay Meadow is also prone to flooding. That disrupts numerous football matches. I have no doubt that we would be higher in the league if our football stadium did not flood so frequently; that is another reason why I want better flood prevention in Shrewsbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/5">During floods, many businesses close down for long periods. As well as the problems that that causes, the flooding issue leads to investors having long-term concerns about Shrewsbury. They know that the town floods, and a major company that wants to build a facility somewhere will think twice about building it in a town that is prone to flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/6">Another area of concern is affordable housing. As the Minister knows, there is tremendous pressure on local authorities to build affordable housing. However, Shrewsbury is running out of appropriate space, so the council and developers are being tempted to build on flood plains&mdash;on areas around Shrewsbury that repeatedly flood. The costs involved in that are astronomical. The purchasers of the homes will have to bear the brunt; extra measures will have to be taken to protect the homes in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/7">I want to mention a couple of individual cases. There is a company in Shrewsbury called Chase Tyres and Exhausts. It is a garage, and it repeatedly floods. The owner said to me, &quot;Every time we flood, we don't get any compensation from the Government; although I have to close my business down, there is no financial help.&quot; The Government go out of their way to help other businesses in times of crisis. When the Rover plant tragically had to close, the Government responded quickly with financial assistance. I should like to hear the Minister's views on what further help can be given to businesses facing the crisis of flooding and shutting down for long periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/8">A lot of agricultural land is flooded, but farmers do not get the publicity that major businesses receive, and although their land is flooded and they lose business, which has a devastating impact on their production, little is mentioned about them. I should like to hear the Minister say what help can be given to farmers when their land is flooded.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/9">One of my constituents in the village of Pentre loves their home so much that they spent &pound;80,000 of their own money building a dyke all the way round their property. Again, there was no financial assistance for that from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/10">Flooding is a tremendous misery. Two weeks ago, I visited Underdale road in Shrewsbury, an area that floods repeatedly, and the residents took me in to see their homes. In the kitchens their washing machines, fridge-freezers and all the appliances were built on stilts in preparation for the next flood. The residents were on the Floodline hotline all the time to find out when their homes were going to be flooded. I was there two weeks ago, when the water was coming right up to their homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/11">The Minister will know that if a road is prone to flooding, people living at the top of the road where it does not flood will still find it almost impossible to get insurance for their home, and if they get insurance, the insurance company will charge an astronomical amount because they are, unfortunately, in a particular postcode.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/12">I do not normally get passionate, but I am passionate about the proposal for a wet washlands scheme. I believe in listening to the professionals. I have visited the Environment Agency, based at the Oxon business park in Shrewsbury, on numerous occasions and asked, &quot;How would you solve the problem of flooding, not just in Shrewsbury, but along the whole of the River Severn?&quot; The answer from the Environment Agency&mdash;the professionals whose job it is to look at such issues&mdash;is that it wants to create a wet washlands project, meaning that 200 hectares of agricultural land in my constituency, near the village of Nesscliffe, would be flooded.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for admitting that his constituency partly contributes to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">The wet washlands scheme would mean storing the water on the 200 hectare site. The project would cost &pound;36 million, but the benefits would amount to &pound;70 million. I spoke to someone at the Environment Agency today and asked what savings of &pound;70 million meant and how I could justify that to the Minister. He said, &quot;The benefits are twofold. First, the Environment Agency has calculated that from all of these towns not flooding, all the homes not being destroyed and all the fridge-freezers, other appliances and everything else not being destroyed and having to be replaced, the savings would be &pound;50 million. Secondly, there would be a &pound;20 million saving in terms of environmental gain.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3">What does that mean? The Minister will recall the 1992 Earth summit in Rio. As part of the conclusions of that, the Government came up with something called the biodiversity action plan, which seeks to protect 391 species of plants and animals in 45 habitats. The plan is the blueprint for conservation in Britain, protecting birds such as snipe, redshank and lapwing.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">This single project in Nesscliffe, involving the 200 hectares, would fulfil 100 per cent. of the Government's biodiversity action plan for the conservation of those birds and different plants. At times of the year, the wet washlands would be only a soggy marsh. That would encourage wildlife and birds, particularly in the breeding season, by providing more food. At other times, the wet washlands would have up to 1 m of water. That is where the water would be stored and thus it would not go into the River Severn and go further down the river.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">I have spoken a lot about Shrewsbury, but there are obviously other towns on the River Severn. The Environment Agency says that the benefits of the scheme will extend all the way down to Worcester. The levels of water in Shrewsbury would be brought down by 1 m during flood times and in Worcester the figure would be as much as 0.25m.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.4/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on securing the debate. However, I warn him off using that excuse for the performance of Shrewsbury Town football club. We use it in Worcestershire for the performance of our cricket club, whose ground regularly floods. He cannot copy that excuse all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/2">However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the misery caused to home owners affected by flooding. I have had no more sobering experience as a result of becoming a Member of this House than that of visiting people who are wading through their flooded homes in wellington boots. The sight of fridges or freezers on bricks or breeze blocks is not uncommon in those properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/3">You may not know this, Mr. Gale, but after the floods of autumn 2000, the River Severn group of MPs formed an inaugural grouping to tackle the issue of flooding along the river. Because of interest shown by other hon. Members, that group became established as the all-party parliamentary group on flood prevention. I have the pleasure of chairing that group, while <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> is one of its vice-chairs. It is all due to flooding along the River Severn that we have established that all-party group.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/4">The Severn, as the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said, has been flooding for years. In the worst flood in Worcester, in 1947, the river rose to 5.58 m above its normal summer level. That level of flooding affects 200 properties in the city of Worcester. While not wishing to be partisan, because my comment is not, I can understand why the Government's eye was taken off the ball regarding flood prevention, given the rather cyclical nature of flooding as it affects Worcester.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/5">To take the Hylton Road in Worcester as an example, that floods at 4.2 m above normal summer level. In the five-year period between January 1955 and 1960, the river flooded six times. Then, between January 1965 and 1990, a 25-year period, the river flooded six times more. However, between January 1995 and 2005, a 10-year period, the river flooded nine times at that point&mdash;a considerable change in the frequency of flooding. That cyclical pattern has really drawn attention to the need to deal with flooding in places like Worcester and Shrewsbury and the towns in between.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/6">I too have worked with the Environment Agency to tackle flooding in the city, and have looked at the options that it has proposed. One attractive option is upstream storage, along the lines described by the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham. If I may use a pun, I do not want to pour cold water on his idea, but for Worcester to be protected by upstream storage so that the city of Worcester did not flood, it would require upland storage capacity of 127 million cu m of floodwater, which is two and a half times the volume of the Llyn Clywedog dam. That is a huge expanse of land, but it is not available to be used to protect the city of Worcester.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/7">I understand how an upland washland area could protect parts of the town of Shrewsbury, but once that river water comes down towards Worcester, there is no capacity above Worcester for the same level of upland storage. It would require something huge further upstream to deal with the problem. However, some policies can be tackled by the Government and the Environment Agency. Will the Minister explain what scope exists for the use of washlands that could mitigate some effects of flooding along the River Severn?</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/8">Let us consider other changes in upland land management, especially afforestation, that could reduce the flow of the rain falling on the Welsh hills and finding its way quickly into the River Severn. If we can slow down the progress of the rainfall, it might have a reduced impact on flooding. We must also deal with barriers that hold back the water, some of which are buildings that are constructed in floodplains. What changes are being proposed in PPG25 to stop councils erecting houses on flood plains and storing up misery for the residents in years to come?</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/9">Another policy that is often flagged up as the saviour of Worcester and other towns and cities is dredging. If it were to be a solution for Worcester, the river bed would have to be excavated to a depth of between 4 m and 5 m for the length of the river from Worcester downstream to Gloucester. It would make the river at Worcester tidal, which would affect water supplies because our drinking water comes from the River Severn. Admittedly, it is clean before it reaches us, but such measures would affect the habitat and the environment generally. Frankly, dredging is not an option that would solve Worcester's problems. That has been confirmed by Dr. Ian Maddock of University college, Worcester, who concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/10" class="indent">&quot;dredging would be a very costly attempt to reduce flooding that is not viable on either economic or environmentally sustainable grounds&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/11">We can put to bed the argument about dredging.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/12">Let us now consider permanent flood defences. They would be options for parts of the city. Worcester has 11 identified areas that are known as flood cells, each of which is examined to see technically whether defences can be built. They are then assessed using cost-benefit analysis to see whether it is financially worth while to invest in them as a defence. Permanent defences cost a fortune because we have to sink them down to the bedrock before they are built up to prevent water going underneath the defences. As the hon. Member for Wyre Forest knows, huge costs were incurred when the Bewdley defences were installed.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.4/13">In Worcester, five of the 11 flood cells have a positive cost-benefit analysis. In theory, that is good news. However, on the priority scoring system, they score between four and six points out of a maximum score of 44, which means that they will not be dealt with in the short term. Perhaps the Minister can write and explain to me and those residents who will be defended by the systems when it is likely that the Government priority score will come down into the region where the permanent defences can be built.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.296.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" speakername="James Paice" colnum="296"  time="015:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h03.htm#51207h03_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.296.0/1">I recognise that I do not have any direct constituency link to the River Severn, but I have shadow responsibilities. I echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>, who would have been here had he not been speaking in the Chamber. Not only would he have spoken from a constituency point of view, he probably would have done the job that I am doing in speaking on behalf of the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/2">During the debate, much has been made of the issue of the new, consensual approach to politics. I entirely support it, but it is not actually new as far as I am concerned. I think that the Minister would agree that, during the time we have been working opposite each other, our approach has been largely consensual. Indeed, I have gone so far as to say that DEFRA has in him an excellent Minister; albeit it has taken eight years to find one. In all fairness, I must say that it is equally unusual to hear the Liberals accepting responsibility for anything, so to have <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> metaphorically hold up a sign and say, &quot;The flood starts here,&quot; was welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/3">To be serious, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham, as others have done, on what I understand is his first debate in Westminster Hall. It is on a subject of great importance not only to his constituency but to the many other constituencies affected by the flooding of the Severn. It also raises issues that are common in many other constituencies; indeed, flooding is not unknown in my area, a third of which is below sea level. We are familiar with the fen washes, which were designed 400 years ago by Vermuyden to take the surplus water and to expel it from the area. My home is only 7 ft above sea level, so I am fully familiar with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/4">Some key points have been raised in the debate. First, many hon. Members referred to the huge cost of flooding&mdash;not only the financial cost but the emotional cost&mdash;to individuals, businesses and communities. Secondly, some have mentioned the overall trend, which shows an increasing incidence of flooding. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" name="Michael Foster">The hon. Member for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> referred to different time scales and demonstrated a cyclical approach. If he took a longer time scale, he would find that that trend is towards an increasing number of incidents. The Office of Science and Technology estimated that without action to tackle climate change, the cost of flooding could rise twenty-fold during the present century. That partly answers <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the point raised by the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/5">It is not climate change only that is at the root of the problem. As hon. Members have said, new developments speed run-off. The Environment Agency published its flood maps just over a year ago. That was a significant step forward, but the maps were probably insufficiently detailed. The Norwich Union maps referred to earlier were considerably better but even they were not accurate enough for many individual properties. I can tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> that although 0.5 m is a detail on a map, it is significant when seeking to discover whether a property is at risk of flooding. I know of many property owners who have had insurance problems whose properties have never been flooded, even though a property just down the road had been. It is crucial that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister should ensure that development does not take place on flood plains. Like the hon. Gentleman, I look forward to hearing what will happen to PPG25.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/6">I shall address some of the specific issues raised during the debate. I generally support the principle of catchment management plans as developed by the Government. It is the right way forward, as it takes account of all the water in a catchment area. I strongly support the principle of what I call soft protection&mdash;soft management&mdash;in preference to the sort of hard defences mentioned today. I fear that the country has far too many concrete channels that no longer have sufficient capacity to take the high-speed run-offs from upstream, which has resulted in urban flooding.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.0/7">If you will permit me to digress for 15 seconds, Mr. Gale, whenever I welcome constituents or friends to the House I show them the chart by the steps up to St. Stephen's entrance. The chart shows what has happened to the Thames over the years, and it shows that Parliament is built on what used to be the river. It shows how the sea wall has moved over the centuries to where we now enjoy it; beyond the Terrace. That shows how development is constantly expecting the channels that remove the water to take ever more. Squeezing watercourses like that is unnatural. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> said, it does not reflect the natural dynamism of rivers or watercourses. Those aspects need to be taken into account. Those who have lived in near rivers in the countryside have seen what has happened over the years and understand the problem.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.298.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1477" speakername="James Paice" colnum="298"  time="015:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h03.htm#51207h03_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.298.1/1">I would rather not, if the hon. Gentleman does not mind; I am trying to keep to time, as we all want to hear what the Minister has to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/2">Soft defences are obviously not enough; as hon. Members have said, hard defences and temporary defences are essential. Indeed, I was interested to hear about the temporary defences; I had not heard of pallet barriers before. Like many other hon. Members, I believe that reform of the common agricultural policy and the development of pillar II money will create a significant opportunity for flood management to be better integrated into our general land use policies. Although as an individual I am averse to destroying good agricultural land, which over the past 40 or 50 years we have been paying farmers to reclaim from marshes so that we can produce more and better food, it seems a bit strange quickly to reverse that tack and suggest developing wetland marshes. Nevertheless, it is sensible to develop flood plains, and if we can use rural development money to do so, that seems wise. As my hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said, in addition to flood prevention, the development of flood plains has significant conservation and biodiversity attributes.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/3">I shall certainly not use this opportunity to suggest one or other solution to the problems of the Severn. The one lesson that we can draw from this debate is that there is no single solution; there are a number of solutions for different parts of the route of the Severn and for different communities. However, before I embrace the idea wholeheartedly, I want to challenge the Government and ask the Minister what work has been done on other options apart from the use of water catchment on flood plains and marshlands. I know that my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire would have made these points if he had been present.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/4">In particular, what work has been done on collection further upstream, into the genuine uplands, where, to pick up the point made by the hon. Member for Worcester, reservoirs may be appropriate to retain water, but may also be used, as they traditionally were, as a source of water? That may not necessarily be in the area of the Severn, but&mdash;if I may be parochial, Mr. Gale, and you may well agree with me, not that you can&mdash;may be in the south-east, which, because of the rush to development, faces serious water shortage problems. I suspect that it will not be many years before there will have to be a much greater water transfer between the west of the country and the east. Therefore, water catchment for consumption is also an issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/5">There is also the possibility of using uplands reservoirs as a source of hydroelectric power, again given the consensus that we need to move further towards renewable energy; water would be preferable to wind power. However, here we bring together different aspects of Government; not just the Environment Agency but the ODPM and the Department for Trade and Industry because of its responsibility for energy. Hon. Members will no doubt think of other Departments that should also be involved. Therefore, although the wetlands strategy is attractive, it is not down simply to the Environment Agency to produce the solution; other organs of Government must be involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/6">The people of Shrewsbury and Atcham, who I am sure will appreciate their MP's debate and the fact that he has taken the initiative, and all the other people in the towns and villages along the course of the Severn will look to the Government for action. Not to be too critical, my own experience of the Environment Agency is similar to that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">my hon. Friend the Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase>; speed is not necessarily the first attribute that one would give it.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/7">Most important, we need action. We have got used to lots of reviews, strategies and plans, but they do not prevent flooding, although they might produce a pretty massive physical barrier if they were all stacked up on top of one another. It is important to turn them into action. My hon. Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham has produced some ideas. He has taken the Environment Agency's ideas for the wetland, which has many attributes. We would all welcome not only the Minister's responses but his commitment to action.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> on securing this debate and I thank him for his new consensual style, which I think informed the rest of the debate&mdash;and very well informed and consensual it was too. I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1939" name="Michael Foster">my hon. Friends the Members for Worcester (Mr. Foster)</phrase> and for Stroud (Mr. Drew), <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> and others for their positive comments about the Environment Agency. It was especially good to hear from the hon. Member for Wyre Forest about the action that has been taken in Bewdley in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/2">My hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment is abroad and therefore cannot be here to respond to the debate, but clearly, climate change is an issue in the context of this debate. I am sure that we all wish him well in the negotiations in Montreal that he is currently enjoying.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/3">As we have heard, flooding is a traumatic experience. It is costly in material terms, in disruption to people's lives and psychologically, in terms of stress and worry. I have great sympathy with those who have suffered damage and distress as a result of flooding and those who are worried that flooding will affect their lives in future. Following the rainfall last week, my wife received an automated call from Floodline to warn us of the threat to our home from the River Wey, so I personally have a lot of sympathy for those at risk of flooding and I appreciate the efficiency of that automated service. I was also pleased to visit the River Severn in Worcestershire over the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/4">Before I turn to the particularities and make some more local points about the Severn, I want to set out the national background. Because of the importance of flooding and the worry that it causes, the Government have made flood risk management a priority area, with significantly increased real-terms funding and the most thorough public review of policy in this area for many years. We estimate that between 4 million and 5 million people live in areas at risk of flooding and assets totalling some &pound;250 billion are involved. We calculate flood risk as a measure of both the probability of flooding and its consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/5">I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> that the probability of flooding might well increase as a result of climate change and sea level rise, while the damage caused will increase along with both the risk to national wealth and further development. I will return to development on flood plains. In line with the majority, I need to focus more on the consequences of flooding rather than its causes.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/6">There is a huge challenge for the Government, the operating authorities and those at risk. DEFRA has overall policy responsibility for flood risk in England, and we work in partnership with the Environment Agency, which is the principal operating authority for managing the risks. The agency's flood risk management activities are largely funded by DEFRA and it operates within the framework of guidance issued by us. We agree its corporate plan, which sets the outputs that we expect it to deliver on our behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/7">As I say, the Government have provided large increases in funding for flood risk management over recent years; the total expenditure on management of flood and coastal erosion risk will be some &pound;570 million this year and for each of the next two years, compared with &pound;310 million about eight years ago&mdash;coincidentally. We will use the money to maintain the Environment Agency's excellent capacity, and its excellent staff, in dealing with the challenge. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester for his kind comments about the staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/8">Hon. Members will understand that this is about risk management, because we have to recognise that we cannot prevent flooding completely and there is not an infinite amount of money that can be spent on the problem, however much any of us in this Chamber would want to spend. Any of us in Government would probably in the end agree with that. I would also advise the hon. Member for Northavon that as part of the next comprehensive spending review we will again look thoroughly at how we apply the resource to this particular problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/9">The measures that we take include the building of flood defences to reduce the probability of flooding and go beyond that, to embrace a range of approaches for reducing the consequences of flooding when it does occur. They include public awareness campaigns, flood warning and emergency planning, together with seeking to avoid increasing risk through inappropriate new development on the flood plain.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/10">From a flood risk management perspective, in addition to significantly increased funding since 1997, we are also addressing the challenge through &quot;Making space for water: Developing a new Government strategy for flood and coastal erosion risk management in England&quot;, to which the hon. Member for Northavon referred. That is a thorough re-examination of policy to set our direction for the next 20 years or so. We are undertaking a wide consultation with all interested bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/11">In March, my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment published the Government's first response to views expressed in our consultation on a new strategy, and that gave greater prominence to the role that flood resilience and resistance can play in managing flood risk effectively. As a result, we are also exploring whether it will be practical to provide some form of financial assistance to households in areas where community defences cannot be justified to make their homes more flood-resilient and flood-resistant. I hope that Members who raised that matter will be pleased to hear that we are considering that&mdash;including, perhaps, for the Boat inn in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/12">Several hon. Members raised the issue of development in areas at risk from flooding. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister recently initiated a public consultation on proposals for strengthening and updating guidance to planning authorities on avoiding inappropriate development in areas at flood risk. The new planning policy statement 25 includes a measure giving the Environment Agency a statutory role in relation to development and flood risk, with the possibility of calling in major development proposals that planning authorities intend to approve against sustained Environment Agency objection, which would then be considered by the Deputy Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/13">Although our investment is making real improvements possible across the country, there will always be the need to prioritise the proposals that should receive funding first from among all those that meet the basic criteria. My hon. Friend the Member for Worcester discussed that at some length in his comments on the flood cells in his constituency. I have sympathy with the points that he makes and the households concerned, but proposals for schemes around the country and in our river catchments are generated bottom-up from the operating authorities working with communities to find solutions to flooding problems. They are then prioritised in the programme through an objective prioritisation system, to ensure that the country gets maximum benefit from our investment. At present, our prioritisation system only covers funding for capital improvement projects, as distinct from maintenance, but we are working on new output and performance measures, which will increasingly be used to guide investment decisions to maximise benefits. They will give greater flexibility to the Environment Agency in particular to allocate its own funding, including making choices between capital and maintenance work so as best to maximise the outputs that we seek.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/14">The Minister for Climate Change and the Environment announced yesterday that we have a fully approved programme of grant-aided projects for 2006&ndash;07. Schemes that have already started, or have already been approved, will be fully funded. Some authorities will be disappointed that, unlike in previous years, there will be little scope for approval of further projects for grant in-year, but the high level of commitment for approved and ongoing projects significantly adds to the certainty that the full works programme will be implemented as planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/15">Having outlined the national context, I now turn to the specifics of the River Severn. The Severn is one of our major rivers, and it presents a considerable challenge in terms of flood risk. Reflecting that, the Environment Agency has invested some &pound;100 million over the past five years in the Severn catchment, with significantly improved defences in Cheltenham and Bewdley, and some significant improvement in Shrewsbury. In the constituency of the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham, the Environment Agency has completed a &pound;3.5 million flood risk management improvement project for the Frankwell area of Shrewsbury, from which 74 households will benefit. The hon. Gentleman mentioned that. In some locations on the Severn, the Environment Agency has been unable to justify investment in permanent defences. Instead, it has trialled the use of temporary defences&mdash;at Ironbridge and at Worcester, for example, and in Shrewsbury at Abbey Foregate and Coleham Head. Those defences are stored locally and put in place temporarily at times of high flood risk. We have heard how effective they are, but it should be said that they particularly suit the nature of the Severn. I stress to the hon. Member for Northavon in particular that the Severn is slow to rise at times of flood, which makes the river particularly suitable for deploying defences of this type. As we look at rolling out this technique, which has been so successful in this situation, we must bear in mind the rapidity with which a river would rise, because there is not much point in having a temporary structure if there is not sufficient time to put it in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/16">For the longer term, the Environment Agency has produced a draft fluvial Severn strategy. That has been sent for comment to a broad range of consultees, including Members of Parliament for the affected areas, with the aim of its being finalised in 2006. It considers a number of options for all flood-prone areas along the River Severn and, together with the Environment Agency's River Severn catchment flood management plan, will provide the agency with a framework for managing flood risk in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/17">The scope in the immediate future for further major flood risk improvement works in Shrewsbury is subject to investment being worth while within cost-benefit terms and the relative priorities that I talked about. However, the Environment Agency will continue to look for opportunities to reduce risk that are feasible and economic. For example, subject to planning consent, they plan to undertake improvements to defences in the town, including some permanent walls and temporary defences at Abbey Foregate and Coleham Head. The agency will also support any appropriate local defences that individual property owners may wish to build.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/18">Now I turn to what the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said in respect of wet washlands. That is a scheme in which I, as Minister for biodiversity, am especially interested because of its potential environmental gains. The agency is considering the viability of that large flood storage project, which could offer improved protection for some 1,000 properties along the Severn from Shrewsbury downstream to Worcester, as well as providing additional habitat. It is an example of just the sort of multi-functional project that we wish to encourage. However, planning is at an early stage; some quite complicated negotiation would be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.0/19">The agency will need to carefully consider the full potential impacts, environmental and otherwise, of such a project&mdash;including the effects on fisheries and navigation. When I visited the Severn, there were barges with aggregate in them on the river. A full assessment of the costs and benefits, including potential payments to landowners and land managers, will need to be made. The agency will also want to consider joint funding with other partners, particularly those who have a more direct interest in the biodiversity gains that the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham talked so passionately about. I cannot make any definite commitment, but the agency is certainly looking at it seriously.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one way forward, which we could look at carefully, is to extend the water framework directive more rapidly to other estuaries? At the moment, we are only looking at Ribble Valley. Would we not be advised to look at the Severn too?</p>

	<p pid="a.303.1/1">I will certainly ensure that my hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment is aware of the hon. Gentleman's comments on the water framework directive, and how it might be used there.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/2">I want to comment on the wider issue of absorbability in regard to wet washlands&mdash;that is, the use of habitat and upland management to improve things. A number of hon. Members talked about wet washlands, and I am also enthusiastic; I raised the subject today when I was being briefed by officials. We are keen to see those sort of &quot;win/wins&quot; take place. However, I should caution that while they can have good local effects, they will have no great impact in terms of the catastrophic 1 in 100 or 1 in 50 flooding events. They are useful, and we should certainly attend to them, but I would not want it believed that they are the answer to everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/3">The hon. Members for Shrewsbury and Atcham and for Wyre Forest talked in particular about insurance&mdash;an important issue for us all. My hon. Friend the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment recently announced to the House that our action to reduce flood risk has allowed the Association of British Insurers to renew its statement of principles so that cover continues to be widely available in flood risk areas. That new statement comes into effect next month and creates a rolling commitment to provide flood cover where flood defences are either in place or being planned. It is directly linked to the commitment that this Government have made to improve flood risk management. It will help considerably with those individual property owners that the hon. Member for Wyre Forest talked about, but they should be talking to their insurers about the risks and cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/4">Where householders live in an area at significant risk of flooding but there are no plans for improved defences within the next five years, they need to have those discussions so that insurers will make their best efforts to provide flood cover, and work with customers to take measures that allow insurance to continue. Those might include reducing the risk to individual properties, or making them more resilient to flood damage by local action.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/5">It remains our highest priority to reduce the risk to life from flooding. Flood warning arrangements continue to be strengthened throughout the Severn catchment, with the Environment Agency investing some &pound;1 million in total over the last three years. I will write to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1719" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.C. Davies)</phrase>, and to my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud about their particular issues, but the tidal Severn flood management strategy will be published early next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/6">I thank all hon. Members for the debate, which has been very useful and has given the Government an opportunity to explain the reasons for our national policy and to explain the action relevant to the River Severn. I hope that all hon. Members will understand that although work has been done and more is being considered, we need to justify all expenditure of taxpayers' money, including any possible investment in new defences.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.3/1">I understand that as a result of the comprehensive spending review last year, some of the funding for export promotion at UK Trade and Investment was cut. The British Chambers of Commerce has also expressed concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/2">Another concern was expressed by David Frost, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, in an interview with one of the Minister's departmental publications:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/3" class="indent">&quot;One real concern is that there is too much focus on Europe . . . Europe is a market that is essentially stagnant. We've got to get where the action is, and at the moment that's on the other side of the globe&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/4">He was talking about India, China and the US. The British Chambers of Commerce has been making that point for years and has been trying to draw attention to the huge opportunities in India and the need to move quickly to seize them.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/5">In discussions with UK exporters and individuals connected to UK trade initiatives since returning from India in September, I have come across the concern that there is exciting action taking place elsewhere in which we are not sharing fully. I heard that view expressed again at the launch of the Indo-British Partnership Network at Asia house on Monday evening. Could we be doing better? I believe that we could and should be doing a whole lot better.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/6">On Monday evening the Indian high commissioner said that Britain is a natural partner for India. He mentioned the 250 years of shared history, albeit not a voluntary relationship on the Indian side. There are a number of other factors that mean we should be well-placed to take advantage of opportunities in India.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/7">First, we are home to one of the largest components of the Indian diaspora. There are now more than 1.5 million people of Indian extraction here in the United Kingdom, many of whom have built successful enterprises here, not to mention the thousands of Indian students who are achieving impressive results at our top universities and business schools.Secondly, we have a shared language. There are up to 200 million English speakers in India, making it the world's second largest English-speaking nation. Thirdly, India shares values and a political system modelled on our own. The Minister made a very pertinent point on Monday evening. None of those factors necessarily translates into easy and automatic wins for UK exporters, but they provide a solid base from which we can build an advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/8">I am concerned that other countries seem to have woken up far quicker to the huge opportunities in India and are notching up truly impressive increases in their exports there. Australian exports to India, for example, are growing at more than 30 per cent. annually and last year passed 6 billion Australian dollars. If that is converted to sterling, it is not too far behind UK exports; on current trends it may not be very long before Australia overtakes Britain in terms of the value of her exports there.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.3/9">What has impressed me about the Australian approach is how they identify certain niche areas on which they focus concertedly. The 2010 Commonwealth games in Delhi is an obvious example. Australian firms, with the support of their Government, are seeking to leverage their expertise in providing services and infrastructure for major sporting events, and they have specifically targeted the 2010 Games as a major business opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good comment. I am aware of the huge increase in tourism between the two countries; Indians visiting Australia and Australians travelling to India and elsewhere around the world. On the back of the Sydney Olympic games in 2000 and the Melbourne Commonwealth games next year, Australian companies have already been successful in picking up contracts in Delhi. That is partly the result of initiatives such as the games linkages programme, which was set up by the state of Victoria to help its firms to exploit opportunities at other major sporting events.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.2/1">That is certainly an important contribution. Another example of a country achieving impressive export growth to India is Israel. Bilateral trade between India and Israel has grown by nearly 25 per cent. a year, a level broadly in line with India's overall increase in international trade. Trade with Israel has grown from around $200 million in 1992&mdash;a tiny amount&mdash;and is projected to reach $2.7 billion this year. The two countries are cementing what seems to be an exciting trading relationship backed up with a clear target set by Kamal Nath, the Commerce Minister, who wants bilateral trade to exceed $5 billion by 2007. India has become Israel's second largest trading partner in Asia in non-military goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/2">Like India's trade with Belgium, diamonds account for a large proportion of the trade but India and Israel are pursuing interesting and exciting initiatives in telecommunications, biotechnology, nanotechnology and space science, which are areas where there are potentially huge high-value gains in future. Perhaps the Minister will tell us whether his Department is working towards clear targets for increasing Indo-British trade and, if so, what they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/3">The United States is India's largest trading partner. Between 2003 and 2004&mdash;the year when our exports to India actually fell&mdash;US exports increased by 22 per cent. Again, that increase was commensurate with the overall growth in India's international trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.2/4">In conclusion, India's economic growth is one of the central narratives of what is happening in the global economy today. I am concerned because British firms should be at the very forefront in sharing that growth, but they are not. A country like the United Kingdom, which has the fourth largest GDP and two centuries of trading experience with India, should have bilateral trade with India in 2005 of more than &pound;6.5 billion or &pound;7 billion with the second fastest growing and 10th largest economy in the world. I look forward to hearing the Minister's thoughts and his response on how we can boost our exports to India.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale, and I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> on securing the debate. I agree with him about the importance of trade between the UK and India, and acknowledge the close interest that many hon. Members on both sides of the House have in developing and strengthening trade relations with India.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/2">India is the world's second-fastest-growing economy and is forecast to become by 2050 the world's third largest economy after the United States and China. It will also become the world's most populous nation. Since economic reform started in 1991, growth rates in India have averaged between 6 and 7 per cent. annually, and growth is now forecast to be about 8 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/3">The emergence of India as an economic superpower is not in doubt: whether in traditional sectors such as construction, manufacturing and financial services or in emerging areas such as the creative industries, renewable energy and environmental technology, opportunities exist for UK businesses. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Government want to ensure that UK companies are well placed to take advantage of India's emergence as an economic superpower, and we are doing that by committing an increased percentage of UK Trade and Investment resources to India.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/4">India is recognised as a priority market in all 16 industry sectors identified by UKTI as being key to the success of the global economy. UKTI has in India the second largest network globally after that of the United States. There are nine trade offices located in the key commercial centres&mdash;New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolcotta, Puna, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Chandagar&mdash;and 72 staff carrying out commercial work for UKTI in India. Put simply, the Government are putting their money where their mouth is when it comes to promoting trade with India.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/5">Support for encouraging trade between our two countries is evident at the highest level. In September, along with my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, I visited India for the EU-India and UK-India summits, accompanied by the largest trade delegation seen for a long time. Increased trade was at the top of the agenda during the visit, and we discussed at length more ways of removing some barriers to trade that still exist between the UK and India.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/6">In the insurance and financial services sector, India has a strong desire to increase trade between our two countries, and we are making good progress on joint UK-India initiatives. We are also working towards the challenging objectives set by the Joint Economic Trade Committee. JETCO was set up as part of the UK-India joint declaration made in London by the Prime Ministers of the UK and India on <phrase class="date" code="">20 September</phrase> last year. It is a bilateral trade and investment forum that seeks to maximise the potential for trade and investment in the relationship between our two countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.1/1">The balance of economic power is shifting to the east&mdash;to China, India and Asia more generally&mdash;so it is vital that we recognise not only the challenges brought by the growing economies of India and China, but the opportunities. We should not adopt a negative approach to those countries. That is why the Government have been looking to maximise the opportunities for dialogue, and to encourage more and more of our companies to enter those important markets for the future. The hon. Gentleman is right that there are tremendous opportunities for environmental technology as well as for water and other services.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/2">I was about to refer to air services, which is another area in which there has been tremendous progress during the past year. The number of direct flights has tripled, from 16 a week to more than 50. Our objective is an open skies agreement between the UK and India.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/3">In another area, the creative industries, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport signed a film co-production treaty on Monday. That framework will allow UK and Indian film production companies to collaborate on future projects. It is due to come into force around next April.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/4">The Asia Task Force, which is co-chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Bryan Sanderson, chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, is also up and running. The ATF, which has more than 20 chief executive officers of major UK companies as well as Lord Desai on its board, has already commissioned research on identifying how we can improve the trading environment throughout Asia. A major strand of that research will focus on trade with India.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/5">As the debate has shown, it is not just the Government who should encourage greater bilateral trade with India, as the private sector has an important role to play, too. The extent to which the private sector is beginning to focus on India is encouraging. As I said, during the Prime Minister's visit to Delhi, we were accompanied by a delegation of more than 30 CEOs of British companies, including small and medium-sized enterprises as well as multinationals. They were all keen to increase trade between the UK and India.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/6">The Indo-British Partnership Network, which I formally launched on Monday, as the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire mentioned, will, I am sure, play an important role in helping to encourage UK companies&mdash;particularly small and medium-sized businesses&mdash;to export their goods and services to India. I hope, too, that it will play a key part in identifying issues that prevent companies from taking advantage of trading with India.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/7">Much has been done, but I accept that more needs to be done. The value of our trade with India accounts for a little less than 1 per cent. of our global total. It can and should be more. Perhaps we should forget predictions. Today, India is the world's 10th largest economy, but it is 17th in the league table of UK export markets. That reinforces my strongly held view that more can be done to increase trade between our two countries. Therefore, I welcome today's debate and the Trade and Industry Committee inquiry on trade and investment opportunities with India. I am glad to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>, the Chair of the Committee, in the Chamber today, and I hope the inquiry makes policy recommendations that will help us progress to increased trade between the UK and India.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/8">UKTI officials are seeking views on how to improve trade from key stakeholders such as the CBI and the Indo-British Partnership Network. The British high commission in New Delhi is busy strengthening its engagement with the Government of India on business issues. The more we can identify and overcome barriers to trade between the UK and India, the better placed our companies will be to take advantage of the opportunities that come with India's growth and development.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.0/1">A point about barriers that was made to our small team, which visited the Science Minister&mdash;a rather smaller team than that which went out with the Minister a week later&mdash;was that UK universities, and particularly chemistry research departments and some new high technology industries, are at times reluctant to undertake joint developments with Indian universities. The trade potential of those developments is enormous. Will the Minister consider inviting universities to forge greater links with Indian universities?</p>

	<p pid="a.314.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate. First, I should say clearly&mdash;I make no apology&mdash;that my points are about nothing more or less than hard cash and resources. I am not necessarily arguing that more money should go to regeneration, to facilities for young people, to training or whatever. I believe that this Government have devoted more time, energy and commitment to investing in and revitalising communities than any other. It is a record of which I and they can be proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/2">My contention is that areas of the country such as my constituency that do not neatly fit into categories are seen as being unwittingly but systematically discriminated against by the system of allocating funds for regeneration and facilities. This is, to put it crudely, about claiming a fair share of the cake for my constituents in Wirral, South.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/3">My part of the United Kingdom could not be called deprived, either economically or socially. <i>The Guardian, </i>for example, profiles Wirral, South as a classic suburban seat. The definition of a suburb is in strict terms quite simple, and it is</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/4" class="indent">&quot;an outlying district of a city, especially a residential one.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/5">If one substitutes the word conurbation for city, we might be said to be a suburb of Birkenhead or Merseyside. However, such a definition is far from adequate. It fails to describe the sheer variety of the landscapes that constitute my constituency, from prosperous residential areas to idyllic villages to leafy and not-so-leafy suburbs and to open countryside. That is part of what makes my job as an MP so enjoyable.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/6">We are all able to identify a suburban area in our mind, but it is harder to put a finger on precisely what it means. That may go some way to explain why parts of areas such as mine tend, in my view, to be neglected. They do not fit neatly into any box. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has published some excellent pioneering research into the potential problems of suburbia. Some might argue that there are difficulties in defining and clearly marking the boundaries and characteristics of suburban areas, meaning that they are not given the attention that they deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/7">Suburban areas' mixed-use nature may result in a semblance, at least to the instant eye, of stability. However, there may not be a focus. There may be an incomplete sense of community and almost certainly an insufficiency of facilities. For the young that can engender, among other things, a sense of deprivation and boredom. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation's research stands out because it is virtually the only study of its type. Of the 42 pieces of regeneration research conducted by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, at least 30 are concerned specifically with urban areas. There are none on suburban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/8">It is right that areas of deprivation such as parts of Birkenhead and the north of Wirral should receive priority. However, as I shall go on to say, if we are complacent about suburban areas it will cost more in the long run to sort them out. Simply put, my constituency does not fare well in terms of funding. A plethora of dedicated funds of one sort or another are available and I welcome the Chancellor's pledge in the pre-Budget report to use unclaimed money from bank accounts to fund youth and community programmes. We are short of those.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/9">I am sceptical about whether we shall see any such funds in Wirral, South. At present, for example, we receive nothing from the neighbourhood renewal fund and precious little from the single regeneration budget, or what is left of it, and we are among the lowest recipients of lottery money. We are 569th in the constituency tables for lottery money, which is a considerable improvement on what went before. European money that is directly attributable to my constituency is minimal, we have no new deal for communities and minimal Sure Start. Why is that?</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/10">First, there is the culture of the bid. For most funding&mdash;thankfully, we are beginning to see exceptions to the rule&mdash;following the initial application, an at-length holistic business plan must be submitted to the relevant arbiter, whoever that may be, and that is followed by a review. The end result is that the process is long and tortuous and, in a sense, professional&mdash;I shall come to that later&mdash;which has consequences for areas such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/11">The philosophy dates back to when Michael Heseltine was Secretary of State for the Environment in the late '80s. His big idea was to make the allocation of regeneration moneys competitive. City challenge, as it was principally called, invited local authorities to tender, initially within a six-week period, for a funding pool. A bid required an extremely broad-based partnership, so applicants were required to muster up a coalition of unlikely bedfellows in the name of partnership&mdash;then and, to some extent, still the buzzword. Private sector companies, the voluntary sector, councillors, the chief constable, head teachers and others were all thrown together in a sort of Darwinian pact.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/12">The end result was a close co-operation of necessity, but it was almost always short-term in its effect because the partnership was brought together for the sake of securing the money. There was no basic solidarity, even if the bid succeeded. If it did not, there was worse to come, as the money for city challenge was not new but top-sliced from existing budgets. Those who lost suffered a double whammy with an appreciable cut in their budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/13">I believe that approach to have been wholly wrong. It was sometimes said that what brought a partnership together was the suppression of mutual loathing in order to get one's hands on the dosh. That was not my phrase. I would not say that myself, of course, but partnerships were formed, in effect, to make a quick buck, and successful bidders certainly enjoyed the spoils of extra cash for regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/14">As it happens, the Wirral bid was successful. I believe that I am right in saying that more than &pound;37 million came to Wirral as a whole, but next to nothing to Wirral, South. The losers were penalised&mdash;sometimes inevitably, as there was insufficient money to go around and good bids lost out. The Department of the Environment's interim report in 1996 praised the scheme overall, but even Heseltine's own former Department was able to point to significant weaknesses. An evaluation of the programme states:</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/15" class="indent">&quot;For some people, it is more problematic as a basis for allocating urban resources in being potentially divisive and penalising areas without conspicuous development opportunities or the capacity to deliver.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/16">As studies in, for example, the academic journal <i>Social Policy and Administration</i> have noted, city challenge had a lasting effect on regeneration policy in this country. In my view, its legacy was not altogether to the good.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/17">The bidding culture has led increasingly to the professionalisation of bidding, to the extent that there are advertisements in the press for lottery and bidding officers whose sole purpose is to maximise the likelihood of successful bids. That is dangerous in that, inevitably, it sucks resources away and means that people on the ground suffer if a bid for moneys is unsuccessful. As I said, the bidding element is no longer as entrenched as it was in all streams, but it and its culture are still there, to the detriment of the United Kingdom generally but particularly constituencies such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/18">Not only is there the snowball effect of successful bids&mdash;one acquires the professionalism of bidding, which is, in a sense, a black art&mdash;that allows for successful bids, but money goes to money. Those who are able to bid in one challenge system are already geared up and have the people and professionalism to bid in the next round. Money follows money, and the concentration concentrates on the previous concentration, to the detriment of other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/19">Because of the holistic nature of the bidding approach, a by-product is that other resources naturally gravitate towards the areas that are already provided for in the funding. For example, police and drugs teams, outreach projects and so on will follow the allocated resources&mdash;to some extent, to the detriment of other areas. The purpose becomes the bid, not the job that is needed. Money is the driver of what is done. People seek to have projects that can secure funding, rather than those that do what needs to be done. Things are awry.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/20">There are powerful and influential lobbies to speak for different parts of our country. Urban areas have, for example&mdash;I am just picking a few organisations at random&mdash;the British Urban Regeneration Association, the Urban Forum and the urban resource centre. Rural areas have the power of the National Farmers Union, the Countryside Commission, the Campaign to Protect Rural England and the Countryside Alliance at their disposal. To the best of my knowledge, there is nothing for suburban areas. There is no lobbying voice that speaks coherently and singularly for suburban areas. The ODPM has an urban and rural policy but, to the best of my knowledge, no suburban equivalent. It is left to local people to take the lead and the odds are stacked against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/21">Often, as is the case in Wirral, the centre of gravity is with the local authority's physical location&mdash;in this case, in Birkenhead. The bulk of the voters are there and thus so is the bulk of the attention. However, we in Wirral, South also have our problems and they are not trivial. Mostly, but not exclusively, they centre on antisocial behaviour. Every day, my office receives reports of incidents of antisocial behaviour of one form or another. Whether it is gangs of drunken youths roaming the streets, or vandalism, petty theft, smashing bus shelters, breaking car mirrors, entering premises to intimidate, or being abusive, such behaviour happens every week and probably every night.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/22">Some people in the leafy suburbs are afraid to go out; that should not be the case. Some parts of my constituency become, in effect, relative no-go areas on a Saturday night. I hold regular meetings with the police, residents groups and, of course, constituents. Antisocial behaviour happens in some of the most deprived areas, but it also happens in places such as Bebington, Clatterbridge, Bromborough, Eastham and even prosperous Heswall. In a sense, those places represent middle England. Antisocial behaviour has become a major blight and it is the No. 1 issue on the doorstep and in my postbag. We have strategies in place courtesy of the Home Office, but they are not wholly successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/23">There are other arguments, although they are part of the same broader problem, and I raised them in Home Office questions on Monday. However, for the purposes of today, I am concerned with the other side of the coin: activities for young people. I am talking about facilities and things to do. It has been shown time and again that those things make a difference in the long run. The entire western half of my constituency currently has no sports and leisure centre. That means that young people are cut off and left to their own devices.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/24">I am not saying that the provision of youth facilities would be a panacea. One can argue about the causes of antisocial behaviour, particularly in young people. It is obviously related to a multitude of things: parenting, truancy, education, the ready availability of alcohol, police presence, our culture and so on. We have the stick of antisocial behaviour orders, section 32 powers and so on, but the carrot is insufficient, particularly in areas such as mine. Time and again, resources are diverted away, wittingly or unwittingly. The toss can be argued and I have no doubt that those administering the funds would be able to put up a robust defence, but I find it hard to square the myriad objective tests with the evidence, which I see every week as a constituency MP, of problems and to some extent stagnation in parts of Wirral, South.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/25">A case in point is one of my local areas: New Ferry. Businesses there find it hard to survive and some shut soon after they are opened. Despite the commendable work of the New Ferry regeneration action group, the place is starved of investment and resources and there needs to be an overall review. I cannot think of a better candidate for a rounded regeneration initiative, yet it is largely passed over and even the measures that are in train&mdash;the Wirral waterfront and Winstanley road home zone areas&mdash;are simply not enough in themselves. They help and I welcome them, but they are not enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/26">The contrast in my constituency is immense. The index of multiple deprivation shows Heswall to be in the top 25 per cent. in terms of the least deprived in the UK. New Ferry is in the bottom 6 per cent. However, the devil is in the detail. New Ferry is a relatively small area and it is surrounded by more prosperous areas, not least Port Sunlight village. I accept that that is not greatly prosperous, but it is more prosperous. It is not a place of milk and honey, but it is slightly more prosperous than New Ferry. We missed out in the first round of the neighbourhood renewal fund because the objective measure took place at ward level, and New Ferry is in Bromborough, which, as a ward, is not classified as deprived, although, of course, it has its needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/27">I am aware that the ODPM started to employ data that are now to be at sub-ward level and to be called super output areas. They can detect small pockets of deprivation; indeed, they identified New Ferry as such. I understand that SOAs will be used as a mechanism to deliver funds from April next year, but again we miss out because the cut-off point is 3 per cent.&mdash;the 3 per cent. most deprived wards, as a recently parliamentary answer informed me. The cut-off point was locally prescribed, but does the Minister consider it right that areas well within the 10 per cent. criterion for allocation of NRF money to local authorities receive nothing from a total next year of more than &pound;6 million?</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/28">Will that cut-off point be maintained after April? Will it be the 3 per cent. most deprived SOAs? Does the Minister consider it right or fair for the wards in Wirral that will continue to receive targeted NRF help to contain several SOAs with lower&mdash;some not inconsiderably so&mdash;levels of deprivation? I am not sure that, if the SOA measures are to be used effectively, there is not a need to reconsider. I hope that the Minister will not consider it unreasonable of me to draw attention to what I and my constituents consider to be systematic discrimination against suburban areas, pockets and strands of deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/29">I am careful not to overstate my case, but if the totality is thrown at today's problem areas, the areas that are now non-problem areas will become the problem areas of the future. We must maintain an appropriate balance. If action is not taken to at least nurture our more suburban areas, they will inevitably decline over time. Already, they suffer from a lack of facilities. In some respects, we are already there. With councils under more pressure to rein in their spending, from which my local authority is far from immune, not least in social services, it is more important than ever to ensure that various tiers of funding are allocated on the basis of need, which takes different forms.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/30">Welcome though it is and an increase in real terms, Wirral's local government settlement, when rounded in all respects, comes out at about 2.6 per cent. this year. However, it is lower than the national average. It is tight. We need to think at both constituency and at Wirral level about how we allocate the scarce funds and the need to allocate them fairly. At present, it is my contention that areas such as mine are not receiving a fair allocation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-12-07a.318.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" speakername="Phil Woolas" speakeroffice="The Minister for Local Government"  colnum="318"  time="016:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051207/halltext/51207h05.htm#51207h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.318.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1930" name="Ben Chapman">my hon. Friend the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman)</phrase> on securing the debate, which introduces a matter that is important to his constituents and to influencing Government policy throughout the country. He said that urban and rural areas have powerful and influential advocates; his constituents have a powerful and influential advocate in him. He is well respected and well known for standing up for them, as he has done again today. I can bring him some good news, at least by reassuring him that the central points of his argument are being acknowledged by the Government in many respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/2">My hon. Friend understandably referred to the revenue support grant settlement for 2006&ndash;07 and 2007&ndash;08, which was announced yesterday, of 2.6 and 2.7 per cent. We have also announced today the education schools budget allocation, and I am delighted to inform him that the allocation for schools in his area will be increased by nearly &pound;12 million&mdash;nearly 7.5 per cent. I am sure he welcomes that.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/3">The available data are now so sophisticated that we can, as my hon. Friend has, identify pockets of poverty&mdash;as he was about to say, the nattily titled super output areas. I have a map here, but unfortunately I am colour blind, so I cannot see the exact allocation. However, his constituency clearly has areas of poverty, which, were they in the neighbouring administrative area, would be entitled to funds that they perhaps do not receive now. The point that he makes is important not just for his constituents, but for the whole country. It is true that Government policy has been targeted on areas of deprivation, and he asks whether special attention should be paid to the suburbs.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/4">It may be helpful if I outline Government policy. Over the past three years, we have worked with local government on possible changes to grant distribution formulae. We consulted publicly over the summer and drew conclusions that have been placed in the Library as well as&mdash;we are a modern Department&mdash;on our website for all to see. A key message about that settlement, and about funding for suburban areas and pockets of deprivation in the relatively prosperous suburbs, is that it is a matter for the main programme funding of the local agencies, such as the local authorities, the national health service and the police.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/5">My hon. Friend referred to the SOA data, which are more sophisticated data than were available in the past. They give us a more detailed understanding of patterns of deprivation in England, which helps us to ensure that funding is targeted where it is most needed. Because the index of deprivation for 2004 provided data by SOA and because those criteria were used when calculating the neighbourhood renewal fund, allocations for 2006&ndash;2008&mdash;the two years that I confirmed yesterday&mdash;and in relation to deciding which areas should get the neighbourhood renewal element of safer stronger communities funding have been made available.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/6">We believe that the SOAs&mdash;the indices on pockets of deprivation&mdash;provide local strategic partnerships with the opportunity better to pinpoint deprived areas. Local partners in the public, private and voluntary sectors are therefore able to target their policies and funding more effectively. My hon. Friend's council, Wirral, and its partners should therefore decide how best to spend the overall annual budgets to meet the needs of all Wirral's residents, including his own, using the evidence that is now available. In addition to the mainstream funding that Wirral receives, the Government have provided extra support for pockets of deprivation, as I said, through the NRF and the safer stronger communities fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/7">Wirral has deprived wards, so it has been allocated more than &pound;5 million of NRF resources for the current financial year. It has also had an indicative allocation for the next two years of &pound;6.5 million for 2006&ndash;07 and &pound;7.5 million for 2007&ndash;08. Therefore, from 2001 to 2008, Wirral will receive nearly &pound;36 million of NRF funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/8">The purpose of that funding is to provide local support to local authorities in the most deprived districts to enable them, in collaboration with their other partners in the public sector and beyond, to improve services. That contributes to the achievement of Government targets and&mdash;I emphasise this point to help my hon. Friend&mdash;local targets to narrow the gap between deprived areas and the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/9">To do that, the neighbourhood renewal programme, agreed by the Wirral council strategic partnership, provides support to the most deprived wards of the area&mdash;all of which are among the 3 per cent. of the most deprived wards in England. That is the crucial point that my hon. Friend made.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/10">This is a local decision. The local strategic partnership is free to use its local knowledge and to spend those resources in any way that helps to meet the key national and local targets. The funding is already being used on a wide range of projects&mdash;for example, to target antisocial behaviour. In Wirral, the LSP is already providing more than &pound;354,000 to fund warden initiatives across the borough as part of its strategy. There is also a neighbourhood management pathfinder scheme in Tranmere. I hope that Wirral, like other areas, will employ neighbourhood management principles to ensure that services are more responsive to the needs of residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/11">Cutting to the chase, my hon. Friend rightly identified the fact that the safer and stronger communities funding was allocated by focusing on the 3 per cent. most deprived SOAs using the 2004 indices of deprivation, so small pockets of deprivation are targeted with additional funding. That is to ensure that funding is not spread too thinly. However, Wirral is getting one allocation of the neighbourhood element of safer stronger communities money, which is worth &pound;1.6 million over four years. It is for local partners to agree how and where the money will be spent and which SOAs in their area will be covered.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/12">The new allocations complement each other; many small pockets of deprivation outside NRF areas are being targeted by the neighbourhood element of the safer stronger communities fund. In total, 108 local authority areas will be targeted by one fund or by both. That means that the new resources will reach more than 93 per cent. of the people living in the 10 per cent. most deprived areas. Therefore, only a small number of small pockets of deprivation are not targeted by my Department in any way. Where pockets of deprivation fall outside those funding streams, it is for local authorities and their partners to support them using their own resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/13">On top of the NRF and the SSCF, European objective 1 funding is available for the whole Merseyside region. Within that, an allocation of resources is aimed at tackling issues of deprivation in specific areas due to their classification as being among the most deprived areas of Merseyside. Three of those areas fall within Wirral, South. Single regeneration funding is available to support Wirral, South businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/14">Wirral is therefore in a good position to bring together funding streams from central Government to ensure better outcomes for people and improved public services through their local area agreement. As my hon. Friend is aware, Wirral is a round 2 local area agreement body and is negotiating that agreement ready for sign-off and delivery in April 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/15">The new area agreements are a new contract between central Government and local government. LSPs are free to use their local knowledge and spend these resources in any way that helps to meet key national and local targets for reducing deprivation. It is crucial that Wirral local authority and its partners continue to target mainstream funding to support areas of deprivation, including my hon. Friend's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/16" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.0/17" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
