<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-25a.2.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" speakername="Frank Cook" colnum="2"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/halltext/80325h0001.htm#0803252000566">
	<p pid="a.2.3/1">That young man has been reading my script. I have been looking to see whether Bradford is identified in a list of factories about to close, and sadly I cannot find it, but I advise the hon. Gentleman to consult the Library debate pack. We must commend the Library for its debate packs. The one for this debate is superb; it contains a list of factories that are closing and the basis on which they are held&mdash;freehold, ground lease or leasehold. I advise him to find out which of those applied to Bradford, because I have discovered that the factory in my constituency was freehold. Would you believe it? While consultation was still going on about whether to keep the workers in employment, the factory was up for sale. That is a motive that we have not yet heard about among the arguments. Is this simply a matter of wanting to realise the value of the plots on which the factories sit, and being prepared to sacrifice the workers on the altar of financial gain? It is a serious question, and I hope for a serious answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/2">I have lost my theme&mdash;I shall render that young man redundant at the end of the debate. I was reminding the House that although the Minister said that there had been two years of discussions, eight months later nothing has changed, at a time when the Government are trying to move people&mdash;I suppose we should call them recipients&mdash;away from benefit and into full employment: yet in the case we are considering, individuals&mdash;human beings who have worked for years at Remploy and given sterling service in sometimes difficult conditions&mdash;are being put out of work. It does no good for Mr. Waterhouse or the Minister to try to persuade me that those people can be placed safely in mainstream employment, because they cannot. They have characteristics, problems and needs that cannot be provided for in mainstream employment. They have been accustomed to working in a family atmosphere, where one individual takes care of another, or several others&mdash;an atmosphere full of compassion and humanity.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/3">Now the idea is to put those employees in the mainstream: we are told they can go into charity shops. There is nothing wrong with charity shops, but good heavens, will those workers get great enjoyment waiting for customers to come in and ask what is on the bottom shelf, when before they were gainfully employed, doing a productive job? The whole thing is farcical.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/4">In July's debate, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/5" class="indent">&quot;A misinterpretation has perhaps been given that somehow the people in mainstream employment are there only for a few weeks or a few months at a time...Remploy has a good record of sustaining people in mainstream employment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/6">In fact, that is wrong. Most of those who gained any kind of placement in mainstream employment were very temporary and found out within a short time that they did not fit in. Not only are they not happy, but the work force that must accommodate them sometimes do not make them welcome, so was that argument plausible? I prefer to use the term &quot;specious&quot;. That situation has gone on consistently.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/7">I must credit some individuals who have tried to bring the circumstances into the full light of day. I name particularly Mr. Phil Davies, of the union GMB. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i><i></i>I do not find that funny. Mr. Davies, who headed a consortium of trade unions, tried to talk sense. He pleaded with Remploy, asked questions and sought answers. GMB is still awaiting information about the financial state of play that it has requested time and time again. The Minister told us during our last debate that details of the financial considerations had been given, and that the process was to be transparent and open. That has not been the case. It has not been open. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/8" class="indent">&quot;I ask us all to encourage that discussion.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2007-07-25.294"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 25 July 2007; Vol. 463, c. 294-7WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/9">Any discussion must be a two-way process. It is not only a question of hearing; it is a matter of heeding, and that has not happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/10">Not only has that not happened, the situation has been made infinitely worse, as anyone will find who looks at early-day motion 809, tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-29">29 January</phrase> by my good friend and colleague <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>. The early-day motion relates to the issue&mdash;it is only one of the issues&mdash;of work being moved from his local Remploy factory to Bulgaria. Outsourcing to Bulgaria? I have nothing against Bulgarians&mdash;I have spoken in the Bulgarian Parliament on more than one occasion, and I have visited the country several times and helped to educate it away from Soviet methods, if we have managed any progress in that direction&mdash;but I must remind the House why Remploy was formed. It was not meant to be a profit-making organisation. Its genesis was in the need to provide employment for disabled servicemen and women who had returned after fighting to defend this country and defeat fascism.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/11">Remploy was set up to give such people a decent way to earn a living and live in dignity. Other disabled people have joined them in those factories since then, and they have provided all sorts of benefits. The factory on the south coast made survival suits at a cost of &pound;20, yet its single franchisee, no more than 300 yards down the street, sold them for &pound;80, and workers could not buy them for less than that. From the outset, it was a strange way to behave and that is the basis of my argument today. The management have been inept, incompetent, incapable and, to my mind, unwelcome, and something ought to be done about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/12">Why was Remploy outsourcing work to Bulgaria in January while closing factories in this country and putting workers back on benefits, when the Government were saying that they wanted to move individuals from benefits into full employment? Is nobody in Whitehall capable of joined-up thinking? It beggars belief that such a situation could be allowed to develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/13">There should be no doubt in anybody's mind, particularly the Minister's, about whether I am exaggerating, overstating the case or allowing myself to become angry. I am not becoming angry&mdash;I am bloody angry already. It is an absolute disgrace that such conduct should be foisted on people who have done a decent job of work for God knows how long. Some of them have done it for longer than some Members of the House have been alive.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/14">I have a letter from the Minister. It is a bit more recent than July; it is dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November 2007</phrase>. I shall not read it all out, because it goes on for quite a while&mdash;strangely enough, most ministerial letters do&mdash;but one particular bit says:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/15" class="indent">&quot;We carefully considered the Company's proposals and also the alternative plan put forward by the trade unions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/16">Two and a half years into negotiations, the Government finally considered it. Let us see how well it was considered, shall we? I am sorry to take a bit of time, but it is an important issue, and I am determined that it should have the right degree of attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/17">I have a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase>. That is not a long time ago, is it? The letter is addressed to the Minister, and it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/18" class="indent">&quot;Dear Anne,</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/19" class="indent">I am writing to you about the treatment of disabled workers at the Remploy Stockton factory, which is earmarked for closure. My colleagues and I have been trying to obtain information about Employment Services and how it would work for those interested in remaining on Remploy's books and working for a host company. Remploy as a company and Mr. Waterhouse specifically have refused to give Stockton Remploy factory copies of leaflets with useful information about how Employment Services will work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/20">&quot;Employment services&quot; means Remploy employment services. Remploy refuses to give leaflets about its own services to its own work force. That is what Mr. Rowland Precious says; the letter is from him.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/21">He goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/22" class="indent">&quot;This information was continually refused until, during phone calls from Frank Cook...and myself...to Mr. Paul Warren, your Private Secretary, the position was clearly explained to him. Mr. Warren was extremely helpful and promised that we would have the information the same day. When Paul Warren requested this information on behalf of Stockton factory this information, which had been refused for many months&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/23">shall I repeat that?&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/24" class="indent">&quot;this information...had been refused for many months&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/25">I am tempted to say it again, but I will not. The information</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/26" class="indent">&quot;was made available in two hours.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/27">If it could be made available in two hours, why was it not made available months before?</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/28">Mr. Precious continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/29" class="indent">&quot;I believe that it is a disgraceful state of affairs when we had to resort to contacting your department before this information was made available.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/30">What was the Department doing until it was alerted? Was it not monitoring the situation? If that is the case in Stockton, is it the case in every other factory in the country? Were they all denied the kind of information that they were supposed to be receiving?</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/31">Mr. Precious continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/32" class="indent">&quot;Remploy Senior Management have over many months force fed us with information about Voluntary Redundancy while at the same time withholding information about how Employment Services would work. This is clearly part of the Remploy Management plan to push as many disabled Remploy workers to take Voluntary Redundancy, which is the cheapest option for the company. I should also like to point out that Stockton Remploy factory has been starved of work for many months and suddenly it has been flooded with work only a few weeks before the deadline of March 6th 2008.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/33">The factory could not find work before, but suddenly it can&mdash;and all the time, there is a &quot;For sale&quot; sign on the outer wall.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/34">Mr. Precious points out that</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/35" class="indent">&quot;the former Work and Pensions Minister stated that for those disabled workers who were unable to be placed in mainstream employment suitable sheltered employment would be found. When our Remploy factory in Stockton is closed there will not be any suitable sheltered employment in the Teesside area, as Hartlepool Remploy factory will also be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/36" class="indent">Remploy claim that charity shops and other voluntary work are suitable replacements for sheltered factories and workshops. The problem with charity shops is that there are grave health and safety risks, which make them unsuitable places of work for a number of disabled workers. Remploy management have consistently refused to answer the question about what would happen to those disabled workers who are unsuitable to work in charity shops or mainstream employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/37" class="indent">The situation is that at present because of the arrogant and dismissive way in which Remploy Senior Management have treated us over many months most of the disabled workers at Remploy Stockton will take voluntary redundancy rather than stay on Remploy's books.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/38">That demonstrates how successful the process has not been.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/39">Mr. Precious continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/40" class="indent">&quot;This clearly shows that the claim of Remploy Senior Management that they understand the needs of disabled workers is simply not correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/41" class="indent">Remploy have also offered voluntary redundancy to factories which are remaining open, such as Spennymoor, which is the closest factory to Stockton factory. At Spennymoor factory 66% of the disabled factory workforce have asked for voluntary redundancy, which means that a number of them will have to remain to maintain suitable manning levels while Stockton factory where most of the workforce wished to stay has been closed. This is further proof that the whole of the closure program has been very badly handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/42" class="indent">Could I close by asking that there is very careful monitoring of the treatment of those who remain on Remploy Terms and Conditions with Employment Services as there is a great deal of distrust of Remploy Senior Management.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.2.3/43">That will be their legacy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-25a.6.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" speakername="Frank Cook" colnum="6"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/halltext/80325h0001.htm#0803252000568">
	<p pid="a.6.0/1">I could not agree more. My thesis throughout has been about the management's disgraceful behaviour. They have been mendacious, mischievous, arrogant and dismissive. During our last debate on this subject I made the point that if I had treated a purchaser in such a way when I was a construction project manager, I would have been sacked out of hand. I would have been told to leave the keys on my desk and go, which is what ought to happen with the Remploy management.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">I have no doubt that the Stockton factory has had it&mdash;it is going&mdash;but I want to put it on the record that the management have proved themselves incapable of good, responsible management standards. As a result, they ought to be changed quickly, because they will repeat their actions. If we allow them to continue, we will simply be continuing a disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">The letter from Mr. Precious was sent to the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase>. To the best of my knowledge he has yet to receive a reply, but on the next day the Minister wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4" class="indent">&quot;My officials have contacted the company to establish the facts regarding the situation at Stockton.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">What a concession! &quot;We are now going to establish the facts.&quot; It is a pity that they did not do that before. The Minister continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/6" class="indent">&quot;in particular to enquire why Mr Precious was not given a handbook when he requested one and also to establish the reason for the recent high workload.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/7">It was not only Mr. Precious who asked for the handbook, but the whole work force. The Minister went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The company has explained that their Employment Adviser was acting on what they thought was in the best interest of their employees.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/9">How considerate.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Rather than just issue the handbook, the adviser takes time to explain the content and discuss the options with the individual.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/11">Something like: the&mdash;cat&mdash;sat&mdash;on&mdash;the&mdash;mat. Those people might be disabled, but they are intelligent. They could manage the business themselves, and to infinitely higher standards than the existing management.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/12">Apparently</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the adviser takes time to explain the content&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/14">that is generous&mdash;so they thought it better to hold on to the handbook. The Minister continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/15" class="indent">&quot;As Mr Precious had not decided what option to take, the adviser did not offer the handbook as a matter of course.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/16">As he did not know what the options were he could hardly decide which one to take, yet the company says, &quot;You don't get it until you decide on the options, but we are not telling you what the options are until you decide.&quot; What kind of farce is this?</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/17">The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/18" class="indent">&quot;I understand that after my officials had spoken to the company, Mr Precious has been provided with information regarding placements and separate information regarding voluntary redundancy that is normally provided when employees have made their decision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/19">That is like saying, &quot;Sign on for the Army son, but you don't have to know that there is a prospect of getting shot.&quot; It is incredible.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/20">Apart from Mr. Phil Davies of the GMB, another person comes out with credit, although unfortunately it will probably condemn his career: Mr. Paul Warren, the Minister's assistant. At my instigation, he promptly took up the matter, although he took some persuading to start with. At my insistence, he spoke with Mr. Precious and realised that we had a problem and something needed to be done about it&mdash;so he did it. However, having thanked him for doing that, I must ask why nothing was done before. The situation had gone on for two and a half years. The exasperation is almost incontrollable.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/21">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-21">21 February</phrase>, Mr. Precious wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/22" class="indent">&quot;I am writing to you on behalf of my colleagues and myself to thank you for the help you gave us... I am sure that you will be pleased to know that this information has been very useful in helping a number of people make their final decision&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/23">at least they got it in the right order&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/24" class="indent">&quot;concerning remaining with Remploy or taking Voluntary Redundancy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/25">I wrote to the Minister alerting her to the ludicrous situation in which people have had to go to that extent and commending Mr. Warren on his behaviour. I have asked Rowland Precious to let me have a copy of the Minister's reply to his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-20">20 February</phrase>&mdash;when the reply arrives.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/26">Precious wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-27">27 February</phrase> in answer to my letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/27" class="indent">&quot;Hi Frank I have just received your letter dated 25th February 2008 which also contained the reply from Ann McGuire MP, Minister for Disabled People to your letter... This letter was unfortunately very unhelpful&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/28">I had noticed that myself&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/29" class="indent">&quot;as it did not answer the questions which were asked, It was also not entirely factually correct as a large number of people at Stockton factory asked for this information and were refused it, It was only after repeated refusals that I as UNION REPRESENTATIVE then asked for the information. It is also a fact that one of the workers in our factory who had already signed the required document&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/30">I stress that: he had &quot;already signed the required document&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/31" class="indent">&quot;after making his choice was then refused this information&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/32">It beggars belief. The letter continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/33" class="indent">&quot;This information was only given after a request was made from the Private Secretary of Ann McGuire, Minister for the Disabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/34" class="indent">I would also like to pass on to you some further information which has come to my attention namely that Spennymoor factory&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/35">we have heard of that before&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/36" class="indent">&quot;which is to remain open but where the workforce had been offered voluntary redundancy had 66 per cent. of the workforce who were willing to take up this option. This meant that some of these workers will have to be forced to remain to maintain manning levels. This is further evidence that the whole of the modernization program has been badly organized and even more evidence is available in that Wisbech factory which was to remain open is now to be closed as everyone at the factory has either requested voluntary redundancy or early retirement. This is a ridiculous state of affairs when Stockton where the workforce wish to remain is being closed,</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/37" class="indent">In my letter to Ann McGuire MP, Minister for Disabled People I pointed out that Peter Hain while still Minister for Work and Pensions stated in his Remploy factory closure announcement that for those disabled workers who required sheltered employment this would be made available for them. Could I point out that yesterday 26th February 2008 the Stockton Disabled Employment Advisors came to visit our factory and when I asked them what sheltered disabled employment was available they stated that at this time there was none available in the Teesside area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/38">None available in the Teesside area. Teesside is a big area.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/39">The letter went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/40" class="indent">&quot;Please note that the Hartlepool factory is also due to close,</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/41" class="indent">I believe very strongly that there is still a need for sheltered disabled employment in the Teesside area and that it would be feasible to set up a small sheltered workshop either by Government funding or a Stockton Council run scheme. This would be on a non profit making basis&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/42">as Remploy was when it was first set up&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/43" class="indent">&quot;but without the very large expenditure which Remploy spends on wages and other perks&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/44">like the Mercedes, to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> referred&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/45" class="indent">&quot;for the senior management this workshop with government procurement work guaranteed could be made to break even.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/46">In fact, the work force have broken records before and since&mdash;even when their work pattern has been changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/47">The work force were so upset about that situation that they were naturally easy prey for the media, so I went along to try to help them make sense of it&mdash;for obvious reasons. I did not want the situation to be exaggerated, but I found it impossible to ameliorate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/48">In conclusion, I shall read out three statements. The first is from Rowland Precious&mdash;length of service, 13 and a half years:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/49" class="indent">&quot;I received a letter on 7th March&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/50">a Friday&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/51" class="indent">&quot;2008 stating that my last working day was 6th March&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/52">the day before&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/53" class="indent">&quot;and that I should not turn up for work on the following Monday. This disgraceful treatment meant that I was not even given the chance to say good-bye to my work mates. The letter was sent dated the 6th March 2008 and my Manager was not even aware that I had&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/54">been finished. The statement continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/55" class="indent">&quot;Could I point out that many of the jobs posted on our work notice boards (Jobs in mainstream employment)&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/56">that the workers can apply for&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/57" class="indent">&quot;are already taken or are unsuitable for disabled workers. (LGV Drivers, Crane Drivers, Press Brake Operators And MIG Welders).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/58">For disabled people?</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/59">The statement goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/60" class="indent">&quot;Many of these jobs are unsuitable for disabled workers due to their age and types of disability. There is clearly still a need for some form of sheltered employment, in the Stockton area, for vulnerable disabled workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/61" class="indent">In conclusion could I say that Remploy Senior management claim that they understand the needs of disabled workers, but the dreadful recent treatment proves that this is simply not true. It is very clear that to move forward then change at the top of Remploy is clearly urgently needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/62">Rowland Precious was not saying that when I first took up those cases. I do not think that he is just mimicking me. He is an intelligent man and he has come to his own conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/63">The next statement is from David Rock: 50 years old, length of service 30 and a half years, which is longer than I have been in Parliament, and that goes back a long time, as you well know, Mr. Atkinson. Mr. Rock says:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/64" class="indent">&quot;Originally I was very happy to stay on Remploy's books and transfer to Remploy Employment Services. I have been the Union Learning Rep, at the Stockton site, for the past 5 years and I have successfully managed the Learning Centre with the help of lecturers from Stockton Riverside College.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/65" class="indent">As I have a very good working relationship with Stockton Riverside College, I was very interested in taking on voluntary work and training courses, at the College, hoping that this would lead to a full time job in Adult Education, whilst effectively looking for work. It was my understanding that doing training courses, voluntary work and effectively looking for work coincided with the Remploy Employment Services criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/66" class="indent">The working week ending 6th March 2008, I discovered that this was not the case, at midday on Thursday 6th March 2008 I reluctantly signed for Voluntary Redundancy and I was the last employee at the Stockton site to do so. To my surprise on Saturday 8th March 2008, I received a letter in the post from Mr Waterhouse&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/67">we have heard of him&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/68" class="indent">&quot;Director of Contract Services, Dated 7th March 2008 advising me that my last working day at Remploy will be 6th March 2008.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/69">That gives some indication&mdash;does it not?&mdash;of the lack of organisation in that organisation. What an Irishism. Mr. Rock said:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/70" class="indent">&quot;I am disgusted with the disgraceful treatment, by Remploy, towards disabled people.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/71">The third statement is from Amanda Campbell, who is 38 and has worked at Remploy for 21 years:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/72" class="indent">&quot;Remploy says whether I stay with Remploy or not they will help me find work. The only jobs Remploy have found people have been less than 35hrs so where are all these jobs coming from? No one from here, Remploy Stockton, has found work yet. There are not many jobs out there for able-bodied people, so what chance have we got? There was 1-week notice given to anyone who left the company&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/73">After 21 years? One week's notice? The statement continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/74" class="indent">&quot;Employees have now been asked to work up to 6 weeks of the 12 weeks in lieu because the company decided 12 weeks in lieu starts when most people have finished. This means that the people working extra time will lose up to &pound;1500.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/75">I need to think about that final paragraph, because I do not follow it myself. What I do follow, however, is that there has been an atrocious record of mismanagement and a dismissive attitude, and it has gone on for two and a half years. It is not just the management. It is not just that they have taken the easy way out, or that they are outsourcing work to countries in eastern Europe; it is that the Department, with the exception of Mr. Warren, who responded to my telephone call, has manifestly failed to monitor what the management were doing and to assess their failure to fulfil their responsibilities. In other words, the Department has failed to conduct its duties with due care and attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/76">It is my intention to see that there is a memorial Remploy debate every year to remind every Minister that they cannot just allow things to go on behind their backs in spite of what they say ought to go on. Things must be checked. Simply issuing an instruction is not sufficient; any sergeant-major could tell us that. It is not just a question of issuing an instruction, but of ensuring that the instruction is carried out responsibly and faithfully. That has not happened in the case of Remploy, which is an absolute disgrace.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-25a.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="13"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/halltext/80325h0003.htm#0803252000577">
	<p pid="a.13.1/1">That was certainly reported to be the case in the local newspaper.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">The proposed closures mean that many people face uncertainty. Previously, factories that were earmarked for closure were saved, and others that were told they would be saved were earmarked for closure. I hope that the Minister understands that the uncertainty faced by the work force in such situations was incredibly destabilising.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3">On securing people's employment in mainstream employment, I sometimes wonder whether an element of political correctness comes into that. Saying that everybody should have a job in mainstream employment is similar to saying that we should close special schools and put everyone into mainstream education. We should have a &quot;horses for courses&quot; strategy. Mainstream employment might work for those who are capable of holding down such a job, but that is not the case for all the people to whom I spoke at the Remploy factory in Bradford, and I am sure that that is true in many other factories. Some of those people readily told me that they would not be able to get jobs elsewhere and would be out of work. Others might get jobs, only to find that those jobs last for just a few weeks. That has already happened, because some people found alternative employment but lost their jobs after a few weeks when things did not work out for them or for the employer.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">The hon. Member for Stockton, North made a powerful point about the great problem of the culture of worklessness in this country. There are people who are able to work but do not want to, and there are families who have no culture of work, sometimes for generations. There are people who prefer to sit at home, on benefits, living off the back of the taxpayer. The people who work in Remploy factories are a shining example to everyone. They probably could sit at home, on benefits, living off the taxpayer and not contributing anything, but they desperately do not want that. They have consciously decided not to sit at home on benefits, languishing at the taxpayer's expense. They want to do something worth while and go out to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">The Government have said that everyone's employment terms will be protected, even if their factory closes. That is all very well, and I am sure that it gives some comfort to those involved, but it does not take away the reason why those people are working in the first place. They are doing it not because of the money it generates, but because they want to do something worth while. They want to earn their money and do not want to sit at home collecting the money that they were getting before. They want to go out and do something worth while and feel some dignity for their work, but that is about to be taken from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">I am not one for wasting taxpayers' money, and I believe that the burden of taxation should be lower, but the Government waste money, willy-nilly, on all kinds of things on an industrial scale. There are people in this country who should be in work but who are not, and people have benefits poured on them that they do not deserve. If the Government want to save taxpayers' money, there are plenty of ways for them to do so, but this is not one of them. The social value of Remploy far outweighs the economic cost, and the hard work of the people who work there should be rewarded by some loyalty from the Government. The Government should reconsider what they are doing to the people who work in Remploy factories. They are punishing people who want to do the decent thing, and we should always be on the side of those who try to do the right thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7">People who work in Remploy factories are trying to do the right thing&mdash;they want to do a hard day's work for a fair day's pay. I hope that the Government will not close all the factories that they have earmarked for closure. Rather than saving some and closing some, they should reconsider the matter and see the value of Remploy. I hope that they will take on board the message that the hon. Member for Stockton, North has put forward so passionately and movingly, and save the jobs of the people who want to work in those factories.</p>

	<p pid="a.14.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">the hon. Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the assiduous support and commitment that he has shown to Remploy over a considerable period of time. I also thank my hon. Friends the Members for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams) for raising their legitimate concerns about the way in which the policy that was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-29">29 November</phrase> has been formulated and promulgated.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/2">The Liberal Democrat party supports the broad principle that disabled people should be given employment and helped to gain employment in the mainstream. The Government can and should do much more to enable that to happen. Nevertheless, the proposals that were announced by the former Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-29">29 November</phrase>&mdash;to keep 55 factories open, merge 11 and close 17, which was down from the original 34&mdash;represent major changes and cause concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/3">In his statement, the former Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The proposals...are both realistic about the challenges facing Remploy and ambitious for the future.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-11-29.449"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 November 2007; Vol. 468, c. 449</phrase>.]</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> was much more succinct about what those closures and changes will mean for local people, and his points have been reflected in some of the comments made today. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Today's statement will have a devastating effect on the current Remploy work force in the factories to be closed...there are real local concerns about the local proposals...What process will the Secretary of State be putting in place to make sure that local concerns can still be heard?&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-11-29.452"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 November 2007; Vol. 468, c. 452</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/7">We have heard this morning why there are local concerns about what is happening on the ground, and I hope that the Minister will respond to those when she replies. I would like to put a number of issues to her about how Remploy is going about its business four months on from that plan. The original plan was that sales from public procurement through Remploy would rise from &pound;200 million to &pound;298 million, but in the revised plan that the former Secretary of State announced on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-29">29 November</phrase> that was increased to &pound;461 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.14.0/8">We have heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole about the changes affecting the factory in her constituency, where the existing work stream is being moved. Despite the fact that she willing to be a local champion and help ensure that the public procurement takes place, no one seems to be doing anything about it and the work force are sitting there, wondering what is happening. In those circumstances, if people say that they do not know what the future is, it is not unexpected that they take redundancy and go on the dole, which is regrettable.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.0/1">I will leave the Minister to answer that, because she has the facts at her disposal to deal with the specific points concerning the factory in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, whereas I simply do not have those details at my disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/2">I want to touch on is the nature of what Remploy should be doing. It is perfectly true that for those employees working in the Remploy factories&mdash;I had one in my constituency&mdash;particularly those who have been employed in them for a considerable time, the change will be unsettling and, potentially, very worrying. I can focus only on how the matter has been handled in my constituency, albeit I recognise that that factory was much smaller than others. I have taken great pains to speak to local management, who were open and transparent about the matter, to discover the destination of each of the individuals employed at the factory and what was sorted out for them. Around half were moved to another sheltered employer, which is run by Gloucestershire county council. Some decided to take voluntary redundancy, some because of their age and some because of what they wanted to do, and some found alternative employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.0/3">I am satisfied that every employee has been accounted for, and although one or two of them contacted my office when the proposals were first mooted because they were concerned about the uncertainly, no concerned employees have subsequently come to see me. The concerns expressed by the hon. Member for Stockton, North are not borne out by my experience in my constituency, so his experience in his constituency is clearly different.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.2/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman, because he brings me nicely to my next point, which is that in the year since April 2007, Remploy's employment services business found work in mainstream employment for more than 6,000 people. Actually, it has helped more people into such work than it employs in its entire factory network. That is worth mentioning, because I am told by all the disability organisations that I deal with in my Front-Bench role, and by most of the disabled people whom I deal with, that disabled people want to work in mainstream employment. They want the same chances and opportunities as everyone else, and they want to be able to maximise their potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/2">I did not agree with the whole of the speech by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley, but one of the points that I very much agreed with is that, generally, many disabled people&mdash;certainly those whom I meet who are on incapacity benefit&mdash;are absolutely desperate to work and to make a contribution. They need help and support to do so, which is why I want to concentrate the rest of my remarks on the part of Remploy's business that enables them to do that. Looking at the information that I have received&mdash;no doubt the Minister will touch on it&mdash;Remploy has indeed had some considerable success.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/3">As I have mentioned, Remploy found work for more than 6,000 disabled people since last year, which is a significant growth of 25 per cent. on the previous year. We should remember that the point of restructuring the factory network is to increase that number still further, and to get 20,000 people into mainstream employment every year. It is clear that that is absolutely necessary if the Minister's goal, which is also my party's goal, to get a significant number of people who are currently on incapacity benefit back to work are to be realised.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/4">It is worth mentioning the sort of disabilities that people have. More than one third of the people placed by Remploy have a learning disability or a mental health condition. That is incredibly important, because a significant number of people on incapacity benefit have those challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/5">It is also worth looking at the types of work into which those people were placed. Several hon. Members have expressed concern about losing manufacturing jobs. However, because the economy has changed, there will be far fewer manufacturing jobs. Let us look at where Remploy has placed people: one fifth of them were placed in business and financial services; 15 per cent. were placed in education, health and social work; and some 10 per cent. were placed in manufacturing. Those roles are spread across all the different employment sectors, which is a good thing because, again, disabled people do not want to work in manufacturing only&mdash;they want the same range of opportunities as anybody else.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/6">Picking up the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley, Remploy works closely with employers. Employer research that it carried out shows that there is</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/7" class="indent">&quot;widespread agreement among employers that disabled people are capable of performing most jobs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/8">Clearly, there are disabled people who have severe disabilities and who are not capable of working at all, but the number of people in that category is relatively small, and it is important and right that they get appropriate benefits to enable them to live a decent life. For the much larger number of disabled people who can work, however, the range of opportunities that they can fulfil, particularly if employers are flexible, is much greater than many people thought in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/9">In the two minutes that I have remaining, I want to touch on one of the things that Remploy is doing to focus on keeping people in work. Under a programme that it operates in south Wales called healthy minds at work, it works with employers to pick up on mental health problems in the workplace before somebody falls out of work and becomes unemployed. There is a good reason for that:</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Supporting employees with a mental health issue to remain in work costs an average of &pound;2,500, compared to an average cost of &pound;25,000 per annum to support an individual who loses their job&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/11">Remploy, by restructuring the factory network in the way in which it has, has so far shown considerable success in getting disabled people into mainstream employment and in helping to keep people in employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.2/12">I believe that the hon. Member for Stockton, North touched on my final point, which is about how long people stay in work. It is worth noting that individuals on Remploy's Workstep programme sustain employment, on average, for three years and six months. We are not talking about people having work for a few weeks and then losing their job. They achieve a record of sustained employment, which means that for the programme as a whole, notwithstanding concerns about individual factories, Remploy is moving in the right direction.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.0/1">It is a delight to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson. I wish to congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">the Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> on securing this debate, which, as he said, is his second on the issue. I know that he feels strongly about Remploy, and I hope that we all share his strength of feeling.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/2">I decided not to make a preordained contribution because I appreciated that plenty of points would be raised, and I wanted specifically to answer them. I start with the challenge that was thrown down by my hon. Friend, but before I get into that, I should say that I will relay his comments to my assistant private secretary, Paul Warren, whose ears will be burning if he is watching this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/3">At the beginning of my hon. Friend's contribution, he threw down a challenge and asked what had changed since <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-25">25 July</phrase> last year. I believe that the phrase he used was, &quot;What has been going on?&quot; Since <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-25">25 July</phrase>, there have been intensive consultations and discussions with trade unions, and between trade unions and the Remploy board. There have been meetings involving the general secretaries, the then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1723" name="Peter Hain">the Member for Neath (Mr. Hain)</phrase>, and me on Remploy and how we plot the way forward. Roger Poole was appointed in August last year to bring an independent mind to the work with trade unions and the Remploy management. For those who are not aware of it, he has extensive experience on the trade union side as a former assistant general secretary of Unison.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/4">The then Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, my right hon. Friend the Member for Neath, made a statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November 2007</phrase>, after which he took numerous questions. Although hon. Members might still have issues with some of the details, there was general support at that point for the direction of travel in which we are taking Remploy. I hope that it will give my hon. Friend the Member for Stockton, North some confidence to know that, since then&mdash;in fact, in the past few days&mdash;the first high-level monitoring meeting, chaired by me, has taken place between the trade unions, Remploy's chairman and chief executive and my senior officials to review exactly how the plan has been implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/5">Hon. Members share the view that, to make the process work, it is not just about words and the plan that was delivered on the <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-29">29 November</phrase>: this is a living plan that has to be monitored, not least in the interests of the disabled workers currently employed by Remploy, the disabled people no longer employed by it and the 20,000 disabled people whom we want to get into employment using Remploy as the vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/6">I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> that this has never been a money-saving exercise&mdash;never has money been one of the major issues. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> for indicating that Remploy has received and will continue to receive a significant, multi-million pound amount in support from the Government. Indeed, the last out-turn figure on the grant in aid from the Department for Work and Pensions for 2006-07 was &pound;133.8 million. We want to ensure that more disabled people benefit from the input from that resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/7">Let me also be clear that we have never said that there is no room for sheltered factories, or supported employment as it is now called. We also continue to give support to the Remploy factories that continue to operate. Through our Workstep programme, we support people in some 83 factories throughout the country. Many of those factories are managed by the voluntary sector and some by the private sector, and others are run by local government. There is no change&mdash;our support should be there.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.0/8">We want to ensure that we support disabled people into employment. However, we also have to recognise that the ambitions and aspirations of disabled people have changed over time. As the hon. Member for Forest of Dean said, in July last year the six big disability charities were prepared to go public and say that they supported the general direction of travel that we were taking. It is not about getting fewer disabled people into employment; it is about getting more disabled people into employment.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for granting permission for the debate. I welcome the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, and the Front-Bench spokesmen for the two other main parties, my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>. I commend the work of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough, particularly on the recent Conservative party proposals on radically reforming our prison system. We will no doubt hear more about those proposals during the winding-up speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/2">Our prisons are in crisis and our prison system is not working as it should. I believe, as do my constituents, that imprisoning people for committing a criminal offence is appropriate in many circumstances and that prison works. However, the present system does not work. Too many prisoners have to spend their time in overcrowded conditions and reoffending rates have increased during the past decade, which suggests that the prison system is not working as it should. Indeed, the prison population has soared from 61,000 prisoners in 1997 to just over 82,000 today. I hope that the Minister will give us the latest up to date figures on how many people are held in jails in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/3">It is perhaps more distressing that reoffending rates have also risen: from 57 per cent. in 1997 to 66 per cent. now. Worryingly, one of the reasons for the increase in reoffending is the increase in overcrowding. As of <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January</phrase> this year, 84 prison establishments in England and Wales, which is 60 per cent. of the prison estate, were overcrowded. In 14 of those establishments, the population was more than 150 per cent. of the certified normal accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/4">A National Audit Office report concluded that prison</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/5" class="indent">&quot;overcrowding disrupts work to prevent reoffending&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/6">and that prisons should, therefore, change the way in which they deliver education courses. As part of its inquiry into the rehabilitation of offenders, the Select Committee on Home Affairs stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.23.1/7" class="indent">&quot;overcrowding is having a hugely damaging impact on the delivery of rehabilitative regimes across the prison estate, both in terms of quality and quantity of appropriate interventions.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.28.1/1">Indeed. This time, the proposals are about reforming prisons. Prison reform was one of the remarkable aspects of the Victorian period. For the first time, it was identified that if appropriate penal institutions existed, there would be no need simply to punish offenders; one could reform their behaviour and attitude and rehabilitate them. Over the past 100 years, since the end of the Victorian period, we have increasingly lost sight of that aspect of our penal system.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/2">The Conservative party proposals would go a long way towards improving our prison system and reducing crime levels. My hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough will explain the proposals far better than I can, but to summarise, they will</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/3" class="indent">&quot;introduce honesty in sentencing so that courts set a minimum and a maximum period with no possibility of parole until the minimum has been served...end automatic release for all determinate sentences so that no prisoner is automatically released from custody unless they have served their full term. Prisoners will earn their release depending on their conduct and progress in custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/4" class="indent">We will make community sentences tough and effective with improved compliance, making them more visible, and introducing new and effective sanctions for breaches, including the withdrawal of social security benefits for those who don't attend.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/5" class="indent">We will enforce drug rehabilitation requirements by contracting with private and third sector organisations to operate the treatment programmes and pay them by results.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/6" class="indent">Offenders will compensate victims of crime through contributions to a Victims' Fund. Those serving time in prison will have to pay into the Fund through work in prison.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/7">At the moment,</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/8" class="indent">&quot;there is no clear accountability for the rehabilitation of prisoners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/9">My hon. and learned Friend proposes fundamental reform</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/10" class="indent">&quot;based on the principles of decentralisation, clear accountability, greater use of the voluntary and private sectors, and introducing incentives through paying by results.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/11" class="indent">Public sector prisons will be decentralised to become independent fee-earning 'Prison and Rehabilitation Trusts', responsible for offenders after they are released as well as in prison.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/12">The trusts will be run by a single, accountable governor,</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/13" class="indent">&quot;and they will be paid by results&mdash;with a premium awarded on a national tariff if the offender or ex-prisoner is not reconvicted within two years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/14">Instead of prisons being overcrowded buildings with little scope for effective rehabilitation, they will become places of education, hard work, rehabilitation and restoration. The proposals include plans to encourage social enterprises to expand prison industries in which prisoners can do proper work, learn skills and be paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/15">There will be an acceleration of the deportation of foreign national prisoners before the end of their sentences. Automatic deportation for non-EU prisoners serving less than a year will also be extended. Old prisons will be sold off and the prison estate rejuvenated to include smaller, local prisons instead of the Government's Titan prison proposals. The plans would increase prison capacity by more than 5,000 places over and above the Government's present proposals. In the long term, we will see the prison population stabilising rather than growing exponentially.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/16">[John Cummings <i>in the Chair.</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/17">Now is the time for radical reform of our prison system. If we just carry on as we are, our prisons will be even more overcrowded, the reoffending rate will go up and more crimes will be committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/18">I end my remarks by focusing on young criminals in prison. I have been contacted by Mr. Gordon Raku of Burton Latimer in Kettering, who is a retired Royal Signals captain. He said that he would very much like to see the introduction of some sort of military component in the reform of the attitude and behaviour of young and juvenile prisoners. I raise that point because I agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/19">In preparing for the debate I found that, as of <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-31">31 January</phrase>, there were 2,243 juvenile prisoners aged between 15 and 17 in our prison system and 9,420 young adult prisoners aged between 18 and 20&mdash;the figures were provided by the House of Commons Library&mdash;so a total of 11,663 young people, or 14 per cent. of the prison population, were aged 20 or under. Almost 50 per cent. of male juvenile offenders are serving sentences for either robbery or violence against the person.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/20">Mr. Raku, my constituent, is keen for a system to be devised whereby those young offenders are exposed to military discipline for a set length of time to correct their inappropriate attitude and behaviour. It would be a version of national service. He makes the point that in the 1950s and 1960s, lots of people who served time in national service did not particularly look forward to the experience but, looking back, time and again they say that those were the best years of their lives&mdash;all hon. Members will know of similar people from their constituencies. They say that they learned a lot about themselves; they gained self-respect and learned how far they could push themselves. As Mr. Raku asks, is it not possible to expose young prisoners, who are relatively few in number, to some sort of military discipline? I believe that if such a measure could be effectively applied at a young age, it would help to lower reoffending rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.28.1/21">There are already a number of Ministry of Defence initiatives for young offenders, including the Army Cadet Force's outreach programme, and the young offenders initiative by the Youth Justice Board and the MOD, which started in October 2004, focuses on youths aged between eight and 17. I urge the Minister and his counterparts in the MOD to look at whether there is some way of making greater use of the MOD's resources to get some of the very young offenders who find themselves in prison back on the straight and narrow at a relatively early stage.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-25a.29.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="29"  time="011:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/halltext/80325h0005.htm#0803252000606">
	<p pid="a.29.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on obtaining the debate, even if I do not agree with all that he has said.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/2">I have no specific knowledge or background on the issue, inasmuch as I do not have a prison in my constituency, but I have made it my responsibility to visit prisons in the area around my constituency on a regular basis in the past 11 or so years. I am indebted to my friend Tony Howarth, who was, for a long time, the chairman of the board of visitors at Gloucester prison. I have visited Gloucester Leyhill category D prison, Eastwood Park, the women's prison, and, on Good Friday, Ashfield young offenders institution to meet its new governor. In a previous incarnation, I taught the new governor business studies in a university department that taught people how to teach. I am not quite sure how she became a prison governor, but she was at Kilmarnock before arriving in Ashfield, so I may have done some good.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/3">Although I agree with what the hon. Gentleman has said about causes, I do not go along with the remedies that he has proposed, because they would take the evolution of prison policy backwards rather than forwards. In my experience, prison is not a pleasant place. The prisoners to whom I have spoken over the years do not want to be there; rather, they are there through circumstance. I agree with the hon. Gentleman's categorisation of why people end up in prison, and I do not believe that it was a parody.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/4">Some years ago, Gloucester prison conducted an anonymous snapshot poll of its population. It found that if it eliminated prisoners who had experienced more than three of mental illness, abuse as a child, learning disabilities allied to exclusion from school, drug and alcohol problems, and serious broken homes, including time in care, it would be left with only six prisoners out of a population of 350. I do not believe that all things are predetermined, but some people end up in prison because of their life experiences, which is why it is important to do things with them while they are in prison and in rehabilitation, and why we should spend money on resettlement and invest in people after prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/5">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that too many people become part of the revolving door syndrome, but that is no reason not do as much as we can to keep people out of prison. Prison is expensive, and it ruins lives. We must bear in mind that people are there because they have committed a crime, and the victims need to know that the perpetrators are serving time, but we must do as much as possible to prevent people from going back into prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/6">I want to concentrate on a small number of issues. People make generalisations and talk about the norm, but I have found anything but in prisons. Instead, I have found lots of good working and investment in education, for example. I am aware that a recent report was heavily critical of drugs policy, including counselling, assessment, referral, advice and through-care schemes, but the prisons that I have visited have worked incredibly hard on such matters as getting people to detox and to move on. There is a view that the best way for people to detox is to go to prison. I do not follow that logic, but we criticise the work done in prison medical and hospital services at our peril, because it is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/7">Despite the fact that there is underinvestment, I support moving prison medical responsibility to the NHS, although that has had the bizarre counter-productive effect of some people not knowing what medical conditions prisoners have. Of course, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS puts prison officers at risk. More particularly, I have heard of cases in which people who have epilepsy and diabetes have been difficult to treat, because such information is confidential unless the prisoner makes it known. Difficulties can result from such circumstances, at least in the short run.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/8">On the current issues, I make no apology for saying that I am not in favour of further privatisation. As I have said, however, I visited Ashfield, which is run by Securicor and found that it is a much better place now than it was when it first turned into a youth offender institution. However, that is largely because Securicor recruited top people from the public service to run the prison. It has stabilised the work force and introduced a proper regime for the prisoners, which is as it should be.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/9">I am not in favour of the National Offender Management Service&mdash;I have made my views on that known in previous debates&mdash;because I have always supported the independence of the probation service. I am worried that lumping the probation service under NOMS and regional offender management schemes will have entirely the wrong impact. The Prison Service is less concerned about the changes, but, if it sees them as a front for privatisation, organisations such as the Prison Officers Association will be more likely to flex their muscles in opposition. I am wary of those developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/10">I agree with the hon. Gentleman on titan prisons. I have been to Bristol prison&mdash;I have not been to Dartmoor but some of my constituents are resident there&mdash;and I worry about moving people further away from where they normally reside. There is a lot to be said for keeping people as locally as possible: their families can visit and, more importantly, proper provision can be made for them after they leave prison, so that they can re-enter their communities&mdash;hopefully with a job, somewhere to live and some purpose in life&mdash;rather than return to prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/11">Another issue on which I wish to concentrate does not relate to prison policy per se, but it is very current. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and Inquest are running a campaign on the use of restraint on young offenders. In the past week, we have had the Joint Committee on Human Rights report on the issue, which was a bit critical of the Minister's performance before the Committee, but I want to give him an opportunity to say where he is going. Of course, restraint needs to be used when people are incarcerated, particularly where young people might damage themselves or others, but the issue for me is staff training and the need for clear rules, as well as the need to ensure that people get medical support if they are injured. The Adam Rickwood and Gareth Myatt cases are still highly pertinent, and I worry about secure training places. We were supposed to be getting one at Sharpness in my constituency, but policy has changed, and we have kept the number of secure training centres to an absolute minimum. However, I question how they are run, the nature of the regime and how we deal with those who are potentially at risk or who cause problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/12">In my experience&mdash;this is purely anecdotal&mdash;the key to running any prison or young offenders institution is good leadership, and strong governors are vital. The regime must be transparent and clear to all concerned. We must ensure that the staff are as much a part of the decision-making process as the management. We must also ensure that the prisoners understand the regime and what they are expected to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/13">On the question of why we have so many foreign prisoners, the reason is very simple: we live in a much more mobile world now, and many more people choose to get on a plane and come to our part of the world. One suggestion, which has been put to be me on a couple of occasions&mdash;I would be grateful if the Minister were to respond to it&mdash;is that if we have a high prevalence of Jamaican, Nigerian and, to a lesser extent, Irish prisoners, we should look at paying to build jails in those countries and at investing properly in running them, so that we can return some people.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/14">One of the saddest things about going to Eastwood Park is the number of drug mules who, for whatever reason, have come from Jamaica. They will spend a good deal of time away from their families and are almost certainly completely naive. I do not go along with the idea that they did not really understand that what they were doing was not right, but they were naive about what would happen to them if they were arrested. Often, they will have been put under duress by male partners or by others who have got to them, and it is desperately sad to see them serving a sentence miles away from their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/15">We might be able to return such people to properly run prisons in Jamaica and Nigeria, and I hope that the Government will not see such expenditure as flippant, but as a serious suggestion. To put the issue in simple terms, it costs about &pound;4,000 per person to keep someone locked up in Jamaica, compared with &pound;50,000 to &pound;60,000 in this country. We could do something of mutual benefit on that, and I hope that the Minister will respond and see such investment as a genuine solution to the problem of the growing number of foreign prisoners.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/16">To conclude, I do not go along with simplistic remedies, because the situation in prisons is complex. Sadly, some people end up in prison, and we must treat them humanely, but we must also do much more to ensure that they do not return to prison, because of the cost to the public purse and, particularly, the cost to our communities, which have been ravaged by those problems.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.0/2">In Wellingborough, I run the &quot;Listening to Wellingborough and Rushden&quot; campaign, part of which involves gauging the views of my constituents. To that end, a survey goes out to all parts of the constituency on a rotating basis, and the No. 1 issue is always law and order. The answers to the detailed questions also reflect on prison policy and show that many of my constituents are fed up with people being sentenced to five years, only to finish up serving two. They do not think that the sentence fits the crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/3">My constituency includes Wellingborough prison, which is nearly always overcrowded. It has a large area of land but a relatively small amount of accommodation. Why is that accommodation not being expanded? The Government are interested in building very large prisons, but it would seem much more cost-effective just to expand prisons such as Wellingborough. I do not understand why that is not being done. I spoke to the governor, who said that only modest expansion is planned for the prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/4">I should declare an interest at this point. At 9.35 on Saturday night, I was sitting in my house about to watch England lose some wickets in the test match, when there was a loud explosion. Someone had attacked my house. They had stuck a stake through my front door. There was an enormous mess. The sound was the result of the panes of glass exploding and the vacuum going between them. Somebody, or a number of people, had walked up my road with a stake&mdash;my house is very accessible and is just in a row of ordinary detached houses&mdash;and stuck it through the front door.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/5">Do I want to see that person caught and put in prison? Well, the initial answer is yes. I believe that prison works, but would it work if that person was put there for six months? Probably not. The point that has been brought home to me by prison officers at Wellingborough prison, who have taken the time to come to see me in my surgery, is that they do not have enough time to deal with prisoners or to give them any sort of education or chance to get back into society in an improved situation. All that happens is that people go into prison, come out again and commit another crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/6">Those prison officers have put a radical proposal to me. When I first heard it, I thought that it was not a very good idea, but when I reflected on it, I realised that it had a lot of merit. Let us say that the person who attacked my house was caught and that the judge had the option of putting them in prison for six months. The prison officers I spoke to suggested that instead of being sent to prison, that person should be told, &quot;That's your last chance. We're not sending you to prison now. But if you reoffend, we will send you to prison for five years.&quot; The reason why they argued that was that if someone is in prison for that length of time, staff really have a chance to give them the education and training that they need so that they are in a position not to reoffend when they go back into society. When there are reoffending rates of 70 per cent. or 49 per cent., something is going dreadfully wrong. The proposal was a radical one, and came from someone who had worked in the prison service for a considerable number of years. I think that a variation of it would have some merit, and I urge the Minister to take the idea on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/7">An exciting thing that is happening in my constituency is the Rose project, which is based in Finedon and is, I believe, partly funded by the Home Office. It targets persistent offenders. As my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering mentioned, if we took the 50 persistent offenders out of Kettering, there would be hardly any crime. The police run the project, and they say that if it were possible to get hold of those persistent offenders, get them off drugs and into employment, get them decent housing and monitor them, they would not reoffend, and an enormous amount of crime would be prevented. I think that the project has been very successful. I know that it is due for more funding, and I do not know whether the Minister can speak about it in particular, but it is such projects, targeting persistent offenders, that probably create the most benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/8">As there is a prison in my constituency, the final point that I should make is that when the prison officers went on strike, I went to talk to them on the picket line. They are a terrific bunch of men and women, who dedicate their lives to public service. To be on a picket line was unnatural for them&mdash;they did not want to be there. They could not wait to get back to the prison, but they had been driven into a situation in which they felt they had no alternative. The Government were wholly wrong to break an agreement with a group of people who do not have&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-25a.38.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" speakername="Edward Garnier" colnum="38"  time="012:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/halltext/80325h0007.htm#0803252000612">
	<p pid="a.38.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing this debate and laying out his arguments so convincingly and powerfully. He was sufficiently candid to say that on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-28">28 March</phrase> last year, our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> introduced a similar debate. If one reads the <i>Hansard </i>for that debate and tomorrow's <i>Hansard </i>for today's, one will see a delicious similarity not just in their thoughts but in the words that they use. However, that does not matter, because it would seem to demonstrate that the Government have done nothing in the intervening 12 months to make anything that my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering said today less true than what my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley said this time last year, which is regrettable to say the least.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">In the past 12 months, I and my colleagues in the shadow Justice team have worked very hard and produced a paper, &quot;Prisons with a Purpose: our Sentencing and Rehabilitation Revolution to Break the Cycle of Crime&quot;. As my hon. Friends mentioned, breaking the cycle of crime is key to a number of the problems that the Government have&mdash;I was going to say supervised, but perhaps that is not the right word&mdash;been in charge of over the past 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">One of the things that always surprises me about the Secretary of State for Justice&mdash;I do not know why it still surprises me&mdash;is that he makes announcements or responds to criticism as if he had been in government for about four weeks, whereas, as we all know, he has been a senior member of the Government for the past 10 years and has twice been in charge of prison policy: once, during the first Parliament, as Home Secretary, and then, like an animal returning to its food, as Secretary of State for Justice&mdash;also know as the Lord High Chancellor of all England. In whichever guise, or dressing gown, he happens to be wearing, he has presided over a total farce in prisons policy. I wholly acquit the Minister, who has to work extremely hard under very difficult circumstances, being bundled from pillar to post, as some hare-brained scheme comes out of the Secretary of State's office that he has to implement.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">My criticism of the Government is this: we have an overcrowded prison estate that is not achieving what it should as a matter of justice, humanity or sensible economics. It is not surprising that my hon. Friends were able to advance arguments with such power, and which completely filleted the Government's competence in this public policy area.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/5">As my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering said, prisons are overcrowded. I rang the Ministry of Justice on Thursday, when I hoped that the weekly population figures would come out; Friday being Good Friday, we were promised that they would come out early. However, they had not been published before I arrived here, so I hope that the first thing that the Minister will do will be to provide us with the current prison population figure. I hope that it has gone down, rather than up, which it has done quite a lot, not because I think it a good idea to release people early from prison sentences, but because an overcrowded prison estate is an inefficient prison estate. We simply cannot mend prisoners&mdash;that is to say, reform them&mdash;and release them as better, law-abiding citizens with an overcrowded estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/6">All of my and my hon. Friends' arguments over the past several years in this area of public policy will not be responded to satisfactorily until the Government address the prison estate's incapacity to deal with the huge numbers of people that it has to accommodate. That is why our paper, &quot;Prisons with a Purpose&quot;, produces a hopeful prescription: by 2016, we will have dealt with the imbalance between prisoner numbers and prison capacity so that we can begin to reduce crime and, therefore, the need for people to be recycled back into the prison estate. That will prevent them from returning to our streets and villages and their life of crime&mdash;a life identified correctly by some of my hon. Friends as one fuelled largely by drug addiction. Until we deal with that and get those people of drugs and living cleanly, we will find it extremely difficult to prevent them from committing further crimes in order to fund their habit.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/7">Surely it is uncontroversial to say that our prisons are in crisis: the prison population has soared, jails are seriously overcrowded and reoffending rates have risen. Emergency measures, such as the end of custody licence, which was announced last June, have done nothing to manage the prison population sensibly or to restore or create public confidence in our criminal justice system. Now that we are nine months into the scheme, what effect has the introduction of ECL had on the prison population? The evidence suggests that despite the fact that the Government will release, over the 12-month period from last June, approximately 25,000 people, the prison population has gone up and, worse still, those released have gone on to commit, in the 18 days between early release and the end of their official sentence, many more crimes. One, I think, committed a homicide, but many others have committed other serious and violent crimes. It is no good the Government's managing the prison population by releasing early those not suitable to be so released. They should be planning and providing the prison estate with the capacity to deal with those deemed&mdash;at the discretion of the courts and in line with sentencing policy, as set out in statute&mdash;necessarily imprisonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/8">It seems clear that the prison system is not working. Building new prisons to accommodate those sentenced by the courts and to reduce overcrowding is essential, but it is not an end in itself. As has been identified, half of all crime is committed by previous offenders and one in five recorded crimes is committed by ex-prisoners. The right way to reduce the prison population is to break the cycle of reoffending and to reduce crime, which is why we need to invest much more political will and leadership and intellectual energy in the rehabilitation revolution. Those who enter prison should not simply be warehoused, left there and invited to come out again, but helped off drugs and taught to read and write, add up and to become employable, so that when they return to society, they can get a job, look after their families and dependents and, in doing so, get away from crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/9">We want a restoration of confidence in the criminal justice system, a re-design of our prisons for the 21st century and, as I said, a major effort to rehabilitate those who commit crimes to prevent them from doing so again. The fundamental reform required is based on the concepts of decentralisation, clear accountability, greater use of the voluntary and private sectors and the introduction of incentives through payment by results, which my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering touched on. I shall not recite the contents of our document, &quot;Prisons with a Purpose&quot;, which we produced earlier this month, but I recommend it to you, Mr. Cummings&mdash;I shall hold it up so that the Minister can see it. I hope that the shelves of the Ministry of Justice library are full of copies.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/10">People, including my hon. Friends, have complained about the lack of confidence in both community and custodial sentences. We must ensure that they are based on four pillars: punishment, of course; rehabilitation; work for offenders&mdash;real work inside prisons to get prisoners used to proper work, not the awful time-wasting occupations with which so many contend at the moment&mdash;and reparation for victims. Too often in the political debate about law and order and other such public policy issues, we forget about the victims. If criminals earn money in prison and put it into a fund to compensate their victims, the public and, in particular, victims will benefit greatly. My hon. Friends have talked about our sentencing reforms. I shall not outline them&mdash;time does not allow me&mdash;but again, they are well set out in our document, &quot;Prisons with a Purpose&quot;. I urge the Minister, his advisers and colleagues to read it and to study them.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/11">The short period available to me is at an end, but the debate will run and run. I hope that the Government, even after 10 years of messing around and failure, will get to grips with the issue and do something to improve the lives of our constituents, to improve our prisons and to reduce heavily the reoffending levels with which we must currently contend.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-25a.40.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" speakername="David Hanson" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice"  colnum="40"  time="012:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/halltext/80325h0007.htm#0803252000613">
	<p pid="a.40.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> for initiating this debate. I have been in my post as Minister with responsibility for prisons for about 10 months, and this is one of our first opportunities in Westminster Hall to debate prison policy, so I welcome it. I thank also <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> for his care and compassion for my welfare and my responsibilities in the Department. I share those concerns&mdash;for him and his Opposition Front-Bench team.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/2">In answer to the hon. and learned Gentleman's first question, as of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-20">20 March</phrase>, the date for which the last figures are available, 81,906 individuals were in prison. That is eight lower than one week ago, and not near the 82,180 figure, which was the highest ever published population figure, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-29">29 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/3">I also thank Members from all parts of the House for their contributions to the debate. I shall pull together some common themes, because throughout the parties and the Chamber today, we do have some common concerns. They are how we ensure that we prevent crime and prevent individuals from entering the criminal justice system in the first place; reducing crime and ensuring that when people are convicted, sufficient prison places are available; and, crucially, reducing reoffending so that people in the system go through it and&mdash;I hope, as the vast majority of individuals will&mdash;return to society in such a way that they do not continue committing crime and further offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/4">Important issues have been raised at the margins of that discussion. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> discussed restraint, and foreign national prisoners were mentioned. What we do with short sentences and how effective they are has been a key theme of the debate, as have the way in which we examine prison build and what we do about that, and the future of prison issues. There are some key challenges for all in the Government and the House to examine. First, how do we provide increased facilities to ensure that we keep dangerous, violent and sexual offenders in prison and ensure that prison places are available for them? Secondly, how do we help develop the reducing reoffending agenda in looking at the very issues that the hon. and learned Member for Harborough and the hon. Members for Kettering and for Shipley (Philip Davies) mentioned: employment, drugs, alcohol, rehabilitation, family links and a re-examination of how individuals return to the community? Thirdly, how do we strengthen and examine the effectiveness of community sentences?</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/5">First, on the availability of places, I shall not deny that there are challenges in the prison system. There are 81,000 people in prison, and about 82,000 places. Some 20,000 additional prisoners have gone to prison through additional capacity, and there has been extra pressure on that capacity over the past 10 years. That is partly because we are bringing more people to justice and picking up more offences than ever before, and because people are being given longer sentences than ever before. There is range of challenges leading to the prison population issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/6">We have responded, however, and I take slight exception to the point made by the hon. and learned Member for Harborough that there has been no Government action over the past 12 months. He knows that in December 2007, following Lord Carter's review, which Lord Falconer commissioned in May 2007, we announced additional prison places&mdash;20,000 new places by 2014, making a net total of 96,000 by 2014&mdash;and the decommissioning of 5,000 old prison places. Indeed, in the past 12 months alone, the capacity programme announced last year has delivered 2,227 places, and a further 1,900 places are planned in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/7">There have been a number of developments&mdash;for example, regarding places at Stoke Heath, Albany, Erlestoke, Ranby, Lewes and Wayland prisons. Indeed, if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr. Bone)</phrase> were still present, I would tell him what I told him in a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-28">28 January</phrase>&mdash;that we plan to build an extra accommodation block with 90 places in Wellingborough prison by next year. What he called for in the debate, we already plan to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/8">Many prison places are being built and it is important that we have them. I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase>. We have planned three, 2,500-strong titan prisons. They will be consulted on over the next few months, and we will issue a consultation document shortly. The plan is that the first titan prisons will not come on stream until perhaps 2011, 2012 or 2013, but their large scale will allow us to create small house-blocks in a large prison, enabling us to provide some of the interventions that Members have spoken of today in a cost-effective and efficient way for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/9">There are plans to build sufficient prison places, but the key question is what we do with the people in prison. The figures are still challenging, so I believe that we need to up our game on rehabilitation, on investment in employment opportunities, on tackling the drug problems that have been rightly singled out as leading to many crimes in our communities, and on reintegration. I refer all Members to the prison policy update paper that we published in January, which highlighted what we intend to do on drug treatment in and out of prison. It also highlighted what we need to do on increasing the number of drug rehabilitation orders and helping support further testing and security regarding drugs in prison; on employment, linking up with employers in the community to ensure that they can provide proper work and work with prison workshops in the community and in prison; and on making strong links with individuals who are on their way through the process, so that in prison they learn and develop skills that can be used outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/10">We all agree on the point that the hon. Member for Kettering made in his opening remarks: we have a problem with underperformance, literacy and numeracy, and with poor social background&mdash;often involving family break-up&mdash;leading individuals to crime. We must invest in those individuals not only because doing so is positive, but because it will, we hope, help them not to return to crime when they return to society, as undoubtedly they will.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.0/11">On foreign national prisoners, which several Members mentioned, we have more than 100 prisoner transfer agreements with countries throughout the world. We have successfully negotiated an agreement that all European Union prisoners should serve their sentences in their home countries. It will take effect from 2011 and should have a major impact on the foreign prisoner population in jails in England and Wales. We have recently negotiated a prisoner transfer agreement with Jamaica, as has been mentioned, and I am due to meet the Nigerian Interior Minister shortly to discuss a transfer agreement with him. Ireland forms part of the negotiations that will take effect from 2011.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.1/1">What will future historians write about one of the terrible disasters in British military history, one that ranks with the charge of the Light Brigade, the Somme and the Dardanelles? This debate is not about the mission to Afghanistan as a whole, which received almost universal approval from the House and still does so. I am not opposed to that mission; I was not opposed to it originally. However, the decision to go into Helmand province was a terrible mistake and plenty of warnings were given to the House before that decision was taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/2">I do not want our troops withdrawn from Afghanistan. There have been real advances in the country that are worth while and worth defending&mdash;improvements in democracy, in the education of women, and so on. Before the Helmand mission was launched in 2006 many of us took the view that our task was to defend such advances around Kabul and to consolidate them, but that to go into Helmand province would be to stir up a hornets nest.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/3">Let us look back on the reason that we went into Helmand province. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, who was the Secretary of State for Defence at the time, said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April 2006</phrase> during a visit to Afghanistan:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We are in the south to help and protect the Afghan people construct their own democracy. We would be perfectly happy to leave in three years and without firing one shot because our job is to protect the reconstruction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/5">I am sorry to say that those words are mocked by the subsequent events. There was not one shot fired; four million shots were discharged. At the beginning of 2006, only five British lives had been lost in Afghanistan. Now the total is 89 and there have been 330 serious injuries to troops, almost entirely as a result of our mission to Helmand province, a mission that has failed in every possible respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/6">There was a mission to reduce the opium being grown in Helmand province, which has utterly failed. In 2006, the production of opium in Afghanistan went up by 60 per cent. Last year, production went up again by nearly 17 per cent. Most of that increase in production took place in Helmand province. Helmand is bigger in terms of the acreage and production of illegal drugs than any country in the world and it is only a province. The mission to reduce opium growing has been an abject failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/7">An alternative, proposed by the Senlis Council policy group, was to use the opium production to create morphine, of which there is a world shortage. That alternative is used for opium produced in Turkey and in India, but our Government have not argued the case for it in Afghanistan, because of opposition from the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/8">All the other missions in Helmand province have failed, too. There has been some construction, but a pitifully small amount compared to our original ambition for the mission. When we went into Helmand province, our soldiers could move around with soft hats and they could talk and fraternise with the local population. Two years on, that is not the situation. In Helmand province our troops are no longer seen as an army of liberation but as an army of occupation.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/9">The situation gets worse. We have fractured our relationships with most of our allies and with the Karzai Government. We are in constant disagreement with the Americans, who call all the tunes in Afghanistan, especially on the question of whether they can bomb people into democracy. We know about the terrible toll of lives that have been lost since the mission to Helmand province started. At least 500 civilians have been killed. Some of them may have been members of the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but a great many of them were innocent civilians, including women and children, and we know the reaction that has been caused by their deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/10">Our mission was to win hearts and minds. Everyone agrees that there is no military solution in Helmand province or in Afghanistan and there is certainly no mileage in the belief that bombs and bullets can be used to win hearts and minds. We have gone backwards in combating drug production and backwards in winning hearts and minds.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/11">There has been a constant battle with the governors in Helmand province. There was a good governor&mdash;Engineer Mohammed Daoud&mdash;who was praised highly by the Secretary of State for Defence in Parliament in November 2006. In December 2006, however, he was sacked and replaced by a number of governors, in particular the Akhundzada brothers, one of whom was not allowed to take part in politics because he kept a private army and he was suspected of involvement in the narcotics trade, like many other governors and provincial police chiefs. We have had constant battles with those people.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/12">Matters came to a bit of a head on Christmas day last year, when our ambassador to Afghanistan was summoned to meet President Karzai and told that a number of British diplomats were in contact with the Taliban. Two diplomats, who happened to be very experienced, very skilled and Pashto-speaking were expelled from the country. At about the same time, Karzai attacked our troops and said that they had made the situation in Helmand &quot;worse&quot;, which was an incredible thing for that ingrate President to say when 89 of our soldiers had laid down their lives for his Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/13">We are in trouble as far as our allies in America are concerned, because they are convinced that the only way to deal with the opium production is to spray chemicals from the air. We are equally convinced that such a policy would lose further hearts and minds and turn a crisis into a hopeless situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/14">Relations with our allies in NATO have led to a two-tier NATO. We shall hear soon that the French are sending another 1,000 troops, but they will not send them into Kandahar and they certainly will not send them into Helmand. They will send them into a safe area&mdash;or at least a relatively safe area, because few areas in Afghanistan are entirely safe now.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/15">None of the other NATO partners has any intention of providing cavalry to come charging over the hill to help us out in the difficulties we face in Helmand province. We can see why it is so resistible. We could say to them, &quot;You could have come into Helmand province when we did. You could have come and helped us out. It is military force that will do it&quot;, but they can see the record&mdash;the silver record&mdash;of the deaths that we have suffered. They have suffered some deaths&mdash;Germany has suffered some deaths, and so on&mdash;but they will not be persuaded to come into the hopeless situation in Helmand province, where the hornets nest has produced hornets with a deadly sting.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/16">Canada is thinking seriously about pulling out of Helmand province. Proportionally, it has suffered more than any other nation; it has 2,500 troops there and lost 78 soldiers. However, at least in Canada such matters are debated in Parliament. We have never had a proper debate in this place. We did not have a debate about going into Helmand province. We had a mini-debate in March 2006, which took place here in Westminster Hall, when warnings were given, but there was no vote and only about six or seven MPs attended. We have never had a proper debate on the situation that we are in now, which is why I am pleading this morning that we should consider the disaster more closely before we continue with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/17">We can look at the situation in relation to our casualties, but it is difficult to establish the precise figures overall. However, according to <i>The Independent</i>, in 2007 at least 6,000 civilians died in the conflict across Afghanistan, mostly in Helmand province, and 1,400 of them were civilians. Furthermore, at least 500 of those deaths were directly attributed to NATO forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/18">What can we do? We have been moving along in Afghanistan in a state of denial. We have used the fact that other NATO countries are not helping out as an excuse for not thinking and not facing up to the abject failures in every sense of the Helmand disaster. The time has come for a debate in Parliament, in the House itself, and for a decision. I plead with the Minister to tell the Government that we need a review. We already have enough reviews and we complain that there are too many of them, but we need to know about the position in Helmand province. Where is the hope? On what basis are we continuing to send young men to die?</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/19">The Americans gave their assessment of the situation a month ago, when the US director of national intelligence made his report. Where are we now, after having been in Afghanistan, having pumped in &pound;3 billion of aid, and after the sacrifice of life? We have spent &pound;250 million of taxpayers' money only to increase the output of drugs, the consequence of which is that the street price of drugs in Britain is the lowest it has ever been. The situation is utterly and abjectly disastrous.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/20">Where is the good? Where is the success? The American director of national intelligence has said that</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/21" class="indent">&quot;although international forces and the Afghan National Army continue to score tactical victories over the Taliban, the security situation has deteriorated in some areas in the south&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/22">particularly Helmand&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/23" class="indent">&quot;and Taliban forces have expanded their operations into previously peaceful areas of the west and around Kabul.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/24">The situation is worse than things simply failing in Helmand. The victories that the Taliban have chalked up there have emboldened them to attack Kabul. If we had taken a different decision in 2006, and defended Kabul, we could have been in a strong position, but we believed the myth that we could somehow get all the warring factions together&mdash;the Pashtuns, Baluchis, Uzbeks and Tajiks&mdash;to form a Scandinavian-like democracy of peace and harmony. That will not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/25">In 2001, a member of the Russian Duma said to me, &quot;You British have gone into Afghanistan and conquered it in a few days&mdash;very clever! We Russians did that in six days, but we stayed there for nine years, killing a million Afghans and losing 15,000 of our soldiers. When we left, there were 300,000 mujaheddin surrounding Kabul. That will happen to you.&quot; His words were prophetic. Where are we now? Are we making progress? We shall not be staying for only three more years. No one believes that we will be out of Helmand province by next year. There is even talk of us being there for 38 years. That was the forecast of a military chief, when he was asked whether we would be there for as long as we have been in past wars. He replied, &quot;Yes, at least as long.&quot; One of those wars lasted for 38 years, and in one of them, only one British soldier came out alive.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/26">There is a terrible history for foreign occupation and invasions of Afghanistan. The situation of the past few years is uncannily like that of Saigon. There are now 10,000 non-governmental organisation representatives in Kabul. They are swanning around in their bullet-proof land cruisers, going from meeting to party and from party to reception, spending huge amounts of public money, mostly on themselves, but with little to show for it. That was precisely the situation in Saigon when General Westmoreland was cheering himself on and giving hope to the nation by publishing lists of the numbers of enemy who had been killed. We are doing the same thing when we try to shore up our belief in the situation by publishing lists of the killed and saying that we are making progress, but we are not. We are going deeper and deeper into a vortex of disaster, blood, shame and failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/27">The Government must realise that the disaster is continuing and they must take a stand against it. We can do something about the drug situation, but there is a practical problem with standing up to the Americans. We are in an impossible situation. We have put out a leaflet saying that we will not destroy drug crops&mdash;rightly so, to stop the attacks&mdash;and that we will not destroy farmers' only means of production, but 16 separate organisations in Kabul deal with reducing the number of drug crops. They are achieving nothing, as few NGOs will go into the Helmand province, but we continue to be in denial.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/28">The comparison with Vietnam is powerful. The problem is that we have Governments and Ministers who do not read history and who did not live through previous wars. They have not witnessed the past disasters that many of us have seen and lived through. The situation precisely parallels that of Vietnam. We seem to be an army of occupation, and the centre is crumbling. The American Defence Secretary set out the precise, bleak position that we are in. Less than a third of the country is controlled by Karzai, 10 per cent. is controlled by the Taliban, and the remaining 60 per cent. is run by a group of lawless, oppressive warlords, narco-barons and a range of people with whom we certainly would not want to do business. There has been oppression over many years. Karzai is looking after his diminishing empire in the centre, while we are losing lives for the cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/29">I want to give the Minister a chance to reply at length, because I would like him to answer these questions. What is going right? What hope is there for the future? Why is everything that we are doing in Afghanistan, including our achievements on the number of children in school, declining under attack? There is a move to the harsher, Taliban view of life, which is being accepted not only in areas that are controlled by the Taliban and warlords, but in those that are allegedly controlled by Karzai.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/30">The area for which we have the greatest responsibility is that for which we, in the House, take decisions. This afternoon, we are to debate our decision to send troops to war in Iraq, but at least that was a decision of the House. The Canadian Government will soon decide whether to withdraw their troops, which they have threatened to do unless 1,000 more go in. A thousand more will go, but not to the dangerous areas. NATO is fracturing before our eyes. That precious alliance has served us well, but the divisions are deep and growing worse. Our relationship with Karzai is at rock bottom, and it is questionable whether we should treat him as an ally, as we once did, because of his insult to our British soldiers and because of his suggestion that their sacrifices have not been beneficial and have even made matters worse. We are flooding the world with drugs. Our mission was to reduce them, but that has failed utterly.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/31">My final point is about our feelings towards the soldiers who die. Nothing that I say on the matter should take away from my admiration, and that of the whole House, of the extraordinary courage and professionalism of our men and women who have served so splendidly, and with rare heroism, in Afghanistan, especially in Helmand. But will we number them on our war memorials in future? I think of the Welsh national war memorial in Cardiff, which is garlanded with an englyn, two lines of which recall the sacrifice of soldiers:</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/32" class="indent">&quot;Dros ei wlad fe rodd ei lw,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/33" class="indent">Dros f&ocirc;r fe aeth i farw.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/34">For his country, he gave his oath, over the sea he went to die.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/35">The situation in Afghanistan has been compared with another Great British disaster: our mission into Helmand has been as futile, militarily, as the charge of the Light Brigade. One could bring that verse up to date by saying that when the troops went into Afghanistan, they had</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/36" class="indent">&quot;Blair to the left of them,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/37" class="indent">Bush to the right of them,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/38" class="indent">Hollered and thundered,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/39" class="indent">Theirs not to reason why,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/40" class="indent">Theirs but to do and die,</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/41" class="indent">Into the valley of Death</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/42" class="indent">Into the mouth of Helmand</p>
	<p pid="a.44.1/43" class="indent">Rode the seven thousand.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.48.0/1">I welcome the ongoing interest that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> has shown in our mission in Afghanistan, especially in Helmand province. It is a subject of the utmost importance, which it is good to debate again today. However, the debate should take place openly and with an acceptance of all the facts, and it should not become skewed by perceptions of and assertions about particular elements of what is a truly multifaceted campaign. What our people are doing in Afghanistan is profoundly impressive&mdash;indeed humbling&mdash;to watch, and it must be viewed in the round with all its elements accounted for. I am afraid that my hon. Friend's doom-laden contribution is a travesty of what is happening in Afghanistan and of our policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/2">The 2004 constitution of Afghanistan begins:</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We the people of Afghanistan realise the previous injustices and innumerable disasters which have befallen our country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/4">Above all, our 7,800 people in that beautiful country are motivated by a determination to make a difference for the better, enable the Afghans to put right those injustices and avoid further disasters. It is difficult for us in this House to appreciate that often the more austere the conditions our soldiers work in, the more they relish the task&mdash;adversity and hardship breed camaraderie and satisfaction. That is precisely the kind of benevolent but hard soldiering that they joined the armed forces to do and that they have been trained for.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/5">Our people are providing the secure space for our partner organisations&mdash;whether British, international or Afghan&mdash;to spread development, reconstruction, stability, governance and the rule of law. Even the most cursory glance at history reveals that western ideals imposed upon Afghanistan do not work. Only solutions of Afghan provenance and with Afghans at their centre will endure, which is precisely what we are enabling.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/6">We have made progress. It might not look much like the Cotswolds, but there have been improvements in Afghanistan, which for so long has been one of the most lawless and troubled nations on earth. I have seen it myself. I was in Musa Qaleh last month, and the recent operations in that crucial town, which was previously characterised as hopeless, have confounded the most sceptical. Faced with measured and relentless pressure, with the Afghan national army in the vanguard having been mentored by us, the demoralised Taliban turned tail and fled in disarray. Despite the tragedy of a fatality on our side, it was a successful operation that maximised consent and minimised damage. The Musa Qaleh operation met all of its objectives in what is an infinitely complicated and ambiguous operating environment. We enabled the re-establishment of the Afghan Government's mandate without providing those who seek to destabilise it the opportunity that they crave.</p>
	<p pid="a.48.0/7">Our role is not about military operations in isolation, and every soldier whom I have met knows that. It is about what comes next, what those operations enable and what follows in their wake. Seven weeks after operations concluded, a school opened in Musa Qaleh for the first time in years. That was quick by anyone's standards, but doubly so against Afghan timelines. Every soldier knew that the job was not about killing the Taliban, but about winning the people. My hon. Friend has said that it was about kill lists. I have been the Minister for almost a year, and I have never seen a kill list or seen our troops present their progress in the way in which he suggested&mdash;it is simply not true. If he has any evidence that our troops present their victories as kill lists, he had better give it to us, because I certainly have not seen it.</p>

	<p pid="a.49.1/1">No, I will not give way. My hon. Friend took more than half the time, and I have little time to reply to the points that he has made.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/2">To be clear, had we not taken military action in Musa Qaleh last year, Taliban brutality would still be in the ascendant and the children would have no school. What I have just described is an example&mdash;just a microcosm&mdash;of what we are attempting through the comprehensive approach, and part of that approach is in counter-narcotics. That is for two profoundly important reasons. First, Afghanistan simply cannot develop and build itself as long as its foundation is an illegal narco economy. Secondly, the product of that economy, heroin, wreaks untold misery both within Afghanistan and more widely. We should remember that almost all the heroin on our streets originates in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/3">We attack that trade through a multi-dimensional and sophisticated approach. Eradication focuses on those for whom alternative livelihoods are available&mdash;the targets are the greedy and not the needy. The targets are the wealthy facilitators, financiers and traffickers, not the unfortunate poor who are forced to grow opium by the brutal landowners who lurk in the shadows, and our attention is focused on those landowners. It must be remembered that our involvement in those efforts is necessarily a supporting one: Afghans are in the lead, as they should be, from President Karzai down. Some progress has been made: in 2007, the number of poppy-free provinces in Afghanistan more than doubled from six to 13.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.1/4">My hon. Friend has said that we do not raise some of those issues because of the Americans. We do not raise some of those issues because we are in a country at the invitation of its Government. Importantly, as he knows and mentioned throughout his contribution, Afghans lead on those policy areas. The Afghan Government build their own capacity, and we do not take over and dictate to them. My hon. Friend has decried American policy on aerial spraying, but knows that the Americans cannot engage in aerial spraying without the agreement of the Afghan Government. We agree with the Afghan Government that that would not be a step forward or an appropriate way of tackling narcotics cultivation in Helmand province and elsewhere in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">I will give way if I have time, but my hon. Friend has left me little time to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">Just as no state can exist on illegal economic foundations, one cannot be built on fear. The Taliban have learnt that to their cost and are hated by the people they seek to oppress. That provides us and the legitimate Government of Afghanistan with an opportunity, and operations such as that at Musa Qaleh exploit such opportunities. The Taliban are a desperate and divided enemy who are increasingly reliant upon asymmetric tactics, suicide bombers and land mines. Vile though those tactics are, they represent disarray, and the atrocities widen the chasm between the Taliban and the Afghan people.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">Our mission in Afghanistan is part of an international coalition, which is NATO-led and Afghan-invited. We are supporting the Afghan Government and enabling them to spread the rule of law and democracy&mdash;Afghan democracy. We cannot simply sit back, renege on our commitments and allow Afghanistan once again to fail and return to the dark ages. To do so would allow renewed sanctuary for the terrorists who seek to attack us. Similarly, we should not allow Afghanistan to be sacrificed to an illegal and appalling opium economy. Instead, without imposing our own ideals, we must support the growth of Afghanistan into a nation of stability&mdash;a nation whose people live with confidence, freely and without fear. That process will be neither easy nor quick, as I have said to my hon. Friend. It cannot be pursued without the dedication, bravery and ingenuity of our armed forces personnel, of whom we should be very proud, and I am enormously pleased by what my hon. Friend has said about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">I shall say a few words about licit production. Even in Helmand, where production is high, as my hon. Friend has said, only a third of the arable, cultivated land is under poppy cultivation. To allow licit cultivation of heroin would risk drawing people even further into poppy cultivation, when they ought to be growing food for their own consumption or potentially for exportation in niche markets, thereby assisting their own economy. Those are the reasons why we do not support it. It is not because the Americans tell us not to, but because the Afghan Government are against it and because it does not make sense.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.1/1">It is a pleasure to introduce the debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings, and to seek a response from my hon. and good Friend the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/2">Let me start by saying that I am in favour of there being public open spaces where people, especially those in urban environments, can relax, play and enjoy leisure time. Town and village greens have a long history of being well used and appreciated by their communities. They allow, almost literally, a breath of fresh air to enter our urban environments. I have no problem, in principle, with areas of land that might be considered as town and village greens in all but name being legally recognised and registered and protected as such. That right has been recognised in law for many years and was reinforced by the Commons Act 2006. I served on the Standing Committee that considered that legislation, but I have to say that the changes that we made did not fully address the problematic issues that I shall raise today.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/3">My worry is that over the years, we have established a body of legislation that allows the law to be used in ways that were not intended by Parliament. That misuse is tantamount to abuse when it is used deliberately to thwart an otherwise legitimate planning permission. In High Peak, that has now produced a crisis in the planning process. Although the 2006 Act gave the authorities that decide on town and village green applications the power to reject repeat applications and those that are clearly vexatious, neither of those criteria has been sufficient to prevent misuse entirely, and many pre-2006 applications continue to wreak havoc with the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/4">Although High Peak borough council is Conservative controlled, we speak with one voice on this matter. The leader of the local Liberal Democrats, the former leader of the council, also agrees. In a story in the local paper entitled &quot;New Law to Stop Nimbys&quot;, he said that the vast majority of people should not be denied what they want because one or two people thought that a TVG application was a good way of stopping development. That problem is not unknown elsewhere, but it is rife in High Peak.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/5">In my area, Derbyshire county council is the authority charged with processing TVG applications. It is currently dealing with about 20, of which half relate to High Peak. All but two of those relate to Buxton, with more believed to be in the pipeline. From that authority's discussions with specialist lawyers and other registration authorities, it seems that no other registration authority in the country has as many TVG applications as Derbyshire. It has recently increased the number of staff working on TVG applications in order to try to address the backlog of casework. I shall explain what is happening through the use of several examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/6">First, High Peak borough council, like every other local authority, has a house building programme that has been consulted on and endorsed by the local plan. The building of affordable and social rented housing has become more important than ever, as local authorities and Government together strive to reach ambitious targets to cope with Britain's demographic challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/7">The largest single planned housing development in High Peak is off Dale lane, in Buxton. That would be a mixed development of about 300 homes, a substantial proportion of which would be affordable or rented. It would be adjacent to a large council estate in Fairfield and its access would be from an area known as Fairfield common. That name is a bit of a giveaway: Fairfield common is a genuine area of common land on the edge of Buxton, between the town and the golf course. From a new roundabout on the A6, a small access road needs to be built to make the Dale lane site accessible both to future residents and, in the shorter term, to construction vehicles, but today not a single brick has been laid, nor a sod turned.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/8">Three of the TVG applications&mdash;those submitted way back in 2002&mdash;have been processed. In April 2007, the High Court ordered that the town and village green register should be amended by the deletion of a previously recorded town green entry. At present, Fairfield common is free of town green status, which should allow the access road and therefore the homes to be built. A fourth application, registered in March 2003, does not directly affect the site of the proposed development, but a fifth, called VG86, was held in abeyance until that High Court action was completed. That happened almost a year ago, but VG86 remains unresolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/9">Last week, a sixth application affecting the proposed development was made. It is known as VG101. I am pleased that Derbyshire now regards this as a priority site for the determination of TVG applications and will be taking that one together with the outstanding VG86. However, I am not optimistic of a rapid solution, as VG86 has remained unresolved since it was lodged in October 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/10">There are 2,732 people waiting for homes in High Peak, and the Fairfield development of 300 mixed homes could have made a significant hole in that backlog. It is my contention that the targets of the TVG applications were picked so as to thwart the building of the access road to the proposed Dale lane estate, as the site of the development itself continues to be free of town green applications. Although that was the largest housing development proposed in the local plan, would it not have been sensible to have identified other sites around the town of Buxton where housing development could take place? Indeed it would.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/11">My second example is Hogshaw field in Buxton, which is reclaimed land. It was once a tip and therefore was never a village green. It is also earmarked for housing development in the local plan. In December 2003, a town green application was lodged&mdash;again, not in respect of the site itself, but of the land that would be needed to provide access to it. The application has yet to be resolved and will not be addressed until the Fairfield cases are over. In 2004, High Peak borough council's report on objections to the local plan stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/12" class="indent">&quot;The TVG applications have the potential to fundamentally thwart the housing strategy for Buxton. If the Fairfield Link Road and the access to Hogshaw cannot be built, the two most important housing sites in Buxton would be stymied.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/13">The third example is at the other end of the constituency, in Glossop, where 25 new homes, including eight classed as affordable, are planned on an infill site at Sumners place. In March 2006, a town green application was lodged, and a public inquiry will be held this summer, as that, too, is now regarded as a priority case.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/14">It is not only housing developments that are being thwarted by the use of TVG applications. My fourth example is High Peak magistrates court. The 650 square miles of High Peak were, until recently, served by two magistrates courts&mdash;at Glossop and Buxton, 18 miles apart. In May 2002, planning permission was given for a new courthouse to be built adjacent to New Mills town hall, in the centre of the borough, on the site of a burned-out and derelict former Methodist church. It was planned that that new facility would replace both existing courts and the local county court.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/15">Planning permission is but the start of the process, and a campaign led by residents living close to the proposed site gathered pace. Building had not commenced when, in March 2004, a TVG application was made. Clearly, a burned-out shell of a building to which there is no public access cannot be reclassified as a town green, but the campaign focused on a tiny patch of land to the rear of the premises that would be required for access purposes. Four years on, that application remains unresolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/16">[Mr. Peter Atkinson <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/17">One possible outcome, I should remind hon. Members, is provided for in the commons legislation, which says that if that land were to be designated a town green&mdash;a claim that is by no means certain to be agreed&mdash;the authority could resolve the issue by identifying an appropriate alternative piece of land to fulfil the same function elsewhere in order to allow the development to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/18">In January 2007, the Court Service, quite rightly, closed Glossop court because of its inadequate access and security. All its cases and those of the county court, which closed at the same time, were transferred to Buxton magistrates court. That court has slightly better facilities than Glossop had, but even so, the court is up two flights of spiral stairs with no lift, security is so poor that prisoners on remand have to be tried elsewhere, privacy for solicitors and clients is limited to two booths constructed within the waiting room, prosecution and defence witnesses share the same waiting facilities, and the staff accommodation and facilities for magistrates are simply appalling.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/19">The TVG application lodged in 2004 has yet to be decided, but the Court Service has made a decision. Because of the protracted delay in the commencement of the development of the new courthouse caused by the TVG application, the plans fell out of the 2005-08 spending round and are now, effectively, scrapped. There are no plans in the 2008-11 spending round to provide High Peak with a courthouse that meets the demands and standards of the 21st century. That is a tragedy caused by the action of nimbys who used town green legislation in a cavalier manner outwith the purposes for which it was designed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-25a.63.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" speakername="Tom Levitt" colnum="63"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080325/halltext/80325h0010.htm#0803252000633">
	<p pid="a.63.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He also served with me on the Standing Committee that considered the Commons Bill a couple of years ago. I will make some suggestions towards the end of my speech as to how we might address that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/2">The fifth example is at St. Thomas More secondary school, which announced plans to build a new sports hall within its existing footprint in Buxton. A large proportion of the funding of the building was to come from the sale of a piece of unused and waterlogged farmland, which was owned by Derbyshire county council and is situated about half a mile from the school. Although I understand that the schoolchildren used the land for cross-country running, it is not a sports field and not technically part of the school. The land was on the fringe of the built-up area of Buxton and has potential for development. However, houses would have spoiled the view from one or two large private homes, so what did the residents do? They submitted a TVG application. The field could not be sold for development and the funding stream for the sports hall dried up, which threatened to derail the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/3">I met representatives of the county council, the school, the borough council and the diocesan education board and together we expressed our determination to press ahead with the project. Fortunately, a different financial arrangement was found, which resulted in a mere six-month delay, and the hall is now being built, but the TVG issue on the site off Brown Edge road remains unresolved. As there is no planning application involved, that application is not being treated as a priority, and there is, as yet, no timetable for resolving it. That resolution would have to be made by a body other than Derbyshire county council because, as owners of the land, it cannot pass a judgment.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/4">My last example involves Buxton leisure centre. Two weeks ago, two sisters called Dorothy and Margaret came to see me. They own a very small farm on the outskirts of Buxton. The farm includes a field that is bounded on one side by a wooded hillside owned by the Civic Association, on another side by private housing and on a third by a school playing field. Buxton community school is a sports specialist school and it is therefore not surprising that High Peak borough council is considering using this site, adjacent to the school land, to relocate its swimming pool and develop a leisure centre. Development can be sniffed in the air, so what happens? Someone who may have once flown a kite on this field or walked their dog there&mdash;albeit while trespassing&mdash;puts in a town green application to protect the land from yet another socially valuable development. Whatever the merits of the case, we know that it will be years before this application is considered. Meanwhile, the sisters have to live with uncertainty, and the council has to look for another piece of land that is potentially more viable to develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/5">Dorothy and Margaret were close to tears in my office. They are ladies of mature years and the field represents their retirement fund. A successful town green application would make the land next to worthless, effectively leaving them destitute and unable to plan for their retirement. That is not something the authorities can take into account when deciding on the merits of the case for a TVG.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/6">In summary, more than 500 new homes, two leisure developments and a courthouse have all been put in jeopardy through the deliberate targeting of sites with TVG applications by people whose first thought is to stop legal, legitimate and much-needed developments, and whose passion for open spaces is, at best, secondary to that aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/7">In a letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-03">3 March</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase>, said that the &quot;balance is about right&quot; in the way in which TVG applications operate. However, Eversheds solicitors, writing in <i>Planning Magazine </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-14">14 March</phrase>, takes a contrary view:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The delay involved in a registration application can be just as important as its chances of success...Many cynical applications have been made with the clear intention to cause delay and cost.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/9">It describes as &quot;effectively impossible&quot; the process of having land removed from the register once it has been included. It notes, too, that councils and developers cannot reclaim costs from TVG applicants whose applications fail, even if the delays have caused great expense, often to the taxpayer, or the loss of an approved planning development. In short, Eversheds is warning of a crisis in the planning world caused by TVGs. Citing examples from all over the country, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The full picture should strike fear into the hearts of private landowners and agencies trying to deliver housing and regeneration targets.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/11">In another letter from the DCLG, to High Peak borough council in February, officials said:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/12" class="indent">&quot;It is hardly surprising if communities spring to the defence of a valued site only once a change of use is proposed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/13">Such naivety is frankly staggering. There is no evidence to suggest that it is the communities that are making TVG applications. It is clever individuals who see a way of putting a spanner in the works of a development that has local support and the endorsement of the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/14">In my experience, it is developments that are required by, or advantageous to, communities that are being hit by this blight. In one instance, the council was told by the DCLG:</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/15" class="indent">&quot;While it can be frustrating to have a particular site removed from consideration for housing in consequence of its registration as a new green, a local authority's housing strategy should be sufficiently robust and diverse to accommodate such difficulties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/16">The civil servant who wrote that is simply showing ignorance of the local situation. Brownfield sites are few and far between in High Peak, so when campaigners make a concerted effort to attack every major greenfield development with a town green application, and when most of a borough is contained within a national park in which there is simply no chance of significant housing development, the planning experts at the DCLG are effectively telling the council to like it or lump it.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/17">With my endorsement, the council asked for a prohibition on TVG applications being made after a planning application has been submitted, and special measures to deal with potentially vindictive applications that would not be in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/18">Private landowners such as Dorothy and Margaret need special protection, so that their lifetime assets are not lost by the removal of development rights on private land that would follow a successful TVG application. Secondly&mdash;this covers the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>&mdash;we should make it compulsory for local authorities to include town and village greens in the local plan. That way, the need for public open spaces would have to be taken into account alongside other developments and not piecemeal, in conflict with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/19">In 2006, there were 77 TVG applications across the country. In 2007, that figure more than doubled to 172. Unfortunately, that trend does not reflect a growing interest in access rights, the enjoyment of the countryside or the value of green lungs within urban environments. What it does reflect is that an increasing number of campaigners have discovered a low-cost, low-risk, low-effort way of delaying the development of sites, often to the extent of preventing the delivery of socially valuable projects, whether their TVG application is successful or not. &quot;Crisis&quot; is not too fine a word to describe the situation, and all the signs are that this misuse, bordering on abuse, of an otherwise beneficial law is going to make planning blight ever worse. We have created a virus that is loose in the planning system. I call upon my hon. Friend the Minister and his colleagues in the DCLG to stop it in its tracks and let sanity, balance and responsible government prevail in the planning system.</p>
