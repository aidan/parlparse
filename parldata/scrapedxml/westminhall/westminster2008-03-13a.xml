<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13a.115.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="115"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080313/halltext/80313h0001.htm#08031362000240">
	<p pid="a.115.2/1">As Chair of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, I am grateful to have the opportunity to introduce the debate on our report on older people in health care,.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/2">It is sometimes argued&mdash;by politicians who should know better, and by the tabloid press&mdash;that human rights exist only to protect unpopular minority groups in society such as criminals, suspected terrorists and asylum seekers. Human rights, they proclaim, are nothing to do with ordinary people, but that argument is a travesty of the truth.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/3">Human rights apply to us all. They are not just for those people on the fringes of society for whom public sympathy is low or non-existent. Vulnerable people in the mainstream are in real need of the protection of human rights law. For example, older people in hospitals and residential care homes, the subject of our report, need such protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/4">There is a growing recognition among pensioners that human rights are vital to their well-being. That explains the enormous outcry over the consequences of the &quot;YL&quot; case, to which I shall refer later, as its outcome has deprived older people of protection in private and voluntary-sector care homes. My Committee's work rightly embraces the universality of human rights by examining and reporting on popular and unpopular causes alike. To illustrate that universality of human rights, we could not have chosen a better example than the one that we are debating this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/5">The numbers of older people&mdash;inevitably the main users of the NHS&mdash;are growing. Some 80 per cent. of NHS resources and 80 per cent. of staff time are devoted to the over-65s. Two thirds of general and acute hospital beds are occupied by people aged 65 and over but, as the British Institute of Human Rights has made clear, the human rights of older people are particularly invisible in society. So we decided to bring the human rights of older people in health care into the political spotlight and, by illuminating the respect&mdash;or lack of it&mdash;for those rights, to make their cause visible to all. Victimisation or neglect of older people in health care raises any number of serious human rights issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/6">We heard about, and saw, a lot of good practice, and our visit to Edgware hospital in my constituency is an example of that. In care homes, we met staff with low status and poor pay who were really committed to looking after the people in their charge. However, although 79 per cent. of care homes meet the minimum standards, that means that 21 per cent. do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/7">Depressingly, but not surprisingly, we received an overwhelming volume of evidence about the problems that exist from staff working for the various inspectorates, service providers and non-governmental organisations. We were told about malnutrition and dehydration; abuse and rough treatment; lack of privacy in mixed sex wards; lack of dignity and respect for confidentiality; neglect, carelessness and poor hygiene; inappropriate medication and use of physical restraint; inadequate assessment of a person's needs; too hasty a discharge from hospital; bullying, patronising and infantilising attitudes towards older people; age discrimination; communication difficulties; fear of making complaints, and eviction from care homes. All those things are human rights issues that can infringe the European convention on human rights and the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/8">Abuse of the elderly can be psychological, physical, financial or sexual. According to Age Concern, half a million people in the UK suffer abuse. Some 23 per cent. of reports to Action on Elder Abuse's helpline relate to abuse in care homes, and 5 per cent. to abuse in hospitals. In our view, elder abuse is a serious and severe human rights issue. It is perpetrated on vulnerable older people who often depend for their care on the very people who abuse them.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/9">Elder abuse is not just a betrayal of trust&mdash;it can also amount to a criminal offence. We heard of an 80-year-old lady who was sexually assaulted, yet no action was taken. Criminality is downgraded by being classed as abuse. We also identified that as a problem in our recent report on the human rights of adults with learning disabilities. If a person is the victim of a serious crime, that crime should be treated as such and not trivialised because of the vulnerability of the victim.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/10">I turn now to neglect and carelessness. The Committee heard examples of death arising from poor hygiene, and about problems with personal care, such as people being left in their own waste. We heard of one patient who asked for a urine bottle for one and a half hours, only for his relatives to be told, &quot;It doesn't matter if he wets the bed, we'll change the sheets.&quot; Where is the dignity there?</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/11">Patients were moved for non-clinical reasons, sometimes at night. Older people's spectacles, false teeth or hearing aids were thoughtlessly left out of their reach by staff. Patients were left for hours in reception without food or drink as they waited to be taken home or to another hospital. At Edgware Hospital, we met an old lady and her daughter-in-law. The old lady had been discharged there from Barnet hospital, in whose discharge lounge she had been left for most of the day&mdash;in her night clothes, with her belongings in her lap in a clear plastic bag but without refreshment.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/12">Medical problems are not addressed until they become critical. We were told of an 89-year-old who was admitted to hospital from her care home with pressure sores and dehydration, because the care home said that it was &quot;not our job&quot; to deal with such matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/13">A number of witnesses raised concerns about malnutrition and dehydration. In 2006, the Healthcare Commission found that 20 per cent. of adult in-patients needed help with their meals, but that nearly 40 per cent. of those never, or only sometimes, received help. That led to uneaten meals being taken away from patients who needed help to eat them. In one case, that happened because it was not clear whether it was the job of the nurse or the care assistant to help.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/14">However, we heard examples of good practice too, such as the use of red trays for patients who need assistance. I recently heard about a volunteer scheme at the Royal Free hospital, where volunteers help with what can be a time intensive and difficult job.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/15">The Committee was told about the inappropriate use of medication, especially in care homes. Neuroleptic sedatives were used to keep difficult patients with dementia quiet, even though those drugs are not licensed for that purpose. We heard about a general practitioner who, without first examining her, prescribed sleeping pills to a care home resident with mild dementia to prevent her from disturbing staff at night.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/16">The lack of privacy, dignity and confidentiality is a serious problem that has a significant detrimental impact on older people in health care. A number of witnesses spoke about mixed-sex wards. Not all of them opposed the continued use of such wards, but everyone raised serious concerns about privacy. Witnesses complained about sensitive medical advice being given to a patient on the ward within earshot of other patients, and about staff having conversations among themselves while attending to patients' intimate care needs&mdash;in other words, just talking over the people in their charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/17">The delayed discharge regulations were mentioned by a number of witnesses. In principle, it is important to ensure that patients do not stay longer in hospital than necessary. However, 16 per cent. of over-75s are re-admitted within 28 days, compared with only 10 per cent. of those aged 16 to 75, which prompts the question about whether decisions to discharge are made prematurely. In one case, the wife of a patient died: his son wanted to attend his mother's funeral, but the hospital decided to discharge his father on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/18">Moving into care can be a life-changing event for many old people. They may have lived in their own home, with or without social services support, up to their hospital admission. Changing from an independent environment to one of dependency can be unsettling and traumatic. We were told that, in practice, older people have little or no choice on discharge. They are put into placements that do not meet their needs, or where adequate care is not in place. They are sometimes discharged to care homes instead of their own home, where they would be able to live with appropriate support. Other elderly people are discharged into care, miles from friends or family.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/19">We were told that the Department of Health guidance that says that no one should be discharged direct from an acute hospital bed to a care home was routinely ignored. We recommended that the delayed discharge regulations should be amended to allow for more flexibility in applying the time period within which patients must be discharged. We also called for guidance to be given to hospitals and local authorities to help them respect the rights of patients under article 8 of the European convention on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/20">The Government set out their view of how the regulations could and should work to safeguard respect for patients' rights. The Minister expressed surprise at the evidence that we received showing that the regulations were not working well in practice. The Government need to do more to show that the delayed discharge regulations work as well in practice as the Department thinks that they work in theory. We have reported that, in practice, the regulations can compromise the human rights of older people in the ways that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/21">The Government's response so far has been complacent. I hope that the Minister will reassure us today by saying that he will look at how the regulations are working in practice and will reconsider issuing guidance to ensure that patients' rights are respected when they are discharged.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/22">So why do these problems happen? There is a real power imbalance: on one hand, we have frail, sick, elderly, vulnerable people and, on the other, a big and unresponsive bureaucracy. Both patients and providers have an extremely low awareness of a patient's rights. It is not just a matter of providing a proper, professional service for the patient; it is also the patient's enforceable human right to receive such a service.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/23">Older people can be very stoical, and they are often reluctant to make a fuss and complain. They may say, &quot;I am old, what can I expect? I am grateful for what they are doing.&quot; Such expressions exemplify their approach to life. Low expectations are, in effect, internalised ageism. They are compounded by the fact that some of the most elderly people remember the time before the NHS was founded, when there was no affordable medical care.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/24">Human rights are seen as a matter only for a health trust's legal department. They are a regulatory burden: they require boxes to be ticked yet have nothing to do with the reform of service delivery. The failure to protect and respect the human rights of older people in health care is a deep rooted cultural problem in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/25">We also received evidence of both direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of age. Direct discrimination is less common than in the past, but it has not vanished. Age Concern gave us some examples, among them the fact that invitations to breast screening stop for women over 70. In addition, doctors are less likely to refer angina sufferers to see a specialist or to have tests if they are over 65.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.2/26">The Committee heard about one GP being called too late to see a care home resident whose health had deteriorated suddenly. Earlier access to a GP would not have been denied to a younger, non-dependent person, as that person would be able to arrange an appointment at an earlier and personally convenient time.</p>

	<p pid="a.122.1/1">The hon. Gentleman probably goes a little further than I would regarding the wider impact on society, and he may have gone beyond the human rights principles that we are advocating. If human rights principles were part of NICE's basic approach, that would in itself be a significant advance and might address many of the matters about which he is concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/2">I shall now consider the position of NHS staff, who are on the front line in protecting and promoting the human rights of older people in health care. They are the people with whom older patients and residents interact every day and on whom they rely. We are not talking simply about doctors and nurses: the attitudes, actions and omissions of reception staff or those involved with patient transport have a major impact on older people. They, too, should know what is needed to respect, protect and promote the human rights of the people with whom they deal. Given the many competing demands on health care staff, if cultural change is to be achieved, it is vital that all staff understand what human rights principles mean and how they should be applied. By respecting human rights, staff will also be able to recognise and support the positive benefit they bring to their own working lives, and the lives of patients and residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/3">Since the Human Rights Act came into force in 2000, human rights training should have been provided throughout hospitals, care homes and other public sector organisations. In 2003, the Audit Commission made a similar recommendation, but the training has not materialised. When training is provided, it is on a one-off basis and is somewhat unfocussed. We recommend that all staff working in health care, both clinical and non-clinical, receive targeted and regular training in human rights principles and duties, and how they apply to their work. The training should be integrated into general training, so it should not be costly.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.1/4">We also ask the Government, the regulators, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission to monitor the extent to which training is provided. The Government responded positively to our concerns and mentioned a number of initiatives that deal with training and guidance on human rights. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what is being planned in more detail and the time scale for those initiatives.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13a.123.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13b.123.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13a.123.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="123"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080313/halltext/80313h0002.htm#08031362000248">
	<p pid="a.123.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has made an interesting point. There was a Human Rights Act case that trumped the ban on lifting and stated that patients should be lifted when appropriate. Obviously, with appropriate training, it is possible to lift people safely. I know from my old job as a personal injury lawyer that nurses can often be injured when lifting patients improperly, because they have not had the training or the additional staff required to lift patients safely. That is linked to the points I made earlier about how the position of staff should be strengthened when they argue against doing things that they consider to be in breach of the rights of their patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/2">We recommend that qualifications, accreditation and relicensing for health professionals should include a basic understanding of human rights principles, such as dignity, fairness, respect and equality. I tabled amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill to address a number of those issues and although the Minister again argued that the bodies responsible for those matters are subject to the Human Rights Act, our view is that that is not enough to ensure that human rights are taken seriously. Staff who come across incidences of neglect or carelessness should be required to report them without fear of reprisals. Doctors and nurses are under a professional duty to report poor treatment, but other staff, particularly those in care homes, are not under such a duty. On our study visit to Denmark and Sweden, we were informed of Lex Maria and Lex Sarah&mdash;laws which require all employees in residential care or hospitals to report suspected abuse. We recommend that similar provisions should be introduced in this country by using the new care standards to be introduced under the Health and Social Care Bill. Will the Minister confirm whether or not the new care standards will extend the duty to report poor treatment to all NHS staff and care home workers?</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/3">It is key to ensure that older people are empowered. They are often unaware that they have human rights or that such rights are legally enforceable. At Barnet hospital, new patients are given a leaflet about what to expect from their stay, how to complain, and the discharge procedures, but not what their rights are. We call on the Department of Health, the inspectorates, and service providers to make information available in an accessible form to service users about their rights. The Government have agreed with that recommendation, so perhaps the Minister will tell us what is being done to implement it. The Government have referred to two publications&mdash;&quot;Human Rights in Healthcare&quot; and &quot;Promoting Dignity within the Law&quot;&mdash;which are apparently available to service users. Will the Minister tell hon. Members how many copies have been distributed to the public, and how the impact of those documents has been measured? Is he satisfied that his Department is doing enough to disseminate information about human rights to patients and carers?</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/4">Older people often benefit from independent advocacy to ensure that their voices are heard. We welcome the Minister's support for independent advocates, but we are concerned about whether there are sufficient advocates to meet the needs of older people. We are also concerned about whether advocates are adequately trained in human rights principles. Effective complaints mechanisms are essential, but they only function if people know how to complain, are not afraid to do so, and are not victimised when they do. Ultimately, a system in which complaints can be made to a third party is needed. We are concerned about the proposal in the Health and Social Care Bill that states that the Care Quality Commission will not be able to investigate individual complaints in the way that the Healthcare Commission can. More emphasis will be placed on resolving complaints at a local level. Will the Minister explain how local arrangements will be sufficiently independent of the organisations that are the subject of the complaint to enable the process to be credible in the eyes of the complainants, especially those who fear victimisation from those about whom they are complaining?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13a.124.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="124"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080313/halltext/80313h0002.htm#08031362000250">
	<p pid="a.124.1/1">I understand what the hon. Gentleman is saying. There are two types of complaints: those that can be resolved locally and quickly without too many problems and others that are more serious and require further detailed investigation. Handling the latter category requires a degree of independence, which is why we have made our recommendations. I tabled amendments on Report, but unfortunately Mr. Speaker did not select them, otherwise we would have been able to debate the matter fully then. One of the advantages of a Joint Committee is that we have representatives from both Houses. I shall be surprised if my colleagues from the other place do not table amendments on the matter when the Bill starts its passage through the Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/2">One of our concerns related to the risk of eviction. We were alarmed by how little protection care home residents have against eviction, compared with tenants in rented accommodation. That is particularly relevant in the context of complaints: care home residents and their families and carers are less likely to complain about the care that is provided if they are worried that the response will be eviction. We heard of a care home resident who used the emergency buzzer at night. The care assistant took half an hour to come, by which time the resident had wet the bed. The resident was left in the wet bed, the buzzer was thrown across the room and, after making a complaint, they were given 28 days' notice to leave. In another case, a low-level complaint was made to the care assistant about the resident's bed not being made. Twenty-eight days' notice was given to look elsewhere. The &quot;YL&quot; case arose out of similar circumstances, with the proposed eviction of Mrs. YL from her home in Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/3">In Denmark and Sweden, residents have the same security as other tenants. As their needs increase, the level of care steps up from sheltered accommodation to highly dependent, all in the same home. Will the Minister consider making it harder for care homes to evict residents? I am sure that hon. Members are familiar with the &quot;YL&quot; case, given the intense interest throughout the country in its outcome. In essence, users of services provided by the private and voluntary sectors but commissioned by public bodies are excluded from the protection of the Human Rights Act, as a consequence of the House of Lords judgment. That raises issues that go far beyond our debate today, but the consequences have been brought into sharp focus by the impact on care home residents: 77.9 per cent. of care homes are private and 13 per cent. are in the voluntary sector, which means that residents in 91 per cent. of homes have no direct protection under the Human Rights Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/4">This year, for the second time, I have introduced a private Member's Bill to attempt to resolve the general issues; and for care home residents in the interim, I moved on Report a new clause to the Health and Social Care Bill to restore the law to what everyone believed to be the case before &quot;YL&quot; and the earlier authority established by the Leonard Cheshire case. I am pleased that the Minister responded positively, with an undertaking to report to the other place with the Government's own proposals. I hoped that that would result in a Government amendment, so I withdrew my amendment. Will the Minister bring us up to date on Government discussions and tell us what amendments he anticipates will be tabled in the other place?</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/5">I come now to the question of leadership. Until recently, the Department of Health manifestly failed to ensure that human rights were at the heart of health care policy and practice. It was left to voluntary organisations to provide leadership and fill that vacuum. We need nothing less than an entire change of culture throughout the health service and care home sector. Recently&mdash;perhaps because of our inquiry as well as the work of non-governmental organisations&mdash;Ministers and senior officials have come to understand better the importance of human rights in health care, and I very much welcome that change. The references to human rights in the policy documents that we have seen are good. I certainly cannot fault the Minister's personal understanding of the issue and commitment to progress. However, we are concerned about how that translates into policy making and implementation in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/6">At the end of our inquiry, we remained without confidence that the Human Rights Act was</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/7" class="indent">&quot;an integral part of policy-making&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/8">in the Department. Initiatives such as the British Institute of Human Rights pilots are welcome but piecemeal, and there is no clear strategy on making human rights integral to the work of the Department as a whole. There has to be much clearer guidance, and we need a much stronger cultural steer. The reluctance to use the language of human rights must be overcome. It is not an embarrassment, but a guarantee of good practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/9">The Government told us that they were focused on improving their performance, drawing on support from the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Will the Minister tell us whether there will be a departmental human rights strategy, so that human rights considerations can be at the heart of the Department's work? How will the Department demonstrate leadership throughout the NHS on human rights? The Department said that it would review its policy-making processes to ensure that they reflected human rights considerations. Has that been done? If so, what was the outcome?</p>
	<p pid="a.124.1/10">This year, the NHS is celebrating its 60th anniversary. It has been a remarkable success story overall. In our inquiry, we pointed to ways in which it can be more successful still by putting human rights at the heart of its work, which will make the rights and needs of users central to the work of the NHS, helping to ensure that financial or staff pressures, or the sheer weight of the bureaucracy, do not drive policy and practice. As one consultant told us, &quot;Looking after older people well is a lot cheaper than looking after them badly.&quot; That can be done without spending enormous sums of money, but it requires a cultural shift from the top of Richmond house down to the staff on the hospital reception desk or in the call centre. The welcome political commitment recently shown by the Minister and his colleagues must be both intensified and sustained, so we will continue to keep the Department of Health under scrutiny until the human rights of older people in health care receive the respect to which they are entitled.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.0/1">I want to say how pleased I am to be contributing to the debate. I commend the Joint Committee's excellent report, and the work of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> and his Committee. The report could not have come at a better time to move the debate forward. We would probably all agree that things have not been moving as quickly as we should have liked. To quote Help the Aged, which also welcomed the report:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Sadly, we have seen little progress in this area since we published <i>Rights at Risk</i> in 2005 and think that it is now long overdue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/3">As the Joint Committee's report made clear, there is much excellent health and social care provision for older people throughout the country. It is very heartening when we see at first hand the best of our health and social care professionals giving such care, and ensuring the dignity and human rights of older people&mdash;something to which we are all committed. Unfortunately, as we have already heard powerfully expressed by the hon. Member for Hendon, examples of neglect and abuse of older people are simply too widespread. We probably all accept that we are talking about a societal problem, and not simply a political one. Some people's attitude to older people is a manifestation of a view of them as second-class citizens who somehow do not have the same human rights that other people do. All the cases that we have heard about from the hon. Gentleman suggest that such attitudes are found far too frequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/4">I was very happy, as I think the hon. Gentleman knows, to put my name to amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill that tackled the current loophole in the Human Rights Act 1998, affecting private and voluntary care home residents who are not state funded. I shall talk about that more later, but will mention now that there are 300,000 vulnerable older people who are not protected by the Human Rights Act. There have been discussions with the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, and I welcome the fact that they are continuing.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/5">We still, however, hear of cases of malnutrition and dehydration, rough handling of patients, bullying, neglect and people being left in their own urine and excrement. The British Institute of Human Rights provided a list of examples, including continent older people being forced to wear incontinence pads; the bathing of older people one after the other in the same bath; routine over-medication to keep people docile; night staff forcing older people to wake at 4 o'clock in the morning to be cleaned and dressed, simply because that suits the shift pattern; and an older woman being placed on a commode, fed Weetabix and washed by a carer, all at the same time. The issue that was so well highlighted by the Joint Committee's report is that, at the moment, there is no real recourse to a legal remedy under the Human Rights Act. Until that changes, older people and, of course, younger disabled people are unable to challenge clear violations of their human rights by independent providers of health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/6">The report was neatly summarised by the hon. Member for Hendon. He mentioned some of the key issues, the first being hospital discharge. Again, inhumane discharge procedures often happen simply because of a lack of consultation with families or a lack of information to the individual and their family. There is very little information about options&mdash;frankly, a lot of the time, there is no choice at all. Often, such things happen in the context of bed-blocking, which is a difficult situation, and the need to move patients into appropriate care facilities from hospitals. However, despite the inevitable pressures, we must ensure that older people have rights. That needs to be addressed, and patients' rights need to be clearly spelled out, which I hope we will hear from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/7">I am sure that we agree that confidentiality causes problems. It is vital that the Department of Health issues clear guidance and perhaps a code of practice to make clear the limitations to the duty of confidentiality so that, when appropriate, family members or carers receive information and are involved in decisions, as they clearly need to be in some cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/8">On the right to complain, there are huge barriers in the system as it currently operates. The hon. Member for Hendon gave a powerful, specific example of someone who was evicted for complaining. So many people in our care homes fear that. People within the NHS often have limited awareness of the organisation's complaints system, or they have difficulties navigating it. That strongly makes the case for an independent advisory service for people, their families and carers to enable them to navigate their way through the system and to show them where to go when they have a grievance and wish to make a complaint. There should be an independent complaints system in social care settings to ensure that people have the right to speak up.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/9">Returning to the human rights loophole, we had lengthy discussions on the matter in debates on the Health and Social Care Bill. Because 90 per cent. of care homes are in the private or voluntary sector, the issue can no longer be ignored if we are serious about tackling the problems that we have heard about today. I was pleased to take forward amendments on the back of the Joint Committee's report, and to work with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>, who led on those matters in the Health and Social Care Bill Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/10">I welcome the way in which the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, listened and engaged with organisations and MPs across the political spectrum to take the matter forward, but the fundamental issue remains. Until we close the human rights loophole&mdash;some of us strongly believe that that must be done in the Health and Social Care Bill&mdash;we will continue to experience situations in which two residents in the same care home have different rights or, indeed, one will have rights under the Human Rights Act but the other will not, simply because one has assets of more than &pound;21,500 and the other does not. That cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/11">I was happy to discuss the matter at the Department of Health, and to acknowledge the challenges of the way in which the Human Rights Act is currently framed. However, it cannot be right that one person is covered and another is not, even though they receive the same care in the same institution. We all accept that principle but the challenge is to legislate for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/12">The Government said consistently in Committee that they did not believe that the Health and Social Care Bill was the right measure to tackle the issue, and they talked about doing so later on in a Bill of Rights.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13a.134.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="134"  time="015:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080313/halltext/80313h0004.htm#08031362000262">
	<p pid="a.134.2/1">It is a pleasure, Lady Winterton, to serve under your chairmanship for this timely and important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the hon. Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> on introducing the debate in such a comprehensive and reasoned manner. I also congratulate him on his chairing of the Joint Committee. I hope that he has the chance to secure further discussion of the subject in the main Chamber. I am sure that it merits such a debate. At the very least, it is highly likely that the report will be referred to in connection with many other matters that are to go through both Houses, and in other contexts.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/3">I pay tribute to all nurses, carers and others in the care sector&mdash;and, indeed the care home owners and businesses. They provide excellent care, day in and day out, to the most vulnerable people in our society. We should not allow aberrations, however horrible, to cloud our judgment of those who discharge their duty with skill, compassion and professionalism. They work towards quality of life, dignity, respect and well-being with the unremitting best care and attention that we know exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/4">I hope that the Minister will enlighten us as to why no mention was made of social care in yesterday's Budget, and why no mention was made of the NHS&mdash;our No. 1 priority and, until yesterday, what the Prime Minister said was also his priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/5">The Joint Committee identified the areas on which this debate should focus. They were that human rights should be integral to policy making by the Department of Health as well as to the planning and implementation of services in hospitals and care homes; that human rights should underpin the work of the proposed health and social care inspectorate; that front-line staff in health care should receive appropriate education and training in human rights; and that there should be no discrimination on the ground of age in the provision of health care to older people. The Committee also highlighted the fact that the debate would be an opportunity to scrutinise the Government's response to the judgment of the House of Lords in the YL case, in which it was found that private sector care homes were not public authorities for the purposes of the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/6">The Joint Committee's report charted failings under articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European convention on human rights because of malnutrition and dehydration, and the inadequate assessment of a person's needs; articles 3 and 8, because of abuse, rough treatment, neglect, carelessness and poor hygiene, and bullying, patronising, and infantilising attitudes towards older people; and article 8 because of the lack of privacy in mixed sex wards&mdash;another broken commitment by the Labour Party&mdash;and a lack of dignity, especially for personal care needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/7">The report also noted failings under article 8 because of insufficient attention being paid to confidentiality, inappropriate medication and the use of physical restraint, too hasty discharge from hospital, fear among older people of making complaints, and eviction from care homes; article 14 because of the discriminatory treatment of patients and care home residents on grounds of age, disability and race; and articles 8 and 14 because of communication difficulties, particularly for people with dementia or people who cannot speak English. Those are the issues that underpin our debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/8">The Department's responses on the question of human rights being integral to policy making and the planning and implementation of services were disappointing. In its response to recommendation 8, it failed to commit itself to a statutory constitution for the NHS. The wider concern is not just that human rights are left out. In December 2006, a consultation on the core principles of the NHS&mdash;we have committed ourselves to enshrining those principles in legislation&mdash;was undertaken by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport when he was Minister of State at the Department of Health. In it, the Government omitted the principle that</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/9" class="indent">&quot;Public funds for healthcare will be devoted solely to NHS patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/10">Are the Government still planning to get rid of that central pillar of our NHS?</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/11">I would be grateful if the Minister provided me with a copy of &quot;Better Policy-Making&quot;, a document that the Government pray in aid in their response. However, the response does not make clear whether the document highlights human rights in any way. I genuinely trust that the Government will not seek to divert the Joint Committee with such an action.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/12">The Joint Committee also proposed that human rights should underpin the work of the proposed health and social care inspectorate. Like others, I had the privilege of serving on the Committee that considered the Health and Social Care Bill. I am glad that we have the opportunity today to hear from the Minister about the Care Quality Commission. One of our concerns is that, in the merger, social care will be squeezed out as a priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/13">It was unfortunate that the Minister, who is responsible for social care, was not chosen to take that Bill through Committee. A number of Committee members would have liked to see him take charge of that Bill; we believed that we might have made more progress if he had had responsibility for the Bill rather than his colleague, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>. Indeed, I know that that concern was shared by some of the Minister's colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/14">The Commission for Social Care Inspection has said that it</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/15" class="indent">&quot;believes, in line with general Government policy, that the new regulator should take a strong rights based approach towards the people who use social care and health services...and their carers&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/16">and there is a desire to &quot;properly reflect&quot; that &quot;in the legislation&quot;. The official Opposition sought a number of changes to the framing legislation for the Care Quality Commission. One of the most important was to create a reference board consisting of commissioners, and a management board consisting of executives, at the head of the commission. That would have resulted in stronger governance, and the promulgation of human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/17">The Minister of State rejected that proposal on the ground that he did not want to tie the hands of the new commission in its structure&mdash;a somewhat spurious argument, as the legislation as framed prevents it from having that structure should it so desire. One has to look at it the other way around. He may genuinely have wanted the freedom of that option, but the legislation was deliberately set out to ensure that that option was closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/18">The Bill Committee also sought to establish a human rights committee within the CQC. The Minister of State refused that request on the ground that the advisory committee set out in schedule 1 to the Bill would fulfil that requirement. However, he also said that the advisory committee would be used for patient and public involvement. 1 wonder whether the Minister will take this opportunity to clarify those mixed messages.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/19">It was also disingenuous of the Department, in its response to recommendations 20, 21 and 22, to say that it would take no action on human rights because it</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/20" class="indent">&quot;will not be specifying the precise work programme of the new regulator&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/21">On health care-associated infections&mdash;the new phrase for what we used to know as health care-acquired infections&mdash;the Government have mandated action from the CQC in the Bill. Why are HCAIs more important than human rights? Why, for that matter, are such infections more important than malnutrition, which affects more people and also breaches article 2, 3 and 8 of the European convention on human rights? The Government repeatedly refused to include that in the Bill, and I hope that the Minister will shed some light on the illogical nature of the Government's contention. Does he believe that HCAIs are more important than human rights, and can he say why the Government were not prepared to include malnutrition in the Bill? As we argued in Committee, many people say that it is closer to a human rights issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/22">It was encouraging to see the Joint Committee's focus on training in human rights for staff, a matter that the hon. Member for Hendon rightly focused upon. Training was discussed at length by the Bill Committee, and I hope that those discussions will be noted by the CQC. The other side of the coin is that staff should have the time to put into practice the things that they have learned.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/23">In fact, the majority of those in the caring professions would deliver care compatible with human rights if only they did not have to contend with so many bureaucratic procedures and Whitehall top-down targets breathing down their necks. That argument is more generally pursued on the Floor of the House, so I shall not take time on the matter now, but I hope that hon. Members recognise that there is a consequence to managing the health service with such top-down targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/24">I hope that the Minister will take on board our proposals for getting rid of distorting targets in our NHS. I would be interested to know when he intends to raise the recommendations with the strategic health authorities and training bodies, as he commits to doing in the Government response, and what measurable outcomes he is expecting.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/25">Rightly, the Joint Committee also called for no discrimination on the ground of age. One specific issue that was picked up on in the Government response, which was raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>, was discharge planning. The Government response to recommendations 1 and 2 showed some prevarication. We have an opportunity today to see if that prevarication can be addressed, as there were no measures in the Government response to strengthen discharge planning, which would ensure that older people's care was not compromised.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/26">In their policy review for the official Opposition, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1490" name="Stephen Dorrell">the Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell)</phrase>, who is a former Secretary of State for Health, and Baroness Perry of Southwark examined the experience of Sweden and Denmark, where hospitals can charge social services for extra bed days. In Sweden, notification of patients is made immediately on admission, social workers visit wards daily and discharges are planned in four stages during the patient's stay.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/27">Lady Winterton, that is a system that we could usefully use in our shared county of Cheshire&mdash;we are neighbouring MPs&mdash;in which there have been plans to close nursing and care homes&mdash;plans that have left some very vulnerable people with some dramatic and at times life-threatening situations to contend with suddenly. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be able to give some clarity and indeed commitment to taking action on the issue of discharge planning today.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/28">The most disturbing issue regarding the empowerment of older people is the changes to, and failings of, the complaints framework. The CQC, unlike the Healthcare Commission which it subsumes, will no longer be a second-tier complaints handling body. Instead the Government intend to strengthen local complaints handling functions and pass unresolved cases directly to the parliamentary ombudsman, which initially will lead to an elevenfold increase in her work load. She is seeking extra funding from the Treasury to support her work and we can only hope that she is more successful than almost every other part of Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/29">The Government have not yet told the House how much that change will cost the ombudsman. Given that the Opposition have been asking repeatedly for that information, I must say that that is something of a disgrace. How can hon. Members make the correct judgment if the Government withhold such facts from us?</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/30">Regarding the failings of the complaints system itself, the Government acknowledge those failings in its response to the Joint Committee, saying, in response to recommendation 32:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/31" class="indent">&quot;We are sympathetic to the situation of those people who self-fund, in care homes for example, and recognise the problem. We are currently considering this issue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/32">I think that the Minister sought to make that point himself, to some degree, in his intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1672" name="Greg Mulholland">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase>, who speaks for the Liberal Democrats on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/33">The Health and Social Care Bill Committee and Report stages showed the failings of the complaints system to be a matter of cross-party concern. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1867" name="Brian Jenkins">The hon. Member for Tamworth (Mr. Jenkins)</phrase> criticised Government policy in that area. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1697" name="Kelvin Hopkins">The hon. Member for Luton, North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/34" class="indent">&quot;A number of my hon. Friends, not necessarily members of the Committee, are concerned about changes in patient representation and procedures for patients making complaints in recent years.&quot; <i>&mdash;&mdash;[Official Report, Health and Social Care Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-01-17">17 January 2008</phrase>; c. 346.]</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/35">The Liberal Democrats supported those comments, as did the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon, who has just had to leave his seat, and the hon. Member for Hendon on Report, as he rightly mentioned earlier in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/36">Therefore, I hope that the Minister will be able to clarify his own comments on the issue. Speaking in a Westminster Hall debate, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/37" class="indent">&quot;it is unacceptable that self-funders should not have the protection that other residents have&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2007-12-11.52"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 11 December 2007; Vol. 469, c. 52WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/38">More cryptically, in September 2007&mdash;I do not have the exact date, but I am told that his comments have been verified&mdash;he told the &quot;File on 4&quot; programme&mdash;this shows that we listen to him at every opportunity&mdash;that he would be solving that problem through the integrated complaints procedure for health and social care in 2009, which is again cited in the Government response. However, the Minister of State, who led on the Health and Social Care Bill, and the Department, in its response to this report, did not embrace the idea of a universal complaints system, nor did they suggest that that system would be achieved through the 2009 framework. Is the Minister reneging on that undertaking or, as I fear, is he just as disappointed as all the rest of us are with his own colleagues?</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/39">Will the Minister tell us exactly how the CQC will monitor trends in complaints? There was no suggestion in the Health and Social Care Bill that the CQC would do that; indeed, the Government rejected the amendments tabled by Opposition Members that tried to achieve that very effect. With the CQC losing its complaint function, how can we be sure that the early warning signals will be picked up by the regulator?</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/40">If I may, I would like to pick up a little on a point that I made earlier. The community health councils were axed. It may be frustrating for any Government but independent trusted bodies should have entitlements to visit hospital or care settings and bring forward generically all their collective wisdom, without necessarily having to individualise it. The councils were able to see trends and put out schemes such as bed watch and deal with all the other issues, which were always a major additional source of information about what was truly going on. There seems to be a lack of ability to collate and collect that information, and to ensure that it is generally made available in reports. That was one of the concerns of the bodies that will be succeeded by the CQC; they are concerned that that information will be lost. I fear that it will be a serious loss, both to the individuals who could be affected and for policy-making purposes for all of us, unless the Minister, who I believe would sincerely like to see those matters improved, is able to take that issue up with his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/41">I would like to address the issue of private care homes, which was raised by the hon. Member for Leeds, North-West. Although the human rights issue is naturally all-encompassing, political and public interest has recently been most exercised by the human rights loophole under which private care homes are not bound by the Human Rights Act 1998, and can therefore evict residents without breaching article 8 of the European convention on human rights, whereas their public sector counterparts cannot do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.2/42">It would be nice to see the Government not dragging their feet over that issue. During the debate on the hon. Member for Hendon's private Member's Bill to clarify the Human Rights Act, which took place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-15">15 June 2007</phrase>, the Solicitor-General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>, who was then the Under-Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs and who is herself a human rights lawyer, talked the Bill out rather than bringing it before the detailed scrutiny and consideration of Committee stage, which is what the Opposition wanted and urged should happen at that time. Indeed, it is still our position that that matter warrants the detailed consideration of a Committee stage because of the difficulties&mdash;difficulties that we all acknowledge&mdash;of intertwining it into all other forms of law.</p>

	<p pid="a.140.0/1">The hon. Gentleman advocates his position even better than I can, and I am most grateful that he was able to intervene. Therefore, we all doubly share in the disappointment, because we are already now in March of the following year, and that seems to indicate that there is a serious dragging of feet.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/2">In the Westminster Hall debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-11">11 December 2007</phrase>, to which I referred earlier, the Minister who is present today called the current state of affairs an &quot;anomaly&quot;, saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/3" class="indent">&quot;neither Government nor Parliament intended that publicly funded residents living in private sector establishments would not be covered by the Human Rights Act 1998. That is an unintended consequence, and we need to put it right.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2007-12-11.52"><i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, 11 December 2007; Vol. 469, c. 52WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/4">During the Committee stage of the Health and Social Care Bill, the Minister of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the Government are committed to ensuring that independent sector care homes are covered by the Human Rights Act.&quot;<i>&mdash;&mdash;[Official Report, Health and Social Care Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2008-01-10">10 January 2008</phrase>; c. 135.]</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/6">Why will the Government not deal with that matter now? If they are truly committed to dealing with it, what is the reason for the delay?</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/7">I hope that I have put questions to the Minister in a fair manner, and I am sure that he will take the opportunity to give us specific answers to the issues raised both by myself and the hon. Member for Hendon, who I again congratulate on securing this debate. I also congratulate him and his colleagues in the Joint Committee on producing this report. I am sure that we will see some movement on the part of the Government, but there will still be too much prevarication and, as I see it, another attempt to find sufficient long grass to kick this issue into. I look forward to the Minister dispelling such a notion, which has obviously formed in my mind, and giving specific answers to the specific questions that I have posed. If, for any reason, he is not able to answer them today, I hope that he will be prepared to let us have some answers in writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.0/8">Let us not forget that at the heart of this debate is the care of some of the most vulnerable people in our society. That is something that all of us, and I include the Government in saying that, take seriously, as we ought to.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13a.141.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="141"  time="015:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080313/halltext/80313h0005.htm#08031362000267">
	<p pid="a.141.1/1">I accept that clarification and shall come on to that issue later. We have a problem with the definition of &quot;public authority&quot;, which makes this quite a complex problem to resolve. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman made a fair point; I just wanted to clarify the current situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">The hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> made a consensual contribution and recognised that both sides of the House feel very passionately and strongly that the rights of older people should be a priority for Government, Parliament and society. Those outside the House might demonstrate wry amusement at the fact that he is a passionate advocate for the Human Rights Act and for further regulation and legislation on this subject, in view of his proud track record as a deregulator and a severe critic of the notion of human rights legislation. I am delighted, therefore, to hear him speak so positively about the importance of such legislation and its capacity to protect older people. It seems that when human rights apply to vulnerable people, there is a common view that we as a society have a duty to look after them properly, but when they apply to other groups in society, about which there is not the same level of enthusiasm and support, people deride the whole notion of human rights. I think that we need some consistency in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/3">The hon. Gentleman said that the Chancellor failed to mention the NHS during his Budget speech, but he referred on several occasions to the record levels of investment that the Government have made in the NHS. I understand why he did not want to hear that bit of the Chancellor's statement, so I am happy to repeat it. I am also happy to repeat the fact that by the end of 2008 we will have achieved a historic landmark in the NHS&mdash;a maximum wait of 18 weeks from seeing one's GP to hitting the operating theatre. Not only has there been record investment, but a major improvement has been made in people's experiences of NHS care and treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase>, the most radical transformation programme in the history of social care will begin in every local authority area, with a focus on information, advice and advocacy for all and, of course, personal budgets putting maximum power and control in the hands of those who use social care services and their families. As the hon. Gentleman is fully aware, we are committed to a Green Paper on the long-term fundamental nature of our care and support system. There is no doubt that the investment and reform of the NHS and social care system is one of the Government's top priorities. More important than priorities, the Government's track record over the past 10 years on the NHS and social care is impressive. Older people have benefited disproportionately from that record investment, which is frequently forgotten. There has been improvements in acute care, hip replacements, cataract operations&mdash;people used to have to wait years for such treatment. Older people have benefited more than any other group in our society from those tremendous advances.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/5">The hon. Gentleman referred to a piece of work conducted for him by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1490" name="Stephen Dorrell">the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr. Dorrell)</phrase>&mdash;a very distinguished former Secretary of State for Health&mdash;detailing a radical transformational vision for the future of social care services in this country. It stated that we needed better and more integrated commissioning between health and social care, but that was the end of the comments on the Conservative party's position for the future of social care, although I am sure that more will be said in the future. Nevertheless, I genuinely welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Eddisbury cares passionately about the issues before us and seeks, wherever possible, to find consensus on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/6">I endorse what the hon. Gentleman said about those on the front line of delivering services. The difficulty with debates such as this is that they are usually based on a deficit model of care. We highlight all of the appalling and dreadful failings and abuses taking place. Of course, too often elderly people and their families describe those circumstances to us and we have a duty to act. Equally, however, every day of the week, in every community, people on the front line of NHS and care services do an extraordinary job, frequently in very difficult circumstances. We should make that clear when we talk about our overwhelming responsibility to improve the system and to ensure that cases of neglect, abuse and poor care continue to be minimised.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/7">Politicians accept the notion that the great national and international challenges facing us are climate change, the effects of globalisation and fundamentalist terrorism, but very few people acknowledge that demography should be up there as one of the top four or five public policy challenges facing our society and those in many similar countries. People are now living longer, which means that more people have complex conditions such as dementia. Furthermore, people have very different expectations. These days, the vast majority of people, given an authentic choice, want to remain in their own home rather than enter institutionalised care, whereas, perhaps 20 years ago, our parents or grandparents were resigned to the fact that they would live to their 60s, if they were lucky, and spend the latter part of their life in institutionalised care.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/8">Members of the baby boom generation are increasingly concerned about those issues, not only because of self-interest and worries about their own future, but because they are coming into contact with the health and social care system through the experiences of their ageing parents. Frequently, those sons and daughters find the system frustrating, particularly the division between health and social care. They also find that their elderly parents are not treated with the respect that we would like. I have set a test; people should ask, &quot;If the care is not good enough for our mothers and fathers, why should it be good for somebody else's?&quot; That simple test should be applied to every NHS ward, nursing and residential home and domiciliary and day care service.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/9">The NHS and social care systems do not function in isolation from the rest of society. We have a deeply negative culture and attitude towards older people in society generally, and it is frequently reflected in the NHS and social care systems. I am a great believer in the human rights legislation being the starting point for, and the heart of, health and social care thinking, systems and policies, but even if we had a utopian application of the Human Rights Act 1998 in its strictest sense, we would still need to address some major cultural and attitudinal issues. Older people are not just passive recipients of our sympathy; thankfully, they make a tremendously positive contribution to their communities and our society, and we should highlight it far more.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/10">Several issues were raised in today's debate and in the report. First, I shall describe what the Department of Health is trying to do internally to ensure that human rights have a far more significant role in the development of policy. The hon. Member for Eddisbury referred to better policy-making guidance for officials in the Department. The guidance includes clear references to a human rights perspective and the consequences of human rights legislation. The impact assessment process is relevant to all policies, and equality is an important part of that. Part of equality is human rights and the human rights legislation. The Department is also working on a human rights e-learning tool, which will be available in the autumn. The tool is designed to make them far more aware of the position of human rights at the heart of development and training.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/11">I shall deal with the Department's ability to influence change on the ground. First, on the YL judgment, there is absolutely no doubt that Parliament and the Government intended publicly funded residents of private homes to be covered by the human rights legislation. As a consequence of a court judgment, they are not, but the Government are absolutely determined to ensure that the original intentions of Parliament and the Government are restored. The question is how do we best do that in terms of the legislative process? Discussions are active and ongoing between myself and ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health and the Ministry of Justice, and we will be able to make clear to hon. Members in the near future how we intend to correct that anomaly.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/12">The hon. Member for Leeds, North-West expressed some concern about self-funders. Correcting the YL judgment would deal simply with people who were publicly funded, but because social care is a means-tested system, an increasing number of people are self-funders. Owing to the implications of the original focus of the Human Rights Act, it is much more difficult and complex to extend the correction of that anomaly to self-funders, because we would then get into a situation involving the definition of &quot;public authority&quot;. On the sentiment, however, we have a responsibility through whatever means to ensure that in a means-tested system, self-funders have far greater protection&mdash;even though it may be difficult to do so through human rights legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/13">A major part of the social care reform programme that will begin in every local authority area over the next three years will be an end to the &quot;no help here&quot; culture, in which people who fund themselves, or their families, are essentially left to navigate the care system alone. The transformation programme seeks to commit local authorities no longer to have a &quot;no help here&quot; culture. Depending on its implementation and delivery, I think most people will welcome it.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/14">The hon. Member for Eddisbury rightly raised the right of people to complain beyond the organisation or provider about whom they are complaining. The difficulty is that if people are publicly funded recipients of care, they can go to the local authority, use its complaints procedures and ultimately go to the ombudsman, but if a self-funder wants to make a complaint, they can go only to the provider against whom they are making the complaint; there is no independent vehicle or organisation to which they can turn. We must do something to address that anomaly, and officials are considering the issue. I am not able to tell the Chamber the solution that we have come up with, but we must create a level of independence for self-funders when there is nowhere for them to go other than to the organisation against which they are making the complaint.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/15">The Government remain committed to minimising mixed-sex accommodation in the health service. This year in the NHS operating framework, we have set stretching targets for every strategic health authority and primary care trust to minimise mixed-sex accommodation. We have made much progress over the past 10 years, but not as much as we had hoped, and the only difference of emphasis is the definition of mixed-sex wards versus mixed-sex accommodation. My colleague Lord Darzi made it clear that he thought the term &quot;mixed-sex wards&quot; was an error and we should not have made a commitment to abolish them because it is unachievable. However, we remain committed to the minimisation of mixed-sex accommodation in the health service, and we have made it clear to the NHS locally that we expect it to be a priority where there has not been as much progress as we expected.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/16">Premature discharge is a very difficult issue, because if older people are in hospital for a prolonged period unnecessarily, all the evidence suggests that their mental and physical health deteriorates. The challenge is to ensure that we have in every community an appropriate range of provision&mdash;intermediate care, step-down care, proper domiciliary and day care services&mdash;and the appropriate relationship between the local NHS and local government, so that, from the point of view of patients and carers, that Berlin wall does not get in the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.1/17">As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon said, it is important that we get the issue right for individual patients and in individual circumstances. It is irresponsible to discharge people when they have not fully recovered or into a care setting that is not appropriate to meet their needs. Overall, however, it would be a mistake to take the pressure off the policy of getting people out of hospital as quickly as possible, because from my experience of my relatives and other older people, the longer they remain in hospital, the less likely they are to make a full recovery. But that depends on our having appropriate alternative provision available.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-13a.147.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="147"  time="016:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080313/halltext/80313h0006.htm#08031362000272">
	<p pid="a.147.0/1">I shall not say a great deal, because we have had a good debate. I appreciate my hon. Friend's approach. He will receive a letter to remind him of those of our findings that were not recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/2">I think that the question of the YL case has been troubling for everybody. The problem is that the Human Rights Act applies only to public authorities; a lot of people do not know that. That is where the difficulty has arisen. The Committee argues that, at least in the short term, we should return to where we were, or where we thought we were, before the YL case, so that publicly funded people in private or voluntary sector care homes have the protection of the Human Rights Act, which should be directly enforceable by residents, if necessary, against providers. The present post-YL system makes enforcement extremely indirect and difficult. We want direct enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/3">The wider issue of whether privately funded people should be included is more complex, partly because that was not what was originally intended by the Human Rights Act. It also raises wider issues about what is known in the human rights trade as horizontality&mdash;the right of private citizens to enforce rights against other private citizens or private bodies. That is why it raises significantly wider issues in relation to the human rights debate and, ultimately, the debate about the Bill of Rights. That is not to say that private funders should not have additional protections, but it is another question altogether whether that can be done through the YL reform mechanism. There is an argument that because there is significant state regulation of private sector care homes, they are therefore brought within the public authority definition. However, that is a complex and convoluted legal argument, and I shall not go into it in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/4">When the Committee was considering what amendment to the Health and Social Care Bill to propose on Report, we thought it better to go back to where we were before YL and let the arguments about private funders be resolved differently. As my hon. Friend the Minister has said, we should try to find better ways of protecting them without getting bogged down in the Human Rights Act. The problem has to be dealt with differently, because private provision goes far beyond people in care homes: it concerns adults with learning disabilities and people who receive publicly funded education in private schools. A whole range of additional services could be affected, so the issue is much wider. My Bill would refine the definition of a public authority to include such service providers. If we are to go beyond that into private enforcement by private individuals against private companies or people, it would involve a much bigger human rights argument, which has to take place in the wider context of the Bill of Rights debate. We want private funders to be protected, but not in that way.</p>

We will also discuss horizontality, or private enforcement against private bodies. That issue concerns much wider arguments and debates than apply here.
