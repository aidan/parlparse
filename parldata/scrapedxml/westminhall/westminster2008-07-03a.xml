<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-03a.304.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" speakername="Maria Eagle" colnum="304"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080703/halltext/80703h0001.htm#08070371000295">
	<p pid="a.304.4/1">Indeed, Sir Nicholas. I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman, who is Chairman of the Justice Committee, which is the relevant Select Committee, and is therefore listened to with extra care.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/2">The job of being the champion for a mere 5 per cent. of the people in the overall system at a time of great pressure is, of course, a challenge, and because the needs of the type of population that we are discussing are so different, it will always be difficult to ensure that those responsible at all levels of the prison system, including the highest level, focus on them. That will always be a challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/3">I do not necessarily accept the right hon. Gentleman's point. The women's estate is not overcrowded. The male estate is overcrowded, and, as he well knows, the projections do not indicate that that overcrowding will become a thing of the past in the near future. It is a fundamental requirement of any Government to try to ensure that there are enough prison places to accommodate those who are sent into custody by the courts. That is a first-and-foremost obligation on any Government, so it should not surprise anyone that, given the current situation, the Government have allocated resources to building the relevant places to ensure that they can meet their obligation over the medium term.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/4">I do not accept that Lord Carter's proposals&mdash;they are basically what we are discussing when we talk about the male estate&mdash;for getting us ahead of the curve, and the increase in the prison population, will not advantage women. If we can get ahead of that curve and ensure that we are not dealing with the pressure of numbers on a day-to-day basis, we will have an opportunity to reconfigure the estate, as Lord Carter himself said, in ways that may assist not only women but other vulnerable groups in the prison system. There are men who have similar vulnerabilities, so I see my position more as being able to forge an alternative way forward for dealing with vulnerable people in the prison system. Women have particular vulnerabilities that are not quite matched by those of other groups. None the less, there are similarities with other groups. It is really about trying to find more effective alternatives, which may then have a read-across to other groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/5">For example, throwing an enormous amount of money at building new small custodial units may not necessarily be the right way forward. We have to find a way&mdash;I am engaged in doing so&mdash;to ensure that the system can better meet the needs of women, who have particular vulnerabilities. I shall say a little more about that later. There is acceptance across the parties that too many women are in prison. Many of them are there for only short periods of time. Almost three quarters who are sentenced to custody receive a sentence of less than 12 months, which is acknowledged to be the precise length of sentence that is of least use in reducing reoffending. Evidence shows that that particular sentence is least able to tackle effectively the needs of those who come into the prison system, yet some women in prison are extremely vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/6">We know that up to 80 per cent. of women in prison have diagnosable mental health problems, compared with a figure of about 20 per cent. in the community outside. About one half of the women in prison report that they have been abused physically or sexually, and of course it is not just the women themselves who are affected by imprisonment. Women are far more likely to be sole carers than men. About 18 per cent. of female prisoners report that they are single and live with dependent children aged 17 or under. The equivalent figure for men in the prison system is 3.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/7">Given what we know about the likelihood of the children of offenders becoming offenders themselves, or of looked-after children or children in care ending up in prison during their lifetime, we must take a decisive step to break the cycle. In fact, we are facilitating intergenerational disadvantage and fuelling tomorrow's prison population, whether male or female, by not considering the children of these women. Such considerations do not apply to any of the other vulnerable groups in prison in quite the same way. Furthermore, the women's prison population is different from the male prison population in another way: women commit less crime than men, if one looks at the overall averages, numbers and percentages&mdash;I am not looking at individual instances&mdash;and their offences are generally less serious. In my experience in my job in the Ministry of Justice over the past year, most parties in the House agree that prison should be reserved for serious and dangerous offenders, yet we know that women, in the main, do not fit into that category in quite the same way that men do.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/8">Clearly, there is a need to protect the public from serious and dangerous offenders, to punish people for whatever crimes they have committed and to try to reduce reoffending. However, far greater percentages of women are put into custody, although they commit less serious offences that would not, in the scale of things, make them serious or dangerous offenders. In addition, far more women are remanded into custody, with 60 per cent. of those remanded being acquitted or not receiving a custodial sentence. The majority of those who are sentenced, as I have already mentioned, receive a sentence of less than 12 months, which is the least useful length of sentence&mdash;if colleagues in the Chamber understand what I mean by that&mdash;for reducing reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/9">The consequences for women in prison can be different from those faced by men in prison. Many women will lose their homes and children as a result of being imprisoned, and will return to the community in a less advantageous position than when they went into prison, not only because the causes of their offending have probably not been tackled effectively, owing to the length of sentences, but because they may have lost their accommodation, and their families and children. My noble Friend Baroness Corston set out all of that last year in stark terms in her report, and she particularly highlighted the fact that many women have multiple and interrelated needs, which are often compounded by severe drug problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/10">We have accepted Baroness Corston's analysis and the vast majority of her recommendations&mdash;40 out of 43&mdash;and I have decided, as the ministerial champion, to make regular reports to the House on how we doing in implementing the recommendations that we have accepted. The first report was laid before Parliament as a written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-24">24 June</phrase>. I am pleased to say that the Government have done everything in the first six months that we promised we would do. That is not the end of the story, but it is a start: the first step on a longer journey to full implementation of the recommendations that we accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/11">I should like to say a little bit more about how early actions can provide the foundations for a sustainable longer-term strategy that will turn the situation around and enable women offenders' needs to be more fully met across the criminal justice system, preferably before they ever end up in custody or, if they are in custody, as they come out, to stop that revolving door straight back into custody, which we see too much. The first six months of implementing the findings that we accepted has been about taking practical steps to begin expanding women's centre-type provision. Hopefully, some extra provision will come on-stream soon in Bristol and Cardiff. We need to get the paper products&mdash;the national service framework, the gender-specific standards and guidance to the Prison Service and the probation service&mdash;published, sent out and embedded in the Prison Service and probation service systems so that those who work in those systems have a fuller understanding of the different needs of women and more of an understanding in their day-to-day work about how they can make the difference for women offenders that we want to be made. Those paper products are needed to make sure that the fact that women need different treatment goes into the psyche of staff who work in the system, so that we start to see practical expressions of that different treatment, which is necessary, and its implementation. For example, the work that we have been able to do on ending strip-searching&mdash;it is called &quot;full searching&quot;, but it is strip-searching&mdash;is one example. The changing criteria for acceptance in women's approved premises is another example. I will say a little bit more about that later on.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/12">We are starting to see different treatment that better meets the needs of women on a gender-specific basis. That is unusual in the prison system: it is not something that those who work in the system are used to doing, and it will take a bit of getting used to. I am glad that, within six months, we will see some of the changes starting to happen and I believe that that will pay dividends in due course. I have been trying, as ministerial champion, to ensure that the governance arrangements and interdepartmental working at ministerial and official level are effective in driving through the changes. My noble Friend Baroness Corston made recommendations to seven Departments. Anybody who has been even a junior Minister knows that the hardest thing as a Minister at any level is making Departments work together effectively towards the same aim: that certainly has become apparent to me in the time that I have been a junior Minister. That is easy to say, but it is not easy to do. If we are to ensure that the recommendations are properly implemented and driven forward, it is important that Departments work together at ministerial and official level to achieve that. We have put in place some arrangements that are intended to facilitate that, but I will not mention them because, although they might be interesting to people who aspire to be constitutional lawyers or experts on Whitehall, they are about process rather than actual achievement. However, I am satisfied that those arrangements are working quite well so far and I intend to ensure that they continue to do so</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/13">In the next six months, we will focus on finding effective, practical ways of diverting resources into community provision that would otherwise be used to lock up women, and encourage sentencers to have some confidence in using such opportunities. Although offenders are judged against the framework of law by sentencers, it is important that magistrates or judges considering individual cases have confidence that sentencing women to community penalties&mdash;to action in the community&mdash;will work as well as they think imprisonment works.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/14">The evidence over the most recent period is that sentencers have been sending women to prison for less serious offences than men&mdash;anecdotally, that is partly because of persistent offending. Of course, one accepts that, in respect of individual cases, if somebody keeps appearing before a sentencer, having broken the terms of their community order, imprisonment is going to be the last resort. However, we need to ensure that the community provision that we provide has the confidence of sentencers. We need make sure that, over the next six months, what we can put in place has their confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/15">In the medium to longer term, diverting women who are needlessly and ineffectively sent to prison and preventing them from reoffending will bring down the female prison population. It is only through diverting women from being sent into custody in the first place and ensuring that those who come out the other end do not swiftly reoffend and go back through the revolving doors that we will get that prison population down over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/16">Prison is, of course, the right place for the most serious and dangerous offenders, but we need to ensure that the only women in prison are those who really need to be there. For less serious offences, a community sentence can be a better punishment and can be more effective in preventing re-offending. Evidence indicates that that is so for all groups. Baroness Corston argued that many women currently in custody should be in the community instead. I agree with that recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/17">We formalised our expectation clearly in the national service framework for women offenders, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-30">30 May</phrase>. That document sets out, for the first time, the different way in which women should be treated, given the different characteristics of women offenders. It aims to reduce the number of women coming through the criminal justice system and to ensure that the needs of women who are found guilty of an offence can be met in the community, wherever possible. It also aims to ensure that women who are sentenced to custody have appropriate facilities that properly meet their needs in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/18">The framework will provide the basis upon which practice can be developed and changed throughout the system better to meet women's needs. The importance of Her Majesty's Prison Service recognising the different needs and characteristics, as set out in the framework, should not be overlooked. Until now, there has been no formal, central document to suggest that it is correct or would be better or more sensible to treat women differently from men.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/19">The full search regime has been applied equally to men and women without taking into account the fact that many women in prison have been sexually abused or are suffering from mental ill health, and such a search may be infinitely more distressing and less useful when applied to women. That is just one example of how the paper product&mdash;the framework&mdash;which is readable but is not of itself an achievement, can facilitate achievement and change in future. The foundation of such documents, understanding them, taking them on board and implementing them throughout the service will enable us to make a difference in the medium term and to drive through the system what could be a profound change in the way in which different groups are handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/20">If we are to reduce the number of women coming through the criminal justice system, we must deliver more effective community sentences for them, and we must deliver more appropriate services for vulnerable women at risk of offending. It is important to devise elements of community sentences that tackle women's needs more effectively perhaps than has happened in the past. That is an important role for commissioners of such services at local and regional levels. If commissioners are to understand what is needed in their local area, it is important that they understand the different needs of women as opposed to those of men. Instead of just commissioning a service that looks at supporting people with mental health problems, we must recognise the particular needs of women with mental health problems and their particular vulnerabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/21">It is important that staff who carry out that commissioning are aware at all levels of the different approaches required to procure different interventions in their areas. Only when that happens will it be possible for sentencers, when considering different options, to have confidence that, if they do not send a woman to prison, there is something else out there to meet her needs and stop her from reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/22">To facilitate much of that, Baroness Corston wanted more multi-agency community centres for women. That is the way forward. Women's centres can bring added value to community orders and reassure sentencers, which is important. Established women's centres run by the third sector provide a one-stop shop to resolve a range of problems, from tackling mental ill health to issues to do with housing, domestic violence, debt, education needs and looking after children. Many of those issues are at the core of the needs of vulnerable women who often end up in prison. They may also be crucial in increasing sentencer confidence that community penalties are worth trying instead of prison sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/23">I have seen for myself the excellent work of many women's centres. For example, the Anawim women's centre in Birmingham works closely with the local probation service. Women attend the centre to fulfil their unpaid work requirement, which keeps sentencers happy because they can see that the unpaid work requirement is being fulfilled, and it enables the women concerned to receive support to tackle the underlying issues and problems that are causing their offending behaviour. For example, they can access the centre's range of courses, support with debt and child care issues, and a methadone programme, which enables them to stabilise polydrug use and to deal with issues that may arise from the chaotic lifestyle that many drug users fall into.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/24">I have spoken to staff at the Together women's centre in Yorkshire and Humberside about how they are delivering the &pound;9.15 million Government-funded programme, which is being evaluated. During my trip to York, I was heartened that the local bench chairman and other magistrates who came along to talk to me had the confidence to sentence women to community sentences rather than custody when they had seen what was on offer at the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/25">Initial findings indicate that services provided by such all-round provision are effective, and we need to make better use of them in the criminal justice system. We are considering increasing the number of such centres. We have contributed extra money towards setting up and running the Turnaround project in Cardiff in Wales, which I have also visited. We are putting money into piloting an integrated approach to combining residential facilities with a range of community-based services in Bristol. Perhaps more importantly, over the next six months a matter of great importance will be cross-Departmental work to examine the extent and nature of current generic women's centre provision, and the potential to develop and to make better use of such centres by bringing together agencies and funding streams with the potential to spread availability of such services much more widely. That is an important part of my effort over the next six months to take these ways of doing things further.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/26">We are planning to supplement the available community provision by asking the probation service to use approved premises more effectively for women who could benefit from the structured services provided. Instead of those who go into approved premises having to present a severe risk of harm to others, we find that women's approved premises are suitable for women who do not necessarily present a high risk of harm to others, but who may benefit because self-harm or the likelihood of reoffending may be reduced by the sort of structured services that are available there. That entails changing the criteria for use to suit the needs of women more. The existing criteria for their use tends to be based on the needs of male offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/27">The probation service has received the &quot;Offender Manager Guide to Working with Women&quot;, which will help staff to work with local partners, introducing them to the ways of dealing with women's accommodation, health and education needs to ensure that women offenders get access to those services and are not overlooked because their number may be smaller than the number of male offenders in a particular area.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/28">We must have better interventions to help to focus on the real causes of reoffending by vulnerable women in the community.We must have interventions designed specifically for women. About one third of women lose their homes while in prison, and lack of accommodation when they come out can be a key cause of swift recidivism. Help focused on accommodation can be particularly useful in ensuring that women do not return straight to offending when they leave prison, and do not come back through the prison door not long after they have left.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/29">Following an initial two-year funding stream from the Ministry of Justice, a project in the south-west is a one-stop shop to provide accommodation for women coming out of prison. It is focused on the Bristol area and other parts of the south-west, but because people in the local community, from the city council to the local probation service, have recognised its value in supporting people, the funding has been supplemented by other agencies, local and national, and the project will continue as a result of having demonstrated its worth. The truth of the matter is that responsibility for meeting those needs goes far wider than the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/30">The criminal justice system must do more, and our partners across Government and all agencies, central and local, must also do more. The more we can do together, the better. Local and regional partnerships, across agencies, Departments and the community and voluntary sectors, are key to progress, as is shifting resources from the &pound;35,000 or so a year average cost of locking up a woman to help to fund provision that will divert women from the risk of custody in the first place, and to help to give sentencers confidence that community-based provision is more effective and more likely to tackle the root causes of offending, and hence to help to reduce reoffending among women. I am looking carefully at how we might achieve that across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/31">Nevertheless, there will always be women who should rightly serve their sentences in prison. As such, we have to be sure that the prison system is adequately responsive to their particular needs. In recent years, we have made significant improvements in that area and we now spend more per prison place for women than for men.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/32">In line with Baroness Corston's recommendations, we aim to make further progress. We are implementing a set of gender specific standards for women prisoners to improve the care, management and resettlement of women. For women who have been abused&mdash;some sexually abused&mdash;strip searching is distressing and is at best deeply damaging. When I have visited women's prisons, many staff have told me that strip searching is worthless and never turns anything up. I was also told that it is demeaning and destructive of good relationships and respect between staff and prisoners. Strip searching should be done only when absolutely necessary and we have made excellent progress in reducing the number of times it takes place in prisons. Pilots are now running in five women's prisons to test a new kind of search that does not require the removal of underwear unless there is intelligence or a specific suspicion that items are being concealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/33">The early results are encouraging&mdash;much against the expectations of some&mdash;and I expect that the new arrangements will shortly be in place in all women's prisons. Already more than a third of the female prison population is benefiting from these changes and I have been given anecdotal suggestions by those operating the pilot that it makes the institutions much more respectful, better, more dignified places. The changes represent a major improvement in treating women prisoners properly and should improve dignity, respect and the relationships between all those who work and live in prisons, which is something that Baroness Corston was keen on ensuring progress with.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/34">In terms of the physical prison estate, Baroness Corston proposed that, over the next 10 years, we should replace existing women's prisons with geographically dispersed, small, multi-functional units, which she recommended should be designed to house 20 to 30 women in areas easily accessible to visitors, such as city centres. In setting out the case for small custodial units, she proposed a number of principles that should inform their development. Those principles include providing a multi-functional environment, at the same site ensuring closeness to home as much as possible and making provisions to strengthen family and community links to support re-settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/35">The Government certainly accept that those principles should underlie the way in which we design the women's estate. We had a project team look swiftly at the practicality and desirability of units of that kind of size, as we said we would do in our response to the report. The findings of our director-led working group on small custodial units are set out in our progress report, which was published last Tuesday. I do not propose to rehearse the arguments in full but, in summary, the working group found that it would be difficult to deliver the full range of services required to meet the needs of women prisoners in such small units. If the full range of interventions were not available, it may increase the frequency of moves, which would damage the aim of stability and closeness to home that is at the core of the report. There were concerns that units as small as 20 to 30 people could increase bullying and make those in them feel less safe. Those are real concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/36">We thought that units of 100 to 150 would be a more practicable size for dealing with all those issues. Some international evidence has shown that such a size is more usual. However, the planned addition of a new 77-place unit at Her Majesty's prison Bronzefield has presented the opportunity to test how redesigning the physical environment might work in practice. The current design of the new unit includes a number of small, self-contained blocks holding about 20 to 30 prisoners each within a larger site at the prison. The unit will combine a more communal and supportive small-scale environment with the ability to provide a wide range of services and interventions to meet the needs of the women who are imprisoned there. We intend to have the new wing in place by 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/37">Baroness Corston's proposals on the physical estate are being taken on board. We are not just going to build a new wing at Bronzefield that, if it did not have women in it, could have men in it&mdash;that is how estates have tended to be built in the past. Over time, we hope that the population of women prisoners reduces and that we will have the chance physically to reconfigure the estate using those principles. I do not think that any new women's custodial facilities will be built as wings&mdash;as many have been up to now&mdash;and that is a tribute to Baroness Corston's work.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/38">I shall conclude by briefly setting out the long-term actions we are taking to embed some of the improvements. We have started work on developing options to divert more women offenders from custody and to make sure that, wherever appropriate, they are dealt with in the community. The aim is to bring about a successful and sustainable reduction in the size of the women's prison population. If that is achieved, it could create real opportunities to make better use of the money we spend on locking women up, which, on average, is about &pound;35,000 per woman per year. It would also allow us to look at how we might reconfigure the women's prison estate, guided by Baroness Corston's principles, better to meet the needs of those women who will remain in custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/39">To make a lasting difference, the strategy should not be delivered in isolation&mdash;it is not an add-on to the way in which we run custody generally or the way in which the Prison Service runs. The changes will be sustainable only if we make them business as usual and bed them into the way in which the Prison Service works. That is what we are aiming to do. The changes we have made, the frameworks and governance we have put in place, and the initiatives for women we are delivering on the ground will ensure that the needs of women are no longer marginalised in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.4/40">There is no doubt that more needs to be done&mdash;this is a six-monthly report on a ten-year strategy. I certainly intend to continue to report regularly to Parliament on the progress that we are making in implementing the recommendations of Baroness Corston's report. I also intend to ensure that we continue to drive forward and implement the recommendations that we have accepted, so that in due course a real improvement in the conditions of women in prison and a real reduction in the numbers of women in prison will be there for all to see.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this extremely important debate on women with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system. It is also a privilege and very humbling to be in the presence of both knights and a champion today. It is important that we challenge and debate with the Minister, as she is the champion on this matter. All of us want to see action on a subject that has concerned many people for many years. The vulnerability of women in the criminal justice system is obviously not a new problem or concern. Although there is a large degree of consensus, there is a concern that we need to move towards action.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/2">The long title of the debate, which draws on the title of Baroness Corston's welcome review, is significant. Indeed, &quot;women with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system&quot; could lead some of those listening or reading the debate to think that it is exceptional for such women to be in the criminal justice system and that those with vulnerabilities are on the edge of the system. However, as we all know, vulnerability in relation to women is the norm rather than the exception.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/3">We have heard a number of statistics today, and although I do not wish simply to repeat them it is important that we clearly establish that vulnerability is not an exception in relation to the criminal justice system. When we consider that 43 per cent. of women suffer from depression; that 22 per cent. had a physical disability for which special assistance was required; that 73 per cent. had used illegal or non-prescription drugs or solvents; that more than 50 per cent. had used crack cocaine in previous years; that at least 50 per cent. of all self-harm incidents in prisons involve women, despite the fact that women account for only 5 per cent. of the overall population; and that self-injury rates rose by 48 per cent. between 2003 and 2007, we become aware&mdash;if we were not aware of it before&mdash;of the significance of the problem. As the Minister said, more than 80 per cent. of female prisoners have diagnosable mental health problems, so it is clear that vulnerability is very much at the core of the issue of women in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/4">Concerns have been clearly expressed by various groups and pressure groups. Indeed, in its briefing for today's debate, INQUEST has made it clear&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-03a.313.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="313"  time="015:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080703/halltext/80703h0002.htm#08070371000297">
	<p pid="a.313.1/1">I was recounting the concerns of INQUEST, which has highlighted the fact that the vulnerability of women in the criminal justice system is not a new problem. It paints a disturbing picture of what it describes as preventable tragedy between 1990 and 2007, stating that during that period</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/2" class="indent">&quot;115 women died in prison of which 88 were self-inflicted deaths. One woman has already taken her own life in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/3">It describes</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the high level of distress and vulnerability among women prisoners&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/5">and says that</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the persistent theme running through these deaths is the lamentable failure of the criminal justice system to enforce its own duty of care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/7">It concludes that women in prison are among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/8">We often hear statistics, but it is also important to hear from those who are affected and have direct experience. Page 27 of Baroness Corston's report describes what she was told by staff at Brockhill, who said that most of those imprisoned there</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/9" class="indent">&quot;were mothers. Some had their children with them immediately prior to custody, others had handed them to relatives or their children had been taken into care or adopted&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/10">The debate is focused on women, and women are often mothers. Indeed, in the prison estate, it is estimated that the mothers of some 18,000 children a year are sent to prison. Of those, 5 per cent. remain in their own home after their mother has been sentenced. It is estimated that by 2012, there are likely to be more than 200,000 children with parents in prison. A problem that arises from that is that only seven out of the 15 women's prisons, as I understand it, have facilities for children to stay with their mothers. The staff at Brockhill went on to say of the women who were imprisoned there:</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Some were pregnant. Some discovered they were pregnant when they had no idea that that could be a possibility...They were drug users. It was not uncommon to have &pound;200 a day crack and heroin habits disclosed...They were alcoholics...They often looked very thin and unwell...They had been sexually, emotionally and physically abused...They were not in control of their lives...They did not have many choices...They were noisy and at first sight confident and brash but this belied their frailty and vulnerability and masked their lack of self-confidence and esteem...They self harmed...They had mental health problems...They were poor&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/12">That is what the staff said, but it is important to think about the individuals involved. I can reflect on one such individual, Sofia, whom I encountered during my early years representing criminal clients, including women, as a defence solicitor. She was presented to me as a client who had just got into trouble and had been charged with a shoplifting offence, but as someone who had every potential in life. She was very able and from a relatively stable background, and she had the life chances that we would all hope she would have. However, she had recently come under the influence of a heroin addict, who had introduced her to drugs, particularly heroin.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/13">That was the situation when I first represented her at Enfield magistrates court, but there was another such occasion, and another and so on. The fifth time that I represented her, two years later, she had descended into addiction and suffered the consequences, which included homelessness and health problems. When she appeared in court she was particularly vulnerable. The court's various interventions, from fines, conditional discharges and probation, to supervision and community service orders, came and went, and in many ways failed. Indeed, she often breached the orders and continued as before. It is important to note that throughout those interventions, she was never given the opportunity to seek residential rehabilitation for her drug addiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/14">When she went to court for the final time&mdash;it was one of my last such appearances with a client&mdash;she was very much at the end of her life. I told the court that it was her last opportunity. She recognised that she had descended into heroin addiction and that her life chances were few, and it was her last opportunity to gain some kind of drug rehabilitation. Perhaps more by luck than planning, funding and a place became available for a residential placement, and Sofia wanted to take it. Before that, she often asked not to receive a community penalty but to go to prison, so that she could have a break from the people influencing her and to have some stability, but on this last occasion she decided to take what in many ways was the harder option&mdash;it presented her with more challenges&mdash;and receive assistance within a structured regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/15">I heard nothing of her for two years. As part of the addiction working group, which was part of the Centre for Social Justice policy review of addictions, I visited Phoenix house in Sheffield, which is one of the few residential units for women and children offering rehabilitation. Crucially, it provides a link to enable children to be with their parent, and thus enable the parent, as part of their rehabilitation, to help with family life. I was presented with a leaflet, part of which described what Phoenix House does. It provides excellent residential rehabilitation care, but the availability of such care is all too scarce, particularly for women and children. Lo and behold, the leaflet included a picture of Sofia, and told her story. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/16" class="indent">&quot;For 10 years I struggled to deal with childhood rape and abuse. I spiralled from one destructive relationship to another, trying many different substances and eventually becoming addicted to heroin and crack-cocaine. When I hit rock bottom I was living on the streets and slowly fading away.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/17">That was when I came into contact with her. She went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/18" class="indent">&quot;That is when I knew I had to get help&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/19">She received that help from the Alpha service. She took part in key work, including counselling sessions, and undertook various activities. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/20" class="indent">&quot;The best bits about being here are the structure&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/21">something that is often lacking in prison, rehabilitation or rehabilitation in the community&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/22" class="indent">&quot;the help of my peers in the therapeutic community and the support of the care team. Since being at Phoenix House I've built bridges with my family&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/23">that is crucial&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/24" class="indent">&quot;and started to make plans for the future I never before believed I had. I'm going to go back to college and get the qualifications I need to become a psychologist. Eventually I'd like to have a family of my own, but for now my own place somewhere safe with my inner peace will be fine.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/25">It was heartening to see that success story in the brochure from Phoenix house. Sofia came through the system. She was particularly vulnerable when she went through the criminal justice system, but she has found a way out through the assistance and fine work of Phoenix house. The challenge is to replicate and increase such experiences by using the voluntary sector and working in harness with the prison and probation services to ensure that stories such as Sofia's are not the exception.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/26">It is an old story that has been repeated in reports, initiatives and plans. The Children's Commissioner highlighted as a concern the relationship between mother and baby, particularly in the criminal justice system, and published a report in January drawing attention to the fact that there are too few mother and baby units, and that they are thinly spread across the country. That means that far too many women in prison who are expecting a baby are miles away from where they come from. As I understand it, there is only one unit, at Rugby in Warwickshire, for girls under 18. I invite the Minister to respond to that, or to investigate the lack of such facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.313.1/27">It is all very well to say that now, but it is important to make the point that when a review of mother and baby units was held as long ago as 1999, the matter was mentioned then, but very little has happened, and the problem has got worse. We all welcome Baroness Corston's report, and we are anxious that its recommendations should be implemented. It is important that, amid plans and initiatives, there is action on the ground, so that the Sofias of this world, mothers with babies, and those with other vulnerabilities can seek proper assistance. Concerns are particularly profound about the distance between prison and court, and how it has increased over the years. More than half of female prisoners are held more than 50 miles away from their home, and at least a quarter are held more than 100 miles away. We want to encourage smaller and more local units, as Baroness Corston recommended.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-03a.316.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="316"  time="015:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080703/halltext/80703h0003.htm#08070371000301">
	<p pid="a.316.1/1">I am grateful for that clarification. Moving to the Government's response, page 13 deals with the potential effects on vulnerable women. The Minister refers on that page to overseas examples of the negatives, rather than the positives, of the small unit model, concluding:</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/2" class="indent">&quot;We are not willing to risk women's safety until we are satisfied there is a model which reduces bullying risks.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/3">The reality is that women's safety is already compromised in many ways by the present state of prisons; the matter is already urgent. We have seen from the extreme figures on self-harm and death that women's safety is at risk now, and we must ensure that we move towards proper action.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/4">It is not adequate to deal with the debate and consideration of whether small units are appropriate simply by saying, &quot;Well, the answer is to deal with lower-risk, short-sentence women offenders in the community.&quot; No doubt we all want to encourage robust community penalties that are wholly appropriate, like Sofia's. She was given a number of community orders that failed, primarily as a result of her lack of compliance, but also because they were often not tailored to meet her needs, especially her needs as a drug addict.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/5">The figures on women in prison show that, although most females serve shorter sentences than males, the percentage of women sentenced for six months or less is double the 7 per cent. figure for men. The percentage of women serving six to 12 months is 7 per cent., as opposed to 4 per cent. of men. There is also a disproportion between the percentages of females and males serving sentences greater than 12 months, but nevertheless, 80 per cent. of females are sentenced to more than 12 months. That is a significant figure. Although it is important to deal with short-term sentences, it is also important to be aware that the reality is that 80 per cent. of women serve long-term sentences of more than 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/6">One cannot deal with the issue and Baroness Corston's recommendation by saying, &quot;Well, we'll deal with them better in the community.&quot; One must still grapple with the fact that while some people in prison need to be there, but they should be in units closer to home. One cannot say simply, as the paragraph that is headed, &quot;Ensuring appropriate provision for the target group&quot;, says, that</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/7" class="indent">&quot;more serious, longer-term offenders often have a different set of needs and requirements which may not in fact be best served by small custodial units.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/8">One size cannot fit all in relation to the numbers and units, but I must challenge the claim that the closeness-to-home issue is not pressing. What is the evidence for stating that prisoners, whether serving short or long-term sentences, are not concerned about how close they are to home? Sadly, as prisoners serve their sentences, relationships become sparser and less linked to the outside, and often the continuity of any kind of relationship is limited more to probation officers and less to families. I remember from my experience with clients that more often that not, their continuity of relationship was with a defence solicitor more than anyone else, which is depressing for anyone. I challenge the Government not to put to one side those serving long sentences, or think that closeness to home is not an issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/9">Both male and female prisoners are increasingly disconnected from their communities, and that disconnection continues after their resettlement. Although the usual supervision requirements provide prisoners with links after they have been dealt with by prison, those links are very limited, particularly for those serving sentences far from home. A different approach is required to take account of the whole estate and to establish new smaller prisons closer to the court and the local community. We need to ensure that prisons and their governors are responsible not just for ensuring prisoner safety and implementing rehabilitation programmes, but have a foot outside, as well as inside, the prison. That is why we have proposed prisoner rehabilitation trusts, with governors responsible both for what happens inside prisons and for rehabilitation inside and elsewhere. They would seek to work properly with the voluntary and private sectors and to run rehabilitation programmes that would dramatically improve opportunities for male and female prisoners, allowing them to pursue resettlement and not to reoffend.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/10">The critique of the Government's position is clear and comes from many sources. <i>The</i><i>Guardian </i>described the Government's response as &quot;lacklustre&quot; and went on to state that</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Corston's work appears to have been shelved. The truth is that the Government's reaction has been to dither.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/12">The Prison Reform Trust said that the Lord Chancellor was questioned by the Justice Committee about the lack of dedicated funding for implementing Corston's recommendations. The Howard League stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The reaction of the Government...was incredibly disappointing. They just set up a third review, thereby reacting with yet more procrastination, delay and cowardice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.1/14">Others have commented that we do not need any more reviews, or reviews of reviews.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.2/1">In a moment. [<i>Interruption.</i>] It is relevant. It is important that we do not compartmentalise the debate on the impact on women in the criminal justice system of these various plans and interventions, which is why people are concerned that Lord Carter did not mention women in the custodial estate.

	<p pid="a.319.4/1">As I have said, we look forward to the report, and we will see whether that happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.4/2">I shall not take too much longer, as several hon. Members wish to speak. I invite the Solicitor-General to consider the issue more widely, and not just look at over-18s. There is also concern about under-18s, who are serving long sentences during which they reach adulthood and go into the adult custodial system. What regime will they go into? If a young woman receives a custodial sentence in London, there are no secure children's units or homes there for her to go to. She would have to travel a long way to serve her sentence. It is always a concern if there is a great distance between someone's home and where they serve their sentence, but particularly so if that person is of a young age. We need to take proper account of that, and not lose sight of that issue and the lack of provision for under-18s.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.4/3">The Solicitor-General asked about costs and how we should deal with them. It is important that we look at costs in the round. In her report, under the heading, &quot;A final word on costs&quot;, Baroness Corston says:</p>
	<p pid="a.319.4/4" class="indent">&quot;Too often costs are masked by a narrow focus on prison places and a failure to take a necessarily broad view across departments responsible for health, social services, housing and employment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.319.4/5">She discusses the importance of considering the impact, across the board, of plans and initiatives. Cross-departmental work across projects is welcome, but it is important to consider those impacts. It is also important to consider making radical changes on costs or changes that would dramatically improve purposeful work in prisons and rehabilitation work outside prisons. That would lead to a large fall in reoffending rates, and would release a large amount of money that would properly be used in the criminal justice system. We need radical change, and the concern is that the Government's responses to Corston's report and previous reports have not gone far enough&mdash;certainly not far enough to bring about, in Baroness Corston's words,</p>
	<p pid="a.319.4/6" class="indent">&quot;a radical change in the way we treat women throughout the whole of the criminal justice system&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-03a.322.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="322"  time="016:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080703/halltext/80703h0004.htm#08070371000322">
	<p pid="a.322.0/1">I am glad that the Solicitor-General makes that point. It might turn out to be absolutely accurate. That connection, not just in this generation but in generations gone by, is crucial to understand how crime comes about, and how we might prevent it.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/2">It is important to improve conditions in women's prisons, which is another theme in the Corston review. I welcome the Minister's announcements on strip searching and I am glad to hear that the developments are working so far and that resistance to them is being broken down.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/3">There is concern about the basic fabric of women's prisons. As many women's prisons were originally designed for men, problems of privacy and sanitation make many such buildings unsuitable for women. I hope that the Solicitor-General will address that issue in her summing up. The greater use of approved premises is a very good idea, but it will not reduce the need entirely to use existing buildings.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/4">I want to comment on the issue raised by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate about small custodial units. Baroness Corston's report proposed setting up local units for 20 to 30 women with access to appropriate services. The Home Office's own research shows how important it is that prisoners maintain contact with families. The issue of separation from families is one of the most important that the Prison Service, women prisoners and the children themselves face. Two thirds of women prisoners have dependent children under the age of 18. In 2006, nearly 18,000 children were separated from their mothers by imprisonment. Let me give a perspective on how big that problem is: in that year, more children were separated from their parents by imprisonment than by divorce. It is an enormous problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/5">How does that affect the children themselves? The Government have not produced any robust research on that, but it is sure to be an important problem. It might even be&mdash;this is hypothesis rather than proven fact&mdash;that separation from family is a factor in self-harm and suicide.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/6">When the Government say that there are reasons for not trying out Baroness Corston's local-unit proposal, they should hesitate and perhaps think again. The Minister gave three reasons for not going down that route. First, there was the fear that small units might produce conditions in which more bullying is possible. Secondly, she said that there is a lack of specialist staff to cover all possible needs, and, thirdly, she said that there is a lack of resources. The question is, why not pilot the idea? The Bronzefield proposal is not quite the same thing. As the Minister said, the basic numbers in that prison are higher. The units will be smaller but they will be put together in the same place. Therefore, it would not be a fair trial of Baroness Corston's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/7">As the Government said, there are risks in piloting such schemes, but there are enormous risks in the existing situation. The risks are so high that if one were to put forward the existing situation as a new proposal, the Government would say the same thing&mdash;that they are not going try it out because it is too risky.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/8">I fully support my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> on the question of resources. In an intervention, he said that ample money is available for new prison building&mdash;including the type of prisons that I hope we will have another opportunity to debate at some point soon&mdash;but no money for other sorts of intervention or investment in the criminal justice system. I ask the Government to think again about piloting the Corston proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/9">We can learn much from the rest of the world, as the Corston review pointed out. Different regimes around the world achieve better results than we do in this country. In Denmark, for example, the basic principle is normalisation of prison life. Prison officers are highly trained, and overcrowding is illegal. We have to learn from others and not just go down routes that have been established for reasons of fear of risk and cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/10">The most obvious point in the Corston review was that too many women are in prison in the first place. On that, some of the Government's announcements are welcome. It is important that sentencers have confidence in community penalties. I agree that that area must be tackled. Sentencers lack confidence in community sentences because of the lack of resources for such sentences. A few weeks ago, a report from the National Association of Probation Officers showed enormous delays in getting offenders into community programmes. One of the biggest delays was on domestic violence programmes, to which the Solicitor-General has already referred. Therefore, it is a matter not of magistrates believing that only prison works&mdash;my experience of magistrates, including the one to whom I am married, is that they do not think that at all&mdash;but of the availability of programmes that they are confident can be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/11">I praise the pilot on integrated community and residential facilities&mdash;it is certainly worth supporting. Support has been given for the Turnaround project in Wales, which is another good project. I hope that the piloting of conditional cautions with rehabilitative conditions will be conducted in such a way that we can draw conclusions from it. I hope that there will be a big enough sample. I do not know how many people will be involved, but I hope that there will be a way of doing it that will come close to a random trial, because we can learn from that sort of trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/12">The problem is that we know of interventions that work, so perhaps we should consider those rather than just concentrate on possible innovations. Some of those interventions, including restorative justice, work better than short prison sentences. Joanna Shapland's review was published last week and it showed that restorative justice provided value for money, that it could lead to a 27 per cent. reduction in offending, and that, on the whole, it works. We know that drug and specialist courts work, as do certain forms of drug rehabilitation and mental health treatment&mdash;although not all. We should be acting on that evidence rather than always trying to think of something new or returning&mdash;as we always seem to do&mdash;to short-term imprisonment as a default option. That is all I want to say about the Corston report. The Government have responded to it, but there are many aspects of that response that are disappointing.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/13">There is one other issue that I want to raise today and it involves a woman with particular vulnerabilities in the criminal justice system; it has been mentioned before, but it deserves fuller consideration. It is the issue of the SP public inquiry and the resignation of Stephen Shaw, the prisons and probation ombudsman, as chair of the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/14">SP was a young woman in the prison system. She was remanded in custody at the age of 16. The period that we are concerned with is when she was aged from 17 to 19. She has repeatedly attempted to take her own life and engaged in self-harm while in custody. She has ended up in solitary confinement in cells that are normally used as punishment cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/15">There are unique circumstances in the case of the SP public inquiry. It is an article 2 inquiry about the right to life; the Government and the state have a duty to investigate circumstances in which a person's right to life is violated or might be violated. Unusually, in this instance we have the young woman herself available to speak about her experiences; SP is still alive.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/16">Mr. Shaw has been attempting to take this investigation further. The Howard League for Penal Reform is also involved in the case&mdash;as a solicitor, I believe, rather than as a campaigning organisation. It reported that Mr. Shaw's resignation letter says that he has found it impossible to carry out his duties because of a lack of co-operation from the Prison Service. Mr. Shaw says that the terms of reference that were agreed last year are now being &quot;challenged&quot; by the Prison Service. He also says that the Prison Service is seeking to</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/17" class="indent">&quot;control what other parties can and cannot see&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/18">including preventing him from having &quot;unfettered access&quot; to all the documents and to staff. Finally, he says that the Prison Service is attempting to</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/19" class="indent">&quot;dictate how I should conduct the investigation&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/20">and that it will not</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/21" class="indent">&quot;focus on the core issue: life-threatening self-harm amongst so many young women prisoners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.322.0/22">I ask the Solicitor-General to comment on what is going on and to say what Ministers are doing to correct it, in particular what they can do to assure the House that this inquiry will go ahead with the full co-operation of the Prison Service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-03a.328.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="328"  time="016:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080703/halltext/80703h0005.htm#08070371000324">
	<p pid="a.328.0/1">I have for some time had an interest in how women fare in the criminal justice system, and it has been heightened in recent years by the fact that I have a women's prison in my constituency. When I visit Low Newton, which I try to do fairly regularly, I am struck by two things. The first is the excellent work of prison staff to support the women and to try to discourage them from reoffending. The prison has very good health support services and the education centre is also excellent. Staff put a lot of work into not only the life skills that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> mentioned but skills for employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/2">The second thing I am struck by is that, despite the excellent work of the staff and the good facilities at Low Newton to support women and try to redirect them from crime, so many of the women simply should not be there. Generally, they are there either for being an accomplice to a crime or for shoplifting or drugs offences; very few of them are violent, at least to other people. A large proportion of them have mental health problems, and, generally speaking, they have had a vulnerable past and have often been in abusive relationships. They end up not having the coping skills to make a success of their lives, nor do they have support networks in the community to help redirect them from crime when they are released. Obviously, I very much welcome the Corston report. It has again put a spotlight on the fact that we are simply sending too many women to prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/3">Statistics show that courts have been using custody more frequently for women over the past few years. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> gave them earlier, so I shall not go through them again. Although we know that the nature and seriousness of women's offending has not, on the whole, been getting worse&mdash;there is now a slight increase in violent crime being committed by young women, but the overuse of custody in the system predated that&mdash;magistrates courts, for example, used custody three times more frequently in 2002 than they did in 1994, and evidence suggests that courts are imposing more severe sentences on women for less serious offences. Through my visits to Low Newton, I am able to witness how the statistics translate into reality for many women who should not be in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/4">Home Office figures show that in the past 10 years or so there has been a dramatic increase in the number of women in prison, from an average of 1,560 in 1993 to around 4,248 in 2006. The highest number, 4,672, was reached in May 2004, so there has been a slight decrease in recent years. Nevertheless, in the past decade or so there has been a huge increase in the women's prison population overall, although it still amounts to only about 5 per cent. of the total prison population.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/5">Historically, responses to offending have generally been developed with male offenders in mind, and Corston and the Government's response are now bringing an important, necessary and welcome break with that. However, the fact that women make up only a small proportion of offenders, and that about 14 per cent. of them are given community sentences, does not reduce the importance of addressing their particular needs and characteristics. If we fail to do that, there is a real danger that the women's prison population will increase again and that the lives of an increasing number of children will be seriously affected by their mothers' offending. I think that all hon. Members understand the terrible consequences, for children and their mothers, of women being put in prison, especially if the children end up in care.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/6">Custody rates and sentences for men have also been increasing over the period we discussing, but that does not negate the need to look specifically at how women are treated in the criminal justice system. I also recognise that the Home Office has, for some years, been examining the reasons behind the trend towards increasing numbers of women in the criminal justice system and has been thinking about steps to take to ensure that custody is used only in the last resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/7">Some recognition has been given to the need for a multi-agency support system, which has been around for some time. The Together Women programme, which my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley outlined, aims to tackle the various factors that can affect women's offending, including poor housing, mental health problems, substance misuse and abuse, child care, education and employment. It is interesting that Baroness Corston has asked for this to be extended to all areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/8">There are still gaps in the information on which approaches work best with women, particularly within the community. We also have to recognise that improvements will not happen overnight. We need to ensure that women offenders have access to and are retained in services and treatment that are appropriate to their needs. Understandably, sentencers sometimes see prison as the safe option for women offenders who may be a risk to themselves or others because of a mental health or drug problem. However, only by assuring the availability of effective community-based facilities and services will sentencers have a credible, effective alternative to custody. We should find it shocking that prison is often seen as a place of safety. However, I know that this happens because of what staff in my local prison tell me.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/9">There is also a demonstrated need for voluntary projects, such as the Open Gate project in my constituency, of which I am a board member, which seeks actively to involve women from local communities in supporting women ex-offenders. This unique local initiative is designed not only to deter women from returning to offending behaviour, but to educate people in the communities to which they are returning about their support needs when they are released from prison and to try to develop a greater understanding in the wider community of the needs of women prisoners and offenders. Open Gate engages with groups throughout north-east England, because the women in Durham prison do not come just from the local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/10">The Open Gate project has drawn on research showing that women need most support immediately before they leave prison, at the point of release and during resettlement into the community, when they can often feel abandoned and isolated in their struggle to avoid getting back into crime. It is at this critical point that women feel it is vital to have some kind of support, whether emotional support through a mentor or being put in touch with an advocacy project. They need reassurance and access to support through projects seeking to divert them from their previous lifestyle, which led to their offending. Open Gate aims to provide such support to reduce persistent re-offending and facilitate effective re-integration into the communities. It has good links with the probation service and the prison resettlement team, but identifies daily the need for a more co-ordinated multi-agency approach on release. Open Gate is trying to fill that gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/11">All voluntary projects, including Open Gate, would like a more coherent statutory framework, and related services, to engage with. In this context, I return to the Corston report. It is excellent that the report was commissioned and the Government's response to it is to be welcomed. There is still some way to go, but it is good that most of the report's recommendations have been accepted.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/12">Some of the report's particularly important recommendations include applying the gender equality duty to the criminal justice system so that we get an emphasis on women's needs; the need for women's prisons to be replaced with small multi-functional custodial centres, about which I shall say something in a minute; the excellent inter-departmental ministerial group that is now up and running; and the better co-ordination of pathways looking at women's specific needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/13">I want to highlight Baroness Corston's emphasis on housing. She identified the accommodation pathway as the one most in need of speedy, fundamental gender-specific reform. Of course, she recommends that more supported accommodation be made available to break the cycle of vulnerability and re-offending. The Open Gate project, which I work with, would certainly agree. We find that the greatest problem faced by women on release is the lack of suitable housing, and particularly the almost total lack of supported accommodation available to women on release.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/14">Life skills and education also need to be given greater priority and, as every other hon. Member has said, custodial sentences for women must be reserved for serious and violent offenders. Women who are unlikely to receive a custodial sentence should not be remanded in custody&mdash;that must be stopped&mdash;and sentencers need to be given more information about the alternatives to custody that are available. There is evidence suggesting, as is outlined in the Corston report, that magistrates and judges do not always know about the wide range of alternatives that might be available. We must ensure that they know that a viable alternative exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/15">There is also an urgent need to address the mental health issues. It is excellent that the primary care trust now commissions such services and that they are mainstream NHS services. We have a good prison mental health team in the north-east that is well funded, but it reports that, despite its best intentions, it is still unable to align the mental health support services in prison with those in the community, so more work needs to be done to achieve that alignment.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/16">The publication of the national service framework for women is to be welcomed. It clearly puts in place the strategic outcomes, including the desire to reduce the number of women entering the criminal justice system at all, and it talks about trying to ensure that sentencers are better informed about alternatives to custody and to reduce the number of women who end up in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/17">I share hon. Members' views that it is disappointing that the Government seem to have rejected the idea of smaller multi-functional units without carrying out a proper pilot scheme. Most of the people in the sector to whom I have spoken seem to think that Corston's suggestion for smaller units where good support can be given to women was sensible. I do not accept that the number is too small to be given adequate support. When those units are operational, they should be able to draw on services that are already available in the local community to support women. I hope that the Minister and her team will think again about that, and about pilots to demonstrate whether that approach could work.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/18">The issue is not just about supporting women better. We want to deter women from going into the criminal justice system in the first place, which requires more support services in the community. It would be nice if the money spent on keeping women in prison were invested in community support, including supported housing. The average cost of keeping a prisoner in a local establishment for females is about &pound;50,000, so if we can get this right, money should be available to divert to community support.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/19">I hope that the path on which the Government have embarked and their positive response to Corston will become reality. I welcome the updates on the implementation of the report that the Under-Secretary announced this afternoon. I thank her for engaging with all of us who have a real passion about the matter. I know that she shares that passion and that she is pushing the agenda forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.0/20">I hope that the great degree of consensus about women in the criminal justice system&mdash;we have heard about that this afternoon&mdash;means that it is relatively easy to move towards implementing the Corston report in full.</p>

	<p pid="a.332.0/1">I am pleased to speak in this important debate.

I pay tribute to the Under-Secretary of State, who is the champion for women in that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.0/2">We are talking about a relatively small number of women&mdash;about 4,500&mdash;and although numbers have doubled over the past 10 years, it is still small and we should be able to do something about it. It is small compared with the male population. The majority serve short sentences&mdash;earlier, there was a dispute about whether women serve long or short sentences. All the evidence that I have seen shows that the vast majority serve sentences of less than six months.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.1/1">I am drawing to the end of my remarks. I was speaking about funding for the Turnaround project. By their very nature, the posts are temporary. One person has already finished her secondment there, which has necessitated a change of worker. The project could have a big influence on policy relating to women in Cardiff, and I would like to see it put on a firmer footing. It is managed by Safer Cardiff, a voluntary sector organisation. It is in the right place.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/2">Wales does not have a women's prison. Women from south Wales are usually sent to Bristol, which causes huge difficulties for them. However, I would certainly be against having a women's prison in south Wales unless it is was of an entirely different nature, as the numbers would not justify it. It should be possible to stop the vast majority of women from south Wales going to prison if we provide enough support in the community. We have the framework to do so, but long-term funding is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/3">If the project continues, the women will have the solidity of knowing that they will still have a job next year. That would be good for everyone concerned, including the victims of women offenders, because as many as 64 per cent. of women released from prison in 2004 were reconvicted within two years, compared with 38 per cent. 10 years ago. The reconviction rate is rising. Victims want to know that whatever happened to them will not happen again, but under the present system it does. It would be much less likely if we kept that network of resources. I say well done to the Government, but my plea is for a firm foundation&mdash;a comprehensive network of preventive centres that could reduce the number of prison places that are needed. That should be the main focus. Before we consider custody units, we should concentrate on prevention.</p>

	<p pid="a.335.1/1">I would welcome that, but my hon. and learned Friend knows that I am of the view that the wrong people are being sentenced. As is often the case, women are being sentenced for something that is triggered by the actions of men. Arguably, we should completely recast the law on prostitution, making the man the perpetrator rather than the woman. However, that is a subject for a separate debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/2">One thing that strikes me in my role as chair of Commonweal is the importance of housing in allowing women to resettle. For men, employment is the critical determinant of an offence-free future. For women, I believe that it is housing and being reunited with their children. For women offenders, their relationship with their family is a profoundly rehabilitative thing, and is a great motivator for going straight.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/3">I am deeply concerned that it is possible to meet NOMS targets for housing and so on by giving a bit of advice, by pushing someone in a particular direction. Some local authorities deem that women who have been in prison have made themselves intentionally homeless, and women remain separated from their children after they have served their prison sentence because no suitable housing is available. Accommodation must be a priority. The best way to reduce the number of women in prison is to reduce reoffending. The figure that I find most worrying is not the increase in the number of women in prison, although it is worrying, but the increase in the proportion of women who reoffend. The figure has more or less doubled in the past 10 years. At every stage, we must reduce that re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/4">I believe that small holistic units will reduce reoffending, and the horrible distress seen by all who have visited women in prison. I will never forget the woman I visited in a prison in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> who had buried a pen in her arm. It was part of a huge history of self-harm, which ended in her killing herself. We should never forget that the trigger for the Corston report was the deaths of five women, who killed themselves, in Styal. The reason for small units is not only that they are the most likely units to rehabilitate women, but that they provide for many vulnerable women who have been victims an opportunity for a more optimistic life and for reducing the distress that inevitably goes with prison, separation from their children and so on. I believe that we should put those units higher up the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/5">I should like briefly to talk about children, because more children suffer from the experience of having a parent in prison than from a divorce in their family. We should not tolerate that. I was looking at my case load of women from my constituency who had gone into prison and found one classic example. A Zimbabwean woman who has two children&mdash;she is an asylum seeker&mdash;had used forged documents to obtain employment so that she could look after her children. She did not think that she would go to prison on the day she appeared in court. She left her children with her sister and was locked up after her case was heard. Nobody&mdash;absolutely nobody&mdash;apart from her solicitor knew that she had children to take care of. There is no system to ensure that when something like that happens to women&mdash;and women often do not believe that they will be given custodial sentences&mdash;there will be any care for their children. The woman's sister was also an asylum seeker and she had no National Asylum Support Service money for the children. We can imagine the impoverishment of that family. The woman was sentenced to a year in jail. That is just one example of the over-sentencing of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.1/6">I urge the Solicitor-General very strongly to do two things for the children of women prisoners. First, we must have a system that knows that they exist. In our present system, there is no duty on the Prison Service to keep a record of the children for whom a prisoner is responsible. A promise was given on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-12">12 September 2004</phrase> in answer to a parliamentary question that the figures would be kept but, to date, they have not been kept. My first request to the Solicitor-General is that as part of the programme, we should begin by keeping those figures for women prisoners. We have recognised that we need to take a different approach to achieve equality for women, so let us start by keeping those figures, because we know that women are more likely to be responsible for their children, although many male prisoners have children. Let us start by finding out about the children for whom women are responsible. Secondly, let us ensure that, when women leave prison, they have a home to go to where their children have the prospect of living with them. Those two things would make a real difference to women in the custodial system.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.0/1">I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase>. I should get this over with so that I can turn to the substance of the debate: it is a pity that neither Opposition party could muster a single woman to come and talk about vulnerable women in the criminal justice system, but there we are. The input of the spokesmen was, none the less, good to have.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/2">We have heard again today some of the many reasons it is right to have a distinct strategy for women offenders. That is a proposition to which the Government have been committed since 2004, and for which we clearly understand the need. We are committed to making real and lasting improvements in how we deal with women who come into contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/3">I should like to deal with some of the criticisms that were thrown over the Chamber, as it were, by the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate. He said that the Government are not committed to making the changes to the estate that Baroness Corston advocated because the money is going on Titan prisons. The Under-Secretary of State for Justice, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" name="Maria Eagle">the Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle)</phrase>, made it clear at the outset that the resources that are going into the male building programme need to go into that programme. However, it is not a resource issue primarily that steers us away from the small local units that Baroness Corston advocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/4">Let me be clear: my priority&mdash;our priority&mdash;is the many women who are unnecessarily in prison. We do not want women to be in custody unless it is absolutely necessary, so more can and must be done to divert women offenders from custody when provision in the community would be much more appropriate in a large number of cases. That is our priority&mdash;it is not about building more, bigger women's prisons if that is what the hon. Gentleman was making some sort of hilarious bid for. There is no overcrowding in women's prisons, and we want to get more women out.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/5">There are bound to be a small number of women&mdash;let us be clear that the number is small&mdash;who are going to be in prison and who are perhaps going to be there for some time: they have committed very serious offences or present a risk to others. We have a responsibility, which is heightened by Baroness Corston's very good analysis, to ensure that the custodial system fits those women's needs. We should ensure that the system is not simply what one fears has happened historically&mdash;one senses a resonance of that fear around the Chamber&mdash;namely, a system based on the fact that women's prisons have been tagged on to the end of men's prisons because women are such a small group of offenders that they have never merited enough focus of their own. We must stop that, and perhaps we have already. One might think that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary exemplifies as a champion for women the fact that that approach is well behind us.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/6">On the small custodial units for 20 to 30 women based in town centres, which is what Baroness Corston proposed, we concluded that there were demerits, if that is not a clumsy concept. First, overwhelmingly, prison must provide a wide range of effective interventions, programmes and resettlement services. We concluded that it would simply not be practical to do that in the proposed tiny little units, even if we consider only women's needs for training in life skills, financial management, self-confidence, basic literacy and numeracy and so on, which my hon. Friends mentioned. All those things must be put in place before going on to anything like training for a job outside. How on earth could all those things be made available in a tiny unit? They could not, any more than a full, across-the-board education for children could be supplied in a tiny school. The difficulty&mdash;this is one of our fears about the proposition&mdash;is that a woman in custody would have to move to receive all the inputs and courses that she required, which would be wholly undesirable. The Tories appear to advocate it, because they tell us that they support small units. We therefore assume that they are going to finance them, although the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate was ominously quiet when I asked him about figures for sizes, money or anything else, to put some flesh on the bones of the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/7">That picture, which is based on a real fear, is not of a stable situation. Such arrangements are not a recipe for enabling someone to settle into their sentence and use the advantage that can be offered in what would appropriately be somewhat larger units. Small units could not deliver the wide range of services that women would require. The hon. Gentleman tried to assimilate the notions of small units and being close to home, and they look as if they go together. However, at present, the average distance&mdash;it is open to comment&mdash;of a woman in custody from her home is 55 miles, and for a man it is 49 miles. Whether that is an acceptable distance or not, there clearly is not, because of the absence of small units, the massive association that the hon. Gentleman suggested. It is not the refusal to spend resources or the failure to appreciate the importance of local contacts and the preservation of family ties that have led us to conclude that there are difficulties with the proposal.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-07-03a.339.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="339"  time="017:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080703/halltext/80703h0006.htm#08070371000338">
	<p pid="a.339.2/1">My hon. Friend puts her finger on probably the best proposition made today for combining localism with all the different services that we are conscious such women need. Approved premises vary in size; some have accommodation attached, so there may be prospects for some kind of service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/2">We considered the question of small units fairly quickly, because of the state of flux of the estate generally and the need to consider questions involving building as early as possible. I emphasise that proper considerations of the kind that I described brought us to the conclusion that the model advocated by Baroness Corston was not entirely correct, but that the principles that she outlined were entirely right. We also looked to the immediate prospect of testing her principles for managing women who must be in prison, in the new 77-bed wing at Bronzefield.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/3">There are now gender-specific standards in women's prisons, and a number of people are very pleased about that. It is key, as is the assault on the horror of repeated strip searches as part of a prison regime. Before I was a Member of Parliament, I sued the Home Office repeatedly for excessive strip searches of women prisoners. It was a proposition to which the Home Office clung at that time, but Baroness Corston has seriously shaken up that position. She made it clear how strongly she felt that it was, in the main, unnecessary. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has championed the need to test the necessity, which was found quickly to be fairly fragile. As she said, about one third of women in custody are not now subject to the regime of strip searching that Baroness Corston criticised. We hope that that will be rolled out further fairly soon. As an aside, it is interesting that because the custodial estate for women is so small&mdash;there are so few women in it&mdash;radical things such as that can be done quite quickly. We should be trying to use that smallness to do radical things that we might in time be able to read across to men or other vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>, as ever, got to the core of the issues. She talked, as many have, about the vulnerability of people going into custody, the difficulties presented by the question of whether to leave a person with their child, the high proportion of women in custody who have children for whom they are responsible, the difficulties of rehabilitation and the overwhelming need for support. I can only applaud her understanding of the issues, as I applaud my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase>, who has three prisons in her constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/5">As I said, I have been to Low Newton, as my constituency lies in the same direction. I know the governor somewhat. He is excellent, and it seems to me that the prison does a lot of enormously good work with young women whom she described perfectly as people with inadequate coping skills. Whatever the misfortune&mdash;whether it be domestic violence or something as small as debt&mdash;they cannot cope without their lives descending into chaos. One must start at the very bottom with them in teaching life skills and management. Again, she reflected what Jean Corston found important. Such women have a long way to go before one can consider teaching them skills for going out into the world; the ability to manage themselves as people is lacking, and that is a great shame.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/6">My hon. Friend is right that Baroness Corston shone light on that issue. She mentioned the good efforts made in prisons such as Low Newton and gave an impressive reference for Open Gate, which supports women at their most vulnerable time, pre-release. That, too, synchronises with Baroness Corston's emphasis on the availability of well-publicised support systems. My hon. Friend made the very good point that the issue might not be exactly the one countenanced by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase>, who said that it is over-subscribed and not used because it is under-resourced. The issue may be one of availability and understanding of exactly what good things projects such as Open Gate can do.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/7">My hon. Friend talked about the mental health team at Low Newton. I remember seeing a young woman when I went there who had repeatedly attempted suicide in the most amazing circumstances. She was under constant watch in a cell that fronted the corridor. There was an officer with her all the time who conversed with her through the bars and people passed and said hello, but despite that she had still managed to attempt suicide a number of times. The good people at Low Newton were keen to get that young women out of the prison and into some better, more supportive community, and they found what my hon. Friend called a misalignment between the availability of local hospital places and the good efforts that can be made in prison, but that simply cannot reach out to somebody such as that. She made a sound point.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1481" name="Julie Morgan">the Member for Cardiff, North (Julie Morgan)</phrase> agreed that we all agree that we are talking about very vulnerable people, and summed up well what we all say ought to be the right features of the way forward. She is entirely right to say that we should not be talking about mother and baby units when we do not have to. By and large, women with children should not be going into custody, unless it is overwhelmingly necessary&mdash;I shall turn to the query from the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate about women and baby units in a minute. My hon. Friend made a strong point about fragile funding, and I am sure that the little project in Cardiff that she mentioned could be pivotal. Her point has been heard. Currently, there is no women's prison in Wales, and she does not want one, which I was relieved to hear. I agree with her.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Slough raised a very specific point about NOMS and the failure to record whether a person taken into custody&mdash;even women&mdash;have children. I am told that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary takes that point. I understand that the Home Office promised, on the birthday of my hon. Friend the Member for Slough, in 2004, to put that on the computer. I am sorry that that has not been done yet, but my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary will write to her, and has taken the point on board, as she could not fail to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/10">I am slightly disappointed that I could not please my hon. Friend the Member for Slough more by telling her about the caution that we have in mind for prostitution&mdash;but I must not allow myself to be taken off on to a different debate that I am sure we will have quite soon, given that we are currently reviewing how we deal with prostitution. At the end of the review, in about a month, there are bound to be issues to air.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/11">The hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate mentioned mother and baby units, but I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff, North: we do not want children in prison at all, if we can avoid it. Our aim is to keep women with children in the community if possible. Most women who enter prison either are deemed not fit to care for their children, or prefer to make other arrangements. There are seven mother and baby units with a capacity of about 75, and the guiding principle for admitting children is their interests. I am told that no child is refused a place on a mother and baby unit owing to capacity problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/12">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of girls under 18, and I am told that very few of them have their children with them in custody. According to the Youth Justice Board, a small number of women at Rainsbrook are in that position, but that is by way of a caring place to enable the mother to bring up the baby at the same time. In exceptional circumstances, and only if it is in the interests of the child, an under-18-year-old can be accommodated in the adult mother and baby unit, but I am told that that is not a significant issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/13">The hon. Gentleman quoted some prison population figures, and he will have noted that we all reeled with disbelief when he suggested that 80 per cent. of women prisoners were serving sentences longer than 12 months. As my hon. Friend the Member for Slough said, the other measure is court outcomes, which give a more accurate figure, because women are counted only once, whatever sentences they receive. On those figures, of all women given a custodial sentence, 76 per cent. are serving under 12 months. It was interesting that, when he quoted the 80 per cent. figure, we all reeled with disbelief. That is a measure of how steeped in trying to tackle this problem the Government are and how at large in a strange land he is.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/14">I shall touch on some issues raised by the hon. Member for Cambridge, whose measured and occasionally praising contribution I very much enjoyed, as I usually do. We cannot help him entirely with his question about drugs mules. I can tell him, however, that 20 per cent. of women in custody are foreign nationals, and about half of them are being sentenced for drug offences. I am not a great mathematician, but that means that about 400 are drugs mules, and therefore that about 600 are facing sentences for different offences. If we can clarify that further, and if he is interested, I shall write to him about the offences for which sentences are being served.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/15">I do not propose to dwell on titan prisons, but everyone except the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate knew before they came into the Chamber that they are not warehouses at all. They are built for bulk but are broken down into small units. He needs to get a grip on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/16">It is not true that no funding has been allocated specifically for improvements for women offenders. The Government response highlights where there has been additional funding. We have heard about the Turnaround project, and there has been passing reference to something very important&mdash;the &pound;9.15 million for the Together Women programme, which opens up the possibility of the conditional caution, which the hon. Member for Cambridge welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/17">In places where conditional cautions have been taken up strongly and there is a Together Women project&mdash;in Liverpool and Calderdale, West Yorkshire, for example&mdash;the Crown Prosecution Service and the police will work together on a pilot basis. They will divert women whose offending is linked to a vulnerability, so that they may be, as a condition of their caution, taken out of the criminal justice system and obliged instead to take a needs assessment to work out what underpins their offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/18">We cannot go significantly further than that because we cannot compel someone on a conditional caution to take two years' worth of counselling. However, people involved in TWP in Calderdale and elsewhere confidently expect that, if we get women to come through their doors and have their needs assessed, they are likely to come back on their own account to have those needs attended to afterwards. We have some hopes for the pilot, which will be carefully evaluated; indeed, it is being fully funded for that reason. Small though it is, it is a fairly important step for us. It is a bit more evidence that we are determinedly taking every opportunity to try to prevent women from being in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/19">I hope that I have dealt with all the issues that hon. Members have raised. Let me congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, in his absence, on being made a knight. I hope that I have addressed hon. Members' real concerns, rather than the posed ones, about the Government's commitment to improving the way in which vulnerable women are dealt with when they come into contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/20">The Government's commitment is clear. With a champion such as my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary, how could it be anything short of clear? She has taken on her shoulders a mantle of transparency by reporting to Parliament, when she does not have to, exactly what she is doing. She has taken the step of making a written ministerial statement after six months and says that she will come back. Clearly, if she keeps her word, which she will, we will have to have made some progress, because we will look very silly saying the same things in six months' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/21">I am grateful for hon. Members' contributions. I was pleased to get some reasonable praise from the hon. Member for Cambridge, although he wants more to be done, and I was not surprised to get no praise whatever from the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate. I can tell hon. Members that Baroness Corston, who was overheard on &quot;Woman's Hour&quot; yesterday talking about her report, has given the Government's progress so far about eight out of 10. As my mother used to say to me even when I brought home school reports that good, which was not very often, &quot;We need to do better, don't we?&quot; Well, we do, and we are determined that we will.</p>
