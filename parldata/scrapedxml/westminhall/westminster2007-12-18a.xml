<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.189.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="189"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0001.htm#07121856000454">
	<p pid="a.189.2/1">I wish you and all other Members present a merry Christmas, Mr. Martlew. I thank the Speaker for granting me permission to introduce this debate, and I welcome the Minister to his place to listen and respond to my constituents' concerns. I also thank the Leader of the House for granting permission for Westminster Hall debates to take place on this final Tuesday before Christmas. In previous years, the habit has been to cancel today's debates, but in a very welcome decision, he has decided to allow them, which will permit another four and a half hours of parliamentary airtime in which a wide variety of concerns can be raised and drawn to the attention of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/2">In the next 15 to 25 years, Kettering, which I have the privilege of representing, will face a challenge arising from the number of new houses that the Government say needs to be built in the borough. That is causing problems for the local community because, I am sorry to say, the infrastructure needed to support that housing growth is not being delivered at the rate at which it should be. I received a letter from the leader of Kettering borough council, Councillor Jim Hakewill, which I shall read to the Chamber. He sums up very well the concerns of the local community about the so-called sustainable communities plan proposed by the Government and how it will apply to Kettering. He writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/3" class="indent">&quot;As leader of Kettering Borough Council I would like to record my increasing concern as to the deliverability of the steep housing growth targets that have been allocated to our Borough as part of the Sustainable Communities Plan&mdash;Milton Keynes South Midlands growth area.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/4" class="indent">We have welcomed National and Regional Ministers to Kettering as well as colleagues from the Government Office for the East Midlands, to see first hand the potential, but also the barriers for delivering the national housing growth targets in our Borough. Whilst we have been appreciative of the time and consideration given to our concerns, it is some five years since the announcement of the Sustainable Communities Plan. Whilst we have seen some support for our town centres via GAF funding&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/5">&mdash;growth area funding&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/6" class="indent">&quot;we have seen little evidence of deliverable infrastructure planning from government departments, let alone anything physically on the ground. If North Northamptonshire is to become a successful community of 400,000 people, it needs a university campus, road and rail infrastructure and business support.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/7" class="indent">The clear agreement back in 2003 was that there would be a sequential approach based on infrastructure, jobs and homes. The bargain struck with local people at that time was that this would not just be a homes-led agenda to relieve pressures on the south east, but a genuine infrastructure approach which would deliver benefits to our existing residents, businesses and visitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/8" class="indent">I am happy for you to deliver this letter and the message within it to those senior politicians who have it within their power to work across departments to deliver on that original commitment, infrastructure, jobs then housing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/9">That is the dilemma that Kettering borough faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/10">Much of the infrastructure that Kettering needs is in the field of transport. I know that the Minister has no direct control over the Department for Transport, but it is crucial that his Department regularly engages with the DFT to deliver his sustainable communities plan. I pray in aid a recent comment made on the Floor of the House by the Secretary of State for Transport, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/11" class="indent">&quot;Given my experience at the Department for Communities and Local Government and now at the Department for Transport, I can assure him&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/12">the right hon. Lady was referring to another hon. Member&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/13" class="indent">that the two Departments are joined at the hip when it comes to planning for more houses... It is essential that we build sufficient capacity so that people can travel by train, road, bus or however they want to move around. In that way, we can meet the needs of a growing population, and of those who will live in the houses yet to be built.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-12-04.679"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 December 2007; Vol. 468, c. 679</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/14">I took that as a reassurance that the Department for Transport and the Department for Communities and Local Government were joined at the hip in delivering the necessary infrastructure that communities such as Kettering require.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/15">In a letter written in August 2006, I was told by another DCLG Minister that the Department</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/16" class="indent">&quot;has allocated significant funding to ensure that the necessary supporting infrastructure is provided at the same time as development goes ahead&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.2/17">It would appear from the assurances given to my constituents that both Departments are committed to delivering the infrastructure that local communities such as Kettering require to ensure the scale of housing growth that the Government envisage.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.0/1">My hon. Friend raises a very important issue, just before Christmas&mdash;I, too, wish everyone a very happy Christmas. He talks about transport infrastructure, but I am sure that he acknowledges that other forms of infrastructure, such as dentists, doctors, leisure facilities and schools, are also important. Not only are we not getting the &quot;infrastructure first&quot;&mdash;that was the slogan that I suggested for Thames Gateway&mdash;but infrastructure is being taken away. For instance, the policy of secondary school closures is set against a backdrop of extending compulsory education to 18 and of Government targets, which are forcing thousands of more houses on to those communities. Should the Government not have a moratorium on school closures until we know the impact of those changes?</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.190.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18b.190.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.190.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="190"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0001.htm#07121856000456">
	<p pid="a.190.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his very helpful intervention. I was disappointed to hear of the difficulties being experienced by him and his community over the lack of joined-up government in the delivery of the ongoing infrastructure required for growing communities. Part of the difficulty is that the Government's housing expansion agenda is so ambitious and aims to build so many houses in such a short time that it seems to have huge difficulty co-ordinating the delivery of the extra infrastructure and support services needed by those who will live in the houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/2">The very strong argument for Kettering is that, if the Government cannot fulfil their promise to put infrastructure first, they need to scale back their housing expansion plans; otherwise the result will be tens of thousands of new houses in north Northamptonshire, but a worse quality of life for those moving in to the new houses and for the existing residents, because the already groaning infrastructure endured by local people will be unable to cope. I am very disappointed that a similar situation seems to be arising in my hon. Friend's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/3">I am disappointed: this is not the first time that I have had to raise this issue in this Chamber. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-12">12 October 2005</phrase>, in the first Westminster Hall debate that I secured after the last general election, I was delighted to raise these issues with the Minister's predecessor, now the Minister for the Environment, in a debate about overdevelopment in Northamptonshire. Overdevelopment is basically lots of houses without the infrastructure needed to support them. What disappoints me is that very little progress seems to have been made towards providing that infrastructure since I brought my constituents' concerns to the House on that occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/4">I also had the privilege of securing another Westminster Hall debate, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-19">19 July 2006</phrase>, on the problems of the A14, the major road that serves my constituency. Despite my raising those concerns with the then Transport Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" name="Stephen Ladyman">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Dr. Ladyman)</phrase>, plans to introduce proposals to improve that road have been put back since that debate. The theme of my remarks today is that the strategy of infrastructure, then jobs, then houses, which local people were promised, has not happened. In fact, realisation of the infrastructure commitments that were signalled now seems further away than they were in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/5">North Northamptonshire has been pre-eminent in the delivery of additional housing as part of the Government's sustainable communities plan. In the borough of Kettering, there are 36,000 houses. Under the Government's proposal, a statutory duty has been placed on the borough to make provision for an additional 13,100 houses by 2021. In other words, the borough will increase by one third, which must be one of the fastest growth rates of any community in the whole country&mdash;it is an extremely ambitious target. The four communities of Kettering, Corby to the north, Wellingborough to the south, and east Northamptonshire to the east form north Northamptonshire. Overall, the requirement is for an extra 52,100 houses in north Northamptonshire by 2021, as part of a county-wide increase of just under 100,000 houses by that date. By 2031 the population of Northamptonshire is set to rise from 660,000 people to just under 1 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/6">That rate of growth is unprecedented in the history of the county and of the borough of Kettering. Traditionally, Kettering has been a successful and thriving market town, which has evolved over the years and never had growth imposed upon it. Because it has evolved, it has a settled infrastructure that has served the community extremely well until now. Now, despite the rate of growth that is being imposed, it is increasingly unlikely that local people will receive the extra infrastructure that they require.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/7">In north Northamptonshire as a whole, 2,500 new homes are completed every year. The area forms part of the wider Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area, which delivers a higher rate of annual housing growth than that of the Thames Gateway, about which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> has raised concerns. However, developers, local councillors, residents and planners all agree that local growth on that scale will be sustainable only if there is sufficient investment in the associated infrastructure. An example of that is the supposed&mdash;yet to arrive&mdash;improvements to the A14.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/8">The A14 is a road of European significance. On maps in the European Commission, it runs from Dublin, through Wales and England, past Kettering to the east coast ports and then into Europe. An &quot;E&quot; number is attached to it. Some 70,000 vehicles a day use it driving past Kettering, and the road is close to capacity. Everyone agrees that it is the major brake on housing expansion in north Northamptonshire, so the Highways Agency needs to introduce a proposal to sort out the capacity on that road. Currently, however, there are no proposals to do anything about it until 2016 or 2017. The plans that the Government have placed a duty on local councils to deliver are meant to be completed in 2021, but major improvements to that major road are not scheduled until almost the end of that programme. It is a perfect example of infrastructure not leading but following housing expansion.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/9">When I expressed local concerns about the A14 in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July</phrase>, the then Transport Minister assured me that the Highways Agency was considering an options study of the road's Kettering bypass section, and that the agency would make proposals to him in due course. Unfortunately, the timetable continues to slip. February 2003, when the sustainable communities plan was published, was the first opportunity for local people to try to understand the imminent changes to their local community. In July 2003, the then Secretary of State for Transport, now the Chancellor of the Exchequer, responded to the recommendations of the then London to south midlands multi-modal study to widen the A14. In 2004, the Highways Agency appointed consultants Scott Wilson to work on the potential for widening the road, and throughout 2005 the agency issued a number of article 14 directions against housing developments in the locality on the basis that the proposed developments could not go ahead because the A14 did not have enough capacity to cope with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/10">In November 2005, however, at a north Northamptonshire summit, the agency advised local people that there was no automatic expectation that it would recommend investment in the A14 before 2021. I secured my parliamentary debate in July 2006, and later that year the A14 issues group was established, involving various Government agencies, the county council, the local planning unit and the Government office for the region; however, Kettering borough council was not invited.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/11">The important point is that DCLG, or perhaps it is the Department for Transport, often seems to forget that planning powers lie with local district councils. In November 2006, Kettering borough council granted planning permission for an office development on a site known as Cransley park, or &quot;the scrapyard&quot; to local people, at the entrance to Kettering from Northampton by the A14. The council was unaware, however, that the Government had established the A14 issues group. That site is now blighted because no one locally knows the proposed route of an offline extension to the A14, which seems to be the Highways Agency's favoured proposal. In yet another example of joined-up government, the local council, in all good faith, has granted planning permission for a development to create job opportunities in the borough, but because it was not involved in major transport decisions, the site is effectively blighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/12">In January 2007, the then Transport Minister, the hon. Member for South Thanet, came to Kettering and gave a commitment that the Highways Agency would submit proposals to him on the future of the A14 by spring 2007. Those proposals have still not arrived, and I understand that it could be late in 2008 before any hard and fast proposals are advanced. The problem is that local people are suffering. Congestion in Kettering itself is getting worse, and access to the A14 for my constituents who live in Burton Latimer, Rothwell and Desborough is extremely difficult at peak times.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/13">The local business community is also suffering. The Northamptonshire chamber of commerce recently commented:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Business is being lost in the county as a direct result of road congestion and the situation is only going to get worse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/15">Mr. Griffiths, who heads up that chamber, went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The impacts of congestion are reaching a ridiculous scale, having a direct and significant impact on the bottom line of Northamptonshire companies. Local businesses cannot remain competitive if they lose time, trade and money through rising transport congestion. And, yet we are still to see any concrete solutions or investment plans from government to address it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/17">In a comment that I wholeheartedly endorse, he went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/18" class="indent">&quot;Transport issues are not just down to business&mdash;think about the impact that the school run makes on peak travel times&mdash;indeed, many small businesses are looking to technology, for teleconferencing, remote working, instant messaging, to avoid travelling. But, in a growing county such as ours, the congestion situation will only get worse. We need action on roads, (especially the A14 and A43), we need action on public transport, and we need action on congestion, and fast!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/19">A very ambitious housing expansion target has been imposed on the county of Northamptonshire, but the road network in the county is not good enough to cope with it. At Government level, the Highways Agency is dragging its feet on proposals to improve the A14, and the Department for Communities and Local Government needs to have a serious discussion with the agency about that. I must tell the Minister that his housing expansion plan in Kettering and north Northamptonshire will simply not be achievable unless there is a sensible solution to sorting out that road, and sorting it out fast.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/20">Kettering also needs an eastern bypass before housing expansion goes ahead. There are proposals for up to 5,500 extra houses to be built to the east of Kettering. At the moment, traffic travelling there goes through the villages of Weekley and Warkton. Warkton is a very small village, almost a hamlet, and the road that goes through it is a C-class road&mdash;the busiest in the county. If proposals to build up to 5,500 houses to the east of Kettering are adopted, that road will become an absolute nightmare, not just because of the volume of traffic but because of construction traffic. There is an urgent need for an eastern bypass to relieve Weekley and Warkton of that traffic.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">I have been listening intently to what the hon. Gentleman has said about Kettering and the surrounding area, with which I am not familiar. As a fellow member of the Select Committee on Transport, does he agree that what is important is improving not just the road network, but public transport in the surrounding area? That is a far more vital component of a sustainable community, because if we just build more roads, we will just create more cars.</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.194.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18b.194.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.194.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="194"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0001.htm#07121856000458">
	<p pid="a.194.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman. In the plans for Northamptonshire, there is a clear commitment to what is called multi-modal shift, which apparently means getting people out of cars and on to public transport. In the proposals for new housing expansion in the county, the county council has an ambitious target of 20 per cent. multi-modal shift. The problem is that, although the Government say they are encouraging such a shift to public transport, they are not funding it. In counties such as Northamptonshire, where infrastructure is cheaper than in some other development areas such as the Thames Gateway, the Government are not rewarding value-for-money schemes. Every pound of extra investment in Northamptonshire would go further in encouraging multi-modal shift than a pound spent in other expansion areas. The penny does not seem to have dropped with the Government that they could achieve a lot more if they looked to areas such as Northamptonshire to deliver the housing expansion that they require.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/2">People in the county have picked up on that point. A local developer contacted me ahead of today's debate, stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The main point is Government should be investing where it achieves best value for money. I would seek to make it clear to the Minister that North Northamptonshire is pre-eminent in the delivery of housing for the Sustainable Communities plan. Building more houses per annum than Milton Keynes which in turn as the MKSM growth area is a substantially greater housing area than Thames Gateway which receives far more Government interest and funding.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/4">The local councils in north Northamptonshire are doing their best to ensure that the Government's housing expansion programme works sensibly. They could have taken an alternative view and said, &quot;We are not going to co-operate at all. This is a Government plan, local people don't want it.&quot; Local people do not want housing expansion on such a scale, but Her Majesty's Government have placed a statutory duty on Kettering borough council and the other local authorities to make provision for the extra housing, and the local authorities have taken the pragmatic view that they will co-operate with the Government to deliver the plan as best they can and to maximise the involvement of local people in its preparation. That is a pragmatic and sensible way forward, and they are doing their best.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/5">Local councils are at the forefront of trying to persuade local people that the plans can work, but they are having their feet pulled from under them by the fact that, time and again, the Government's infrastructure commitments have not been delivered. Another example of that is Kettering's rail service. One might think that if the Government were going to increase the population of the borough by a third by 2021, they would want to improve the rail service to Kettering; in fact, with the franchise changing last month, the new operator, East Midlands Trains&mdash;part of the Stagecoach Group&mdash;has proposed dramatic cuts to the train service to Kettering from next December. The reason for that, to quote a Government official in the Department for Transport, is that the reduction in Kettering services is a direct result of the introduction of a new service to Corby,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/6" class="indent">&quot;due to limited capacity on the mainline&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/7">Weekday peak evening services from London to Kettering will be cut by a third; Saturday day-tripper services will be cut by 40 per cent., and the number of trains north from Kettering to Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham will be halved. In effect, Stagecoach is saying that it wants to take away Kettering's inter-city status and make the service just outer-suburban. That does not fit with the Minister's plan to build a sustainable community in Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/8">Given the 52,100 extra houses that are to be built in north Northamptonshire by 2021 and the need to create an extra 47,000 jobs to go with those houses, what sort of message do such extensive cuts to the local rail service send to the local business community? It now appears that the Government, through the Department for Transport, have been involved in encouraging the new operator to make cuts, to speed up train services to more distant destinations such as Sheffield, Derby and Nottingham. That is a perfect example of the Government not fulfilling their commitment to local people to provide infrastructure first&mdash;before jobs and houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/9">We cannot have local councils busting a gut to introduce plans to accommodate all the extra housing on one hand, while on the other a major transport provider for the area is seeking to scale back its services to that extent. I strongly encourage the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for Transport to get involved and to ensure that Stagecoach does not proceed with those proposals. Last night, I presented to the House a petition objecting to the proposed cuts in the rail services, which has been signed by 2,485 local Kettering residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/10">Local roads in the county also need urgent attention, but are not getting the funds they need. Kettering has always been the capital of north Northamptonshire, and the county town is Northampton. One would think that the road between the county town and the county's second town would be one of the major road arteries in the county, but not a bit of it. Instead, the A43 between Kettering and Northampton is the most dangerous and congested road in Northamptonshire. The county council has recently reprioritised that road in its local transport plan, but the regional funding allocations, which are determined by the east midlands region, mean that the pot simply is not big enough for money to be directed to that urgent scheme. The population in the county is set to increase by at least a third, but the main road between the two largest towns in the county cannot attract the funds needed for improvements. It simply is not good enough for the Government to say that such work must be funded by developers. They have to understand that the infrastructure deficit in the county is so big that if the developers have to pay for it all, they will not come to build houses there.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/11">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">the Member for Castle Point and the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> have commented, roads are not the only issue. We require more than one-off infrastructure investments. There must be a recognition that the populations of counties such as Northamptonshire are increasing anyway, not only as a result of the sustainable communities plan. I refer hon. Members to evidence from Bob Lane, chief executive of the North Northants Development Company, who rightly said:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/12" class="indent">&quot;There is no doubt that official statistics are underestimating the population and this is exacerbating the problem created by the lag that always occurs in growth areas between people arriving and demanding services and the government formula recognising the existence of people in that particular area. This is proving a particular burden obviously to health, education, policing and other revenue based services and from NNDC's point of view could affect housing completions because people may choose not to move to an area where these services are clearly under pressure.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/13">That message from the highly respected chief executive, Bob Lane, in whom the Government have a lot of confidence, should send alarm bells ringing in the Minister's head. Mr. Lane is absolutely right: the quality of life of people coming to new housing areas in north Northamptonshire, and of the people who live there now, will be adversely affected if the Government do not appreciate the scale of the ongoing revenue commitment required to fund local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/14">Kettering general hospital is working at breakneck speed to treat an ever-growing local population. It is not only people from Kettering, Corby and Wellingborough who use those services; people from Market Harborough, Leicester and further afield also use them. It is a well respected and hard-working local hospital, but there is only so much that it can do without Government recognition of the pressures that it is under.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/15">Local schools are full, and it is difficult to get one's child into the school of one's choice. All the good schools are full, and some of the not-so-good schools will also be full. There seems to be a lag in the provision of new school facilities whenever a new housing proposal comes forward. I know that the local county council has a role to play, but the Government need to recognise that when they allocate funding to local authorities such as Northamptonshire county council.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/16">There are not enough police in Northamptonshire, partly because the Government funding formula for local policing is skewing money into the police community support officer programme and taking it out of the programme for fully powered police officers. I know that is not the intention behind the formula, but the effect in Northamptonshire is that although there are more PCSOs, there will be fewer police officers on the streets. I suggest that if the population is to increase by one third, we need one third more police officers, but little assurance is being given to the chief constable and the Northamptonshire police authority that that is the Government's intention.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.3/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Martlew. I am sure that we agree on many matters, and we fight with a common spirit as we represent one third of the constituencies in the county of Cumbria. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>, who raised important issues about the infrastructure that is necessary for new housing developments in his constituency and many others.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/2">I would like in a brief time to turn the matter on its head. The hon. Gentleman pointed out that the Government's plans for housing development in his part of the world are over-ambitious, or at least the infrastructure that is being provided is insufficiently ambitious to match the plans. I represent Westmorland and Lonsdale, which contains a large chunk of the Lake district and also a significant part of the Yorkshire dales and much other attractive countryside in the southern part of Cumbria. What we have there is, perhaps, a lack of ambition when it comes to the provision of new housing, specifically affordable housing. In the next few minutes, I shall encourage the Minister to consider making provision to allow building where infrastructure already exists, in a way that underpins and safeguards that infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/3">In a nutshell, the problem in south Cumbria is that average house prices are around &pound;250,000 and average incomes are some &pound;17,000 per year. One does not need to be a mathematician to work out that that means that the average person is stuffed when it comes to getting a mortgage for a home.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/4">We also have a problem in that three quarters of our social rented homes&mdash;council houses&mdash;have been sold off in the past 25 years. The local authority in my area, South Lakeland, is working hard to increase the number of social rented properties, but it is starting from a poor and low position. Some 28 per cent. of our young people leave the area and never return, and the principal reason for that is expensive houses without the commensurate work to enable people to afford them.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/5">I and other people have been seeking solutions to the problem. There will not be a one-size-fits-all solution. We have been looking for innovative ways of tackling the problem. One potential scheme that I have come up with and have worked with others on is something that we dub &quot;home on the farm&quot;. I am pleased to say that it has received formal backing from the president of the National Farmers Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/6">I estimate that in my constituency several hundred affordable, social rented properties could be created in buildings that already exist; that is, underused or disused farm buildings. The buildings already exist, as does the infrastructure to underpin them. Typically, on many farm sites there may be a disused or underused farm building in which one could create two or three affordable, social rented cottages. Two of them might be put into the general social housing pot for the district, and the third would be an agricultural tied cottage. In my constituency and many others, a principal problem with the sustainability of farming, particularly in the uplands, is anybody being in a position to take on the tenancy or ownership of a farm once the farming couple reach retirement age. It would be wonderful if one could provide a social rented agricultural tied cottage on site. Typically, it would be a place for the daughter and son-in-law, or son and daughter-in-law, of the farmer to live in, and then the couples would swap when the older couple reached retirement age. As I said, the other two houses would be put in the social rented pot to try to alleviate the pressure on the local housing market.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/7">Such a scheme would help to underpin and make use of the existing infrastructure of local farming, help to ensure sustainability in a vital industry in our area, and maintain the countryside that other Members' constituents love to visit. It would also be important in trying to keep young people, families and people of all ages in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/8">In relation to underpinning infrastructure, I think of a village that I represent. The school in Satterthwaite, which is near Hawkshead, closed last year. Ironically, it is about to be converted into affordable housing. If there had been affordable housing in the village five years ago, the school would not have shut. If we can create living, vibrant communities in places such as those that I represent, we will be able to safeguard our schools, post offices, public transport routes and so on, prevent young people from leaving and create balanced communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.3/9">I simply ask for a reclassification of existing buildings to brownfield sites to allow development for the exclusive, narrow purpose of providing affordable rented accommodation. Guidance should be given not just to local authorities and district councils but to national parks, which also hold the reins on planning in areas such as those that I represent. One of our great problems, understandably, is dealing with people who say, &quot;Not in my backyard.&quot; The wonderful thing about this scheme is that it calls for development in the backyards of people who desperately want it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.199.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="199"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0002.htm#07121856000464">
	<p pid="a.199.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on the way in which he introduced this important debate, and on the passionate plea that he made for his constituents. Similarly, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> made a passionate plea for his constituents and helpfully demonstrated how different the questions of house building and infrastructure are in different parts of the country. In the time remaining to me, I would like to make a similar plea on behalf of my constituents in Worcestershire, which I believe also has broader national policy implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/2">I was interested particularly in my hon. Friend's final remarks about the broader quality of life issues that are at stake. When people hear the word &quot;infrastructure&quot;, they often think just about roads and possibly railways, but infrastructure is actually so much more than that, as he rightly said in the concluding part of his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/3">Three aspects of infrastructure most worry me when considering the prospects that face my constituents as a result of significant increases in housing. Rail networks are the element of public transport that can play a real part in relieving some of the pressures in my county. If we had decent co-ordination between cars and rail, decent car parks at railway stations and, by the way, a decent rail line to London&mdash;that is another matter&mdash;we could see a big shift to public transport. The problem too often is that one cannot leave one's car at a railway station.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/4">The hospital service in my constituency is at breaking point. I now fully admit that I was wrong to support the construction of the Worcester Royal infirmary at its current size&mdash;it is too small to serve the existing population of the county. An additional significant population coming from whatever process&mdash;I shall come to one specific issue later&mdash;will stretch that hospital beyond its capacity to serve my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/5">Another issue that is crucial but does not get much attention is how we deal with refuse and waste. That system, too, is under huge pressure and strain in my constituency, and additional house building will put it in a serious situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/6">Of course, roads, public transport and bus services are important. Schools are also important, but as there is some decline in Worcestershire school populations at present, schools may be able to cope with the increased development. Getting energy to the new houses is important, as are water and sewerage, and, as my hon. Friend rightly said, the emergency services. Leisure services and open spaces are part of a community's infrastructure, too. We must not lose our open spaces by cramming houses into existing urban areas. I particularly draw attention to flood defences and flood protection work, which is part of the infrastructure in my constituency, and which new house building in the wrong location threatens.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/7">The problem is that we are trying to work out what we need to do while steering a course between the Scylla and Charybdis of two different and conflicting parts of Government planning policy. Perhaps I should call them, in the spirit of the season&mdash;a happy Christmas to you, Mr. Martlew&mdash;the ugly sisters of planning policy: the regional spatial strategy revision and the joint core strategy. I congratulate the <i>Worcester News</i>, my local paper, on its attempt to make those two arcane subjects comprehensible to the people who live in south Worcestershire. They are difficult subjects, and people find it difficult to wrestle with them, but they have huge implications for house building and infrastructure in my constituency and also in Worcester city and Malvern Hills.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/8">The problem is that the timetable for the joint core strategy, which is how the local districts decide how they will provide housing and the infrastructure to support it, is out of sync with that of the regional spatial strategy revision. The RSSR second-phase numbers have been agreed. They are high&mdash;higher than I would like&mdash;but we can probably just about cope with them. The problem is that Worcester city is full and my constituents have to take a large proportion of the houses that are actually Worcester city houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/9">My concern is that the Government, when it comes to the examination in public, will actually increase the numbers. At present, the joint core strategy is being consulted on locally and effectively by the three district councils. They have come together in a joint strategy, which is really good and helps to get a picture across south Worcestershire, but they do not know the final housing numbers for which they will actually have to cater. The questions are being asked the wrong way around. The joint core strategy should be decided a year later when we know what the housing situation is.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/10">However, it is even worse than that. Phase 3 of the regional spatial strategy has only just begun. It looks at some important issues for my constituents: rural services; Gypsy and Traveller sites; culture; environment, including flood risk, air quality, renewable energy and green belt; and minerals. We are conducting our joint core strategy before we even know what the regional assembly will say about those things, never mind what the Government will agree to. It seems a bizarre way in which to run something.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/11">I entirely agree that we need more houses in south Worcestershire. I am not someone who says that we cannot build them. Clearly, the existing population is ageing, household formation rates are increasing and we need some more new houses. However, I have doubts about the levels. I think that the Government have over-predicted on immigration. They have taken three years of very high immigration levels and projected them into the future. They should have projected the last 20 years, and then we would have seen a lower demand for new house building, but that is a separate debate. I agree, though, that we need more houses and more affordable houses, which my hon. Friend mentioned in his speech. There is a serious problem with affordable housing in my constituency. I am not one who says that we should not have houses, but I think that we are probably being asked to provide too many at present, and the Government risk asking us to provide many more. We must ensure that a good number of those houses are genuinely affordable and not built by developers to meet a market need that they perceive for themselves, rather than the market failure that affordable housing should address.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/12">If we do not know how many houses the Government are going to ask us to build in Worcestershire, I do not see how can we plan or fund the infrastructure in an intelligent way. Here, I bring in the pantomime villain of the piece to go with my earlier metaphor of the ugly sisters. On top of the regional spatial strategy plan numbers and the uncertainty of the south Worcestershire joint core strategy, the Government are considering plans to build two eco-towns in my constituency. One is entirely in my constituency, on the old RAF airfield at Throckmorton, and the other is two thirds in Warwickshire, in the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1847" name="John Maples">the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Mr. Maples)</phrase>, and one third in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/13">The trouble is that we know nothing about what those plans involve. We can only guess how many houses are being proposed by the developers. We do not know the criteria that the Government will use to assess whether those towns should go ahead. We know and understand that they will have their own local infrastructure, but they will also put huge demands on the wider infrastructure of south Worcestershire, particularly on the things that worry me&mdash;the railways, the hospitals, the waste disposal systems and the rest. I am worried that the Government are saying that those eco-towns will be in addition to regional spatial strategy plan numbers. They may be playing a very clever game. Although we have the West Midlands regional assembly's preferred numbers, I bet that the Government will up those numbers miraculously next year to meet whatever number of eco-town houses they are trying to impose on my constituency. Technically, the numbers will be within the regional spatial strategy plan, but the Government will have been shuttling around and doing some very clever arithmetic to justify their numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/14">Initially, when the eco-towns were proposed, my constituents did not seem too concerned&mdash;after all, everything that is eco is good. If the word &quot;eco&quot; is put in front of anything, it makes it acceptable. One councillor spoke to me about the Government's proposal for the eco-town at Throckmorton, where the Government have previously tried to build an asylum seekers centre, which was rejected, and where they have dumped large numbers of diseased cattle&mdash;they probably were not diseased&mdash;from the foot and mouth disease epidemic. I do not know what the Government have got in for Throckmorton, but there we are; never mind. The ambition was to ensure that half of the houses were affordable, which sounds great. We would have an eco-town with affordable houses. One could not possibly oppose such a magnificent combination. It would be like being against apple pie or against Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/15">However, if that town is to be a genuine eco-town, to be sustainable, and not to put a burden on the wider infrastructure of south Worcestershire, and if half the houses are to be affordable, then half the jobs provided locally must be affordable, too. I do not think that planners can get right that magic equation in which all the people who live in the new Throckmorton super eco-town will also work in the same town. No, they will get in their cars and drive, putting a huge strain on the infrastructure and damaging the environment. We do not know what criteria the Government are using to assess the eco-towns. We do not know how big they are going to be. We know nothing about them. Freedom of information requests have failed and parliamentary questions have produced very little. We have three district councils that are trying to plan their joint core strategy and their infrastructure, without knowing what the regional spatial strategy numbers will be or how many eco-towns they will have imposed on them. It is absolutely ludicrous.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/16">The district councils should not commit to the location of any of the housing that they need to find under the regional spatial strategy plan until they know what those eco-towns are and how the infrastructure is going to be funded and planned. I am not saying that the Government necessarily have to find all the money for the infrastructure. The Milton Keynes model&mdash;the roof tax for providing private sector developer money for infrastructure&mdash;is a good one. I am not saying that we necessarily need to use public money. But we must know the precise mechanisms that will be in place to deliver the money that we need to fund the infrastructure for these new houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/17">If we get that wrong, it is not just the people in the new houses who will suffer, it is the people in the houses that are already there who will suffer. It is their quality of life that is at stake, too. Getting to London from my constituency is already a nightmare. The roads are at breaking point and the railway cannot cope. Fifteen years ago, that journey was an acceptable part of my life, and now it is one of the most unpleasant features of my existence. Putting in massive new numbers of houses on that infrastructure will compound the problem and make existing residents' lives miserable, as well as failing to provide a proper quality of life for the people who will live in those new houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/18">It is this failure to understand the impact on current residents that I want to drive home. I say to the Government, please be more open with us now about the eco-towns and tell us how big they will be. Will they have 5,000 houses or 20,000? That is the range of possible numbers. Please tell us what assessment will be made of the impact of the infrastructure on the area and on other towns around it. If a new eco-town is built at Throckmorton, what impact will it have on the very attractive Georgian market town of Pershore, which is only a couple of miles away? How can the Government decide that it is right to go ahead with that eco-town when they do not understand the dynamic of south Worcestershire and the possible impact on the town of Pershore, which lies outside my constituency in that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1941" name="Michael Spicer">the Member for West Worcestershire (Sir Michael Spicer)</phrase>? Therefore, big questions about those eco-towns must be resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/19">I also ask the Government to tell us in precise detail how the infrastructure that we need is going to be funded. If we have not got that detail, we cannot plan with any confidence. One of our key jobs as constituency MPs&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering and the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale did this very well in their opening remarks&mdash;is to defend the interests of our constituents. The Government are tying our hands behind our backs as we seek to do that. I hope that the Minister will shed some light on the issue when he comes to wind up this debate a little later.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.203.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="203"  time="010:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0003.htm#07121856000465">
	<p pid="a.203.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing this debate. He has given us a very detailed exposition and analysis of the problems facing a growth area such as Kettering. It is an area that he knows far better than I do, so I will not try to go back over the detail of that local case, which has been more than eloquently laid before us.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> had different examples, but all made the same point. Many of the problems outlined in the opening speech are common across huge parts of the country and are seen not only in the specific high growth areas designated by the Government. A number of common themes have emerged from the speeches of the hon. Members who have contributed so far. One such theme centres around the question of housing growth. From the Government's point of view, that growth is concentrated in a number of handpicked high-growth areas in which the sheer volume of housing that is to be provided will cause enormous problems and strains on the surrounding infrastructure. The issue of jobs was also raised. If sustainable communities are to be created, jobs need to be created in the locality of the housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/3">This country has a generally inadequate road system, and public transport is very inadequate compared with that in most of our continental counterparts. In some growth areas, there will be tens of thousands of new houses&mdash;for example, 160,000 in the Thames Gateway&mdash;and we cannot have such large conglomerations without public transport and road transport infrastructure, particularly if people must commute long distances to find work elsewhere. If growth areas are in the London satellite areas, it will be impossible with the state of the present infrastructure for residents to commute to London. Even if the infrastructure could be improved to cope with that amount of commuting, would one want that? How would that fit with our commitments on tackling climate change, for example? If we are to have truly sustainable communities, we must look not just at an area's transport infrastructure&mdash;roads and public transport&mdash;but at the development of local employment in tandem with growth areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/4">Hon. Members have touched on other areas of infrastructure and given local examples, such as the provision of schools, hospitals, shops, community facilities, water, sewerage and so on. The hon. Member for Castle Point spoke about schools and asked what would happen in areas where schools had been closed, or were bursting at the seams&mdash;one example was in Kettering&mdash;because tens of thousands of new houses had been built. Does one wait until the problem has developed and then provide the schools, or does one plan ahead, which creates funding issues?</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/5">Only two weeks ago, some of us were debating a similar issue concerning Aylesbury Vale, another housing growth area, which is south of Milton Keynes, and the same issues arose. A specific issue in Aylesbury Vale is pertinent to some of the points that hon. Members have made about water, sewerage and power supplies. In one area the proposal was for 4,000 to 6,000 new houses, but the electricity company said that there was no capacity for delivering electricity to the area without building a new sub-station, which would cost &pound;6 million up front. The electricity company could not provide that money up front and said that someone else would have to raise it. Who will provide &pound;6 million up front to supply the electricity infrastructure to allow those 4,000 to 6,000 houses to be built? One cannot have one without the other, but where will the up-front money come from? There are other examples, and I shall return to one when I look at possible solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/6">North of Chesterfield, the Brimington and Staveley area runs up to the M1, where a large development is under way to create a new motorway junction&mdash;29A&mdash;and a large industrial park on an old colliery site. Over the next five, 10 or 15 years, it will become a major employment area for a deprived coalfield community stretching from Chesterfield to Bolsover. The Government may create a motorway junction and the huge industrial park on the reclaimed colliery site will create jobs. However, it will also generate a huge amount of traffic&mdash;and not just extra traffic on the M1, for which lane-widening is already being considered because it is so congested, but extra transport on the existing road infrastructure through Staveley and Brimington to Chesterfield, and the other way from Chesterfield through Brimington and Staveley up to the huge new industrial park that will be created.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/7">The Brimington and Staveley area has been promised a bypass since 1936, but the money has never been available, although it was promised repeatedly, usually around the time of county council elections. The bypass never happened, because the money was not available. The county council and the Government say that even to think about the bypass is not on the books, but when the industrial park near junction 29A is up and running in five, 10 or 15 years with the additional employment and the additional transport problems on the road through Brimington and Staveley, which is already too congested, they will think again about a bypass. We shall create the problem and then think about a solution. That is the wrong way round, as we have heard with the other examples of schools, sewerage, electricity supply and so on. Those are common problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/8">The hon. Member for Kettering said that the East Midlands Development Agency should put more money into major road infrastructure in the Kettering and Northampton area, but Chesterfield is in the far north of the east midlands region and we want some of that money for road infrastructure in our area&mdash;for example, for the Brimington and Staveley bypass. The danger is that we will rob Peter to pay Paul, unless infrastructure is planned systematically. Those problems are common throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/9">What are the solutions? Hon. Members have suggested that some of the major growth areas, which the Government have handpicked in willing partnership with local councils, are too large. Should we be looking at spreading them out? In my area, Derby is a growth area. It is a small city and has been selected by the Government for considerable growth, but some people in Derby are asking whether they want that with the accompanying infrastructure problems and huge population growth. On the other hand, Chesterfield, which is not far from Derby&mdash;about 20 miles further north&mdash;has been restricted to 280 new houses a year, but we want further expansion. We are recovering from the massive unemployment that followed pit closures and then the loss of engineering works, and we need more housing than we have been allowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale spoke about homes on farms for people in lower income brackets who cannot afford to buy in the normal way in a popular tourist area such as the Lake district. The problem is the same in Cornwall, and similar in Derbyshire. Some of the new homes in growth areas such as Derby are for people who will commute from the suburbs to low-paid jobs in the Derbyshire Peak district. They cannot afford to live in the Peak district because the houses are either in the upmarket commuter belt or are second homes. It would be more sensible to look at planning issues throughout the country rather than focusing on huge growth areas because we would minimise some of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/11">Another issue concerning solutions is infrastructure funding. The pre-Budget report referred to &pound;1.7 billion of targeted funding, which is a step in the right direction, but only for growth areas. The Milton Keynes levy from 2005 has been held up as a great example throughout the country of how to raise money for infrastructure. The community infrastructure levy in the Planning Bill, which has just started its progress through Parliament, is another step in that direction. Many people would say that it is based on the Milton Keynes roof tax idea. The Bill, which has only just been presented to Parliament, contains 10 sketchy clauses with almost no detail of how it will work, but it will be some time before it is implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/12">The community infrastructure levy will not completely solve the funding gap. In Aylesbury, &pound;6 million was required up front to provide the electricity capacity for new homes. In Ashford, the Highways Agency vetoed the building of new houses because of the pressure that they would cause on the M20. Taylor Woodrow said that it would put up &pound;7 million to improve capacity on the motorway and that Ashford council could repay it over a number of years as it received levies from developers. We need more up-front funding, and cannot rely totally on piecemeal funding from this company or that company. Otherwise, many such developments will be stymied. The Government and regional agencies must consider providing up-front funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.0/13">We need less Government diktat, particularly in large growth areas, and more joined-up planning and more thought about up-front funding for infrastructure before houses are built, not after problems have been created.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">It is a pleasure, Mr. Martlew, to see you in the Chair. I join other hon. Members in wishing you and everyone else the compliments of the season on our last sitting day.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing this debate on an important issue. He has been assiduous in raising his constituents' concerns about this and related topics throughout his time in the House. I pay tribute to his work in that regard, and I am delighted that he has given us the opportunity to debate the matter today.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">The debate has been worth while and constructive, and I am grateful for the contributions from other hon. Members. It is interesting that the common thread running through the observations is the need to provide infrastructure if there is to be a sustainable supply of good quality housing. Those elements must all be equally stressed, which is why the sequential approach taken by the borough council leader in my hon. Friend's area is so important. A real concern for many of us, however, is that that approach does not appear to have been taken in practice, and we look to the Minister today to deal with that. If we do not provide transport infrastructure or, as other hon. Members have said, the social, education and health infrastructure to go with it, existing communities will inevitably resist new development and we will be in danger, as many professionals have observed, of creating the sink estates of the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">Such problems are apparent to me as a London Member of Parliament, although London has not yet been mentioned. My constituency borders the Thames Gateway, and I know that the Minister takes an interest in the project, but I am sorry to say that, so many years on, the Government's handling of it remains disjointed. Such condemnation is all too typical of much regeneration and growth policy, and the Thames Gateway project has been described&mdash;rightly, I fear&mdash;as an alphabet soup of disparate agencies, none of which are pulling together. In that respect, it was useful to hear the observations of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, who represents part of the gateway.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1923" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase>, who made a number of important points. Among other things, he stressed, as Conservative Members always have, that there cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution&mdash;there needs to be much more flexibility. If there is a criticism to be made of the Government, it is that their top-down, centralised, target-driven approach is too one size fits all to meet current needs, and I hope that the Minister will address that.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> dealt with the important impact of development on the quality of life of current residents. As I hope that I have suggested, it is important that we deal with that if we are to get existing communities to buy in to development. That links to the need for openness&mdash;not only in terms of eco-towns, but generally&mdash;and for precision about funding, which is a key point.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/7">In London, that has been an issue in relation to the long-running Crossrail saga. In my constituency, people are still waiting for the delivery of the Thameslink rail link, which is a key piece of infrastructure. Thameslink 2000 is now likely to arrive in about 2016, which is a pretty significant delay, even by the standards of South Eastern Trains. That lack of precision and clarity causes many people to believe that the projects will not be delivered and that we will create rather soulless dormitories with inadequate links. In that context, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" name="Paul Holmes">the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Paul Holmes)</phrase> made a hugely important point about the need for local employment, but the issue has perhaps not been sufficiently addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/8">I have great regard for the Minister on a personal level, but the Government have so far failed to tackle the issues before us. The Housing and Regeneration Bill gives us no confidence that Ministers have learned the necessary lessons, because it, too, is predicated on a centralised, target-driven strategy. It simply is not adequate to pile target upon target or, as the Bill does, quango upon quango; that is not the way to get communities to buy into the projects that we need. I do not doubt the Government's good intentions, but Ministers must unfortunately face the fact that their performance does not match their good intentions. They are building fewer homes, including social homes, than the previous Conservative Administration; their targets are not delivering on the ground, and that is the key issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/9">The Planning Bill, which proposes a community infrastructure levy, falls into the same trap. As the hon. Member for Chesterfield said, it is sensible to look at the means by which local communities can harness the added value of development, but the CIL, as currently proposed, seems extremely remote and potentially bureaucratic. It is administered at a rather distant, regional level and breaks the key link between the local community, where the development takes place, and that community's ability to have a say over where funds will go and what projects it will finance and support locally. If local people are to buy into development, such decisions must be taken much closer to them, rather than at regional level.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/10">In the spirit of Christmas, I am prepared to offer the Minister one or two potential goodies, and perhaps he will want to steal them from our bag. I hope that the Government will look more favourably at giving communities incentives to recognise that it is in their enlightened self-interest to welcome development. That requires them to be certain, as my hon. Friends said, that infrastructure will be properly funded and delivered. That requires the Government to be open about the fact that confidence in their official population statistics has collapsed in many parts of the country. In growth areas in much of the south-east, local authorities of all parties have raised concerns about the fact that current statistics do not adequately reflect population growth and, therefore, that funding formulae do not adequately reflect the real population on the ground. That creates pressure on existing populations and makes them even more resistant to new development, which could, if properly funded, be of great benefit. The Treasury's unwillingness to move away from Office for National Statistics formulae, which are now largely discredited at all levels, is, with respect, a serious mistake, and I hope that the Minister will look at the issue again.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/11">I also hope that the Minister will look at some of the proposals that we have had from others with experience in this field, including Lord Heseltine, who had a pretty good track record on regeneration, if I may say so. He has suggested that we look at the possibility of councils keeping the additional revenue from council tax and business rate growth, perhaps for five years or so, to give them an incentive to welcome growth. When I was a local councillor in the 1970s, it was useful for us to encourage commercial development in our area because we kept the additional revenues from business rate growth. I hope that the Government will seriously consider moving back in that direction.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.1/1">Unfortunately, there was a time when some local authorities&mdash;not those controlled by the Liberal Democrat party or the Conservative party&mdash;stretched the limits of what local businesses could afford, and that damaged local authorities' credibility, although we are now moving towards a better situation. We must start from a position that commands the confidence of the business community and see how things develop. That is why it is worth the Government examining the details of the formulation that I suggested, and I hope that the Opposition, too, would look at the issue constructively.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">On an issue that concerns rural and other areas, we should consider the greater use of community land trusts. That would allow us to build local homes and ensure that homes remain available to local people. That important need must be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/3">I also hope that the Government will look more constructively at allowing local communities to introduce new social enterprise zones to promote social enterprise, particularly in disadvantaged communities. That is not the whole answer to the question of how to encourage local employment, but it is an important part.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/4">There are therefore many positive things that could be done locally, but I regret to say that the current top-down, target-driven approach does not address them. I hope, however, that the Minister will give us some Christmas cheer by saying that he will look at the issues that we have raised and move away from the Government's needlessly rigid approach, which his heart is perhaps not really in.</p>

	<p pid="a.208.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Martlew. I wish all hon. Gentlemen who have participated in the debate a merry Christmas and a peaceful and prosperous new year. I hope that you do not have a good start to the new year, though, Mr. Martlew, because Carlisle United are playing Hartlepool United on new year's day, and I do not want you to see too much good cheer in that respect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing this important debate, which has been conducted in a well mannered and well intentioned way. It has been incredibly useful, certainly for me, to tease out some of the arguments about housing and the necessary links with infrastructure. I shall several times stress in my speech that it is very important that housing and infrastructure should be integral; they need to be together, in parallel, to unlock the growth that is needed and to provide the sustainable communities that we require.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/3">To return to first principles, we need more homes. That is becoming a political consensus now, across the spectrum. We have not been building enough homes since about the 1970s. The level of housing supply has not kept pace with demand. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> mentioned that most articulately in his speech. Society is changing. We are living longer and in different ways, including on our own. That needs to be addressed through the housing stock in a way that perhaps was not recognised 30 or 40 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.2/4">We are not coming from a complete standing start. Housing growth numbers have increased, for new build, by about 40 per cent. since 2001, to about 185,000 new builds a year, but we need to go further. The projections are that 223,000 households are forming every year, so that we need to build more to accommodate them. The Government have set a target of 240,000 homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">I would go further and take a longer-term perspective. As I said earlier, I think that we have not been building enough houses for the country's needs since the 1970s. That is what we need to address, and I think that the Government have been quite ambitious in pushing forward with it. The hon. Member for Chesterfield and I are both on the Committee considering the Housing and Regeneration Bill, and are looking at the issue to ensure that we are addressing the needs in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">I am very fortunate, as I expect are other hon. Members, in that I am a home owner. I was brought up to think that it was possible for me to own my home. I should hate it if in the next 10 to 15 years pressures on affordability were to lead to a situation in which housing was a source of inequality, home ownership was not the preserve of everyone, and good quality housing was for an elite. We need to deal with that now, which is why the Government have put processes in place to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.2/1">The Minister made a point about making good quality home ownership available for all, and referred earlier to our not having built enough since the 1970s. How does he square that with the fact that, in 1979, about 107,000 homes were built by various social agencies&mdash;local authorities and social landlords&mdash;but that that figure fell to about 18,000 in 2003, and we have not got above about 24,000 since?</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.209.3" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18b.209.3" matchtype="changes"/>

	<p pid="a.209.3/1">Hon. Gentlemen are making my points for me. We have not consistently been building enough houses for a generation. We need to deal with that, and the Government are putting in place the building blocks&mdash;literally&mdash;to do so to meet the housing needs of all society, rather than just a narrow elite, now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/2">It is not, however, only a matter of bricks and mortar. We took evidence in Housing and Regeneration Bill sittings last week, and I made the point, when I gave evidence, that although there is a target for 3 million homes to be built by 2020, it will not work if we simply plonk them in a field. We need the infrastructure to be in place. Modern development should consist of well designed homes in attractive environments, made sustainable by the right infrastructure, which, as hon. Members have mentioned, encompasses transport, utilities, green space, policing and flood defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/3">Good design is also very relevant. I do not want quality to be compromised in any way because of the expansion of house-building targets. We need good quality, well planned homes that meet the needs of the population and are in well designed areas where people want to live. My big fear is that in 20 years we shall have built homes that people do not want to live in, and will be putting more public money into them. They will not be sustainable and we shall have to think of regeneration areas for homes built between 2010 to 2015. That will not be good enough. The people of this country deserve better, and we have a lot to do. I want to stress in the strongest terms that the Government are committed to ensuring that housing growth is closely accompanied by the infrastructure necessary to provide sustainable development at local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/4">Perhaps I may quote a passage from the 2007 pre-Budget report about increased spending on infrastructure:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/5" class="indent">&quot;It is essential that new housing developments are accompanied by the investment in schools, transport and other infrastructure needed to support flourishing and prosperous communities. The 2007 CSR has therefore been informed by a review into the investment needed to support the Government's housing ambitions...To support this strategy over the next three years the Government is providing &pound;1.7 billion of targeted funding for infrastructure in Growth Areas, the Thames Gateway, New Growth Points and eco-towns, including &pound;300 million to continue the Community Infrastructure Fund over the CSR.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/6">It is essential that we should continue to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/7">I am getting to know the Milton Keynes and south midlands area very well, because I chair the MKSM inter-regional board. I am starting to love the area, and I am very impressed by the people. The inter-regional board is considering many issues associated with prioritising and co-ordinating the investment necessary to support housing growth in the sub-region. I was pleased to attend my first board meeting in Bedford earlier in the year, and I spoke at the second annual conference in Kettering, and greatly enjoyed it. However, I did not experience, on the ground in Kettering and elsewhere, the somewhat pessimistic tone adopted by the hon. Member for Kettering. I recently received a letter from Michael Hayes, the chief executive of the West Northamptonshire development corporation; I hope that he will not mind my quoting the letter, in which he says:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/8" class="indent">&quot;Your vision of an enterprising sub-region at the heart of the UK particularly echoed our thoughts. We agree that with our location, connectivity and potential skills base, our area can not only provide sustainable communities of the future, but be a principle economic driver for the wider nation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/9">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/10" class="indent">&quot;The conference was also a valuable opportunity to recognise the progress that has already been made. Since 2005, WNDC has been setting the foundations for an unprecedented period of growth and regeneration, helping to invest almost &pound;30 m in local infrastructure projects, assuming planning control powers for strategic developments and subsequently attracting considerable amounts of private sector investment into the area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/11">I see the area as a real can-do area, full of positivity and ambition. There are challenges, but a real opportunity for growth and opportunity has been seen, which can really drive the UK economy. I want to do all I can to facilitate and enable it.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/12">The hon. Member for Kettering mentioned a couple of points about transport, and perhaps I may respond to them, as I know that he has a particular interest in transport. As to what he said about the A14, I understand that the Highways Agency is looking into measures that would allow the new housing to be got under way while the current A14 could remain functional. That would include the prospect of something called ramp metering&mdash;a technique by which the amount of traffic joining the A14 would be managed by the use of signals, accompanied by sensors, to regulate the system and prevent the build-up of traffic on the adjacent local road network. I wrote to the hon. Gentleman recently in response to a parliamentary question and explained that</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/13" class="indent">&quot;North Northamptonshire Joint Planning Unit has been developing a Core Strategy which is currently at the Examination in Public stage&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/14">I added:</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/15" class="indent">&quot;The Highways Agency has presented information to the Examination in Public to show improvements that can be made to the A14 to meet the anticipated housing trajectory.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-11-29.688"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 November 2007; Vol. 468, c. 688W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/16">I understand that the Highways Agency intends to submit a report to Ministers in the spring, outlining potential interim and long-term solutions, and I await it with interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/17">There is an awful lot more that I could discuss, but time will not allow it. I shall briefly refer to East Midlands Trains. It is for the company, working with Network Rail, to determine the exact timetable. I know that local stakeholders have been putting their views on detailed timetabling issues to the train operator in recent weeks. The hon. Gentleman mentioned a petition that he presented to the House yesterday, which I imagine will be a powerful driver in pushing the issue forward. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Department for Transport visited Kettering recently and is taking a keen personal interest in transport issues, in the town and in north Northamptonshire. I want to mention that my right hon. Friend's father passed away yesterday; I know that the whole House would want to convey its sympathy to her.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.3/18">As I said, housing and infrastructure are absolutely crucial. I wish everyone a merry Christmas.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on obtaining this important debate. Is he as concerned as I am about who is responsible for paying for the police? It varies from area to area. Birmingham International airport, which is my local airport, pays for its policing, whereas smaller airports such as Coventry, which is next door, has its policing paid for out of the local precept, meaning that local people must pay for it. Does he share my concern that that is bound to lead to variation in the quality of the policing in different areas?</p>

	<p pid="a.213.1/1">I am not sure about the last part of the hon. Lady's question, but I share her concern about the way in which the police are funded from region to region and airport to airport, depending on the size of the airport. I shall address that point later in my speech. I do not believe that it would affect security, however, because I would expect that to be at the same level at smaller and larger airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/2">Throughout the UK, there are national organisations for drug enforcement, immigration, intelligence and customs. Those national organisations have a co-ordinated central structure&mdash;the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase>. It therefore seems strange that the exact cover by uniformed police is not known. I cannot obtain the actual figures from the Home Office, but it is estimated that there are 140 airfields and airports throughout the UK. I believe that about 30 are substantial passenger airports&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> mentioned one of them. There are nine designated airports: England has London Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Birmingham and Manchester airports, and Scotland has Aberdeen, Glasgow, Prestwick and Edinburgh, which is now Scotland's largest airport&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.213.3/1">Yes it is, and it continues to grow. Scotland has eight police authorities, three of which&mdash;Grampian, Stratchclyde and Lothian and Borders&mdash;cover the airports I mentioned. Judging by the written answer that I received, it seems that the Government have no idea what the police presence in each of the airports is. When the Minister responds, I hope that he will explain how the Government co-ordinate the work of airports, local police authorities and the national agencies concerned with drug enforcement, immigration, intelligence and customs to co-ordinate airport policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.3/2">That leads to the question of the structure of police forces at airports throughout the UK. Given that policing and counter-terrorism must go hand in hand, why do local authorities still provide the police presence at airports? There are two parts to the argument. First, removing airports from the responsibility of local forces would free those forces for regular community work, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> said, although I do not wish to address that aspect now. Secondly and most importantly, a national&mdash;UK-wide&mdash;police force would be the best way to ensure the safety of all our airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.3/3">The logical step would be to increase the scope of the British Transport police, which answers the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire, who anticipated the direction of my speech well. The BTP has 2,774 police officers supported by 258 special constables, 210 police community support officers and 1,204 police staff. They cover 10,000 miles of track, more than 3,000 railway stations and depots, and the larger ports, at many of which there are railway headings.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.1/1">I was unaware of that and I am glad that my hon. Friend has drawn attention to the fact that two airports have been assigned for that purpose in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/2">On &quot;The Politics Show&quot; on BBC television on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-16">Sunday 16 December</phrase>&mdash;I imagine that it was the version shown up in Scotland&mdash;Kenny MacAskill, the Cabinet Secretary for Justice in the minority Administration in Scotland, spoke. During the programme, reporters showed segments in which they highlighted the following. Under anti-terrorism legislation since July this year, British Transport police in Scotland have stopped and searched 14,620 people and vehicles. However, throughout the rest of Scotland, where there are eight police authorities, only 135 people and items were searched by the police. Therefore, each of the British Transport police officers conducted about 73 stop and searches, while on average one in 12 Scottish local authority officers would have conducted a search. I must point out that 75 million people use Scotland's railways every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/3">Mr. MacAskill, the Scottish Justice Minister, referred in an interview to the transport police allegedly harassing and interrogating the public by diktat from London&mdash;I assume that he means Westminster. He made the point about 14,620 stop and searches by the British transport police in Scotland and only 135 by local authority police, but he forgot to mention that about 20 million people go through Scotland's airports, all of whom have to go through a search system. He forgot to mention that extremely important activity in which the police are directly involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/4">I believe that the real reason for Mr. MacAskill attacking the transport police was that he believes that they should come under the Scottish Parliament. He is therefore trying to politicise the issue, which I believe is unfortunate and quite disgraceful. He even said that he would be pulling in the transport police to explain themselves to him. That is how he finished his comments on the programme: they have to come and see him to explain themselves, although he has no direct responsibility for the transport police in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/5">It is clear that specialist policing will be put on the agenda. Her Majesty's chief inspector of constabulary for Scotland said in his recent annual report that</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/6" class="indent">&quot;creating a robust national solution for the very important but relatively small volume of policing activity that could be managed above force level, is one as yet unrecognised but effective way of improving and sustaining local or community policing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/7">I suspect that that statement could be made by any chief inspector throughout the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/8">My purpose in initiating the debate was to highlight the fact that sometimes the simplest way of doing things is the right way. In this fast-moving world, we should be eliminating potential conflicts. Maintaining the status quo is not acceptable post 9/11. If it makes sense for all our agencies to work under a national umbrella, that principle should also apply to our uniformed police at airports and ports and on railways. I hope that the Minister will give the points that I have made due consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase> on securing this extremely important debate. I also welcome my hon. Friends the Members for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe) and for Livingston (Mr. Devine) and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/2">I say to my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian at the outset, in case I do not get to this at the end of my remarks, that I am perfectly happy to meet him to discuss the issues that he raised, with any of his hon. Friends whom he wishes to bring along who also wish to raise matters. That will enable us to discuss this issue further with officials at the Home Office and play a proper, constructive role in taking forward all the various points that he made in relation to trying to improve security at our airports. This should not be a party political matter; we all have an interest in ensuring that our airports are secure and safe from terrorist and other threats. My hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian made an excellent speech that showed his wide knowledge of the issue, and we certainly need to address some of the points that he made. I hope that I will be able to address many of the points made by my hon. Friend and other hon. Members. If not, I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian will intervene at the appropriate time. That said, I think that the meeting that I propose would be a good way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/3">The Home Office deals with the funding of policing at airports in England and Wales; Scottish airports, as my hon. Friend will know, are dealt with by the Scottish Executive. Policing of UK airports is undertaken by both uniformed officers and special branch officers. Separate arrangements are in place for the funding of each. I agree entirely with my hon. Friend about the importance of policing at airports and the need for co-ordination, which we try to achieve. It is also important to ensure that the funding for all that is adequate and appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/4">I shall give some general context for my remarks. The police have a multi-faceted role at the border, leading on intelligence work for counter-terrorism and serious crime, providing protective security and carrying out the policing of ports, the largest of which are sizeable communities in their own right. That is a significant deployment. My hon. Friend asked about this. There are currently 1,575 special branch officers at ports engaged in intelligence work alongside approximately 1,260 uniformed officers. I hope that that is helpful information for my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.0/5">The effect of that police deployment will be maximised through partnership working with the other border agencies. The creation of a new UK border agency, as announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November</phrase>, therefore provides a unique opportunity to improve the processes through which the police interact with their partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.3/1">That is one of the options that we must examine to consider how best we can use all the policing resources available to us, in order to integrate them at airports. The hon. Gentleman will know that one of the factors that we must consider with respect to the British Transport police is that currently they are not armed. Therefore, there is an issue about their deployment at airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.3/2">There is a range of different issues to consider. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire and my other hon. Friends have made some important points that contribute to the debate and we need to see how best we can take matters forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.3/3">The UK border agency will be up and running, albeit in a shadow form, from January 2008. The public are already seeing a difference in our border controls, with a visible, uniformed presence at ports of entry across the country and the beginning of the roll-out of new UK border branding. Biometrics programmes, such as Project IRIS&mdash;iris recognition immigration system&mdash;are making a difference by automating border entry for legitimate travellers. IRIS has over 140,000 British citizens and foreign nationals enrolled in the scheme and operates at nine terminals, with over 600,000 crossings.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.3/4">The single primary line is a combined checkpoint for passport control and customs and will be the focal point for border activity on arrival in the UK. Trials of the single primary line are under way at six sites. Based on the lessons that are learned from those pilots, the models will be rolled out nationally, with consistent UK border branding, throughout 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.3/5">Border and Immigration Agency and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs staff are already working closely together, enhancing staff awareness of individual roles and integrating checks to strengthen effectiveness at the border. Again, that relates to my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian's point that policing at airports is not just a police responsibility. There are a lot of agencies involved in providing security at airports. Agencies such as BIA and HMRC are important in that they work with the police to ensure that we have proper security at our borders and in our airports.</p>

	<p pid="a.218.0/1">The Minister may recall that we had a number of security alerts at BIA during the summer. BIA's management have now got together to monitor all subcontractors on their sites to ensure that they are fulfilling their role. Could he say whether that is an initiative that is being rolled out countrywide, or is it exclusive to BIA?</p>

	<p pid="a.218.1/1">There is a national aviation security programme, which, as the hon. Lady will know, is the responsibility of the Department for Transport, and it is known as TRANSEC. No doubt the Department is considering the type of initiative that she has just outlined, along with a range of others across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.1/2">Some other important progress is not necessarily so visible. The freight targeting system is providing real-time risk assessment of freight movements. Launched in 2007, FTS 2 has contributed to the seizure of over 9 million cigarettes, 20 kg of heroin and more than 2.5 tonnes of cannabis.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.1/3">I would also like to remind hon. Members that an independent review of airport policing was completed in July 2006, the broad thrust of which was accepted by the Government. The key issue identified by the review is that uniformed policing is part of the wider airport security context and that all stakeholders at an airport, not least airport operators&mdash;again, that is a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian made very well in his speech&mdash;have a role to play in coming together to address the threats and risks at each airport. There is no point in looking at policing in isolation from all those other bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.1/4">Government and industry representatives have been working together to agree both the overall approach and the details of a workable system for strengthening security at airports and the underpinning funding arrangements. Part of that work is the identification of police roles and responsibilities. Therefore, our focus must be on airport security as a whole. The costs of the necessary policing resource are an integral part of establishing the wider security context at each airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.218.1/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian made the point about the importance of co-ordination. Nationally, representatives of industry, the police and police authorities, and Government have been holding discussions on the way forward on policing and airport security. A shared security vision for UK airports has now been agreed, along with the key principles that will be used to develop the airport security plans to achieve that vision.</p>

	<p pid="a.219.0/1">I do not think that the views of my hon. Friend the Minister are far away from those of my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian. However, there is one thing that I do not understand. We already have in place a structure whereby, for example, if football fans are travelling from Edinburgh or Glasgow to London, it is the British Transport police who would accompany them all the way from Scotland to London and indeed to the football ground. Given that we already have this structure, which is unique, why do we not just add to that?</p>

	<p pid="a.219.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a reasonable point. Part of the purpose of this debate, and this is also why I am suggesting that I have a further meeting with my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian, is that we need to examine whether we can learn from some of the existing structures and systems&mdash;for example, as my hon. Friend points out, those of the British Transport police&mdash;so that we do not reinvent the wheel and so that, if we have something that works, we can build on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/2">However, we need to see how a structure such as that of the British Transport police would impact on other aspects of airport security. For instance, as I mentioned to my hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire, such a structure is fine in some regards, but it would be inappropriate to consider involving the British Transport police in aspects of airport security, because, for example, they are not armed, as I said previously. Therefore, there is an issue about how we put together the various structures, so that we have a meaningful overall structure that works both in the type of situation that my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston described and in relation to aspects of airport security. We are developing this plan and this vision for the future so that the different structures are integrated and the overall structure works.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/3">We are now working on establishing the framework for a strengthened security system, taking account of the threats and risks at each airport. As we do that, I will obviously bear in mind my hon. Friends' comments. That framework will build on the good work completed in 2002 by Sir John Wheeler, who devised the MATRA&mdash;multi-agency threat and risk assessment&mdash;system, which, in turn, would lead to the production of a clear airport security plan. We are trying to identify a suitable legislative slot to take forward those aspects of the plan that will require primary legislation. Of course, that process will require amendment of the existing civil aviation legislation, as well as setting out what is needed for the future. We will therefore try to legislate to deal with some of the issues that my hon. Friends have raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/4">Complementary work has also been taking place, as my hon. Friends and the hon. Member for Solihull will know, at the nine designated airports. Under section 25 of the Aviation Security Act 1982, nine airports are designated for policing purposes, which means that at those airports the airport operator funds the permanent uniformed police presence that is agreed with the police. The following airports are designated: London Heathrow; London Gatwick; London Stansted; Aberdeen; Edinburgh; Glasgow International; Glasgow Prestwick; Birmingham; and Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/5">More recently, the Civil Aviation Act 2006 required those airports to agree a formal police services agreement to determine the uniformed police complement. Where agreements are not yet signed at designated airports, negotiations are ongoing and, in most cases, they are at an advanced stage. If an agreement cannot be reached, then the parties involved can request that the Secretary of State initiates a process of expert determination to resolve the dispute, but we have received no such requests to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/6">Where an airport is not designated&mdash;the hon. Member for Solihull made the point that some airports are not designated&mdash;it has either a permanent police presence or the police attend where there is an operational need to do so. The police authority is normally required to meet the cost of the permanent police presence. However, in keeping with the conclusions of the independent review in 2006, we are working towards an outcome in which the system of designation will be abolished and any agreed policing costs are passed to the airport operator. That will bring the funding of policing at airports in line with other industries that require a permanent police presence. However, the Government do not underestimate the concerns that that has caused to the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/7">As well as uniformed police officers, there are also special branch officers at all airports. Those officers are also drawn from the local police force area. Special branch officers in England and Wales are part-funded by the Home Office through the ports element of the dedicated security posts funding. Each year, police forces in England and Wales submit a bid to the Home Office, outlining their dedicated security posts requirements for the following financial year. Those in Scotland are funded by the Scottish Executive and therefore separate, but broadly comparable arrangements apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.219.1/8">May I conclude by again congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian on securing this debate? He has raised some extremely important issues. Millions of people travel through our airports across the UK. They want to do so as quickly as possible, but they also want to do so securely and safely. The points that my hon. Friend and other hon. Members have made this morning will help us to develop our programme of airport security. As I said to my hon. Friend, we can sit down and have a meeting early in the new year, and he can also talk with the relevant officials about our plans, feeding into that process. In that way, I think that we can all be reassured that the plan that eventually emerges will be as good as we can possibly make it.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.2/1">It is a pleasure to meet under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. I wish you a very happy Christmas and a good new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/2">At dawn on Saturday, if the weather is clement, I will join a select group of enthusiasts at Stonehenge to witness the first sunrise after the winter solstice. It is a far more significant occasion than the summer solstice. Our ancestors calculated the exact date of the year's turn, when they could look forward to longer days and the green shoots of spring, and laid out Stonehenge accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/3">Stonehenge was inscribed as a world heritage site in 1986, and the UNESCO-approved management plan was published in April 2000. The stones are instantly recognisable, and are a worldwide symbol of our ancient heritage. They were shaped and erected more than 3,000 years ago, and their lintels, unique jointing and perfect geometry make Stonehenge the most sophisticated stone circle in the world. But it is more than just stones. Within the 2,600-hectare site are more than 400 scheduled ancient monuments in a ceremonial landscape that includes the avenue, the cursus and nearby Woodhenge. Just to the east lies Durrington Walls, where the people who built Stonehenge lived in a village of hundreds of houses that featured a stone-surfaced avenue. The secrets of Durrington Walls have only recently started to be revealed.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/4">Members of Parliament must consider the national interest as well as their constituency interests. Similarly, the Government have a duty to consider the implications of their national decisions for local communities. In November 1995, the planning conference on Stonehenge and the A303 resulted in 16 resolutions and a remarkable consensus among the representatives who attended. Sadly, that national and local consensus has slipped. Last week, a local survey by Vision News, Salisbury's online TV station, found that most people disagreed that the Government were right to cancel the Stonehenge A303 road project and tunnel. In fact, only one person who was interviewed favoured cancelling it.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/5">That surprised me. Despite some triumphalism from those who oppose the tunnel project, most people just want something to be done to minimise the negative impact of traffic congestion on their daily lives. They are proud of Stonehenge, but they mind more about getting to work and home again across the barrier of the choked A303. It is outrageous that the Government have abandoned my constituents in Winterbourne Stoke. That village and Chicklade to the west are now the only communities between London and the west of England without a bypass.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/6">If the A344 is closed, traffic will double on the A360 between Airman's Corner and Long Barrow roundabout and increase by a third on the A303 past the stones. Unless my constituents in Orcheston, Tilshead and Shrewton are served by a new junction at Airman's Corner and an A303 underpass at Long Barrow, their councillors will not agree to the closure of the A344. That agreement is essential to planning permission. Objective 11 of the management plan requires the A344 and A303 to be removed or screened. Interestingly, support is growing for the planting of trees along both roads, within the world heritage site. Will the Stonehenge project board please consider that?</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/7">The Department for Transport has just saved itself more than &pound;500 million and announced that any new money for even minor road improvements must come from the meagre south-west regional road budget. That is totally unacceptable. Why should people in Devon and Cornwall lose their road improvements to pay for the wreckage of a national road project that was funded from the Department for Transport's budget until <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.221.2/8">Meanwhile, my constituents in Larkhill, Bulford, Durrington and Amesbury will be plagued by rat-running to avoid the gridlock past the stones. There is increasing evidence of rat-running further south&mdash;down the A338 along the Bourne valley to Salisbury and then along the A30 through the Nadder valley to Hindon, bypassing the entire Stonehenge section of the A303.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.1/1">My hon. Friend and neighbour knows that Chitterne and many of our villages are plagued by satnav lost sheep. Lorries from all over Europe regularly get stuck on completely inappropriate roads signed on satnav as the best way to get from A to B. I have pursued the matter with the Department for Transport during the past 18 months or so, but the Department can do precious little about it&mdash;it requires Europe-wide action. The real problem is that whatever satnav might say, a driver confronted with a road must rely on signs. If a sign says that the road is narrow, has a weight limit or other restriction or is otherwise inappropriate&mdash;and if the driver can read English&mdash;it will work, but there is nothing physically to prevent truck drivers from driving down an inappropriate road and getting stuck. It is a massive problem, and we have yet to come up with a solution. How right he is to draw attention to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/2">Will the Government please consider afresh the potential in the long term for tolling or shadow tolling, a major road improvement for the strategic A303 route? I have raised the point before. Of course I do not mean toll booths either side of Stonehenge; smart cards or even global positioning system technology will soon be equal to the challenge. Design, build, finance and operate contracts, with shadow tolling, are well tried in this country and could be an attractive option for the medium to long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/3">In April 1986, UNESCO said that the A344 past the stones must be rerouted. In November 1986, the UNESCO world heritage committee</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/4" class="indent">&quot;noted with satisfaction the assurances&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/5">that the closure was being seriously considered. In April 2002, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport told UNESCO that planning consent for the new visitor centre would be submitted, and the highways consent procedure for the tunnel initiated, in December. In 2003, UNESCO welcomed the decision to construct a bored tunnel and asked for a report by <phrase class="date" code="2004-02-01">1 February 2004</phrase>, which DCMS provided, albeit on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-28">28 May 2004</phrase>. UNESCO then asked for another report by <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February 2005</phrase>, which did not come. In summer 2005, it asked for an updated report by <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-01">1 February 2007</phrase>. Meanwhile, in 2006, it noted that DCMS had provided no time frame for the Stonehenge project and that management was weak.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.1/6">In July this year, the world heritage committee received a brief report full of good intentions that said how difficult it all was. Now the Government are washing their hands of Stonehenge and leaving it to the Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to pick up the pieces. I do not doubt her good intentions and determination. She needs all the support that she can get.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.0/1">I am here as the chairman of the all-party group on world heritage sites to tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> that this is in many senses a cross-party issue. The site is of major significance not just in the UK but throughout the world. The all-party group, as he knows, is keen to see the matter resolved. The visitor centre is not up to standard for the previous century, let alone the future. I want the group to support his efforts to ensure a settlement on the road network in his constituency. I congratulate him on securing this debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.223.1/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>, and I salute him for the work that he does for the all-party group on world heritage sites, of which I am an assiduous attender. I also welcome the support that the group, which draws its membership from both Houses and from a wide range of support in the world of culture and heritage, has already given to the Stonehenge project.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/2">I refer to the Government because I believe that this 21-year-old saga represents a systemic failure in the machinery of government. Successive Culture Secretaries have not been powerful enough to obtain Cabinet agreement; and Transport Secretaries have always found it easier to give greater priority to other roads. I understand that the &pound;500 million in this case will go instead to widening the M25. Four Prime Ministers have failed to acknowledge the importance of our national heritage to our culture needs, let alone to our tourism and transport needs. Only the Treasury has won every round.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/3">In February 2008, the Minister of State must report progress to UNESCO, following the Government's decision to abandon the road and the proposed visitor centre. At its July meeting, the world heritage committee will</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/4" class="indent">&quot;fully examine the implication of their decision for the value and integrity of Stonehenge as a World Heritage property&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/5">Will the Minister confirm that time scale, and say whether she expects to submit a revised management plan to UNESCO in January 2009?</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/6">The Government are already in trouble, because they have failed to restrain the encroachment of new tall buildings on the world heritage sites here at Westminster and down the river at the Tower of London. Only last month, UNESCO threatened the delisting of the Dresden Elbe valley site because the landscape would be degraded by a new bridge. It would indeed be a national humiliation if Stonehenge were to be put on the endangered list. I do not think that it will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/7">I congratulate the Minister, and the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, for calling an emergency meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December</phrase> of the new Stonehenge project board, in order to agree terms of reference, to consider options for the future, and to decide the key issues and what can now be delivered. By all accounts, it was an eclectic gathering of the main stakeholders in the south-west of England. Crucially, however, the local planning authority was not represented. That caused consternation. Will the Minister confirm whether Salisbury district council was invited to the meeting? If it was, I consider it a dereliction of duty that not one councillor or council officer could be found to attend that meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/8">Looking forward, will the Minister assure us that the starting point for a new beginning must be the existing management plan, revised to take account of the new situation? Will she retain the three long-term objectives&mdash;objectives 1, 2 and 3? They are the endorsement of the management plan; the improvement of the management and conservation of the cultural landscape; and the interpretation of the universal value of the whole world heritage site. Will she continue to promote public enjoyment, education and research at Stonehenge?</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/9">Under the terms of objective 14 of the plan, and as a gesture of good intent to UNESCO, will the Minister consider adding to the site the unique Parsonage Down national nature reserve and Yarnbury castle, which lie to the west of the stones? I believe that they should have been included from the start.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/10">Will the Minister also say how much money the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will contribute to the new visitor centre? The right hon. Lady has done so well to pledge that the Government will have a new centre up and running by 2012. Such a project on such a tight time scale must be primed with the help of the taxpayer. English Heritage is already in discussion with the Heritage Lottery Fund, which suddenly has more than &pound;20 million to spend on something else&mdash;the Olympics?&mdash;following the decision not to proceed with the visitor centre. Will the Minister assure us that her Department will give 100 per cent. backing to a lottery bid by English Heritage?</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/11">Objective 18 of the management plan states that a new world-class visitor centre should be secured to act as a gateway to Stonehenge, to improve the visitor experience and to encourage the dispersal of visitors around the entire world heritage site. Will the Minister maintain that objective? I said in the House last week that something cheap and cheerful would not do. What we are embarking on is a semi-permanent solution that is likely to last for at least 20 years, until a new strategic plan can be agreed. It must be a visitor centre of high quality, innovation and vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/12">May I recommend that all those involved revisit the Fargo north scheme, published in April 1998? There are well-reasoned arguments for a centre just north of the A344 and west of Fargo plantation. That would be a good site. Much of the transport planning, including designs for new road junctions, has been done. That could considerably shorten the time scale necessary for design work. If the 1998 proposal could be updated to include a grade-separated junction at the Long Barrow junction of the A303 and the A360, that might well avoid a public planning inquiry and would save at least a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/13">UNESCO has always been critical of facilities for interpretation and explanation, and so have I. However, I at least had the advantage during my childhood in Salisbury of spending many hours at the stones and at the Salisbury and South Wiltshire museum, which has the best Stonehenge collection in the country. Under its new chairman and director, the museum is planning a new &quot;Stonehenge Experience&quot;. Given the circumstances that we now face, DCMS and English Heritage have a golden opportunity to join forces with the museum&mdash;the Minister visited it with me in September&mdash;to create a world-class exhibition and learning experience. It would be in service within two years, well ahead of any possible delivery at Stonehenge&mdash;and it would be only a stone's throw away. It would also represent good value for money, at about &pound;1.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/14">Already, thousands of people combine visits to Stonehenge with trips to the English Heritage site at Old Sarum and Salisbury cathedral. In 2008, our cathedral celebrates its 750th anniversary, and there will be many new reasons for people to combine visits to the sites&mdash;and also to visit local National Trust properties, including Mompesson house. There is also early discussion about the nomination of our incomparable Salisbury cathedral close as a future world heritage site.</p>
	<p pid="a.223.1/15">Now is the time for us all to work together to ensure that Stonehenge becomes more than a tourist destination&mdash;that it becomes a wonderful experience for all who marvel at mankind's ancient footprint on our land and who yearn to understand more of our humanity. Christmas is upon us. All of us&mdash;even, dare I say it, English Heritage and the National Trust&mdash;should find a large bunch of mistletoe and pledge undying friendship in the interests of Stonehenge.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.225.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" speakername="David Wright" colnum="225"  time="014:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0006.htm#07121856000503">
	<p pid="a.225.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He says that he will be at Stonehenge on Saturday. I hope that he will excuse me for not joining him, as it is my birthday; nevertheless, I wish him all the best.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/2">I have particularly fond memories of Stonehenge. My family regularly visited the site on our way to the south coast for our summer holidays. The management of the stones has changed somewhat over the years. We used to have access to them&mdash;we could sit on them and wander around them. I have a photograph in my family album of me in a hideous 1970s T-shirt sitting one of the stones, with my grandfather sitting next to me smoking a Woodbine. I still like to visit Stonehenge, but the Woodbines did for granddad. I am fond of the site and I try to visit it whenever I pass by, as it brings back important family memories.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/3">I am chairman of the all-party group on world heritage sites. It is, I believe, one of the most successful groups in Parliament, with a large attendance. The Minister is to visit the group early in the new year, and I am sure that she will be asked a number of questions about Stonehenge and the management of the site. I speak today largely because the subject is an all-party one and it is important to our nation that we get it right. Stonehenge is one of the United Kingdom's most significant sites. Clearly, all world heritage sites are important, but Stonehenge is recognised across the world as being of extreme significance.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/4">The hon. Member for Salisbury said that Stonehenge sits in a landscape. World heritage sites are now considered as part of a wider landscape. For the older sites, it was an iconic feature within the landscape that was designated, but UNESCO and all involved in world heritage now take the view that one has to place sites such as Stonehenge within the landscape setting. That is why this debate is so important. The management of traffic around the site is of major importance, but is not working effectively. Someone driving past Stonehenge will see a lot of people trying to glimpse the stones as they pass by. I do not know how many accidents are caused as a result, but clearly the framework for traffic management is not right.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/5">Sadly, we have been having this debate since 1995, and the reports published are stacking up. The hon. Gentleman was right to raise, on behalf of his constituents, the issue of vehicle management, but this is important to the whole nation, so we need to get it right. As he mentioned, a number of other world heritage sites are also under threat. There is a significant debate about the Tower of London, about the world heritage site in which we sit today, and about the impact of tall buildings. UNESCO will wish to take a view on the continuing volume of traffic passing Stonehenge and how it impacts on the way in which people can look at, study and enjoy the wider landscape.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/6">The site is of world significance, but the visitors' centre is not up to scratch. In fact, it is the same one that I visited while wearing that pretty horrible 1970s T-shirt. The centre has not stood the test of time. It might function, but one would imagine that such an important feature of the landscape would require a visitors' centre that does it credit with, for example, a multi-media presentation of the site and attempts to promote an understanding of the wider landscape. I hope that we will get a commitment from the Minister to major steps forward in traffic management and a visitors' centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/7">It is particularly important that we make progress before 2012. The all-party world heritage sites group wants to pursue the concept of &quot;world heritage, world games&quot;, so that people visiting the UK for the Olympic games will be encouraged to visit world heritage sites&mdash;not just Stonehenge, but other sites such as Ironbridge gorge, in my constituency. We want people to visit not just London, but all our major world heritage sites. There could be a fantastic link between the world games and world heritage sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/8">It is crucial, however, that Stonehenge has a better-quality visitors' centre. Many people will want to visit Stonehenge when they come to the London Olympics, because in their home countries they have seen incredible images of that feature of our landscape. However, it is important to focus on the management plans and on delivering them. Plans for all world heritage sites take considerable time to develop, and the organisations involved in putting them together are very proud of them&mdash;they are of the plan for Ironbridge gorge, and I am sure that they are of the Stonehenge one as well. We must hold faith with the organisations, and the Government, who have contributed to the development of those plans. They should be seen as the main structure for future delivery on traffic and visitor plans around Stonehenge and the surrounding landscape.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/9">In conclusion, I again congratulate the hon. Member for Salisbury. I stress to the Minister that this matter is important to all parties in the House and all people in this nation.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.0/1">I apologise if I sniff and cough my way through my contribution. One connection that I might have with those who built Stonehenge, other than a love of the stones themselves, is the fact that I am suffering from a common cold, which no doubt they experienced during its construction.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/2">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> for raising this important debate at this crucial time. Clearly he has a constituency interest, but I am sure that it has been demonstrated to all hon. Members that his interest goes far beyond that&mdash;he has a personal connection to the site having grown up in the area. He spoke about the long identification of Stonehenge as a world heritage site. Happily we now have many more in this country, but this country's performance will be assessed according to how we approach our more major and long-standing commitments, such as that to Stonehenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/3">The hon. Gentleman addressed the wider historical landscape and the dangers of simplistic solutions, such as closing the junction on the A344, in isolation, which would not resolve the problems facing the landscape and the site itself, but would have consequences for congestion on the A303 and present problems for his constituents and those seeking to explore and enjoy the wider south-west. He also mentioned shadow tolling, which shows that he has a positive contribution to make and is not merely criticising the Government. He should be congratulated on taking a constructive approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/4">The hon. Gentleman raised the important issue of the visitors' centre, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the hon. Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>. However, although progress on the visitors' centre would be welcome, we must consider how people would get there, otherwise we could create a huge problem. We cannot encourage greater numbers of people to experience what is on offer without affording them proper access. The hon. Member for Salisbury also spoke of the connection with the supporting heritage and tourist facilities in Salisbury and elsewhere, and about the importance of finding the right approach for the benefit of the wider economy and Stonehenge itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/5">The hon. Member for Telford spoke about the long-standing support of the all-party world heritage sites group for Stonehenge, and I pay tribute to the work of his group. He raised some crucial points about the landscape and maintaining the stones' legacy, which is why we all support the scheme on which sadly the Government recently turned their backs. It presented an opportunity to reunite some of the features of the landscape. He spoke also about the link with the 2012 games and the opportunity to present the heritage of our country at its very best. That deadline looms for all sorts of projects. I hope that the Minister will refer to that in her remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/6">We might be having this debate during the last full year in which Stonehenge enjoys and retains unquestioned UNESCO world heritage status, as has been mentioned. After years of failing Stonehenge, Ministers in the Department for Transport seem to have settled on failure as their chosen course of action. Stonehenge is arguably the United Kingdom's single most important historical monument, but sadly the Government's recent decision puts the UNESCO world heritage status at risk. The monument is at risk from further damage from growing volumes of traffic. UNESCO accorded Stonehenge its world heritage status on the condition that nearby roads be examined and progress be made on protecting the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/7">Transport Ministers have consistently let down the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by underestimating the importance of the scheme. Indeed, the DFT sees the A303 improvements as a regional scheme only, which demonstrates its indifference to Stonehenge's national and international significance. I speak from the heart as a Member for a south-west constituency where there are other projects. Had the scheme gone ahead, it would have gobbled up south-west funding for many years to come. Trying to brush the scheme off as regional would, therefore, have had deleterious effects on important safety schemes, such as the A30 improvement between Temple and Higher Carblake in north Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/8">Now that a decision has finally been made, we need to look to the future. The Minister must have asked herself, &quot;What am I going to do now?&quot; She has said that she still wants to resolve this matter, so what are her plans for the current Stonehenge visitors' centre and what is the future for the ambitious plans previously connected with the A303 changes and the centre? What is her, and her Department's, view of the proposed closure of the A303-A344 junction? Local Members are said to be concerned about further congestion in that area, and hon. Members have raised that concern in this debate. What, on balance, does she believe should be done?</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/9">As we have heard, UNESCO will meet next year to discuss Stonehenge's status. How will the Minister convince UNESCO to give the Government the benefit of the doubt? She will need to act early to influence the UNESCO world heritage centre's report to the world heritage committee in July. Images of Stonehenge were used as part of the successful bid for the 2012 Olympics, and improvements to the site were anticipated to be in place by then. It is a cruel irony that a British site given such credence by the International Olympic Committee should be given so little priority by the British Government themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/10">Before the DFT made its decision, how many visitors did the Minister anticipate visiting Stonehenge in 2012? By contrast, how many does she think will now get there? Indeed, what does she anticipate to be the wider implications for tourism in the wider south-west of the DFT's decision? Stonehenge is a magnet for the region, but the A303 is also a major artery to the wider south-west, and the Government have chosen to undermine one and block the other. What was the outcome of the Stonehenge programme board meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December</phrase>, to which the hon. Member for Salisbury referred earlier? Does the Minister feel that her colleagues at the DFT recognised the importance of Stonehenge to the whole United Kingdom and beyond? Do her colleagues in the DFT, in the Ministry of Defence, which could be a vital partner in any scheme elsewhere in the area, and crucially in the Treasury share her resolve to get the issue right?</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/11">Have Treasury officials been asked to compare the relative worth of capital expenditure on protecting a site of such unique status as Stonehenge with, for example, other high-profile Government schemes? Have DFT officials been asked to compare the increased costs of going ahead with the Stonehenge scheme with other schemes that have suffered serious delay? It has been reported that the costs are much higher than originally anticipated, but in the meantime the costs of most road schemes have also escalated due to rising labour costs. Should not the DFT have anticipated that likely increase in cost when it was budgeting?</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/12">After a decade of dithering, there remain countless questions for the Government. It is almost 18 years since the Public Accounts Committee said that the setting around Stonehenge was &quot;a national disgrace&quot;, but we seem to have moved no further forward. The Liberal Democrats welcome the Minister's recent support for Stonehenge, but we need to know that she is not whistling in the inter-departmental wind. She has to convince not only this House, but UNESCO. We all agree that for Stonehenge to lose its status would be a tragedy. I hope we can agree that the south-west as a whole needs the revenue it receives from tourism, and that the Government's decisions on Stonehenge will have serious effects on it, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/13">The Government have spent years failing to decide, and now they have decided to do nothing. Stonehenge may be famous for its longevity, but it cannot wait for action for ever.</p>

	<p pid="a.229.0/1">It is a pleasure to participate in this important and timely debate. I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> on accumulating so much knowledge over the 10 years that he has pursued the matter. His constituents can be rightly proud of the way in which he has stood up for and pioneered Stonehenge, helping to remind us that the issue is about not only Stonehenge and the stones themselves, but Durrington Walls, Woodhenge and the surrounding area. He has shown a commitment and dedication that I hope the Government will honour as we move forward and consider another proposal, following their announcement. Indeed, the announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase> has led us to the debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">I need not remind the Chamber that after 10 years of studies, at a cost of &pound;23 million, all plans, details, ideas and improvements concerning Stonehenge have been thrown out. As we have heard, that is a massive blow to the area and for many people who simply want a solution. We are back to square one. The way in which the announcement was made was a surprise. It was slipped out in a written statement, and it was only thanks to Mr. Speaker agreeing to an urgent question that we forced a Minister to come to the Dispatch Box to answer it. Unfortunately, it is a reflection of the importance that the Government grant to tourism that instead of the Secretary of State for Transport responding to that question, she simply left a junior Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the hon. Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, to stand up to the wrath of the questioners and justify the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/3">Under the Government, the tourism deficit&mdash;the amount that we spend abroad compared with inbound spending&mdash;has changed significantly since 1997. It was &pound;4 billion then; it is &pound;18 billion now, which shows that we spend far more money abroad than we are able to attract from visitors to the United Kingdom. Tourism is a competitive international market, but Britain is losing out to competition from abroad, and more Britons than ever before are choosing to holiday abroad. We do not enjoy the increases in inbound tourism that our competitors enjoy.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/4">It was interesting to see a reply to a question that we tabled last week, in which the Government acknowledged that the percentage of tourists who come to the UK was 3.9 per cent. in 1997, but down to 3.6 per cent. last year. We do not benefit from the increases in the number of flights and in people's disposable income, because we do not attract visitors to the UK. That is reflected in the status of Stonehenge, and unless we harness the visitor potential of such attractions, we will continue to suffer.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/5">I shall recap the history of the issue. It goes back to 1989 when the then Government, under their roads programme, first considered improving the A303. More than 50 possible routes were considered prior to public consultation, involving the Highways Agency and a huge planning conference in 1995, at which it was recommended that only one acceptable scheme had been put forward&mdash;a tunnel, 4 km long, at an estimated cost of &pound;300 million. The then Government considered it unaffordable and withdrew the scheme from the roads programme in November 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/6">In July 1998, the new Government identified a new A303 scheme, which was in their targeted programme of improvements. It included a 2.1 km tunnel, a bypass of Winterbourne Stoke, a two-level junction at Countess roundabout and a new junction arrangement at Longbarrow crossroads. There was then a public inquiry, which concluded in May 2004, and the inspector recommended a new dual carriageway be built along with the bored tunnel. However, the costs had increased significantly, and the Government, concerned about the costs, decided to review the entire process. Consultation was held in 2006, leading us to the announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase> in which all plans and ideas were thrown out. So we are now back to the drawing board.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/7">I visited Stonehenge the weekend before last. It was a miserable day weather-wise, with appalling rain, but it was stunning to see the car park almost full. Coachloads of visitors wanted to walk around and explore the grounds, and the gift shop was full. What was sad, however, was the state of the visitor facilities, which have been referred to already. They are third-rate, prefab construction units that have no place on such a wonderful site as Stonehenge. It is strange to have such an archaic and temporary outfit supporting something that has been around for so long. That is the irony: a heritage site that has existed for thousands of years is supported by such inadequate facilities that they could not last a decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/8">I left with a brochure that the very friendly staff gave to me. On the back page, it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Plans for the future. Your future visits to Stonehenge will be very different from your experience today. Major plans are being prepared to place Stonehenge in a grassland setting, free it from roads and traffic noise and provide world-class visitor facilities. This will improve your enjoyment and understanding of the whole World Heritage site.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/10">Clearly, the brochure is now out of date, so perhaps the Government might be brave enough to add a different line, saying, &quot;We apologise for the delay in improving the visitor facilities and infrastructure around Stonehenge. Your patience in waiting another 10 years before a new plan is announced is much appreciated.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/11">I am a little cynical, but I fear that I echo many concerns of people throughout the country who support the site and wonder why on earth it is taking so long to improve what might arguably be described as our No. 1 outdoor heritage attraction. As I said at the Dispatch Box last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Stonehenge is a first-rate heritage site with second-rate facilities supported by a third-rate tourism policy.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-12-10.13"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 December 2007; Vol. 469, c. 13</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/13">I should acknowledge straight away, however, that the Minister has only recently inherited the brief and is not responsible for the tourism policy that the Department introduced before the summer. None the less, she must accept that she now carries the burden of responsibility and will therefore feel the wrath of those on all sides of this issue, although I hope that she understands that it is directed at the issues themselves, not at her personally.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/14">Stonehenge is a wonderful site, but we would not expect to find temporary facilities at similar places, such as the temple of Artemis, the pyramids of Giza or even the Grand Canyon. At such places, people are continually looking at ways to market the attractions and improve what is on offer, but in a manner that protects the attractions themselves. If we are to celebrate our history and heritage&mdash;whether man-made or natural&mdash;we must provide the necessary infrastructure to both market and protect attractions for future generations. Doing nothing is a dereliction of duty and an insult to heritage, but I am afraid that that is exactly what the Government are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/15">It is interesting to think about when the Government made their announcement, because it came out in a week when we had an awful lot of bad news from them. We heard about the hard drive lost by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which contained millions of details, and about the discs lost by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, which contained 25 million people's records. When I heard that the money was not available for Stonehenge, part of me thought that the Government had perhaps lost the cheque, but I hope that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/16">As we have heard, we are talking about not only tourism, but transport. I live in Bournemouth and I am fully aware of the importance of upgrading the A303. The road is a key arterial route into the south-west, and it is critical that such a strategic pipeline receives the attention that it deserves. We also heard about the number of accidents that happen on the road, but the issue has been thrown out with the bathwater, and we now hear that the South West of England Regional Development Agency will be expected to pay for any improvements in that respect. I would be grateful if the Minister could spell out in a little more detail whether there are any additional funds that the RDA might be able to use. Placing such a burden on the RDA would, as my hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury said, mean denying the south-west other transport improvements. Many areas will not benefit from the improvements to the A303, so placing the burden of paying for them on the whole south-west would be very unfair, particularly considering that the Government were committed to making those improvements for so long.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/17">As has been said, the Department for Transport had the final say on this issue. I would be curious to hear what discussions the Minister, or indeed the Secretary of State, had with the Department and whether she failed to persuade it to take a different approach. Sadly, such problems reflect the way in which the Department for Culture, Media and Sport often plays second fiddle to other Departments, which often dole out legislation that has a massive impact on DCMS areas. For example, the cost of visas has been doubled, bed and breakfasts are now affected by red tape and air passenger duty has been increased. All those things happened almost as if the DCMS had not been consulted. Again, I would be grateful if the Minister could say what efforts she is making to ensure that tourism is pushed up the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/18">Such decisions are not helped by Treasury pressure to cut heritage and tourism budgets, which is a bizarre attitude, given that we should be marketing Britain in the lead-up to the Olympics. Organisations such as VisitBritain promote Britain abroad and encourage visitors to see attractions such as Stonehenge, so why did the DCMS decide to cut VisitBritain's budget by &pound;18 million over three years? What links all these issues, I suspect, is the fact that the Treasury has the final say, and the voice of tourism gets lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/19">Such is the anger over this issue that the Tourism Alliance, a hugely influential body that links many of the voices in the tourism industry, accused the Government of</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/20" class="indent">&quot;grossly misunderstanding and mismanaging the UK's tourism sector&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/21">Those are damaging words, considering that the alliance is the very body that benefits from support and guides the tourist industry in the UK. The alliance had a crisis meeting with the Minister, and I would be grateful to hear what it asked her to do. There has been an absence of leadership on tourism, and the Tourism Alliance has recently launched its &quot;Take Tourism Seriously&quot; campaign, which urges the Prime Minister to reconsider what the Government are doing with Britain's fifth-largest industry, which lacks a robust voice in the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/22">We must recognise the appetite for heritage. I think that the Minister has visited the British Museum exhibition about the terracotta army from China's Xi'an area. The exhibition has been a huge success and provides evidence that there is a massive appetite for heritage in the UK, but that appetite will be denied if we do not explore and take advantage of our own heritage.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/23">I cannot finish without mentioning the concern about the UN's world heritage committee, which is seriously considering removing Stonehenge's world heritage status. That would have a devastating impact on the area, and I would be curious to hear the Minister comment on what discussions she has had on the issue. The committee has certainly voiced concerns about the visitors' centre and about the infrastructure being woefully under par and it has said that improvements are needed as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/24">I have a number of other questions for the Minister. What feedback did she have from interested parties following the decision that was made on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>? The Government say that they are now looking at new options. What are those options and what timetable&mdash;however vague&mdash;is in place? Will she report back to Parliament in six months on the progress that has been made on this critical issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/25">Will the Minister also comment on her meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December</phrase> with the new Stonehenge board? What was decided? Was the local planning authority invited? When will the next meeting take place? Was Salisbury district council invited? It is a Liberal Democrat-controlled council, but I gather that it did not turn up. Will the Minister confirm whether that was indeed the case?</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/26">The Minister has inherited a difficult brief. It is said that Stonehenge is most impressive at sunrise, with beams of light reflecting on the sarsen stones, but thanks to the Government's poor stewardship, and the mist of confusion that now hangs over the future, I fear that although the stones themselves will continue to defy time, the sun will set on the Government before a plan worthy of this ancient and historic landmark is brought forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.0/1">Season's greetings to you, Mr. Cummings, on the last day of our debates and happy birthday to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase>. Like others, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> on securing this important debate, even if it is being held on the last day before the recess.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is an expert on Stonehenge. Not only is he the area's representative, but he has had ministerial responsibility for transport and culture at different points in his career. In both roles, he probably grappled with many of the difficult issues that face me today as I try to find a way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/3">I endorse my hon. Friend's suggestion that it is all too easy to score political points on this complex issue, but I hope that we will not try to do so. It is in all our interests to find a solution of sufficient substance, because that is what is warranted by this magnificent historical site, and we can best reach such a solution by working together.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/4">The problem before us has not been around for just the past 10 years; sadly, it has been around for a generation. When I went to visit Stonehenge with the hon. Member for Salisbury in September I had not been there for many years. When one goes back one realises what a mistake we made putting up a visitor centre of that quality in that place&mdash;presumably in the '60s. There are other buildings around of that era, and I am sure that we would never make such a mistake again; as long as English Heritage does not go and list it, and create further difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/5">Stonehenge is of international importance. We share that view across the Chamber. It is one of our most iconic sites, and has fascinated people across millennia. We probably will never know&mdash;that is its fascination&mdash;why our ancestors built the structure 5,000 years ago, and went on building and changing it over the two millennia that followed its original construction. It is not just the stones that are important. As hon. Members have said, there is the cursus just north of the stones, which I saw on my visit: two grass banks 100 m apart, stretching nearly 3 km. They are also an enigma. On the ridges surrounding the stones are burial mounds, which were built more than 1,000 years after the stones were erected. The landscape all around Stonehenge continues to reveal wonderful new archaeological finds. In September, I met a team of archaeologists who work, they tell me, every year at Durrington Walls.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/6">The Stonehenge landscape includes sites of special scientific interest, and a major objective of the management plan&mdash;which has to a considerable extent been achieved, with the help of the countryside stewardship scheme and its successors&mdash;has been the reversion of that core area of the world heritage site from arable to traditional chalk grassland. It is now home to the stone curlew, a rare, red-listed visitor to our isles&mdash;although I did not see one. Of course, Stonehenge is also the place where druids and pagans celebrate the solstice.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/7">Stonehenge, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1437" name="Tobias Ellwood">the hon. Member for Bournemouth, East (Mr. Ellwood)</phrase> drew to the House's attention, is a hugely important tourist destination. Every year it attracts about 875,000 visitors, and another 23,000 go to the solstices and equinoxes. The income for the area is about &pound;5 million. The hon. Member for Bournemouth, East tries to oppose our policies for tourism, but I am perfectly happy, if he wants to call a debate, to justify our decisions. It is precisely because we want to invest in what tourists experience when they come to the UK that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has used the budget allocated to it in the comprehensive spending review as it has. We have deliberately put more money into heritage, at the expense&mdash;to a slight extent&mdash;of the money that we invest in marketing.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/8">We have done that not so much for the benefit of Stonehenge as a specific site; rather, for the first time in a long while English Heritage is getting more money, and it is the first time we have ever set up a budget that focuses specifically on the heritage of our seaside resorts. Some of our seaside resorts have done extremely well in the past 20 or 25 years, but others have suffered. Yet they all have within them little heritage jewels, and if we can use those, with a little investment, as a catalyst to regenerate those areas for tourism, that will be money well spent by Government&mdash;proper investment that will grow our tourism.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/9">At the same time, it would be dilatory of us not to ask VisitBritain to modernise the way in which it markets the UK&mdash;including its use of office infrastructure and new methods of communication. With regard to the hon. Gentleman's refusal to support us in that, I attended last week a meeting of the VisitBritain board, which could have been difficult, given that its budget is being cut in the coming period. However, all the people at the table, including representatives of the devolved Administrations, welcomed what we had done, because it energised them into strategically rethinking, in a way that has not happened before, how best to use the &pound;350 million&mdash;including the hon. Gentleman's money and mine&mdash;in tourism support to market our country.</p>

	<p pid="a.234.0/1">We are mixing numbers up. The overall headline figure for heritage funding has dropped from &pound;461 million in 1997-98 to &pound;231 million in 2006-07. It might have increased slightly from last year, but overall there has been a net decrease. The Minister mentions VisitBritain, but if she cares to look at its website, Christopher Rodrigues, the chief executive, is said to have expressed</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/2" class="indent">&quot;real disappointment at the overall settlement level, particularly following ten years of static funding and the most challenging summer for tourism since 2001.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.234.0/3">The Minister is aware that funding for VisitBritain has remained about &pound;35 million for the past 10 years. It has not changed&mdash;excluding the running costs of about &pound;15 million; but this time the Government have decided to reduce that amount by &pound;18 million in the next three years.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.1/1">That intervention was full of selective statistics, and it is not the real issue for debate. If the hon. Gentleman had spent more time understanding the challenges that we face at Stonehenge he might have focused his contribution on that. I feel that I have to respond to what he said, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/2">First, the hon. Gentleman was selective in his figures on heritage investment, because he did not include the money that has gone through the Heritage Lottery Fund. Secondly, it is not only VisitBritain that markets Britain. The regional development agencies have had responsibility since 2003; the devolved Administrations have responsibility as well. One of the purposes of the review is to make sure that we eliminate duplication and use the resources&mdash;I repeat that &pound;350 million of support for tourism is coming from the taxpayer's and council tax payer's purse&mdash;to the best effect. I am sure that under Christopher Rodrigues's superb leadership of VisitBritain, the enthusiasm that he and other board members showed last week will result in better marketing of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/3">Stonehenge is important; I recognise that, and it is because of that that I am investing a lot of time in trying to find a solution for it. I have said that we want the relevant improvements to Stonehenge's traffic management and visitor centre and the environment surrounding that world heritage site to happen by 2012. That gives us a catalyst for action. When visitors come to Britain they tend to come to London. There are a few places outside London that they choose to visit, and Stonehenge is always on that list. If we want the whole of the UK to capture the benefits of our hosting the Olympics in London in 2012, it is crucial that we get world heritage tourist attractions such as Stonehenge in proper, fit, modern and well-preserved order by that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/4">Stonehenge was one of the first UK sites to be inscribed on the world heritage list. That was more than 20 years ago. It was not just the stones that were inscribed, but also the associated monuments, which are spread over more than 2,000 hectares. Since the signing of the world heritage convention in 1984, we are proud as a country to have attained a total of 27 world heritage sites on the list, which now totals more than 800 sites worldwide. The UK sites differ greatly, ranging from uninhabited islands in the southern oceans, through great prehistoric, Roman and mediaeval monumental buildings, to marvels of Georgian urban architecture and planning and an increasing number of sites that demonstrate the contribution of the UK to industrialisation, which underpins the modern world. The UK is among the top 10 countries for the number of sites inscribed on the world heritage list. I say to the hon. Members for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson) and for Bournemouth, East, that we have absolutely no intention of suggesting that Stonehenge should drop off that list.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/5">Inscription on the world heritage list is the highest accolade that can be afforded a place, and it brings international prestige. It also brings international responsibilities, which we take seriously. The world heritage convention brings together countries from all parts of the globe, acting together to safeguard places that are of such outstanding universal value that their protection transcends national boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/6">In the UK, we are proud of the part that we have played in the movement's success. Until 2005 we were one of the member states elected to sit on the world heritage committee, and since our four-year term of office ended we have continued to work closely with and support the world heritage centre to deal with the development pressures facing some of our sites, which my hon. Friend the Member for Telford mentioned. As part of the heritage protection review, we are taking measures to increase the protection of world heritage sites in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/7">In London next month we will host an international expert meeting, which we hope will help the committee to achieve its goal of increasing the number of sites represented, particularly in developing nations, and recognising advancements in science and technology. We are in the throes of our own world heritage policy review, which will examine how we should nominate our sites best to reflect the world heritage committee's priorities, and we always send experts to participate in international events. I hope that that shows our commitment to the world heritage convention, which will continue and be reflected in how we handle Stonehenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/8">As several hon. Members have noted, work to determine a way forward for Stonehenge and address the traffic problems on the A303 has been going on for some time. We also want to see work to improve the landscape environment around Stonehenge, and the improved visitor facilities and interpretation that a number of Members have referred to. The work has been going on too long, and I hope that hon. Members will join me in paying tribute to the hon. Member for Salisbury, because in the discussions that I have had with him since the summer he has committed himself to helping me achieve what we require&mdash;a consensus on the way forward. If we can build that consensus with all the relevant authorities, we will not need long planning inquiries. That is our best opportunity to get improvements made before spring 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/9">The Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" name="Tom Harris">the Member for Glasgow, South (Mr. Harris)</phrase>, with whom I have had conversations since I assumed my position, outlined the history of the Stonehenge project when he made his statement to the House. It is not a matter of the DCMS playing second fiddle to the Department for Transport or any Department, but we must examine expenditure commitments responsibly across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/10">Considering what has happened over time to the proposal that was on the table for Stonehenge, the decision that was taken last week, sad and frustrating though it was to all of us, was right for the spending priorities of the Government as a whole. The money involved had grown beyond belief, and there were complications once people had started burrowing and examining the site. I think that the chalk underneath was the wrong type, and the site also had a high water table or something like that, which created greater costs. The cost had become intolerable, and it was much better to cut the plan dead so that we could start thinking creatively about alternative solutions, rather than to believe that we could find the necessary moneys. It was not a viable proposition, given competing demands for transport infrastructure. We reluctantly concluded that it was unaffordable, which meant that English Heritage's proposed visitor centre, for which it had got planning permission from Salisbury district council, could no longer proceed. The planning approval was contingent on the A303 road improvements. English Heritage will retain the land that it had intended to use for the visitor centre, close to Countess East, and it will have to review its future use.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/11">Costs have been incurred in the past 10 years, but looking back at the history of the matter, when the previous Secretary of State, Lord Smith, made his announcement as long ago as 1998, Sir Jocelyn Stevens, then chair of English Heritage, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/12" class="indent">&quot;It is now six years since the Public Accounts Committee described the visitor facilities at Stonehenge as 'a national disgrace'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/13">That takes us back, dare I say it, to previous Administrations. That is why people should not try to score political points on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.1/14">We recognise that the decision on the traffic management of Stonehenge will have implications for the whole south-west as well as for local residents. As part of our further work, we are exploring much smaller-scale measures to improve the traffic flow and safety on the relevant section of the A303. Decisions on funding improvements to other sections of the A303 to the west of Stonehenge are a matter for the south-west region, using its resources provided by central Government in the south-west's regional funding allocation for major transport schemes. We have deliberately decentralised that budget, which was the right thing to do so that people can take the most appropriate decisions at a regional level.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.238.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" colnum="238"  time="015:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0008.htm#07121856000513">
	<p pid="a.238.1/1">I stress again that I am not a Transport Minister, so I shall not reply to that kind of detailed question. Clearly, the decision was taken earlier that it was a major transport scheme and therefore could not be funded regionally. I said&mdash;I suggest that the hon. Gentleman reads the <i>Official Report</i><i></i>carefully&mdash;that it is possible that there will be small-scale measures to improve traffic flow. The Highways Agency will have some responsibilities in that regard, and I hope that there will be some collaboration with the Highways Agency on anything that it feels it has to do after further study. I hope that that, Together with a reprioritisation of the regional transport pot of money by SWERDA and its partners, will lead to a compromise solution that will enable us to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/2">Hon. Members know that one possibility on the table&mdash;the ideal solution, because it would not disturb archaeological sites elsewhere&mdash;is to close the relevant part of the A344 and use that site as the basis for creating a visitors centre. However, that solution would require everyone to come to the table, to compromise and to contribute. That is what we will try to achieve with the reconvened board. All of that must be subject to consultation in the usual ways. I stress again that consensus will be the only way forward, and that will depend on the county council, the local authority and others. Salisbury district council was invited to the meeting, but it told us that the date clashed with a full meeting of the council and sent its apologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/3">Our focus must be on where to go from here. In response to a question asked in the House by the hon. Member for Salisbury on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-10">10 December</phrase>, I announced that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, South, and I would jointly chair a meeting with key stakeholders, which we did&mdash;indeed, we had the first meeting that evening. Our goal is to deliver environmental improvements to Stonehenge, including new visitor facilities, in keeping with its status as a world heritage site by the beginning of 2012. In response to requests to report on that meeting, I will say that there was a real spirit of determination among those who were present to work together and bury the hatchet and to seek a consensual solution. We have set an ambitious timetable, but we will achieve what we want only if we work creatively and co-operate in the next phase. I cannot stress enough the importance of co-operation and I ask all those with an interest to support us in any way they can.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/4">We will, as the hon. Member for Salisbury noted, draw on the detailed investigations that have taken place over the years&mdash;it would be madness to try to reinvent the wheel. They will include the Stonehenge master plan, which was presented at the public inquiries for the A303 and the visitor centre, as well as the earlier plans that he mentioned regarding the location of the visitor centre. A central part of that work will be a review of the Stonehenge world heritage site management plan published in 2000, which my hon. Friend the Member for Telford mentioned. That plan has stood the test of time and much has been achieved since then, so we will use it as a basis from which to move forward, as the hon. Member for Salisbury suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/5">The overall vision still has long-term validity and many objectives need no change, including the ones that the hon. Gentleman mentioned&mdash;1 to 3, 11 and 18. We will, however, need to review how those objectives can be achieved. To make any significant changes to the world heritage site boundary, which I think he might have suggested, we would have to submit a new nomination to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, which would render our timetable impossible. Much though I would like to help him in that regard, we will not go down that route. I therefore seek a review that focuses on the parts of the plan that need to be changed as a result of the decision that was announced to Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/6">The process of considering those decisions will inform subsequent decisions on making improvements to the environment around the stones and, crucially, on the location of the new visitor centre. We will keep the UNESCO committee fully informed about developments; indeed, we have already written to advise it of our decision, and my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Transport is to write again. We will report further to the committee at the end of January 2008 and we will keep it informed as we review the management plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/7">Flowing from the revised management plan will be a new planning application and a new environmental statement, which we will publish. Work on that will involve exploring the case for closing the junction between the A303 and the A344, on which we must have a detailed assessment and public consultation. I look forward to co-operating with the hon. Member for Salisbury to ensure that that progresses as smoothly as possible, because on it will depend the need for a public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/8">We have wasted no time&mdash;we had our first meeting on the second working day after the announcement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>. At this stage, I cannot comment further on all the costs and funding streams, but I am determined that we will have a set of exciting proposals in the shortest possible time. That being the case, I am sure that the Heritage Lottery Fund will be very interested to hear about them, but as the hon. Gentleman knows, decisions on such matters are for the trustees of the fund and not for this House or the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/9">We have had a good debate in which I hope we have aired the issue in full. I think that we all share certain concerns and some disappointment regarding the current position. However, I trust that I have made it clear that the Government have a huge commitment as we move into the latest phase of delivering our goal, which must be to provide the right environment for Stonehenge in keeping with its world heritage status. We must do that in the shortest possible time, while adhering to proper procedures and public consultation. I ask all hon. Members for their co-operation throughout that process, and we shall report to the UNESCO committee for its meeting next July.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.1/10">With those comments, I wish hon. Members a happy and peaceful Christmas. I look forward to pressing ahead with this important work in the new year. There is a lot to be done and it is an enormous privilege for me to be associated with this important piece of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.0/1">With the leave of the House, Mr. Cummings, may I thank the Minister for the spirit in which she responded to this important debate? I hope she understands that we are aware that she has had to answer for the decision of another Department, which is what caused the rumpus, and that she will have a great deal of cross-party support as she seeks to achieve what she set out today.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/2">I reiterate how important it is that the machinery of government address the issue and resolve the problems facing the Minister. I come back to a point that I referred to earlier: there has been a breakdown in the machinery of government over much more than the past eight or 10 years. Indeed, it is more like 50 years, because it is 50 years since the first schemes were proposed for dealing with the roads around Stonehenge. As well as a disappointment, the present situation is an opportunity, and we should all view it in that spirit. The devil is in the detail, and we must all pledge ourselves&mdash;I certainly do&mdash;to seeking consensus on the way forward. With that, Mr. Cummings, I thank you for chairing this extremely important debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.241.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="241"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0009.htm#07121856000515">
	<p pid="a.241.2/1">One of the many historical quirks of my constituency is its policing structure. Whereas Britain as a whole is covered by only 43 local police constabularies, my constituency is served by two. The Westminster part is policed by the Metropolitan Police Service; the other&mdash;the famous square mile&mdash;is served by the City of London police. That leaves me in a relatively unique position to compare and contrast the workings of a large, lumbering, bureaucratic and, in recent times, politically tainted constabulary with a smaller, localised responsive and accountable force. Is it a coincidence that in my six-and-a-half years in Parliament, I have received not a single complaint about policing issues from any of my City of London constituents? For the fifth successive year, figures confirm that crime in the City has fallen.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/2">In recent years, there has been talk of change in London policing, and ideas about merging the City of London police with the Met have been bandied around. That must not happen. Far from being amalgamated into a bigger organisation, the City of London police should retain its independence, and I would argue that we should not stop there. I believe that the City force needs to be regulated as a template for policing to be emulated across the whole of London, and its model should be rolled out to ensure that all residents of the capital benefit from a responsive, localised and properly accountable police service.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/3">The City force has a unique role. It exists to ensure the safety and security of the City, not just for its 8,000 residents, but for the 300,000 people who arrive each day to work in the square mile and for the many tens of thousands who daily visit iconic sites such as St. Paul's cathedral and the Old Bailey. When Sir Robert Peel, the founder of modern policing in the late 1820s, set up a structure of policing in the capital, almost a quarter of London's population lived in the City; as a result, it was assigned its own police force, which was answerable, as it is today, to the City of London corporation. Meanwhile, the rest of the metropolis was served by a body that finally became the Metropolitan Police Service. The arrival of the steam train led to the emergence of the commuter, and the City of London rapidly depopulated. It is only in the past decade or so that that process has begun to reverse itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/4">The very distinctive demographics of the City demand a style of policing that is, in my view, very different from any other force. Businesses and residents in the City experience the very best of traditional British policing, alongside a technologically adept force with a wealth of experience in counter-terrorism and financial investigation. The constabulary may have a small geographical area physically, but it reaches across regional, national and even international borders as a widely recognised leader in policing global business.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/5">I have witnessed at first hand the force's effectiveness at street level. Only a few weeks ago, I joined the City of London's special constabulary on one of its busy Friday night shifts for a patrol of the square mile. The City has about 75 specials, which is 10 per cent. of the total complement. They form a team of dedicated volunteers who, in addition to their normal jobs, help to police the streets. The force has managed to utilise volunteers to make a real difference to policing and to provide an effective and visible presence on the streets. Despite the relatively small size of the specials' team, the variety in their work is probably the best national demonstration of innovative deployment and the use of a special constabulary. Rather than invest money in the relatively powerless paid community support officers, the City prefers to train its volunteers to a high level, providing them with the longest basic training period in the UK and the most intensive tutoring programme to get them to independent patrol status. That alone gives their regular colleagues the confidence to use them in a wide variety of roles, from policing high-security state occasions to cracking down on general street crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/6">Friday nights in the square mile have traditionally been quiet affairs, with the working population heading to the west end for after-hours entertainment. One could have argued, therefore, that the City force has an easy job compared with the Met, which regularly deals with alcohol-fuelled disorder, and not just in central London, but that is no longer true. In recent years, a large number of night-time bars and clubs have begun to open their doors within the City of London as well. Joining the specials on their neighbourhood patrol, I witnessed at first hand their quick response, their zero tolerance and their very visible approach to policing. The message that the force wants to send out is clear, &quot;Commit crime in the square mile and you will run into the law.&quot; On our patrol, even relatively minor crimes such as cyclists going through red lights, and drunks urinating in the streets or collapsing on the pavement, were followed up. Officers approached each person in a calm and civil manner; there was no aggression, and all those who were approached showed a willingness to co-operate. The specials also displayed and demonstrated incredible enthusiasm for their role. I have to say that the team was well resourced. There was a great spirit of camaraderie, with one volunteer officer telling me that he gets far more out of this part of his work with the City force than he puts in.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/7">The work of the specials feeds into the ward policing system in which constables play a vital role in ensuring that the concerns felt by local businesses and residents about public order and terrorism are fed directly into the force. The community beat officer system gathers local intelligence to ensure that wider policing resources are effectively targeted to local problems, with the ward constable acting as an approachable figure within the community. A notable success of that localised and visible approach to policing has been in the City force's ongoing work with St. Mungo's, the homelessness charity. The police initiatives with St. Mungo's have been especially important since the enlargement of the European Union in May 2004, which led to a large influx of migrants arriving in central London. Many migrants have secured jobs and homes in advance of their arrival, but a significant minority have not. They may choose to sleep on the streets because they lack money, or because they want to avoid spending their wages on the very high rents in the centre of London. Operation Poncho, which began in May, engages with people who are sleeping on the street. It checks their welfare and offers access to support services such as accommodation and alcohol and drugs rehabilitation. Since the start of that initiative, City of London police officers, in conjunction with their partner organisation and St. Mungo's, have assisted some 400 people with a history of rough sleeping.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/8">It is not just in tackling everyday crime and social disorder that the City force excels. Its economic crime unit has an enviable international reputation and boasts the largest fraud squad in Europe. It is regularly called upon to investigate crimes that arise nationally and internationally, and the high esteem in which the unit is held has clearly assisted in giving people confidence to report many alleged crimes. The City of London police's high degree of experience and expertise in the investigation of white collar crime has led to the Government granting it lead force status for fraud cases across the whole of south-east England. The economic crime unit has recorded exceptionally high detection rates&mdash;in the region of 80 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/9">In late 2005, when the Government announced that they were considering the reconfiguration of police forces with the aim of improving counter-terrorism activity and work against organised crime, there was great disquiet within the business community. There was a strong feeling that the City force had an extremely highly esteemed brand and that interfering with that winning formula could impact negatively upon the continued success of the UK's financial centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/10">In addition to its growing domestic role, the City force has also received funding from the Department for International Development for a new dedicated team to investigate allegations of overseas corruption. That international element to its work links into and complements the City's extensive experience of responding to terrorist crime. Having fallen victim to large-scale terrorist attacks in the square mile in the early 1990s, the City is an area that is uniquely prepared to deal with those who target our capital. Responding to the IRA's assaults of that decade, the City invested very heavily in state-of-the-art technology and restructured itself to tackle the major threat from terrorism. On my own tour of duty with the force last month, I was shown the City's control room and was astounded by the quality of technology at its disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/11">The force's network of cameras keeps a close eye on all the crime hotspots and entry points into the square mile. By co-operating with organisations such as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, the force can identify stolen, uninsured and untaxed vehicles within seconds and stop them before they leave the square mile within the few minutes it takes to communicate with patrol cars on the ground. That heavy investment undoubtedly helped the force's response to the July 2005 attacks by home-grown Islamic terrorists. When those attacks occurred, the City of London police was able to provide resources quickly at the Aldgate site, which is in my constituency, and even attached specialist officers to the Metropolitan Police Service for the subsequent investigations into all four terror attacks. In the following weeks, officers engaged in prolonged tours of duty owing to heightened security levels, but the impact on other criminal activity was minimal. The City's success in that area is proven by the fact that the square mile has continued to prosper as a leading financial centre, despite those ongoing security threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/12">The ability of the City of London police seamlessly to co-operate with other forces, such as the Met and the British Transport police, has enriched both its own work and that of its partners. It polices more than 1,300 ceremonial and public order events every year&mdash;about five every day&mdash;including all the state banquets held at the Guildhall, where the safety and security of visiting heads of state is in the force's hands. That requires the ability to co-operate with diplomatic protection, security services and traffic controllers. That ability and experience will no doubt be called on when the 2012 Olympics roll into town&mdash;an event for which the force is, rightly, already preparing.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/13">Given the importance of the City to a number of the Government's broader objectives, it is regrettable that all police authorities will receive grant floors of only some 2.5 per cent. for each of the next three years, apart from the City of London police. Unfortunately, despite working beyond its boundaries as a trusted, relied upon and frequently utilised resource, the City force is not financially rewarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/14">In the light of the current dispute over police pay, I must provide a voice for a force that offers the Government fantastic value for money, in contrast with what has increasingly become a politicised Metropolitan Police Service. At a time when the Met's senior officers are losing the trust and confidence of many Londoners, we witness the disturbing spectacle of the police threatening to renege on their no-strike agreement. I accept that the Police Federation has a legitimate grievance. The no-strike deal is the other side of the coin of the Government being bound by arbitration. Unfortunately, the Government have torn up their side of that deal, but I suspect that many Londoners will not take kindly to the threat of strike action, not least so soon after the Met closed ranks and accepted so little responsibility for the shooting of Jean Charles de Menezes and the systematic cover-up that followed that catastrophic episode.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/15">Within days of the shooting, I made my position extremely clear about the mendacious way in which various incorrect details were leaked to the press. We have still not had a full apology for that regrettable episode. I am not here to advise the Police Federation, but it should soft-pedal a little, because I suspect that much of the sympathy that the public at large have for the police is skin deep, and if it went ahead with strike action it would be disastrous for what I think is in principle a pretty good case.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/16">I believe that any plans to diminish the independence of the City of London police are unlikely automatically to result in service quality being maintained or improved. Indeed, many of the City's unique resources might be merged into a lumbering bureaucracy, with loss of the ability to react quickly and to co-operate simply. It is not only the City force's independence that we should cherish. I believe that we can learn important lessons from its effective law enforcement, which should be used as a template for policing in the capital and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.2/17">I would like the Metropolitan Police Service to be broken up into smaller, more locally accountable, manageable constabularies that properly serve the people of our capital city. In many ways, the spirit of the age has moved away from amalgamation to localised and democratically accountable control. That applies not only within London, but in the context of what I see with my own eyes in my constituency. There is a view in the political arena that we all believe in localism, and in this area it is crucial. Rolling out the City's model of localised and democratically responsible and visible policing will ensure that residents throughout London benefit from the same degree of excellence.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Cummings. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on the informed and measured way in which he made his case with clear historical research. I also congratulate him on the time that he spent with the specials, which is something that I have not yet had a chance to do. It sounds as though he had an interesting time, and it is always good for us in the House to get out and see what it is like on the front line.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">I agree wholeheartedly with the hon. Gentleman that the support of the City of London police, alongside the Metropolitan police, after the events of July 2005 was very welcome. His constituency and mine share a boundary, and many of my constituents were caught up in the Aldgate bombing. We were grateful for all help on that difficult day and those following.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3">I take issue with the hon. Gentleman's comments about police and community support officers, and will go into that in more detail. It is important to stress that they play a different role from that of special constables, who are volunteers. I am interested in the City's training programme, but police community support officers play a different role and, rightly, were introduced partly because of the plethora of popular neighbourhood wardens on the fringes of my constituency and his. For example, I once counted five different uniformed groups, including the police and neighbourhood wardens. Police and community support officers being trained alongside the police and working properly alongside them are doing very well. They also have the advantage of diversifying the Metropolitan police, particularly because they often provide a source of trainees and recruitment. I have met police community support officers who have gone on to become police constables.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.0/1">I thank the Minister for that reassurance. Clearly, the City of London police are not necessarily concerned about the Home Office but, more often, either directly about noises off from senior Metropolitan police officers or, potentially, at least this side of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-01">1 May</phrase>, about a Mayor of London who might in future look to flex his or her muscles on such issues. However, I take on board what the Minister said, and thank her for that reassurance.</p>

	<p pid="a.246.1/1">Mayors, Metropolitan police chiefs or whoever may flex their muscles, but, in the end, it will be a matter for the Home Office to decide, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman has taken my reassurances on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/2">The hon. Gentleman praised the efficient working of the City of London police, which I endorse, but suggested that it compares favourably with its larger neighbour. I take issue with that slightly because the Metropolitan Police Service faces a unique range of challenges and yet it scored two &quot;excellent&quot; ratings in its last police performance assessment, and was deemed to be improving in the resources and efficiency category. When the Metropolitan Police Authority was first established in 2000&mdash;I was a member of the London assembly at the time&mdash;I saw people leaving MPA meetings looking pale at some of the old-fashioned practices under which the Met worked, but we are now seeing improvements come through in those results.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/3">The hon. Gentleman also suggested that the City of London police provide a model that might be emulated in the policing of the rest of London, but it is worth highlighting some of the issues and arrangements within the Metropolitan Police Service. I do not agree with the prescription that the Met should be broken into smaller units as per the City of London model. London faces problems, particularly when it comes to more serious crime and the threat of terrorism&mdash;which he and I both mentioned&mdash;which need to be dealt with on a city-wide basis. It is noticeable that when it comes to the threat of major disorder, even the City of London police, which we agree is a good force, cannot always cope on its own and often must call in assistance from its bigger neighbour, the Met. Were the hon. Gentleman to carry out a detailed study, he might find that the management costs of the City of London police are rather higher than those of the Metropolitan police, which is the price that it pays for being a small independent force. There is nothing for nothing, and the City chooses to sustain that position with Government support.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/4">I agree that any police force must be responsive, localised and properly accountable. Borough command units and local neighbourhood policing mean that we are moving in the right direction on that. Of course, this Government created the MPA to give direct accountability to the Metropolitan police, perhaps having learned something from the City of London police. As I mentioned, safer neighbourhood teams are doing a fantastic job in every ward in London and we are seeing falls in crime. In my constituency, which neighbours the hon. Gentleman's, there have been considerable drops in crime in the past three years, thanks partly to that measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/5">Having said that, I expect the City of London police to remain independent, but that it will collaborate across force boundaries when necessary. I am pleased that the City of London police operate seamlessly with the Met and British Transport police to protect the public and businesses in London. Cross-border or pan-London events require such an integrated approach, which tests operational protocols that override territorial boundaries. Planning for major events such as the Olympics or the recent grand d&eacute;part of the Tour de France in London is carried out on a collaborative basis, and we all benefit from such cross-working. As I mentioned, we have seen good collaborative work on terrorism&mdash;the City of London police make a vital and unique contribution to counter-terrorism policing in the capital, which extends far beyond the square mile, and which will play an important role in major events such as the 2012 Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/6">Fraud and economic crime are key areas of work for the City of London police. The Government have recently provided some of the &pound;28 million of fraud review funds for the financial year 2008-09 to the City of London police. The force deals not only with those issues but some that resonate beyond the City boundaries, such as protecting the integrity and reputation of the world's most important financial centre. As the hon. Gentleman said, the force has carved out a role as a specialist in tackling economic crime, and has a well deserved reputation as a leading authority on it. The Home Office, in partnership with the City of London corporation, has provided additional funding to the City of London police force to enable it to fulfil a lead-force role in the investigation of serious and complex fraud, not only in the square mile but throughout the south-east of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/7">I recently met single points of contact on identity fraud who were interested in the work done in the City of London on fraud in general. Those people worked in different public organisations, including police forces up and down the country, and they welcomed the resource available to them on that specialist area.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.1/8">The additional funding has enabled the City force to increase the size of its economic crime department, and it has been able to take on more cases, including providing assistance to other forces in the south-east to investigate large, complex fraud that falls slightly outside Serious Fraud Office criteria, but which it is nevertheless important to investigate. That frees up officers in the provinces for other work, for which they might be better equipped.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.248.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="248"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0010.htm#07121856000522">
	<p pid="a.248.1/1">Given the time, I shall talk about some of the funding issues. We agree that the City is doing important work on a range of issues, for instance, in Operation Halo, the national cheque and credit card database, which links to other forces and the financial services industry. Operation Halo means that intelligence can be collated and analysed quickly and leads to targeted operations against criminals. More recently, Operation Archway, the national centre for gathering intelligence on the notorious boiler room fraud, by which innocent investors are sold worthless shares, is another example of the force's specialism.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/2">It is worth saying, in the time I have available, something on the funding settlement for the next three years, which was announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>. The unique status of the City of London police is well demonstrated by the settlement. Like every other force, the City receives a police grant from the Home Office; the House must approve the allocation that the Government will suggest in the new year&mdash;the hon. Gentleman will doubtless have the chance to raise his concerns at that time. However, the Government also provide funding to the other 42 forces in England and Wales through the revenue support grant. That provides the floors that ensure that every authority receives a minimum increase in funding. For the three years of the current comprehensive spending review, the floor is 2.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/3">For the City of London police, however, the extra support comes as part of the whole settlement for the City of London corporation to provide services such as education, social services, police, highway maintenance and so on. The corporation is treated as an education authority for the purpose of funding floors. This time, the floor for education authorities is 2 per cent., which is less than the police funding floor. In previous years, the funding floor has been higher for education authorities than for the police, which benefited the corporation. It is a case of swings and roundabouts: some years the corporation does well, but this year it receives slightly less. Clearly, the Government cannot change the City's classification as and when it suits. There have been jam years, but there have also been bread-and-butter years&mdash;this year is a bread-and-butter year for policing.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/4">It is for the corporation to decide how to allocate the funding with which it is provided between the services it supports. I have no doubt that the corporation values the service it receives from the City of London police and will provide the appropriate funding. Clearly, making the best use of resources is a requirement for any police force, so I am pleased to congratulate the City on scoring a &quot;performing strongly&quot; rating&mdash;the best possible&mdash;in the Audit Commission's annual survey of police use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/5">The City of London police play an important role. The force will continue as a separate and independent entity, although it will work with partners when required to do so. The force has a well deserved reputation on financial crime and is well equipped to meet the challenges ahead. Forces up and down the country will benefit from its expertise, for example, working alongside the Metropolitan Police Authority in areas in which it has competence. It has been a great pleasure to debate this matter with the hon. Gentleman, and I would be happy to talk further with him on the issue of special constables in the City of London, because there will be matters that we can consider more widely, such as how they are trained and how that might benefit others.</p>

	<p pid="a.251.0/1">That is an important point, to which I will return at the conclusion of my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/2">As Ministers will be aware, in 2004 the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture prepared a report on allegations of harm by removals staff. In all 14 cases on which it reported, it carried out medical examinations, but it also found that, beyond the 14 cases that it investigated, there were other allegations of harm occurring in detention. As a result of the examination of the 14 cases, the foundation found a pattern of abuse and it highlighted four main issues: the use of inappropriate and unsafe methods of force that carry a higher-than-acceptable injury risk; the use of force even after the removal attempt had been terminated, often out of sight inside escort vehicles; the continued use of force even after the detainee had been restrained, through the use of handcuffs for instance; and the misuse of handcuffing. The foundation's analysis suggested that gratuitous force was being used. In four of the 14 cases that it considered, the people disclosed that they had been tortured in their country of origin, suggesting that their psychological state would have been affected by that further abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/3">The Medical Foundation's report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The methods of restraint or assault described by the detainees include: being dragged along the ground, being kicked or kneed, being punched&mdash;including to the head and face, being elbowed, having the thumb forcibly bent back, pressure being applied to the angle of the jaw, pressure exerted on the neck, being sat on...and assault to the genitals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/5">It raised specific concerns about the misuse of handcuffs, which can lead to nerve damage. There was evidence that physical force was used after handcuffs had been applied, which is considered unnecessary and dangerous. There were also reports of verbal and racial abuse during deportation.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/6">The Medical Foundation recommended that an automatic medical examination should take place of any individual who is the subject of a failed removal attempt. That has not happened. It recommended that, for allegations to be investigated properly, the victim should be allowed to stay in this country to pursue any legal course of action. That has not happened. Most important, it recommended that those involved in the physical removal of failed asylum seekers must receive comprehensive training in the proper use of restraint techniques. That is one of the issues on which I shall press the Minister today.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/7">In 2005, a report by the Campaign Against Racism and Fascism and the National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns documented 35 cases of abuse during removals that had been referred to solicitors firms. Most of the 35 allegations were against Group 4 and Loss Prevention International&mdash;two private companies involved in those removals. The majority of the incidents took place on the way to or at the airport. The injuries included cuts, swellings and bruises, nerve damage from handcuffs, sexual assault, groin damage, cracked shoulders, fractured fingers, psychological problems and serious head injuries. Most recently, campaigners on this issue believe that there may be 200 allegations of abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/8">Let me talk about a particular case, which received some publicity. Beatrice is an asylum seeker from Cameroon who has a history of psychological problems and suicide attempts following the murder of her husband in Cameroon. She was taken from Yarl's Wood detention centre and put on a plane in handcuffs and leg bindings. She alleges that when she complained of feeling unwell, one officer said to her, &quot;If you do not go quietly, we will beat you.&quot; Another said, &quot;I'm very sorry, but I have to do it. If we don't bring you to Cameroon, they won't pay us.&quot; Her head was forced between her knees and covered with a jacket. An escort clamped his hand over her mouth and kicked her legs. When they arrived in Paris for a stopover, she saw two French policemen and tried to escape, but was tripped over. Two policemen held her down on the floor. As she struggled, she was kneed in the groin so hard that blood poured from between her legs.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/9">During the consequent flight to Cameroon, Beatrice suffered five panic attacks. When the plane arrived, a British policeman who happened to be on the flight, together with two other passengers, reported her to the Cameroonian officials because she seemed so unwell. When asked to walk unaided, she collapsed. She alleges that the escort team attempted to bribe the Cameroonian immigration officials to take her but they refused. She was eventually returned to Heathrow in a wheelchair and immediately taken to Hillingdon hospital, where she was treated for severe genital bleeding and multiple bruising. A psychiatrist said that she was &quot;traumatised by events&quot;. In October, an immigration judge ruled against the Home Office and released her on bail.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/10">I would like to think that that was an unusual case and that the officials involved have been disciplined or reprimanded in some way. I would like to hear from Ministers what has happened. Nobody, not even a failed asylum seeker, should be treated in that way. No woman should be treated in that way by people acting for a British Government. It is not necessary and it makes a mockery of our claims to be a country that subscribes to human rights and the various human rights conventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.251.0/11">The National Coalition of Anti-Deportation Campaigns, along with the organisation Medical Justice, is currently compiling a dossier of such cases. As I said earlier, they estimate that about 200 cases are known to various asylum rights groups, solicitors groups and visitors groups, and that number is by no means exhaustive. They passed 10 cases to <i>The Independent</i> newspaper, who reported on some of them. Three cases have been passed to the Home Office. The Home Office asked to see all 200 cases. However, I would say to Ministers that there are serious problems about passing cases on and the campaign groups involved are unwilling to do so without assurances that the victim's name will not be made public without their consent and that the victims will not come to any harm by the Home Office or its contractors.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point, which I will return to in my closing remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/2">I was making the point that, although the Home Office has asked for this dossier of 200 cases, there are difficulties in passing these cases on, because the victims are worried that they will come to harm if they report what has happened to them. However, the campaigning groups are trying to get permission from the victims to pass on the cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/3">The other issues that the campaigning groups have identified in reporting all these assaults, apart from the victims' fears, are difficulty with investigation, because the relevant CCTV footage would have been wiped; potential witnesses being dispersed; and difficulties in contacting those witnesses. There have been cases where witnesses of these types of assaults on planes have been intimidated by removals officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/4">Anne Owers, Her Majesty's chief inspector of prisons, has examined detention centres and one of the points that she made in a report last year was that we are dealing with failed asylum seekers</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/5" class="indent">&quot;as though they were parcels, not people, and as parcels whose contents and destination were sometimes incorrect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/6">In fact, there are more controls and checks on the removal of livestock from this country than there are on the removal of failed asylum seekers. Earlier, I spoke about the culture of targets and the contracting out of this removal service. Of course, among the problems of contracting out are the lack of accountability and the level of training.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/7">I am afraid that the annual report of the Border Immigration Agency's complaints audit committee sheds light on the fact that the Home Office is still not dealing with complaints in a systematic or fair way. This afternoon, I would like the Minister to respond to a number of points. First, when will they implement the recommendations of that committee? Secondly, what training do removals officers receive, particularly in safe methods of restraint? Thirdly, what are the specific targets that are given to private companies? For instance, in one of the cases that I have spoken about earlier, the officer involved said that staff would not get paid unless they removed the woman to Cameroon. So what are the specific targets that private companies are given and how do these affect their work? Fourthly, what is the follow-up of failed asylum seekers that are removed, to find out what happens to them and whether they are subject to violence? Finally, do Ministers have the figures on how many occasions airlines have refused to take failed asylum seekers because they are concerned about some of the scenes taking place on their planes?</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/8">So here we are, on the verge of the Christmas holiday. This is not the most cheerful of subjects and, as I said, it is not a subject that most of the public are too concerned about. However, it seems to me that, in trying to construct an immigration system that is firm and fair, the way that that system treats some of the most vulnerable people in it is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/9">Earlier in this Session, I used the opportunity of a debate in Westminster Hall to draw attention to the plight of children in detention. This afternoon, I want to ask the Minister to give the House some assurances that, just because somebody is a failed asylum seeker and they have to be forcibly removed, they will not be subject to abuse, violence and treatment that is unbefitting of a country that is meant to be a beacon of human rights in western Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>, who is my constituency neighbour, on securing this debate on this very important issue. Also, I welcome her strong support for firm and fair immigration control. I can pay testament to her reputation as a robust and effective constituency MP in dealing with immigration and other matters. Furthermore, because our offices inevitably collaborate on certain issues, I know that she has an excellent team of staff supporting her in her work.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/2">My hon. Friend raises a number of issues and I will do my best to respond to them in as much detail as I can in the time available. She raised issues generally about the allegations of abuse, particularly about private security companies and their work; about targets; about allegations of racist abuse and other abuse; and concerns from the airlines. As I say, I will try to cover all those points in the time available.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/3">I slightly take issue with my hon. Friend's suggestion that the removals are target-driven. Each case to decide whether someone has a right to an asylum claim is dealt with completely on its individual merits. The point at which someone is removed is when they have refused all attempts to require them to leave voluntarily. So they will have gone through the full legal process to determine whether their claim is valid in the first place. At the point at which their claim is refused, they always have the option, at any point, to go voluntarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/4">I am sure that, like myself, my hon. Friend has people in her surgeries who present themselves and ask for support to return. We have a very good voluntary returns programme. It was criticised in the media over the weekend for being too generous, but it is important to recognise that that programme enables people to leave voluntarily and is cheaper, quicker and affords people more dignity than if they are removed forcibly. It is important that we continue with that voluntary removal programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/5">The Prime Minister set a target to remove 4,000 foreign national prisoners this year, but that was a target for foreign national prisoners and I think that we would all agree that we need to remove people who are a danger to the country. If some of those individuals should resist removal, we have a right and a responsibility to tackle their resistance proportionately. We certainly cannot have a situation whereby just because somebody resists removal, they are able to stay. We will always pursue removal of those with no right to be here, but we would encourage them at every step of the way to seek a voluntary removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/6">In our last debate in Westminster Hall, my hon. Friend and I debated the issue of children in detention. I invite her to come and visit the scheme that we have begun just this month whereby we enable children and their families to live in a type of hostel environment rather than going into detention, in an attempt to encourage voluntary removal. I am sure that she would be interested to visit that scheme, either alongside myself or on her own, or indeed with my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration, who is due to visit shortly. She may wish to go along with him on that visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/7">It is important in this debate just to outline some of the challenges that are faced in dealing with removals. Clearly, there is going to be a core of people who are not keen to return to their home country and yet they have gone through every legal process and they no longer have a right to remain in the country. For the benefit of the House, I want to outline some of the measures that people resort to in order physically to resist removals. Such measures can start with passive resistance, but then move on to active fighting. They include refusing to leave the removal centre, refusing to board or leave escort vans, verbally or physically abusing escort staff, taking off clothing, defecating and spitting, and dirty protests in the holding room, on the vehicle to the airport or on the plane. Sadly&mdash;although it does not happen too often&mdash;parents have occasionally threatened to harm their children if placed on a plane.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/8">Such are the difficult challenges faced by those seeking to remove people. We all agree that they should not use inappropriate force, but they are dealing in many cases with quite difficult situations. My hon. Friend asked how many removals fail because airlines will not carry those being removed. Clearly, some of the protest methods that I listed, such as dirty protests and violence, would make it difficult for an airline to carry someone. Last year, 6 per cent. of removals ended in failure because of an airline's refusal to carry.</p>
	<p pid="a.254.0/9">There are issues, but we cannot allow someone to remain in the country just because they resist removal, as my hon. Friend will agree. We must ensure that proportionate measures are in place. She asked about training for people assisting removals. All are trained to prison service control and restraint standards as a condition of their employment. It is not a job that any of us, when elected to office, think&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.255.1/1">I shall have to write to my hon. Friend on the precise details, but I shall be happy to do so. If she ever wants to go along and see how that training works, we could certainly facilitate that. Detention custody officers have a difficult job. It is right to train them properly in that role, and it is right that they should be accountable. Whether or not they work for a private company, they are working for the public and the British Government, and it is important that they should be accountable. As my hon. Friend said, the complaints audit committee recently published a report. We need to deal with complaints systematically and fairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.1/2">To give some background, the complaints audit committee audits the process of removal as well as the Border and Immigration Agency in general. Individuals dissatisfied with service can go to the parliamentary ombudsman. Last year, more than 14,000 complaints were made about service, of which 112 were investigated by the ombudsman. Some 76 per cent. of those, or 85 complaints, were upheld. We have introduced changes to how we handle complaints&mdash;particularly in detention, which covers some of the people that my hon. Friend talked about&mdash;and improvements to how serious misconduct investigations into enforcement cases are handled. The CAC acknowledges them. We are also working to design a radical new complaints system, which will come online in February next year. Her comments are particularly welcome in that respect, and I promise to keep her updated on how it works once we unveil it in more detail.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.1/1">I am sure that we will see some improvements. I know that my hon. Friend will keep a close eye on the changes coming online from February next year and will, quite rightly, hold the Home Office and Government to account on the issue. I welcome that, because it is important that as well as being improved, the system is seen to be accountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.1/2">Any individual can register a complaint with the police if they feel that serious misconduct has taken place. I appreciate that the group of people that we are talking about might have difficulty reaching the authorities, especially if they are returned to their country of origin. That is why it is important that we improve the complaints procedure and log any incidents that arise.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-18a.256.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" speakername="Meg Hillier" colnum="256"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071218/halltext/71218h0011.htm#07121856000534">
	<p pid="a.256.3/1">I am delighted to tell my hon. Friend that only 10 days ago, I met the new case owners of all current asylum cases in the Border and Immigration Agency. Each case owner is assigned a few thousand cases to handle with their team, and will own each case from beginning to end. Each case in his constituency and my own, for example, will have somebody to take it through the whole assessment process. If the claim fails, that person will deal with deportation or voluntary return; if it is successful, they will take the applicant through to support for remaining in the community, ensure that they are established and so on. That will make a marked change.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.3/2">Like my hon. Friend, I have been frustrated as a constituency MP by the feeling that cases are often passed to completely different individuals, without any continuity. The change, which has been driven through by my hon. Friend the Minister for Borders and Immigration, arose from that frustration. I think that we will begin to see a change. I am happy to say that the cases were allocated last week, a week ahead of time, so the changes should come through our case loads and those of other hon. Members in the new year. I hope that that will make a difference to the individuals concerned, and we will get the continuity that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.3/3">In the time available, it is best that I concentrate on the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington raised about the so-called dossier of 200 allegations of abuse printed in <i>The Independent</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">5 October</phrase>. The chief executive of the Border and Immigration has requested the dossier from <i>The Independent. </i>We do not have it yet, but I am pleased to say that we have made some progress&mdash;we were told in early November that it would take about two months to prepare the dossier before it could be provided to the BIA. That is helpful. It is impossible without the full facts to investigate complaints and take the disciplinary action necessary in cases of abuse of position.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.3/4">I should also point out in relation to police complaints that although 58 allegations were made during the last 14 months that illegal or disproportionate force had been used during removal, the police found that none of those instances had a case to answer, on the basis that the use of force was both legal and proportionate. The BIA and private sector investigations have identified only one case of non-criminal lapses in escort behaviour resulting in minor disciplinary action in the past 14 months. We must get the issue in proportion. It is a challenging task, but we need evidence to take action against people who might be abusing the system. With the dossier of information, we will look into the matter in more detail. It is a shame that it has taken so long. As my hon. Friend rightly said, if we do not have the information to act quickly, things are much more difficult. Witnesses may be dispersed, or other individuals concerned may not consent to make information available.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.3/5">We must ensure that we have a robust system while recognising the challenges facing us. We are a little disappointed by the failure to produce the dossier at the point of publication. Having been a journalist, I would think that if something might lead to action, it is preferable to print it when it is possible for that information to get results, rather than having to delay for a total of three months from publication, or a quarter of a year, before we can investigate the matter. That is rather a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.3/6">We cannot discipline people without evidence. We look forward to the evidence, and we will act robustly and swiftly when we have cause to do so. I thank my hon. Friend for securing this debate. As ever, she has highlighted passionately and robustly the concerns shared by many Members. Importantly, she calls the Government to account for actions taken by us or agencies on our behalf. She is right to do so. I look forward to continuing to work with her. I hope that I can continue to provide her with reassurance in the information that I have promised. She is welcome at any point to visit a detention and removal centre, or indeed the Kent project, if she wishes.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.3/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.3/8" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
