<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-07a.147.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="147"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070607/halltext/70607h0002.htm#07060791000308">
	<p pid="a.147.0/1">I wish to declare my interests, as one should, at the beginning of my contribution. First, I am the honorary president of the British Resorts and Destinations Association. Last night, I spoke at its annual conference in Eastbourne, where it was sunny. Secondly, I am the convenor of a group of Labour Back-Bench Members of Parliament who represent seaside and coastal towns. The group was formed shortly after the 1997 election, as you are aware, Mrs. Anderson, because of our belief that seaside and coastal towns had things in common. Thirdly&mdash;and, of course, not least&mdash;I am the MP for Blackpool, South. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> is unable to be here today because she is on a Select Committee visit. She and I work closely together on all the issues that affect Blackpool, and I am sure that, if she were here, she would echo many of the things that I hope to say this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/2">I praise the Select Committee and its Chairman, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>, for producing an excellent and outstanding report. To those of us who represent seaside and coastal towns, many of the issues that the report covers will not come as bolts from the blue, but the singular value of the report is in bringing all the specific characteristics and challenges together in a succinct way and with the full authority of an informed and thoughtful Select Committee. The report is an important contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/3">I was pleased, but not at all surprised, that the Select Committee included in the report many if not all the problems that Blackpool and many other coastal towns face. Some of them have already been mentioned: the skewed demography, the outward movement of young people, and the need for stronger care structures for vulnerable and elderly residents, which is a big issue that needs to be addressed. Certain resorts have a reputation for attracting retired people, but all coastal and seaside resorts attract a significant number of people who are retired or are about to retire. When they move to seaside and coastal resorts, they often think that there will be many years of happiness and security ahead of them, and for many, pray God, there will be. But if illness or accident come along, or if one partner loses the other, those people are often deprived of the natural supports of family and familiar social networks that they would have had had they stayed in the places that they came from originally. Therefore, apart from the number of care homes and the other issues to which my hon. Friend alluded, seaside and coastal towns attract significantly higher burdens in that respect, and the funding formula and the Government in general would do well to pay attention to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/4">Transience has been mentioned. It is a great challenge for local authorities. I believe that sometimes the sophistication of the problem is not entirely understood, particularly in relation to education. For example, I can think of two or three schools in the centre of my constituency for which turnover on the roll can be anything between 40 and 50 per cent. in a year. It is not just a question of people coming into the town&mdash;families coming to Blackpool or escaping economic pressures elsewhere and so on&mdash;but of families moving within Blackpool. I know from my advice surgeries and from cases that have been raised with me that some families in Blackpool move three or four times a year to get access to relatively low-cost accommodation in the rented sector, which, sadly, is sometimes of relatively low quality as well. That creates additional burdens. The impact of transience was well documented in a series of reports that Janet Dobson and her colleagues at University college London did some years ago under the sponsorship of the Department for Education and Skills. The report deals very well with the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/5">Housing is a major problem. If we pick up our papers today, we see alarmist reports about what will happen to the cost of housing in years to come and how difficult it will be for first-time buyers to get on the ladder. I pay particular tribute to the Select Committee for having the sophistication to recognise the dual problem in seaside and coastal towns. House prices have been driven up very high in seaside towns that are attractive and where regeneration has taken place. However, areas with former bed and breakfasts that have officially or unofficially become houses in multiple occupation, for the reasons given by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West, have remained areas with low-cost rented accommodation that is often of poor quality. Those twin pressures do not do seaside and coastal towns any favours. I am glad that Blackpool council, with the support of the Government, has begun to license HMOs. The Government acknowledged the problem in their response to the report, but a great deal more needs to be done about it. The situation will only get worse, not better.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/6">As for tourism, again, I do not want to repeat many of the things that I and other colleagues have said continually since 1997 to a succession of Ministers, but the historical reliance on tourism for jobs and inward investment, certainly in a town such as Blackpool, cannot be expected to produce change or renewal overnight. An analogy that I have used before can be used to describe the problem faced by all of us who represent seaside and coastal towns. After Suez, Dean Acheson said that Britain had lost an empire but not yet found a role. That is true, although perhaps not in quite such a bleak way, of many seaside and coastal towns. We have lost the empire of the standard one or two-week family holiday.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/7">It is not true to say that seaside towns have not yet found a role; they are all in their various and vibrant&mdash;some more vibrant than others&mdash;ways trying to find alternative roles, but it is not an easy path. I will briefly illustrate that with some facts about Blackpool. One of the great advantages of being the MP for Blackpool is that everyone has an opinion about it&mdash;it is not like representing some melange dreamt up by the boundary commission. Blackpool experienced one of the biggest, if not the biggest explosion of investment in working-class holidays and infrastructure in the late 19th and early 20th century. Our experience of the legacy and the downside of that is therefore significant, which is one of the reasons why Blackpool is currently ranked as the 24th most deprived authority area out of 354 nationwide, why between 1987 and 2003 visitor numbers dropped from 13.2 million to 10.6 million, and why about 11 per cent. of Blackpool's population is classed as transient.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/8">I am grateful for the comments on the evidence given to the Committee by Blackpool council as it means that we have not simply cried into our beer. I see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1837" name="Barbara Follett">the Member for Stevenage (Barbara Follett)</phrase> in her place; and she will be pleased to know that I will not go into a long account of Blackpool's attempt to secure a super-casino&mdash;although I am tempted. That process and campaign demonstrated that it was not just about getting a super-casino, but about everything that Blackpool has done with its master plan, its sea defences and the investment that has gone in. Much of that was directly a result of Government investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/9">What can regeneration do? What should we expect the Government, local authorities or regional development agencies to do in terms of regeneration in response to the Committee's excellent report? I hope that most hon. Members agree that the success of a community in a seaside or coastal town depends on addressing the needs of visitors and residents equally. We should take account of the needs of visitors, who are in many cases still the economic bread and butter of a town, as well as the needs of residents. In Blackpool there has sometimes been a history of friction and tension between those involved in the tourist industry in the town, who thought that enough could never be done for tourism, and those residents who were not involved, who thought that far too much was done. I am glad that that tension has largely disappeared in Blackpool during the past 10 to 15 years. Regarding the need to have a joint enterprise, there is a great sense of commonality between those who are involved in the tourism sector and those who are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/10">It must also be recognised that investment in infrastructure is important, which the Committee has made clear. Another important factor is the economic motor in a seaside or coastal town. Money may be spent on infrastructure, but if there is not an economic force in the town&mdash;a vibrant activity, entrepreneurship or source of job creation&mdash;the infrastructure that is designed to attract tourists will not in itself lead to regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.0/11">Tourism infrastructure will also not solve the problem of transport, which is a key issue in seaside and coastal towns. The report has alluded to that, but on the whole Governments of all parties have not focused on the transport needs of seaside and coastal towns. We are grateful to the Government for the first tranche of investment in our tramway, but we are still waiting for a definitive solution on transport. Hastings is a classic example of a south-coast town that does not benefit from good links to London, either by rail or by road. Such peripherality issues cannot be left solely to regional development agencies to deal with; they have own priorities and pressures. An element of central Government intervention or response is needed.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.0/1">Internal transport in Blackpool may leave a little to be desired, but getting to Blackpool is relatively easy. Getting to towns in south-east England that are on the south coast is a nightmare, whether it is Hasting or, in my case, Worthing. The density of housing that is being imposed on us means that transport will become an increasing nightmare. Never mind the gridlock that we have in our towns; getting into the towns, and getting corporate investmentinto the towns is a complete nightmare. The quality of life for residents trying to get back to their homes, particularly in south-east England, is also a problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.153.3/1">My hon. Friend and I entered the House of Commons at the same time, so we have become accustomed to these little tricks over the years. He is entirely right about that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.3/2">I was going on to say that we are about to have a change of Government, without a general election,so I am hoping that we may get some action on the33 recommendations in the Select Committee report. The Minister for Local Government is not here to respond to the debate, but he and I have had several meetings about the challenges that we face in Southend. I am in a reasonably good position to judge what it is like to represent a coastal town, as compared with a new town. Representing, as I did, a new town with a development corporation and a new towns commission was as if I had won the pools. There was investment there all the time. However, having moved to a seaside town I am, not to use too much of a pun, awash with challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.3/3">I do not want to stir things up too much, but I still regard Southend as the finest seaside resort in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, it has some real challenges, among which is the fact that 20,000 people were left off the census. I had meetings with the census organisation and the Minister, and was given tea and sympathy, but has anything changed? Absolutely not. It will not change until the next census when some of my constituents, and even I, may have passed on to another place. Who knows? The impact of losing funding for 20,000 people has devastated the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.3/4">It was wonderful that the Chancellor could give everyone free bus passes. Sadly, in Southend that is of no use because we do not have too many buses. As a result of unitary authority status we had cuts of &pound;7 million one year and &pound;5 million the next.</p>

	<p pid="a.155.1/1">My hon. Friend has his ear closer to the ground than I do. However, I think that the Chamber has heard him. The battle must now be joined.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/2">Many coastal towns with aspirations, such as Southend, cannot afford to promote themselves through the VisitBritain scheme or to appear in its brochure, in which the towns that pay the most money get the best slot and pictures. Now that we have a global market, I hardly need to illustrate the enterprise of various countries, such as Qatar, which has realised that its oil resources will not last for ever and recently has invested&pound;40 billion in tourism. I think that despite having so much to offer, Britain cannot be a lead competitor in the tourism market without increased funding. Indeed, if we are going to talk about wasting money, we must highlight the logo for the Olympic games. I am one of the lead enthusiasts for the games, but I do not think that the logo is worth while.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/3">The report considered diversification, with which I agree entirely, and touched on employment opportunities in Southend. This was another blow to Southend: we were called to a meeting with colleagues at the Treasury and found out that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs will be sized down. Where will cuts be made? In Southend!</p>

	<p pid="a.156.2/1">Like other Members who have spoken today, I pay tribute to the work of the Select Committee. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> who has over the years lobbied Ministers along with other Labour MPs representing coastal towns and seaside resorts.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/2">I shall try to start with the positives. Cleethorpes itself is a small part of my constituency, but the name conjures up an image of saucy seaside postcards and end-of-the-pier shows. Blackpool, Southend and other coastal towns and resorts also have that image, which is still stuck in many people's minds. That perception is detrimental to the development of our economies. Nevertheless, coastal towns have a lot going for them, and I do not think that we talk them up enough. Cleethorpes has about four and a half miles of sandy beach, although unlike Southend, we probably have the stumpiest, shortest pier on the east coast. It used to be considerably longer, but for some reason, after the second world war, the War Office decided to blow up most of it&mdash;I think that the office thought that that was a matter of national security. So we were left with the pavilion, but no pier attached to it. The timbers were then sent to Leicester, I think, to rebuild its bomb-damaged football ground. At least we managed to help out there.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/3">On any sunny Sunday bank holiday, Cleethorpes remains the playground of south Yorkshire. People from Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster all head to Cleethorpes, so it remains vital to day trippers. People still spend holidays there. We have the wonderful, listed Humberstone Fitties chalet park, which is enormously popular, as well as some very large caravan sites. However, the core of the tourism economy is now day trippers from south Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/4">As others have said, there is a lot of entrepreneurship in coastal town resorts, and there have been new developments on our seafront&mdash;restaurants, coffee bars and other such facilities. We even have our own boutique hotel. The coastal light railway has been expanding; in the 10 years in which I have represented the area, the railway has expanded year on year&mdash;it is probably the only railway in Britain about which that could be said during that time&mdash;run on time and been very cheap. The track is being extended into the theme park in Cleethorpes. A new cinema was opened recently as well. Until a few years ago, there was no cinema. Given British weather, it is absolutely outrageous that the resort had nowhere inside where visitors could go if it rained. Good things are happening, but they are happening in spite of the Government. We are seeing this development only because of action taken by some very determined, single-minded visionary people in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/5">Cleethorpes has another wonderful attraction: the meridian line runs straight through the resort. Cleethorpes is 9,919 miles from the south pole and143 miles from London, but frankly London might as well be 9,000 miles away given the understanding of some Departments of what is going on in seaside resorts. The last calculations that I looked at estimated that about 2,000 people work in the tourism economy in Cleethorpes. However, as the Select Committee and others have mentioned, there are serious problems. There is physical and social isolation in the area&mdash;it is true to say that we are at the end of the line. The railway stops there. The A180 stops at the outskirts of Grimsby, and from there to Cleethorpes there is one huge traffic jam as people try to get into the resort. The A46, which comes up from Nottinghamshire, is a dual carriageway to Lincoln and from there it is an ordinary road. That creates further problems. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> will understand those problems; some of those who go to Boston and Skegness travel the same route. Those transport problems are quite serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/6">On the question of the skewed demographics, as in other coastal areas, young people want to move out&mdash;particularly talented young people. They do not see a future for themselves there, so if they are bright, they move. There is therefore a much lower than average number of 18 to 44-year-olds. There is also a larger number of elderly people in the constituency, and as other hon. Members have mentioned, many of them do not have family and social networks there, whether because they moved to the area to retire as it is by the seaside or because younger members of the family, seeing no future in the area, have moved out. We therefore need to consider loneliness and social isolation as well, which naturally impact on the Department for Work and Pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.2/7">Apart from the outward migration of young people, most residents who remain in the area are manual workers. The number of unskilled and semi-skilled workers is much higher than the national average. In the 2001 census, Cleethorpes came fifth in the UK for people in lower supervisory jobs and 37th for semi-routine jobs&mdash;routine is the term now used for unskilled jobs. As for professional, managerial and technical jobs, the numbers were negligible. That skewed demographic profile impacts across the board in an area, including politically. In the part of Lincolnshire to which I am referring, there has never been Government investment in a Government agency to bring white-collar jobs to the area. I would love to see that; other areas such as Blackpool have it.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.0/1">A number of hon. Members would still like to speak, but if Members restrict their speeches to less than 15 minutes, we should just about manage about to get everyone in. I am sure that hon. Members want to give the Minister plenty of time to respond.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.1/1">I am sure that as a former Tourism Minister, you must be tempted to intervene in this debate, Mrs. Anderson. I hope that the Minister will respond to the last point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1504" name="Shona McIsaac">the hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac)</phrase> by commenting on the fair proportion of the &pound;20 billion that is set aside for regeneration. If we get that sort of news at the end of the day, it will be very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/2">The report has clearly got people talking seriously about coastal towns. As Oscar Wilde said, there is only one thing worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about&mdash;and we are certainly being talked about. We have been talked about on &quot;You and Yours&quot; and on a Trevor McDonald show that I caught, on which the Select Committee report featured prominently and Southport was shown quite favourably. Few Select Committee reports make it on to Trevor McDonald's show.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/3">Apart from the profile of this issue having been raised, I question what other results there have been. The Government's response has been disappointing, and that disappointment has been echoed by organisations such as British Resorts and Destinations Association, which has commented on it. To be fair to the Government, however, they have had some sort of conference and have given support to deprived wards in particular areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/4">Dogging the Government's thinking&mdash;and, to some extent, the Select Committee's&mdash;has been the question of what thematic solutions apply right across the piece for all coastal resorts. Both the Committee and the Government recognise that there is a great variety of seaside resorts, which might be why they both rejected the idea of an individual, dedicated seaside or coastal fund. That is not a bad tack to take, because seaside resorts differ enormously in size&mdash;one could compare Brighton and Whitstable in that regard. One might also compare Southport and Whitby in terms of accessibility, Blackpool and Bournemouth in terms of current economic success and Hastings and Cromer in terms of types of economy. The housing profiles, resident bases and educational opportunities in those towns all differ.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/5">The report makes a fair case to suggest that thereare generic problems that are solved more or less adequately in different places. Some problems might not be universal and might be a consequence of the fact that the towns concerned are seaside towns. Although such problems might not be totally peculiar to seaside towns, the fact that the towns are by the coast is the prime cause of those problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/6">The fundamental thing that goes against all coastal towns is that they are not in the middle of a radial catchment area&mdash;50 per cent. of what their residents look at is sea and fish, if they are lucky enough to have fish in the sea off their coast. That has two important consequences: it often affects the location of public investments, such as hospitals, which should arguably be in the middle of dense population centres, and it affects the location of private investment, because industrial and commercial operators look hard at the catchment area for any investment that they make. Those highly desirable public and private facilities, which are good for any town, often follow commercial and public service models and are set up in centres of population. Most coastal resorts are not centres of population in that sense, so they face problems in keeping public facilities and attracting inbound investment apart from leisure investments, from which they have had particular success.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/7">Coastal towns are invariably at the end of a transport link, on which they are highly dependent. Those links are often appallingly inadequate, given the nature of the economy, the demands of citizens and so on. A lot of seaside resorts grew up in the railway age. In many cases, the railway is either no longer there or no longer useful, so those towns are left with a somewhat inadequate road. It frustrates local councils and local people when their perfectly reasonable pleas for better communication are dismissed because their towns do not happen to be regional priorities or because the funding is simply not there.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/8">Although we complain, the coast remains extraordinarily attractive, which is a big plus. At times, there is an enduring call to all human nature to go to the coast. Unfortunately that call is seasonal and, sometimes, it is to the coast of the Mediterranean, the Iberian sea or elsewhere, which leads to all the problems that we have discussed. Employment fluctuations have always been there to some extent in seaside resorts.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/9">There is an element of decline in many resorts, and there is the problem of spare capacity. Accommodation that was once for visitors who stayed some time is now sometimes filled with benefit clients and the like. We saw a good deal of that in Margate, where we saw the problems that it is experiencing. Not every resort has such problems, however. I was told the other day&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase> will confirm this&mdash;that Southend has a university, so many places that might formerly have been occupied by holidaymakers are now occupied by students. That solution is not available to many other seaside towns.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/10">There are other problems that are consequential on being a seaside town but are not a necessary consequence, which to some extent invalidates the Government's response. The Government have dismissed some of the Select Committee's findings by giving general statistics. They suggest that economic fluctuations in employment are not very different from those that one might find in many inland towns. If one aggregates the figures for all seaside towns, including those for the really successful ones such as Brighton, I am sure that one can come up with some such stat, but some seaside towns that are in decline are severely affected by precisely the problems that we have identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/11">The Government should also concede&mdash;I do not think that they have hitherto&mdash;that because of the environment of coastal towns, they attract a large number of retired or otherwise economically inactive people, which puts an additional burden on social services departments. That is insufficiently recognised, which has been the case for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/12">The fundamental point, which we all want to address, is that to solve the problems as they crop up in coastal towns, we need central Government, RDAs, transport and health authorities and policy makers in general to recognise that there are generic problems and problems that are peculiar to, or typical of, coastal towns. Such problems do not necessarily have a single solution&mdash;it is not a case of casinos all round for everything to come right&mdash;but there are good solutions for most resorts that have not gone too far down the path of decline. However, those solutions cannot be implemented without a degree of sensitivity from the policy makers.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/13">The Committee Chairman made the point, albeit in a less full-frontal manner than I will, that solutions cannot be implemented without a certain amount of tough political leadership locally, and another member of the Select Committee also made that point. The management of change in a seaside resort, or anywhere else, is fairly tricky, because one is dealing with a volatile political environment. We have only to look at the local election results in&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;Blackpool, Torbay, Bournemouth and Eastbourne to see what a volatile political environment it is. Seaside towns are difficult places in which to manage change.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/14">One of the most discouraging events that the Committee witnessed in the south-west happened when we went to Exmouth. We found that it had solutions to its problems, but zilch political leadership to deliver any of them, so it was in a state of paralysis. There has to be an absence of paralysis, and there has to be dynamism and a vision of how the resort will regenerate. The community and the other agencies have to buy into that vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/15">Support from other agencies is not always as helpful as it might be. VisitBritain was mentioned earlier. On a trip to France with the Select Committee, I picked up a brochure entitled &quot;Guide to the North-West&quot;. I looked to see whether my resort was mentioned in glowing colours, and I found that it did not feature on the map, although the squirrel reserve half a mile down the road did. Some mills in Oswaldtwistle that I had never heard of&mdash;I had never actually heard of Oswaldtwistle&mdash;were also mentioned. I was deeply puzzled, as I am when I go abroad and find that London, Stratford-on-Avon and bits of Scotland are the only things to which foreigners who come here are generally directed.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.1/16">Regeneration is a difficult business, and it is a rollercoaster ride for anyone who embarks on it. A major regional attraction will open this month in my resort. It will be called Splashworld, and I am happy to put in a plug for it here. As I go back to my resort, I shall see cranes around the town, which testify to the building of new hotels, a conference centre and so on. I do not share the views of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> about Blackpool Pleasure Beach, which last year, cynically, stupidly and in trust-destroying fashion closed its Pleasureland operation in Southport, leaving the site semi-vandalised. Within weeks, there will be renewed activity on that site and international marketing of a prime opportunity. I seek to bring home the fact that for most towns, seaside regeneration is struggle. It is a tough ride, but I hope that the report will help people to go on that journey.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-07a.167.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="167"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070607/halltext/70607h0005.htm#07060791000336">
	<p pid="a.167.4/1">I, too, apologise for missing the first few minutes of the excellent speech by the Chairman of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>. I did not intend to speak in this debate, but I have been urged to do so, not in order to join the voices of those Parliamentary Private Secretaries who want to dish it to the Government, but to make some observations arising from the various points that have been raised. I was late because I was with the representative of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, but that does not outdo meeting the President of Namibia<i>&mdash;[Interruption.]</i> I believe that he has a bit more money than Namibia.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/2">I do not want to outdo colleagues, but Worthing has the oldest population in the world, if not the universe&mdash;4.6 per cent. of Worthing's population are not just pensioners, but are over the age of 85. I recently went to 106th birthday party&mdash;not quite 116&mdash;and was regally entertained with the largest glass of sweet sherry that I have ever had in my life, and some interesting entertainment. I thought that people came to Worthing to die, and then forgot, and that the apocryphal graffiti at Victoria station says, &quot;Dover for the continent; Worthing for the incontinent.&quot; I shall not go into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/3">The serious point is the enormous pressure on the local infrastructure, particularly the health service. I shall not repeat health debates, but in south-east England the pressure that older people place on the health service is considerable. A 75-year-old requires twice as many visits to or from the doctor as a 65-year-old, yet the captitation payment in the health service does not acknowledge the additional age-related costs. The older population is disproportionately concentrated in seaside resorts, particularly along the south coast in Bournemouth, Worthing and the coastal resorts of Kent.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/4">The references to Margate are interesting, and I see from the Select Committee's report that the Committee visited Margate. I am delighted that the serious problem of looked-after children being dumped there was also mentioned. I made a speech about that this morning at a conference on looked-after children. Disadvantaged children who have had traumatic experiences are often dumped at the opposite end of the country from the place they are used to. That does them no favours, and they are often left to run riot.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/5">A couple of years ago, a chief inspector in Worthing told me that 28 per cent. of his crime figures for one month related to half a dozen children in independent children's homes&mdash;we now have 10 such homes in Worthing. The problem was not necessarily the individual homes, but the effect of clustering them. If the children are not properly looked after, it is not fair to local agencies or the police who must pick up the problems, or to local residents who must suffer the problems. Most of all, it is not fair to the young people whom we have already failed to fail them again by putting them in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/6">I quoted Lord Utting earlier because many years ago, back in the '90s, he produced a report saying that young people who go into the care system should remain as close to home as possible, unless there is a good reason for them to be given a completely clean break and taken to a place of safety away from traumatic family experiences, and that preferably they should have kinship care. I have visited independent homes in my constituency, which often offer good-quality service, but children from inner-city London, Somerset and other urban towns are dumped in seaside coastal resorts or rural areas in West Sussex, and are like fish out of water. The experience is disorienting for them and we are doing them no favours.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/7">That happens in many coastal resorts, such as Margate, although I read a little while ago that because of the perceived problem with hoodies, whom we love dearly, a group of pensioners in Margate had got together&mdash;they were dubbed the gangster grannies&mdash;and went around wearing hoodies so as to make the wearing of them so uncool that young people would not want to wear them to make themselves seem intimidating, which is interesting counter-intuition.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/8">Another problem in coastal towns, certainly in Worthing, is identity crisis. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said, they are often towns that grew up because of railway links, and they prospered because they followed the success of Brighton's royal patronage. Worthing became an alternative to Brighton, and coastal towns became upmarket seaside resorts, but were later often hit by poorer times. Some places, such as Cleethorpes and Blackpool, served as holiday resorts for midlands industrial towns where everyone took their holidays at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/9">What are those towns now? In the age of low-cost flights, when it is cheaper to fly to Torremolinos than to take the train from London to Brighton or from Leeds to Cleethorpes, their role is not so clear. Are they still seaside resorts with a future? I believe that they have a future, but the competition is far greater. Are they retirement towns? In places like Worthing, there is clearly a dominance of people who have retired there, and they are often incoming retirees. Many people retired to Worthing from Essex because they went to Worthing for their holidays when they were children, and then retired to the south coast that they knew. However, nearby towns in my constituency&mdash;Shoreham and Southwick&mdash;consist of people who have lived there for generations. There is a great contrast in the populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/10">Are coastal resorts business towns? For three years running, Worthing had the extraordinary accolade of being the most profitable town in which to do business in the United Kingdom. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> and I are at a loss to work out how that was calculated. We think that because GlaxoSmithKline has a large division in Worthing its worldwide profits were predicated into the calculations; thus, Worthing turned out to be the most profitable town. However, we have a thriving business community, as does Brighton&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">the hon. Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> mentioned that. Are the south-eastern coastal towns business towns, or are they on the fringes as commuter towns? I do not know the answer. Many local people&mdash;Worthing is not atypical in this respect&mdash;really do not know the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/11">Some towns have been very successful. A few years ago, some coastal towns, such as Brighton and my birth town of Eastbourne along the coast, got together to work out what they wanted their identity to be. With the council, the chamber of commerce, business, the hotel industry, and the movers and shakers they decided that they wanted to be upmarket conference towns, for example, and appealed to the conference business. A common theme among many coastal towns is an identity crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/12">I agree that many coastal towns need strong leadership and someone to bring together strong local movers and shakers to take them forward, out of the time warp in which many of them have been stuck. That can be done, but it needs Government support. They do not need the Government to lead the way, but they need the Government to provide support. The Government have been good at identifying areas of social exclusion in inner cities and sometimes the rural poor, but coastal towns have missed out, and they need help because of their special circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/13">I would guess that all our constituencies&mdash;we have heard this today about coastal towns&mdash;have enormous contrasts between neighbouring wards. In my constituency, I have wards that are in the top 10 per cent. in terms of deprivation next to wards that are of average or just above average affluence. Depending on how the geographical boundaries are drawn, if the two are bunged together they come out as having an average rate of poverty or affluence, so some pockets of poverty are overlooked, which masks the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/14">Places such as Worthing, Brighton, Hastings and Cleethorpes used to be fishing towns, but the fishing fleets have gone. We did not see the money that was supposed to help them out, but the last vestiges remain of what used to be prosperous fishing towns. Shoreham harbour in my constituency is the closest cross-channel harbour to London, but reflects only a shadow of its former glory in years gone by.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.4/15">There is a problem, particularly in the south-east coastal areas, with transport. When I go to Blackpool for party conferences, the journey by car is swift, and travelling within Blackpool to one's hotel is not too bad. However, travelling to Worthing, Eastbourne, Brighton, Chichester and Hastings by road can be a nightmare. The train service to Brighton is a good one, but as soon as one arrives at the south coast and turns right, it becomes a nightmare. I have many big manufacturers in my constituency, including GlaxoSmithKline, British Oxygen and B&amp;W Loudspeakers, but a place at the end of a line where there are very poor road infrastructure links surrounded by residential areas is not obviously the best place to run a manufacturing business.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-07a.170.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" speakername="Tim Loughton" colnum="170"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070607/halltext/70607h0005.htm#07060791000338">
	<p pid="a.170.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has had10 years to do something about it, but let us not go there, because we have built up a cross-party consensus in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/2">Transport to many coastal towns, and particularly to the south because of the population density, is not good. When we in the south-east are told that the region stretching from Milton Keynes&mdash;the constituency of the Chairman of the Select Committee&mdash;to Dover, the Isle of Wight, Sussex, Berkshire and so on, which is amorphous and incohesive, is to be the powerhouse of the European economy, and that central Government must impose housing development on us, many of us have reservations. However, everybody will have reservations if we do not have the infrastructure to support that development.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/3">The number of new houses that my constituency is being forced to take is ridiculous given the geographical limitations of the sea to the south and the downs to the north. We simply do not have the spaces for those houses, and we certainly do not have the infrastructure for getting to and from them, let alone to and from the companies for which the people living in the houses are supposed to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/4">We are dealing with a double-edged sword. The A27 is probably the biggest car park in the south of England. One can drive from Newcastle all the way down south on dual carriageway or motorway until one reaches my constituency when it changes into single-file traffic on a major trunk road. It is crazy putting more and more cars arising from the extra house building on to that road; it is a double-edged sword. Our biggest weapon for combating inappropriate further developments at the foot of the downs is by saying that the roads cannot sustain them. That is the biggest factor enabling us to reject some of the developments on appeal. However, we want infrastructure, investment and everybody to have a good quality of life, so that they can retire to Worthing or bring up their families in Worthing, Shoreham or another town in East Sussex.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/5">Brighton is a thriving place and a big town of 250,000 people, but it has its problems. I visited a Brighton school that was dubbed the third worst in Britain a few years ago. At the school, which is in a particularly depressed part of Brighton called the Whitehawk estate, there is some really good stuff going on, and an entrepreneurial headmaster is bringing about change. Brighton is the drugs capital of the United Kingdom, and there has been a great deal of downside to its prosperity and the life that has been put into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/6">However, Brighton is just a city, and although I am not trying to undermine the place, it has gobbled up the lion's share of investment, particularly social investment, from the Government. Much regeneration money has quite rightly gone into cities because of their problems, but it has done so to the exclusion of neighbouring towns and villages, which also have big problems. They do not qualify for that help because they do not have economies of scale or the same quantity of problems, and they do not get the help and regeneration that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/7">A scheme that worked really well and that the previous Government strongly championed was the single regeneration budget. One did not need to be a big city or a big deprived estate to qualify for it. The SRB did a lot in my constituency and along the Sussex coast in pockets of deprivation to help to upgrade the more downmarket business estates, to regenerate the town centres that had lost out to out-of-town shopping centres and to bring up the standard of the housing. It worked very well, because it was not big-budget stuff, but it had a big bang for its buck.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/8">My final point is about coastal erosion. We have benefited greatly from the Environment Agency, I am glad to say. We got &pound;20 million to fortify the coastal defences from Shoreham to Worthing, where we are vulnerable and below sea level. I am grateful for the Environment Agency's far-sightedness, which enabled us to do that work. The trouble is that because of the pressure on budgets for coastal defence work, and because the problem a few years ago was not coastal but river defences, when the city of Chichester, the town of Lewes in Sussex and other market towns throughout the country flooded badly, a great deal of money that would have gone into coastal defence work had to go into river defence work in our towns. There is a competing equation, and towns are losing out on coastal defence work that is essential if we are to defend them from the effects of global warming.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/9">The debate has raised a range of interesting coastal town problems. I am not one to bleat and say, &quot;Why aren't we getting more help?&quot; because ultimately local people, enthusiasm and entrepreneurship, and the flexibility to adapt to new times, markets, customers and interest, are the future of our coastal towns. However, the Government must at least recognise that coastal towns have diverse problems. They are not inner cities with enormous estates that suffer from all sorts of deprivation; they are not rural ex-coal mining or ex-tin mining communities that have specific problems; and although many parts of north-west Sussex are close to affluent rural areas; many parts of south-west Sussex are not. It does not mean that they are without their problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.1/10">We want to solve the problems ourselves. We need greater co-ordination and we parliamentarians can be the catalyst for much of that change, but it would help if the Government recognised the problems and responded rather more positively and proactively than they have to the Committee's otherwise excellent report.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-07a.173.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="173"  time="016:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070607/halltext/70607h0006.htm#07060791000341">
	<p pid="a.173.1/1">The hon. Lady was also on the local authority in Wandsworth with me at that time, and I am sure that she learned many lessons from my hon. Friend about dynamism and how to regenerate socio-economically deprived areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/2">My hon. Friend was also absolutely right to say that the Minister should feel beleaguered, although I would go further and say that she should also feel embarrassed to come here and defend the Government response to the excellent Select Committee report. The hon. Members for Blackpool, South and for Cleethorpes (Shona McIsaac) also said, although in a very polite way, that the response was not acceptable and not up to scratch. Of course, they have to be careful, given their positions.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/3">Before I drill down into some of the details of the issues for Skegness, I should like to put it on the record that the town is very different from Bournemouth and Worthing, because it does not have economic diversification. It is very reliant on the UK tourist industry and is a very successful UK tourist resort. I would argue that it is the leading UK tourist destination. People go there&mdash;and to Cleethorpes&mdash;from the former coalfield areas of south Yorkshire and from many parts of the midlands, such as Mansfield, Nottingham and Worksop.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/4">Some 600,000 people visit Skegness in summer. In peak periods, there are 250,000 tourists in the town. The tourism sector is dynamic, full of energy and driven by an entrepreneurial flair that means that the private sector is prepared to put its money where its mouth is and invest in creating attractions that bring people back to Skegness, and other tourist resorts, year after year. Skegness's tourism sector is also coupled with a hard-working public sector that understands the importance of co-operation and a link between the private and public sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/5">I want to pull from the report several key points with which I agree&mdash;I shall rattle through them quickly. The report states that</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Government has neglected...coastal towns for too long.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/7">I agree. It also states that the</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Government does not sufficiently appreciate the needs of coastal towns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/9">I agree. There needs to be cross-departmental liaison, which is currently &quot;disappointing&quot;, and I shall return to that theme.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/10">There are problems, particularly those linked to deprivation, common to many coastal towns, and that is just as true of Skegness as it is of Blackpool and Cleethorpes. A high number of people in coastal towns claim sickness and disability benefits, and it is absolutely right to point that out. The response from the Government on that, read out earlier, was awful, and it raised a titter of laughter in the Chamber. I hope that the Minister will address that issue in her reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/11">We need a national-level requirement to promote English seaside resorts to visitors, and it is incumbent on the Government to try to find ways to address such resorts' inherently low-wage and low-skill economies, the seasonal nature of employment and the importance of economic diversification. I will make some specific suggestions on that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.1/12">I want to put on the record some of the specific problems in and around Skegness. I want to cover the level of deprivation. Some 19.4 per cent. of the working-age population in the East Lindsey coastal area claim incapacity benefit. The area includes the constituency of the hon. Member for Cleethorpes&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-07a.177.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" speakername="Adrian Sanders" colnum="177"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070607/halltext/70607h0006.htm#07060791000344">
	<p pid="a.177.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase> on securing the debate and enabling this important matter to be discussed through her work as Chairman of the Select Committee. The Committee's report took the common challenges that face coastal towns and placed them firmly on the political agenda. For too long it has been assumed that because a town is an excellent place to spend a week's holiday, the permanent population must be lucky to live there. In a sense they are, but as we have heard today, in many other senses they are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/2">Anyone who ventures past the promenades, deckchairs and piers will soon realise that many people who reside in coastal towns are far from lucky. From the lack of affordable housing to low-value employment, the vast range of problems that plague such towns have a daily impact on the lives of residents. I commend the Committee for turning its attention to some of those issues. Although I appreciate that the Committee covered a wide range of issues, for the sake of the debate I will focus on coastal economies, demography, funding and regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/3">As the MP for what I consider to be England's premier coastal town, I am only too aware of the challenges faced by such towns. It is difficult to represent a holiday area as our main business is attracting visitors and therefore it is our duty to put the best gloss on the attractiveness of our area. However, we cannot ignore the socio-economic changes that have taken place in most of our seaside towns over the past 30 to 40 years, which have resulted in a number of negative features, more often associated with inner-city areas, that lie behind the facade of the palm trees.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/4">Seaside towns could be described as 180&deg; local economies, whereas inland communities are 360&deg; economies. Seaside towns have hinterland on only one side, while the sea faces them on the other. Those with the most severe economic difficulties are, inevitably, a long way from the main centres of economic activity and are geographically on the periphery. Many seaside towns are a mixture of the urban and rural, the deprived and affluent, and residents and visitors. Their main industry is tourism, which is one of the fastest-growing economic activities in the world&mdash;but not, sadly, in our coastal tourist resorts.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/5">Some 42 per cent. of British residents who opt to take their main holiday in Britain choose a traditional seaside destination. The market is worth an impressive &pound;4.2 billion. Between 2005 and 2006, more than270 million day visits were made to the UK coast. However, day trippers to the coast spent on average one third less on their day out than those who visited an inland city. However, that is only part of the story. The figures do not separate tourism spending in seaside resorts from the growing number of inland attractions and markets across England. They do not recognise the fact that local tourist spending does not stay in the local economy because of the growth of nationally owned entertainment centres, pubs, hotels, retailers and superstores, where once locally owned businesses rang up the tills.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/6">The geographic location of coastal towns means that they are likely to be end-of-the-line destinations, and with poor transport links it is harder to diversify the local economy to attract higher value employment from manufacturing and other sectors. The Government's transport policy only exacerbates the problem, as funding and approval of major road projects is concentrated on the main arterial routes linking our main centres of population, with a number of coastal towns waiting decades for much-needed link roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/7">Although the Committee has highlighted the trend of high sickness and disability benefit take-up in coastal towns, the Government have again chosen to stick their head in the sand and deny that that is a problem. Unemployment in seaside resorts remains higher than the national average. In the United Kingdom the average was 5.4 per cent., but in many seaside towns it was well above that figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/8">The most recent figures produced by the Office for National Statistics on local labour markets show that in three of England's regions, coastal towns have the highest take-up rates of jobseeker's allowance: my constituency in the south-west, Thanet in the south-east and Great Yarmouth in the east England region. I am glad to see that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> has taken an interest in the debate. The Government fail to acknowledge that the majority of tourism sector jobs are of a low value and tend to be minimum wage, service sector employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/9">High employment figures mask the cruel reality of low-value employment for both the individual minimum wage employee and for the local economy that has less disposable income in circulation to help other businesses to grow. The employment figures that the Government use do not reflect the nature of the employment situation. Low-skilled jobs do not prevent young people from leaving the area, provide enough income to allow people to compete in the local housing market or provide stability within communities that already have an above average transient population. No progress will be made until the Government acknowledge that that is a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/10">Housing has been mentioned this afternoon, and although I appreciate that the issue of affordable housing affects many parts of the country, unaffordability is exacerbated in coastal towns. I welcome the Committee's acknowledgement that greater provision of affordable housing is a key priority in coastal areas. Too many grotty bedsits and flats hide behind the affluent image of the Victorian seaside hotels and villas. That is a consequence of changes in the tourism market and of the Government's failure to recognise that special change. The housing that has been built is out of reach to the two thirds of would-be movers who earn less than &pound;17,500 a year, which is not enough to get a first-time buyers' mortgage on a terraced house in my constituency, let alone on certain housing in areas of higher house prices in the constituencies of other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/11">The Government must consider giving local authorities more power to require developers to build properties that match local needs. Part of the problem could lie in the fact that VAT is levied on renovations but not on new build. The renovation of a great deal of old, crumbling infrastructure, often built in the Victorian era, in our seaside resort areas could be encouraged if that VAT were lowered. Planning law also needs major reform; local authorities must have greater power to determine what can occur in their area. Following pressure led largely by Members of Parliament from coastal resorts, the Government changed the rules on second home council tax discounts. Although that change is welcome, however, it is only a tiny step in the desired direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/12">The decline in business for both hotel and bed-and-breakfast owners and the consequential pressure from their lenders have led many into a tariff war with their competitors in which they have been charging rates that minimise profit margins. Where I grew up, I had friends whose parents made money as bed-and-breakfast proprietors&mdash;that was all that they did, yet it provided an income for a family. They were able to sit on the income during the winter months and spend the winter renovating for the next season. I do not know any guest house proprietor today who does not need a second job or income, because they cannot now sustain a living through tourism alone. Others have sought new custom from the growing numbers of people who are looking for accommodation to rent&mdash;many of them on long-term benefits. Changing accommodation use from tourism to long-term tenancies has an impact on the streets and neighbourhoods in which that accommodation is located.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/13">Reference has already been made to the number of housing benefit claimants, which increased nationally by 5 per cent. between 2001 and 2006. In my own constituency, the number of claimants has increased by 16 per cent. Government ought to be asking why that is and addressing the consequences of that trend. In their response to the report, the Government have stated that they are on track to deliver 30,000 new social rented homes nationally in 2007 and 2008. I acknowledge that that is a 50 per cent. increase on 2004-05, but it is really not good enough. In my constituency alone about 6,000 applicants are waiting to be housed, with only about 600 properties being allocated each year. If the Government are serious about tackling the shortage of affordable housing, they need to provide serious funding, but currently they are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/14">The Committee noted the impact that a coastal town's demography can have on its economy. Inward migration of older or economically inactive individuals, coupled with outward migration of the young, perpetuates many of the problems that coastal towns face. The large, elderly populations are in many ways an asset&mdash;elderly people contribute to voluntary organisations, clubs and societies that would collapse without them. However, the numbers have effects for which local authorities, businesses, and health and social services cannot compensate. A large proportion of the elderly population are on fixed incomes, which in real terms are declining incomes, so the amount of money circulating in the local economy is suppressed. The extra pressures on local health and social services are not fully compensated for by Government grants. As the number of retired people is expected to increase over the next decade, the Government must deal with those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/15">On regeneration, I welcome the Committee's recommendation that the Government should support a permanent network to facilitate the spread of best practice in coastal town regeneration. Although they have held a Department of Trade and Industry conference on coastal towns, the Government refuse to take responsibility for the regeneration of such towns, stating that it is the role of the regional development agencies. Yet the South West of England Regional Development Agency, for example, with the support of the Government, is using taxpayers' money to help relocate Dartington College of Arts&mdash;a higher education establishment&mdash;to another part of the south-west region. That is taking business and jobs away from the coastal resorts and towns of south Devon, despite the fact less taxpayers' money could be used to secure the college's future where it is currently based. I have much sympathy with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase> in wondering what the point of RDAs is if they can, in my terms, misuse or abuse taxpayers' money in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/16">Governments have recognised declining and restructuring traditional industries, and have funded inner cities and rural areas to assist their economic regeneration. New tourism markets have developed, which in most cases have won some of the business that traditionally came to resorts. Traditional seaside resorts have suffered a double whammy: their economies have been in decline because of overseas competition, while Europe and the UK Government have funded other areas and made them into competitors for tourists.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/17">Why, given that single pot funding was allocated to the old coal-mining towns, are the Government so quick to dismiss a similar approach to tackle the problems faced by coastal towns? At the same time they seem perfectly happy to see European funding wasted on pointless relocations of higher education establishments that add no value to the economy ofthe far south-west. Is the answer that the decline of the mining towns occurred almost overnight, whereas the decline in coastal towns has been happening gradually for the past 25 years? Is it also that those who approve European and other funding lack any real accountability to the areas that they serve and to those whose taxes fund them in their work and largesse. Both those issues need addressing&mdash;and quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.177.0/18">In conclusion, it saddens me that the Government have disagreed with every single recommendation by the Committee that requires them to carry out any action or change any resource priority. The Government are supporting only those recommendations that require them to do nothing. Their response to the Committee's report shows a blatant disregard for the people who live in coastal towns.</p>

	<p pid="a.185.0/1">I apologise for having to be absent from the debate for an hour. I had another meeting to go to and I did not think it was appropriate for me to intervene on other hon. Members who had sat through the debate. One of the points that has been raised today is that where there are pockets of deprivation in seaside resorts, such asin Great Yarmouth, we need to take the regional perspective. The area may well be affluent, but we tend to forget the problems, such as transport and infrastructure links.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-07a.186.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="186"  time="017:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070607/halltext/70607h0008.htm#07060791000354">
	<p pid="a.186.2/1">It is important to recognise the degree of funding that the current structures allow. I entirely accept the need to co-ordinate better between different agencies and Departments; we certainly take that on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/2">Problems of transport and physical isolation were raised. It is impossible to divide transport issues and economic development, because one without the other does not make a whole package and does not enable an area to develop economically. The draft Local Transport Bill, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>, is a key part of the Government strategy to give local authorities stronger powers to meet local transport needs. I hope that hon. Members will discuss that with their local authorities. It will help to provide a more coherent approach across local authority boundaries, which will help the economic regeneration of areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/3">Older people's social services and the grant funding were raised repeatedly by hon. Members. Within the calculation of formula grant, there is a relative needs formula for older people's social services at present. The resident population is the main driver of the formula and additional elements take into account other factors related to need, including the number of very elderly people in the area. Currently, that is calculated using data on the number of people aged 65 and over who are resident in each area, the number of pensioners who live alone, the over-65s who are in receipt of pension credit and attendance allowance, pensioners who live in rented accommodation and those who are over 90. We expect to update the data that we use in the relative needs formula for the 2008-09 settlement. That will ensure that the calculations reflect the demographic changes and other trends in local authorities, which hon. Members suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/4">Several hon. Members mentioned housing. All of us know that our communities need additional affordable housing. That has been taken on board by government at all levels. There are powers in the Housing Act 2004 relating to houses in multiple occupation. The local authority is the licensing authority, which will help to ensure good management standards in HMOs. However, the Government are keeping the effectiveness of that legislation under review and we are open-minded on the need to give additional powers in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/5">The point was made quite effectively that many coastal economies are characterised by tourism, which has seen some increase and some additional benefits, but more still needs to be done. Hon. Members also referred to low skills, low pay and seasonal employment. There is an urgent need to tackle those problems and diversify into other growth areas of employment. Local authorities will have an important role to play in that. Coastal towns have benefited from a strong national economy and a buoyant labour market, with a rise in employment. The key for economies in coastal areas is to diversify.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/6">I was in Southend just over a week ago and visiteda very good, high-value company&mdash;KeyMed. That company has a social conscience. It is a good employer and has attracted new investment into the area. The mayor of Southend, the Japanese ambassador and I attended the opening. There are opportunities&mdash;Southend benefits from the Thames Gateway development&mdash;to draw investment into the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/7">I think that the hon. Member for Southend, West had his tongue in his cheek when he said that Southend's problems were worse than those anywhere else. I made the point that we should celebrate our coastal towns, and the hon. Gentleman said that he was very proud to be the MP for Southend, West. Southend is one of the designated areas of change in the Thames Gateway. It is important that we recognise the other regeneration issues that we can use to benefit coastal areas. Southend has benefited from Southend university, through an investment of &pound;14 million and the creation of a new university right in the heart of the town. Education opportunities are extremely important in coastal towns, as several hon. Members said. I do not know the details of the project to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1879" name="Adrian Sanders">the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders)</phrase> referred, but certainly I will look at that. Where we can drive up skills, create employment&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I would like to the respond to the hon. Gentleman. Where we can drive up employment, it is important to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/8">I acknowledge the comments made in particular by my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West and the hon. Members for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) and for Torbay about looked-after children. That is a very serious issue. It is ludicrous that several social services departments have to co-ordinate with one school. The &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; consultation paper that the Department for Education and Skills is examining now will be crucial to trying to address that extremely serious issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/9">I cannot do justice to all the comments made. I thank hon. Members for their comments. I hope that some of the measures that we are taking to ensure that we work better together across Government and at all levels of government&mdash;local, regional and national&mdash;will ensure that we can address the issues that affect coastal areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.2/10" class="italic">It being half-past Five o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
