<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-06a.63.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" speakername="Michael Penning" colnum="63"  time="009:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090506/halltext/90506h0001.htm#09050659000435">
	<p pid="a.63.6/1">I reiterate your comments, Mr. Hancock, about the insult to the House and those hon. Members who have turned up for this important debate. It is also an insult to my constituents and the children of this country, who have been so badly affected by the funding fiasco. It is a shame that the Minister was not here earlier to hear your comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/2">The funding of sixth forms and further education colleges is very important for my constituents, as it is for people throughout the country. The fiasco of the past two and a half months&mdash;at least&mdash;has caused great anxiety in colleges, and among headmasters, pupils and parents. It has been described by headmasters as &quot;incompetent and dishonest&quot; and I am desperately concerned about the fact that, with the Learning and Skills Council in its dying throes, its chief executive still does not seem to understand the seriousness of the situation. The chief executive said in a recent interview for <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> that the Learning and Skills Council is a fascinating place to work. It may be interesting, but I wish, for the sake of the pupils, parents and headmasters in my constituency, that he was doing a bit more work, so that the current situation had not occurred. Frankly, he should be a little more contrite about how what has happened has affected pupils.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/3">I want to give a brief resum&eacute; of what has happened in Hertfordshire. On <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March</phrase> schools in my constituency were told their final allocation of funding for 2009-10. That was the funding that they were to set their budgets by for the end of March, which they could take up to ensure that they had suitable building work done, suitable facilities, and suitable staff in employment, and so that they knew exactly where they were. I have seen the letters that went out from the LSC about that funding. By the last week in March there was a clear indication of a problem throughout the country, and particularly in Hertfordshire. By <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-27">27 March</phrase> schools in Hertfordshire had had their funding slashed. Thirteen schools had had their funding cut by up to &pound;25,000; 33 schools had had it cut by between &pound;25,000 and &pound;50,000; 24 schools had had it cut by between &pound;50,000 and &pound;100,000; and five schools had had it cut by more than &pound;100,000. Those are huge figures, whether they are &pound;25,000 or &pound;100,000, when someone is trying to set funding for the following year, and achieve a legal budget&mdash;one that is not in deficit, because it is illegal for the governors of schools to set a deficit budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/4">Many schools in my constituency, in good faith, gave instructions for building works. The refurbishment of a small classroom was one instance. One school took on two members of staff. The news was therefore something of a shock. We then saw the plethora of articles around the country claiming that everything would be okay, and telling us &quot;We will try to sort this out.&quot; Interestingly, different messages were coming from the LSC, which said it just did not have the funding. The Government eventually announced that they would fill the budget hole&mdash;the cut affecting 16 to 18-year-olds throughout the country, although I am making particular reference to the constituency of Hemel Hempstead. They said they would bring forward a further allocation of funds&mdash;some &pound;210 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/5">My question to the Minister is about the description of that as additional funding. Where did the funding from <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March</phrase> go? It was clearly there. If the LSC issued letters announcing that that was the funding for the year, how could the Government later say that it was additional and was filling a hole that was already there? Not one head teacher in my constituency has said that any money was made available additional to what they were promised on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March</phrase>. The Government's description of it as additional funding is disingenuous, suggesting that it is extra money, when it is not. It goes only part way towards the cut in sixth-form funding that had already been made. Interestingly enough, the shortfall is partly caused, it would seem, by the &pound;65 million that was taken out of the further education budget and sent to the university student grant scheme. That might partly explain where some of the money comes from, but what has gone on has involved sheer incompetence.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/6">We have heard in the past couple of days&mdash;I have raised the matter on the Floor of the House&mdash;that the money will be sorted out and will be coming. We are a month into this year's budget. It is illegal not to have set the budget by <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March</phrase>. It is a legal requirement for the LSC that the funding should have been addressed by the end of March. Naturally enough, I phoned the schools in my constituency yesterday, knowing that the debate was to take place, and realising that it had been on the Order Paper for some days, to find out whether they had had the promise of the funding that they required. They were all promised that by the end of April&mdash;admittedly a month late&mdash;they would have their funding. To be fair, some of them have been given it, although it is not, I stress, extra funding. One has received the &pound;25,000 that had been removed from its allocation, and another has been promised that it will have the money, although there is nothing in writing. Another school is concerned about funding of up to &pound;90,000 and is still formally without any contact from the LSC or the Government about where the funding will come from. The headmaster yesterday said to me, &quot;What am I going to do? It is not legal for me to be operating in this framework. I have a legal responsibility to my children, but I also have a legal responsibility under the Act, to make sure that I have the funds available for the pupils in my school.&quot; Another headmaster said to me, &quot;I will stop a capital project in another part of the school to fund this part of my school, because I will not allow a deficit budget. It would look terrible for my school.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/7">Through no fault of their own, wonderful schools in my constituency, which are doing excellent work for their pupils and the community, many of which have expanded and done well, with dramatically improving results, received letters saying formally that they contained the final allocation. What other word can one use for &quot;final&quot;, other than perhaps &quot;terminal&quot;, which might apply to the LSC and the Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/8">I am serious about this: the schools have had the letters and they have moved forward. They set their budgets in good faith only to be told three weeks later that there had been a mistake, a miscalculation. Frankly, the Learning and Skills Council and the Government cannot seem to get the funding ready in time for 2009-10. Telling schools three weeks before the cut-off time how much they were getting and then, two days before legally required, informing them that the funding had been cut, shows a degree of incompetence that borders on the insane.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/9">People want some destiny for their children. They want to know what is going on. They want to be able to pick the right school. For example, my daughter is doing the second year of her A-levels. She needed to know that she would have the facilities that were promised, that the school had set the curriculum and that the teachers would be available. We hear promise after promise from the Government&mdash;jam tomorrow&mdash;but the money is coming later. The schools still do not have a promise in writing that they will receive the funding that they deserve, and it is now a month after the legal requirement for the funding has passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/10">I ask the Minister not to stand up like the Secretary of State did in the main Chamber and say, &quot;You should have listened to the Budget.&quot; I ask him please to listen to the heads and governors. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] Please listen to what is going on in the country. It is shameful that the Minister was not here to listen to the start of the debate. It is an indication to parents and headmasters of how the Government are likely to treat them in future. What guarantee is there that that will not happen next year or the year after? If things do not change, parents have the right to ask, &quot;Are the Government fit for purpose? Are they capable of producing the education that children need and desire?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.63.6/11">It is an indication of how much the question matters for the whole country&mdash;certainly those who care&mdash;that so many of my colleagues are sitting next to me and behind me. I did not lobby anyone to attend this debate. I simply asked Mr. Speaker, after he made his comments in the Chamber, whether he would be minded to grant an Adjournment debate. I thought long and hard as to whether it should be a half-hour debate. I now believe that an hour and a half is too short. The Minister should allow a debate in Government time on the fiasco of funding further education.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-06a.69.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="69"  time="009:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090506/halltext/90506h0001.htm#09050659000446">
	<p pid="a.69.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a valiant fist at an indefensible case. However, he ignores the reality that if a school takes on a member of staff and has promised a place now from September next year, they must pay for it then. It cannot start to make budget adjustments from the beginning of the 2009-10 financial year to take account of the last-minute change announced by the LSC on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-30">30 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/2">This is happening at a time when the Government are urging schools and colleges not to cut, but to increase provision for a greater number of post-16 students and when the recession has reduced severely the opportunities for young people to go, at the age of 16, directly from school into employment. I do not think that the argument will wash that there was an unexpected surge in the number of people seeking sixth-form places. My schools are telling me that the LSC has always funded them on the basis of the number of sixth-formers in the previous September and that the cut is being imposed on the basis of that formula, not on account of some new upsurge identified only during the course of March this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/3">I cannot exaggerate the sense of anger among head teachers in my schools. I do not know the politics of these men and women. The head of Aylesbury grammar school said:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We are losing the equivalent of three members of staff, or our entire maintenance budget, for all departments across the school&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/5">The head of Misbourne upper school said:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The reversal of funding levels has now destroyed coherent planning&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/7">which</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/8" class="indent">&quot;makes providing a stable and productive learning community almost impossible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/9">The head of Sir Henry Floyd grammar school said:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We will have to cut 11 A-level teaching groups...and reduce the number of teaching groups in the most popular subjects&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/11">The head of Aylesbury high school said:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/12" class="indent">&quot;We are working on rumours at the moment as to whether or not we will receive the original sum that we were allocated&mdash;it is in no one's interest to work in this way...The problem seems to be at the core of the LSC&mdash;the regional office does not know what is going on&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/13">The head of Princes Risborough upper school described the episode as a &quot;complete farce&quot;. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/14" class="indent">&quot;To be given an interim budget with a reasonable assurance that the figures were robust and then to be told at the end of March just as we have to submit our new budgets that the amount will be cut drastically is ludicrous&mdash;how could any institution have a financially prudent plan?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/15">The head of Mandeville upper school, which is pushing hard for the take-up of BTECs and other non-A-level qualifications, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/16" class="indent">&quot;The reduction in funding could mean a lost opportunity for those students who excel at BTEC qualifications rather than traditional A-levels&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/17">Finally, the head of John Colet school said that</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/18" class="indent">&quot;to reduce our salaries budget further, we are going to have some staff teaching outside their specialism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/19">That is bad enough in a secondary school, but for it possibly to affect a sixth form is intolerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.0/20">I hope that the Minister will pledge not just to ensure that the money will be made good, but that the schools will be told quickly and in detail how their individual budgets will be restored to the status quo ante. I also hope to hear him pledge that the Department will learn the lessons and that this sort of catastrophic failure of good administration and planning will never happen again. A strong case could be made for the Public Accounts Committee to investigate this business, because the Department has let down our schools very badly, whose interests it is supposed to defend.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your benign chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> on raising this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">Let us talk about what this debate is not about. It is not about my hon. Friends asking for more money, or asking for more money in order to cut budgets elsewhere&mdash;the rather puerile student union dividing-line approach taken by the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families last week, which was rather demeaning and symptomatic of the Government's decline, as we watch them crumble in front of our eyes. If that was happening to a budgie, we would take it to a vet and have it put down.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">The issue is about basic honesty, communication, administrative competence and transparency. Hon. Members rightly want to know why there was such a disconnect between what the LSC and the Department knew in January&mdash;if not before&mdash;and the schools' expectations, and why there was such a time lag in getting the right information to schools. Moreover, they want to know why there was no honesty when the difference first came to light. Why was it necessary to include the figures in a footnote on page 13 of the Learning and Skills Council's funding letter that arrived on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March 2009</phrase>? It was almost as if those figures were hidden away in the hope that schools would not notice that they were several thousand pounds short in their budget for sixth-form education. Perhaps the Minister will consider that.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/4">Last autumn, the Government told us that they were uniquely placed, well equipped and fully prepared to deal with the economic recession. Why then was there no robust, predictive model to ascertain the likely and accurate take-up of school sixth-form places? If it was the case, as Mr. Geoff Russell told <i>The Guardian </i>recently, that it was impossible to predict student numbers accurately, why was there not better communication and liaison between the Department, the LSC and individual schools?</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/5">As my hon. Friend rightly said, the situation has caused significant distress, unhappiness and worry for head teachers, senior staff, governors, pupils and parents. In my local education authority, 10 secondary schools have been affected, suffering a loss on paper of &pound;397,000. We are already underperforming in terms of the skills agenda, particularly with respect to NVQ level 3, compared with other education authorities in the east of England and elsewhere. Moreover, jobs in our area have been significantly hit by the economic recession. We cannot afford to lose sixth-form places for young people. We have lost funding for 70 learners in 2009-10. That does not sound much, but we are a relatively small unitary authority. Such a loss will have an impact on participation rates and on the delivery of the September guarantee. Inevitably, it will lead to larger class sizes, and there will be less flexibility to offer more specialist provision for some of our sixth-form learners, which will lead to an increase in the number of young people not in education, employment or training. Such a problem is already a significant issue in Peterborough.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/6">The Voyager school in Walton will lose &pound;71,000&mdash;the equivalent of two full-time teaching posts&mdash;the King's school in Peterborough will lose &pound;66,000, the Jack Hunt school, a specialist language college, &pound;52,000 and Ken Stimpson community school &pound;36,900. Two of those schools already have problems with respect to school improvements, and losing staff and being unable to fund and plan properly will mean that the school establishment only adds to its difficulties. Indeed, it will have an impact on staff morale, which will feed through to results. There will also be an impact on Peterborough regional college, which has similar problems. Don Lawson, the principal, to whom I spoke three weeks ago, told me that the college has been impacted severely by the further education capital programme debacle, which has not been fully resolved to the college's satisfaction. Frankly, that will jeopardise the very ambitious city regeneration plans for a university centre to complement the extra FE provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/7">Finally, as John Richards, the director of children's services in Peterborough, has said, schools do not operate their post-16 funding discretely from their statutory provision, which could have significant implications for their ability to deliver better outcomes overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/8">The Minister has some pertinent questions to answer. How did we get into this mess, who was responsible, who will be accountable for it and, more importantly, how can we have equitable funding for our schools? We do not want promises or extra money, but cash, so that young people in Peterborough and throughout the country can achieve their ambitions.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> for introducing this debate and I echo his thanks to Mr. Speaker for making it possible. Clearly, this subject should have been debated for a full day on the Floor of the House, with a Minister saying at the beginning, presuming he had arrived, what is happening and what is going to happen, followed by proper winding-up speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2">The catastrophe of schools and colleges that provide post-16 education having to cut staff must have been known about by Ministers and their advisers well in advance of the institutions and Parliament being notified. It comes on top of the current problems associated with the Government's supervision of the LSC and the capital funding for colleges. In Worthing, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> has already pointed out, virtually every young person goes to Worthing and/or Northbrook college at age 16. One of the colleges uses huts that were rescued from Southampton docks at the end of the great war from 1918 to 1920, which should have been retired; the other was built for 600 pupils but now has more than 1,500, half of whose lessons take place in huts.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3">We can leave aside capital spending, which is not the main theme of the debate. The colleges are being squeezed for &pound;1.5 million cash. The Government require the LSC to pay the money as a legal commitment, but it has not been received, and the LSCs had to go to the banks for money. The unpaid governors of colleges have major legal responsibilities, but they also have to deal with the question of how many staff they may have for post-16s. Will the Minister make it plain that the LSC has paid or will pay within days the money for those fees and ensure that the other costs on the capital schemes are capitalised so that they are not pushed into deficit? Capital sums can come in a week or so. I hope the Minister answers those two precise questions today.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/4">Will the Minister ask his advisers to send to each hon. Member present and all hon. Members for affected parts of the United Kingdom a copy of the document, marking the footnote on page 13, which is the relevant piece of information? Is the information in the footnote the least important piece of information&mdash;perhaps it is simply a detail&mdash;or was someone, in a clever-clever way, trying to keep the catastrophe away from publicity?</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/5">Let us ask questions in terms not of &quot;education, education, education&quot;, but of &quot;statistics, statistics, statistics.&quot; I will even answer some of them for the Minister. How long has he and the DCSF known how many 16-year-olds there would be in September? The answer is 16 years&mdash;births are registered, so the number of 16-year-olds cannot be a big surprise. Did he or his predecessors, and will his successors, know participation trends? Yes, they did and they will. Do they watch the cash? No. Who is going to lose? Late applicants will lose&mdash;the people who thought they were going into work or who thought they were not going to be in employment, education or training, who decide that they want to apply for a post-16 course. Who will the colleges and schools turn down? They will reject those who apply late, so the person who needs the place most is the most likely to be turned away.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/6">I do not want to repeat what my hon. Friends have said&mdash;the Minister will be able to read a report of what was said in the first two minutes of the debate in the <i>Official Report</i>, and his Parliamentary Private Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1576" name="Liz Blackman">the hon. Member for Erewash (Liz Blackman)</phrase>, will be able to read a report of what was said in the first 20 minutes of the debate&mdash;but there is not a single Labour Back Bencher in the Chamber, yet half the colleges affected have Labour Members of Parliament. Either there has been a Whip's operation, or Labour Members&mdash;I am not saying that they do not care&mdash;do not dare speak up. Perhaps the Whips had a meeting and told them, &quot;This is what you ought to say if you go to the debate.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/7">When the Minister speaks, I hope he focuses on answering these questions: where is the cash and who will be excluded? I hope that he understands that our colleges are finding that they have to have eight fewer members of staff and perhaps to double-up, and that he explains the situation and does not pass the responsibility on to somebody else.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> on securing the debate and drawing such a crowd from his own party. I am pleased that the Minister turned up eventually. As those of us who have just completed consideration of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill will know, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1825" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr. Hayes)</phrase>, a habit is developing of Ministers not turning up on time for proceedings. However, I will follow your exhortations to other hon. Members, Mr. Hancock, and try to keep my remarks brief so that the Minister has plenty of time to answer questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">This debate is on the latest in a litany of failures in the two new education Departments. Last year, they failed to send out confirmations of education maintenance allowances for young people. Moving to the next age group up, that was followed by a complete miscalculation of the number of people who would qualify for student grants. That led to the budget for higher education places being trimmed, which will cause a crisis this summer. On the Learning and Skills Council, we have had several debates in Westminster Hall and in the main Chamber on capital expenditure for further education colleges. There has been a long-term gap between the funding received by colleges and schools for 16 to 19-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">This year, there is a real cash shortage in the provision that schools and colleges are receiving from the Government. That has led to yet another emergency announcement and emergency measure. Why has that taken place? As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">the hon. Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> said in his powerful speech, it appears that it is partly because the Government were taken completely by surprise by the over-subscription caused by students deciding, rightly, to stay in education beyond the age of 16. That is amazing because, as he rightly said, the number of people in that cohort was known with considerable certainty before that time. We know from previous recessions that more 16 and 18-year-olds decide to stay in education and training at such times.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/4">With last year's student grants fiasco and the upcoming crisis in university places this summer, the two education Departments are building a record of being caught out and surprised by what goes on in the real world. Whichever party is in government in two years' time, I hope that the Departments will not be caught out again because we will have more people staying on at school sixth forms and going to further education colleges post-16. I hope they will ensure that there are enough places for 18-year-olds to continue in training or education, whether through adult apprenticeships or higher education.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/5">The Chancellor announced more emergency funding for this sector in the Budget, just as he had to do for the college capital expenditure programme. This year there will be an additional &pound;250 million and next year an additional &pound;400 million. That is not recession-related funding. It is not a bail-out for the banks or a loan for car companies; it is a bail-out for another Department that is guilty of mismanaging its budget. It is ridiculous that one reason why the Government were forced into the bail-out was the spectre of being sued by schools and colleges. That remains to be seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/6">A squeeze on future education budgets was also announced in the Budget. There will be a renewed efficiency drive in the sector with hundreds of millions of pounds having to be saved. Extra money was announced on the one hand, and on the other the sector was told that it will have to make significant savings in future. That could take us back to square one. What a way to treat a sector that is central in delivering the objective of the Government and other parties to have skilled people who can weather the recession and enter the workplace. This sector is crucial in delivering the diplomas for 14 to 19-year olds that are being rolled out across the country. It will also be crucial if the participation age is raised to 17 and then 18 over the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/7">After the fiasco in college capital expenditure, the Government were obliged to set up an inquiry into their own mismanagement or into that of an agency under their control. With this fiasco, I hope that the Minister will not announce an inquiry, nor hide behind officials at the Learning and Skills Council, but will take some responsibility for the two education Departments and answer the pertinent questions that have been put to him by hon. Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.1/1">I have almost finished. At the end of last week, in relation to the detailed allocations, I agreed that the <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March</phrase> figure could go out to learners, with the exception of four institutions. The reason I have been unable to be absolutely clear on that until now is that there are four institutions that will not get up to the <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-02">2 March</phrase> allocation. I will be talking to the MPs who represent those institutions today&mdash;the hon. Members for Braintree (Mr. Newmark) and for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson) and my hon. Friends <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" name="Angela Smith">the Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith)</phrase> and for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson). Technical reasons relating to how the formula was worked out mean that those institutions will get less than they thought. In all but one case, significant numbers are not involved and, in every case, I think that the school and college know the situation in respect of those allocations.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/2">Finally, before I take a couple of interventions if I have time, it is worth reemphasising that the allocation from the Budget means that we can fund more post-16 learners that ever before. The allocation is up from &pound;1.5 million to &pound;1.55 million. That is on top of the 17,500 additional apprenticeship places to which I referred earlier, and it includes funding 55,000 extra educational maintenance allowance places. A detailed process will now go on until <phrase class="date" code="2009-05-22">22 May</phrase> to agree the very final allocations, including that extra amount for those colleges and schools that are able to stimulate additional demand in order to meet the needs of young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.1/3">It is also important for me to say that&mdash;I know that the Opposition will not like this&mdash;we are committed to a September guarantee and, going forward, we are committed to funding places for every 16 to 19-year-old in school and college who wants one and wants to carry on learning. In terms of skills, it is important that we come out of this recession stronger than when we went into it. That is not a guarantee that I have heard repeated by the Opposition, who are so well represented in this Chamber.</p>

Were his officials aware of it? In other words, did the Department know because, presumably, he has at least conducted some kind of internal investigation into these matters?

	<p pid="a.87.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair for this debate, Mr. Hancock, and the Treasury Minister who is here to respond to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">The premise of this debate about sustainable procurement is that the Government have fine policies for sustainable procurement promotion, but there is confusion over responsibility, and some practical guidance is missing. That means that there is not the leadership and direction necessary to make as big a success of sustainable procurement as we should.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/3">For much of my speech, I shall focus on the power of public procurement, but sustainable procurement is the responsibility of every procurer. In fact, in some instances, the private sector is ahead of the public sector, particularly in respect of private finance initiative contracts. Whatever people think about the politics of such contracts, those who bid to construct and then run a building or a series of premises for 30 years are clearly focused on the cost over the whole life of the contract, not just the up-front building costs. In some senses, the private sector is already aware of whole-life costing, which I shall discuss, when the public sector is a bit slower.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/4">The public sector has enormous purchasing power, and it would be interesting to hear whether the Minister has a figure for that. I estimate that &pound;175 billion a year is spent by all public sector organisations on goods, services and utilities. I contend that that purchasing power could be used to lead by example to promote sustainable procurement, which is the procurement of goods, utilities and services in a manner that maximises the environmental, social and economic benefits for all of society over the whole life of the procured asset.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/5">In 2005, the Government set themselves the ambitious goal of making the UK a leader in the European Union in sustainable procurement by 2009&mdash;this year. A little over a year ago, I chaired an inquiry into sustainable procurement which last summer resulted in the report, &quot;Costing the Future: Securing Value for Money through Sustainable Procurement&quot;, which was intended to be a contribution to the debate about how best to achieve the Government's ambition.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/6">Our inquiry took evidence from private sector companies, the public sector&mdash;central Government, local government, the National Audit Office, the Audit Commission, the Office of Government Commerce&mdash;and many others, and we published our report in the summer of 2008. The report states that many of the necessary policies are in place for sustainable procurement but they have not been consistently translated into practice. We found some instances of good practice but many missed opportunities. I shall try later to give some examples of where we felt opportunities had been missed. Since the report's publication, I have been happy to see several further Government initiatives&mdash;for example, the creation of the Centre of Expertise in Sustainable Procurement, which will help to address the issues raised in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/7">What can sustainable procurement achieve? Clearly, there is a great deal of focus today on the dangers to the environment and the urgency of tackling climate change. As a result, there is a focus on environmental sustainability. That is one aspect, and it is one with which sustainable procurement clearly can help. After all, the Government have pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050, and the whole of Parliament bought into that by passing the Climate Change Act 2008. Just consider the Building Schools for the Future programme, which provides schools that will be used well past 2050, yet so far it is nowhere near making the design changes and reductions in energy consumption that will make a contribution to the tough target that we have set ourselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/8">If we want to be at the forefront in leading the world in low-carbon technologies&mdash;both for consumption in this country and as exports that will earn us money&mdash;and resource-efficient economies in the future, we have to be attuned to the potential of global green market opportunities and innovate now. Sustainable procurement policies would help with such innovation.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/9">As well as the environmental sustainability argument, there is also an argument for better value for money. We must take into account the medium and long-term costs as well as short-term costs. That is the crucial point of whole-life costing, which I shall come on to. It means sometimes spending marginally more at the outset of a project in order to reduce drastically the whole-life costs throughout the contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/10">A project may cost more up front, but if people are mentally attuned to doing things the right way, some features may actually cost nothing extra. For example, orienting a building to be in the right position to catch the maximum amount of daylight and sunshine does not involve more money, but it does involve thinking about the whole-life cost of the procurement, not just the actual building costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/11">More sustainable construction can help by drastically reducing energy prices. It would be interesting to hear whether the Minister has any forecasts for future energy costs. We clearly see that gas and electricity prices are on an upward curve. People are talking about investing in a new generation of nuclear power, which will be expensive. Even some renewable energies are expensive, because they are at the beginning of their process. Therefore, we need to attune ourselves to wanting to reduce energy consumption in new buildings and projects where we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/12">The same applies to water consumption. We can all see that with an increasing population and greater demands for water, the cost of using water will be higher in the future. We must invest in ways to minimise the consumption of water. Reusing water and harvesting rainwater are ways of keeping costs down over the long term of contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/13">Also on sustainability and better value for money, we could get long-term unemployed people back to work if there were incentives to help people into work as part of procurement contracts. We would reduce social benefit costs in this country and hopefully reduce the social problems associated with long-term unemployment more generally.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/14">That brings me to promoting social cohesion and sustainable communities as an objective of procurement. An example is the Building Schools for the Future programme. It has enormous potential to promote opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises to bid for parts of contracts, as long as the process is welcoming and open to them. Consider the building of a new school. A traditional procurement approach might simply advocate the construction of a building in which students can be taught. Sustainable procurement would bring an appreciation of how features such as renewable energy technologies offer the potential to minimise the environmental impact of the building. Furthermore, such procurement would be a practical demonstration&mdash;a learning tool&mdash;of environmental sustainability for the school community itself, and, being set in the wider community, for people at large to learn about new technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/15">In addition to that benefit, through the inclusion of social clauses such as requirements in respect of regeneration of the area and using apprentices in the construction process, sustainable procurement could also be used to address unemployment, social mobility and social cohesion. For an extended school&mdash;is that not the ambition these days for every school?&mdash;early engagement in the procurement process with community leaders would ensure that the building is designed and constructed to meet the wider needs of the community. That one example of building one school shows that best value for money and environmental, economic and social concerns can be addressed through sustainable procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/16">Correctly made up, the contracts can encourage greater social cohesion by including provisos on using people in apprenticeships or the long-term unemployed, and they can make a difference to the whole community in which the project takes place. Therefore sustainable procurement is not an abstract, idealistic goal, but a practical, achievable objective for government. By using procurement to promote the goals of sustainability, economic efficiency, environmental sensitivity and social justice, the Government can help to foster a better society composed of sustainable communities that are more able to respond to the global economic market. Why is this not happening every time now?</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/17">The first barrier, which I learned of from the inquiry, is affordability. There is always enormous pressure to make short-term cashable savings, yet there is little or no incentive to reduce the long-term costs. Often, that is exacerbated by the split between capital and revenue budgets, meaning that procurers cannot think long term. Three-year settlements have been helpful, but when we are talking about 30-year contracts, as many of the relevant contracts would be, people need to be able to move between revenue-in-the-future costs and capital costs up front to complete a whole-life estimation and a contract built on whole-life costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/18">Budget silos are another problem. Sometimes, different people make decisions in different parts of the project. Let me give a simple example from my constituency of Stafford. My local authority wanted to replace an ageing leisure centre and did a deal with a private developer, under which he would build the new leisure centre for free and, in return, would have the site on which the old leisure centre stood. So the developer's ambition was to build a new leisure centre as small and cheaply as could be got away with, consistent with good standards of modern construction&mdash;I have no criticism of my new leisure centre in Stafford, in that sense&mdash;but he was not able to conceive of my argument about including renewable energy technologies in the design, for example, as it was not in his interest. The borough council now picks up the running costs for the next 30 years, which will be higher than they could have been. That is an example of how people dealing with different parts of the project are not willing to work with each other. That is why leadership and guidance is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/19">Although the Treasury procurement green book says that we should not always go with the lowest cost, it does not give sufficient guidance on what sustainable procurement actually means. Despite Treasury guidance stating that projects should be whole-life costed, the public sector does not possess the tools to do that meaningfully, let alone take account of the social and environmental benefits in its calculations.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/20">The solutions are as follows. First, the report strongly advocates whole-life costing to incentivise people's behaviour and get them thinking about the long-term effects of the contract that they enter into, and for them to start to provide an accurate cost for sustainability and see how budgets can be adjusted between the revenue costs and the capital to get the right outcome. Secondly, a stronger theme of the report was commissioning for outcomes instead of just trying to procure outputs. Enabling people to use their own solutions to get to the outcomes that they want helps promote innovation and allows for additional and unforeseen social and environmental benefits to be weighed in selecting the right bid for the contract. Those desirable outcomes are achievable, but they are barriers to the solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/21">It is difficult to get Ministers to take responsibility and show leadership. That is a not a criticism of my hon. Friend the Minister, but let us consider what happens when I ask the Government who is responsible for leadership. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says, &quot;We're responsible for sustainable procurement&quot;; the Cabinet Office Minister says, &quot;I'm responsible for sustainable procurement&quot;; the Office of Government Commerce says, &quot;But we're responsible for it&quot;; and the Exchequer Secretary is our Minister, so a Treasury Minister is responsible. I keep going round the circuit of the Ministers in those Departments to get somebody to say that the detailed work needs to be done on whole-life costing and that incentives are needed to be able to do the right thing in the procurement process&mdash;and to get something done. Is the Minister the one responsible for this and is she aware, and willing, to do the things that need to be done to achieve this? I hope that we can get to the point at which somebody says, &quot;I am the person who is going to sort this out. What needs sorting out?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/22">There is a need for standardisation. As we saw when we talked to the bidders for the contracts that I have mentioned, there is a great lack of benchmark data and of standards to work to in presenting a bid that shows a whole-life cost. Benchmark data help everybody to have a common understanding of what the ambition is and they show what things need to be taken, and not taken, into account. For example, the Audit Commission said to us: &quot;If it's a whole-life contract for a building and at the end of its life it's finished, should the whole-life costing, as part of the contract, take into account the decommissioning costs at the end?&quot; Some people do that, but most do not because it ramps up the costs still further. But if people are not bidding with a common understanding, it is like comparing apples and pears.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/23">Some people are working to try to develop helpful standards. The British Standards Institution, for example, has a whole-life costing standard to try to bring uniformity to the process. I am not saying that the BSI is the one and only organisation that can do this. If we can develop standards that everybody applies, at least we are all singing to the same hymn sheet in assessing who wins the bid.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/24">People working in procurement need a greater level of skills to be able to work with the benchmark data and standards, and with the idea of being much more flexible about how to achieve the best contract over a longer period. To some extent, new metrics on standards are needed to standardise the methods of financially valuing things that do not always have a price on them&mdash;for example, the social and environmental benefits that I mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/25">We found some relevant examples in our inquiry. In a project for eight schools, the bidder wanted to put in biomass boilers instead of natural gas boilers, and although the installation costs of the biomass boilers was &pound;800,000 more, in round figures, than the natural gas ones, over 30 years the running costs would have been &pound;8 million less. But the natural gas option went ahead because it was &pound;800,000 cheaper. A hospital wanted to put in environmental and energy-reducing measures as part of its contract, but those were all removed because it was said that the payback in the benefits of reducing energy costs versus the extra capital costs would have happened over 47 years. When somebody looked at the probable energy costs over 30 years and included a shadow price for carbon, which the Treasury green book says should be done, they saw that there would be payback over 11 years. But by the time that somebody mentioned that, the decision had already been made to cut out all the environmental and energy-saving measures and to go with the lower cost option. So the opportunity was lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/26">The message that came across strongly from the report was that everybody feared European Union procurement policy. People might say, &quot;We want whole-life costing. Aren't we breaking EU law on procurement?&quot; or &quot;We want regeneration of apprentices employed under this contract, but are we discriminating in favour of buying local, which is against EU law?&quot; People can use the EU as their whipping boy as much as they like, but mostly the answers to those questions is no. Actually, they can do those things as long as they get the process right. Firm advice and guidance is necessary from the top to ensure that people have the confidence to procure in the right way.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/27">We found good designs and good projects, but too few of them were making it through the process: they were dropped at planning or final-cost stages and did not make it through to become the buildings of the future. It is urgent, for all the reasons that I have mentioned in respect of the environment, social cohesion and social justice for the future. We have had to borrow a lot of money to meet the needs of coping with the greatest economic downturn since the second world war and things will be tighter in future, so it is all the more important today to stand up for good quality buildings and contracts that are going to be with us for the next 30, 40 or 50 years and will, hopefully, contribute to tackling climate change along the way. It is even more important now for us to stand by our standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/28">Will the Minister be serious about addressing climate change, look for long-term cost efficiency and not just short-term gains, and help to promote more sustainable public sector procurement? To do so, whole-life costing for public sector procurement contracts must be adopted.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">It is a pleasure to respond to the debate and the good and expert points made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase>. As chair of the Westminster sustainable business forum, he has a long history of involvement and great expertise in the matter. I agreed with almost everything that that he said, although borrowing against future revenue streams goes slightly too far in public accounting procedures for now, although we could perhaps consider it in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">It is clearly important, as my hon. Friend did, to put the necessity for sustainable procurement in the appropriate context. He was right to say that, in the recent Budget, we published three carbon budgets&mdash;the first such budgets in the world&mdash;requiring substantial and stretching reductions in carbon emissions. He expanded his definition of sustainable procurement to encompass other aims&mdash;equality, social issues and innovation&mdash;in addition to green sustainability. I hope that he recognises that the Office of Government Commerce is keenly aware of the re-engineering processes in procurement that will have to feed into society's efforts to cut carbon emissions by 80 per cent. by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">At my instigation, we have published a series of pamphlets. &quot;Buy green and make a difference&quot; deals with waste, sustainability and environmental efficiency, but others cover social issues, equality and innovation. It is important to recognise that there has been a change in approach. I was anxious to proceed with that and to get over the default option of a narrow definition of value for money, which is clearly a bane of my hon. Friend's life when considering the potential for reaching targets other than value for money and having a whole-life cost view of what can be achieved with capital expenditure and procurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">My hon. Friend asked about the amount that the Government spend on procurement and he had the right figure: &pound;175 billion. There is enormous potential to achieve more value for money from that expenditure, and I share his exasperation that that does not always happen. He gave some examples. One explanation for the situation is the diffuse nature of the procurement process throughout central Government and the whole public sector, because many of those who are responsible for procurement work in their own areas, often with a narrower view of value for money than we might want promulgated nationally, which is part of the reason behind producing the pamphlets.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/5">In expanding the view of what value for money is and embedding a more active and innovative approach to whole-life costs, which my hon. Friend urged me to do, we must ensure that we improve the capability, confidence and professionalism of procurers throughout the whole public sector. My hon. Friend said that some people in the private sector are more confident in this area than those in the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/6">My hon. Friend also mentioned something that crops up whenever I go out and talk to public procurers: the dead hand of EU procurement law. It is often used as an excuse for not doing things differently. There is often, but not always, a tendency for those in public procurement to be defensive about doing that and to take a narrower view of value for money, rather than taking account of the increasing need to take a wider, whole-life cost view and to be innovative about what other value can be achieved when letting a contract. It is all to easy, for a quiet life, to say that nothing innovative can be done with apprentices or equality issues in specific areas because the EU does not allow that. The EU does allow it if the processes are right, as my hon. Friend rightly said.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/7">I am sure that my hon. Friend has perused some of the OGC publications, which I wanted out there to get over the refrain, &quot;The EU will not let us do it this way.&quot; Actually, the pamphlets demonstrate precisely how the EU allows public procurement to take account of some important advantages, and I hope that my hon. Friend recognises that we have made progress in getting that fact over.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.1/1">It is a great pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Hancock. I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting this vital subject for debate in a long slot, especially as it precisely coincides with this year's Christian Aid week. I shall focus my opening remarks on the international development implications of tax avoidance and evasion and then highlight the impact on the UK Exchequer and our society of the corporate culture of tax avoidance that has taken root in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/2">As the Finance Minister of South Africa, Trevor Manuel, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the correct spelling of the word 'aid' is 'T-A-X'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/4">It should be a source of consensus, or a no-brainer as the tedious phrase goes, that tax is the most sustainable source of finance for development work in poor countries. It promotes accountability and allows Governments to generate revenue from their nations' economic activity to invest in their own infrastructure, health care and education. A broad tax base improves representation and accountability between states and citizens. It encourages good governance, as Governments who depend on their citizens for revenue are more likely to act in the interests of the people.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/5">Because promoting economic development for all means greater revenues for the state, Governments have a vested interest in ensuring that economic growth is shared among the population. Progressive taxation also benefits the poor by redistributing wealth through society, and it can limit consumption that has harmful effects on society or the environment through the levying of heavier taxes on products and services. Angel Gurr&iacute;a, the head of that international free market acolyte the OECD, certainly believes that. He has observed that</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/6" class="indent">&quot;taxes provide the long term financial platform for sustainable development. Taxes are the lifeblood of state services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/7">It is estimated that between $500 billion and $800 billion of illicit capital flows from developing countries every year. Of that, $160 billion is lost through commercial tax evasion&mdash;or &pound;20 million during this 90-minute debate. It is about twice the annual bill for global aid from rich countries to poor countries. It is also several times larger than the $40 billion to $60 billion that the World Bank estimates will be needed annually to meet the United Nations millennium development goals, which are intended to halve poverty by 2015. If that money&mdash;that avoided tax&mdash;was allocated according to present spending patterns in poor countries and with the same degree of effectiveness, the additional revenues could, among other things, save the lives of 1,000 children under the age of five every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/8">There is much discussion about the role of tax havens in facilitating these capital transfers. It is recognised by, among others, the current Pope&mdash;he must be infallible&mdash;that offshore centres play a major role in the imbalances of development, causing a gigantic flight of capital that is the result of tax evasion. Christian Aid estimates that, between 2005 and 2007, &pound;35 billion of illicit capital flowed from non-EU countries to the United Kingdom as a result of trade mispricing&mdash;a practice whereby multinational companies sell goods and services across borders at inflated or sometimes deflated prices to minimise their tax burden. Of that, &pound;5 billion of illicit capital flowed into the UK from the world's 49 poorest countries. That is almost equivalent to the Department for International Development's entire programme budget for 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/9">The estimable researcher on these matters, Professor Prem Sikka, has pointed out that transfer pricing is used as a &quot;key mechanism&quot; for dodging tax by multinationals all over the world, yet its abuse is scarcely on the political agenda. These are not abstract figures. They represent essential services that the world's poorest people are being denied by merciless and venal exploitation, not just of individual states but through the lack of regulation applied to the global movement of capital.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.0/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the plight of children between the ages of one and five. He will know that malaria particularly attacks those children, that it affects 40 per cent. of the people in the world and that it infects 500 million people each year. Can he estimate just how much good it would do for mankind if just 5 per cent. of the tax that is avoided was put towards malaria research?</p>

	<p pid="a.98.1/1">I agree, and Zambia would be a great example. Soon after I qualified&mdash;it was quite a few years ago&mdash;I was on the point of moving to one of the towns in the copper belt in Zambia to work as an accountant, but it did not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">Evidence so far shows that TIEAs have produced only a trickle of information. For instance, the TIEA between the US and Jersey&mdash;two of the biggest players in the offshore system&mdash;was used only four times in 2008. States may also maintain or introduce other restrictions on the procedures for obtaining or supplying information. For example, some states consider that before any information is supplied, the person concerned must be notified of the request and given an opportunity to object. That, of course, gives tax evaders ample opportunity to cover their tracks, which highlights again the culture of secrecy and privilege that the activities of powerful multinationals are afforded by domestic and international authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">The Government must recognise that automatic tax information exchange between all jurisdictions, including tax havens, is the only system that can deliver rightful tax flows to poor countries. The Minister's response to that specific point would be immensely helpful and much appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">Of course, some will argue for a bilateral agreement on tax information exchange. Indeed, the Government have argued against automatic TIEAs, saying that developing countries might not have the capacity to use the data that would be transferred and that the information transfer would thus be for nought. That argument is patently absurd and deeply patronising to developing countries. It suggests that they do not have, and could not quickly develop, the ability to deal with large quantities of data of the sort that automatic information exchange would generate. In fact, many developing countries already use international software and data sources to deal with vast quantities of data&mdash;most obviously, when one's passport is scanned at any customs point when entering an airport in almost any country at any income level.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">At present, no one can tell what profits are made by companies operating in developing countries, or what taxes they have paid there, because companies are obliged to provide only a total profit figure for the whole world. That is an open invitation to avoid or evade tax liabilities&mdash;an invitation that most companies take, given the $160 billion figure for tax evasion and avoidance that I cited earlier. It is critical that the Government actively try to secure an international accounting standard on country-by-country reporting. That would provide investors, regulators and tax authorities with a powerful indicative tool to assess risks and highlight abuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6">An international accounting standard for all industries that would require companies operating internationally to disclose the profit that they make and the tax that they pay in each country in which they operate would equip developing countries with the information that they need to target corporate tax abuse. To secure an IAS on country-by-country reporting, the Government, acting in alliance with other leading economies, would need to ask the International Accounting Standards Board to create such a standard. It is important to note that the gang of four&mdash;the four big accountancy firms of Deloitte, Ernst and Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and KPMG&mdash;are represented on the IASB, so they have a direct say in setting international accounting rules and standards. Interestingly, Christian Aid's proposals for the country-by-country reporting of corporate profits, which are supported by ActionAid, have been rejected by the big four, and no convincing argument has been posted to date to explain why, although we can draw our own conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">The IASB is little more than a trade association for international accounting firms that is funded largely by the gang of four and other corporate entities. It might be time to relieve it of responsibility for setting international accounting standards. Perhaps that should be passed to a supranational body such as UN so that appropriate mechanisms can be developed. I am not sure whether that idea was floated at the recent G20 summit&mdash;perhaps the Minister will tell us&mdash;but the current situation is untenable. It demonstrates, once again, that in spheres as important as global accounting, self-regulation does not work&mdash;it militates against the public interest and the public in the poorest countries. However, G20 Governments should commit themselves at least to approach the IASB in support of a country-by-country profit reporting system. I hope that we will receive an assurance that such an approach will be made today.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">If implemented, the measures would have the potential to deliver a sum that would have a big impact towards eliminating poverty on a scale never seen before and achieving and embedding the millennium development goals. The Minister, who is a highly regarded, efficient and conscientious member of the Administration, might be able to elaborate on the UK's interpretation of the G20 agreements on the regulation of capital flows to tax havens, and the way in which the impact on developing countries can be reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9">On <phrase class="date" code="1789-05-12">12 May 1789</phrase>, William Wilberforce made his first major speech in the House of Commons on the abolition of slavery. He argued that slavery was morally reprehensible and a matter of natural justice. Tax evasion on the present massive scale has been described as the most harmful economic condition since slavery, as it contributes to the desperate global poverty endured by millions every day. The financial crisis has presented us with an opportunity to reform the economic system and to address global injustices, which are hugely damaging to the world's poorest people. Left untouched, the current system will for ever cast doubt on the legitimacy of profits derived from corporate activity in poor countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/10">I do not have time to deal with the role of the Commonwealth Development Corporation, which was rebranded as the CDC on privatisation. Why do we allow the corporate culture of &quot;greed is good&quot; to spread into international development policy to such an extent? The Minister will not have time to answer all my questions, but the Government must answer them at some stage, and be forced to do so if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/11">Finally I turn to the impact of tax avoidance in the United Kingdom, which is another area in which reform is overdue. We need to combat the advances made under such a highly dubious corporate culture. It is a tale of merciless profiteering that again features the infamous gang of four. Government borrowing is about to double, but we should not expect private householders alone to bear the brunt of the problems caused by the failure of regulators and the City.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/12">I strongly support and applaud President Obama's action to close tax loopholes, including offshore tax havens, that are exploited by US companies, which we read about in the press a day or two ago. The new Administration in Washington estimates that US companies paid an effective tax rate of 2.3 per cent. on the $700 billion that they earned in foreign profits in 2004, so action is long overdue. I hope that there is more to come. I urge the Government to display similar principles and conviction in dismantling the tax avoidance industry in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/13">As we know from a series of excellent articles by the tax gap team of <i>The Guardian</i>&mdash;I referred to it in an early-day motion at the time&mdash;the tax avoidance industry and its clients will go to exceedingly convoluted lengths to avoid their full liability. The evidence of Barclays bank's commitment to stretching Denis Healey's famous prison cell wall that exists between tax avoidance and evasion is not only astonishing, but significant for gaining an understanding of the relative ease with which existing tax laws may be manipulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/14">There is a compelling argument that complex tax avoidance strategies were a major factor in the collapse of our over-leveraged and indebted financial system. However, the bottom line is that HMRC annually loses a minimum of &pound;25 billion in tax revenue as a result of the tax avoidance activities of the wealthiest individuals and 700 largest businesses. This places an unfair and intolerable burden on working families, small businesses and pensioners at the best of times, but during a recession, when general taxation is expected to increase to meet the Government's higher borrowing, that potentially toxic load that could fuel serious civil unrest.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/15">As an accountant myself, I have been studying the special purpose vehicles and other formulae used to channel funds offshore to avoid tax liabilities. We all need to be aware of the damage that such complex instruments wreak on the public purse. We do not let scientists develop chemicals that have a destructive environmental impact, so we should never exempt accountants from the social consequences of their actions, no matter how lucrative their proposals might be in the short term.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/16">The Public and Commercial Services Union's tax justice campaign, which builds on the work of its members and that of the Tax Justice Network, focuses on the loss of local tax offices and the consequent problems for HMRC when tackling tax avoidance. Given the Chancellor's Budget announcement just two weeks ago of more resources for HMRC to devote to closing tax loopholes and tackling tax avoidance, it is vital that the programme of so-called efficiency measures does not include the continued closure of local tax offices, as that is akin to tying one hand behind HMRC's back as it tries to deal with the serried ranks of accountants employed by private sector firms to avoid tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> on raising this important subject. He, I and others have been lobbying Ministers and HMRC to do something about it for several others, and we have always received an interested hearing along the lines of &quot;Gosh, we didn't know that!&quot; but no action has resulted. Now that we are in a recession or near-depression, and the manipulations, greed and derelictions of the financial sector have produced their own nemesis, something will clearly be done. When the Minister speaks, and when Ministers do act, however, I hope that they will not just fob us off with the idea that everything is very difficult and that we can act only through international agreement. As my hon. Friend said, there are actions that this country can take at a national level.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/2">One of the basic problems that we face is the avoidance of taxation through the formation of holding companies, which can be found around the world. Thirty per cent. of Barclays subsidiaries are in tax havens, Lloyds has 80 holding companies in Jersey and BP has 3,000 holding companies, and such companies are used to manipulate profits. News Corporation is very adept at that. It makes huge profits from <i>The Sun </i>and now from Sky television, which do not pay tax on their earnings in this country as they should, because those earnings are manipulated through holding companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/3">Google is a classic instance. It must generate between &pound;1 billion and &pound;2 billion of its &pound;7.5 billion worldwide profits in this country. It is headquartered in Ireland, and the money is filtered out through Ireland. It does not pay any tax in Ireland, so the Irish get no benefit from providing the European headquarters&mdash;ultimately, the headquarters are in Bermuda. Google has more advertising revenue than ITV, which produces programmes in this country, but it does not pay tax on that revenue and is making no contribution to production in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/4">Last year, in an interesting pamphlet entitled &quot;The Missing Billions&quot;, the TUC estimated&mdash;its estimates are very moderate&mdash;that such practices cost the British taxpayer &pound;25 billion in lost revenue. That will become increasingly important, because we need the revenue to repay the debts that we are accumulating as a result of trying to expand the economy at a time of deflation. Individuals are failing to pay &pound;13 billion in tax in this country, while companies are failing to pay &pound;12 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.1/5">As my hon. Friend said, we can deal with the problem through action in this country. We need not to tax companies registered as subsidiaries, but to view corporations and multinationals as a whole. We need a unitary tax system with formulaic apportionment. Where is the revenue generated? As my hon. Friend said, we need national accounts of what is generated where so that we can tax in this country the revenues accruing from profits, plants and workers in this country. Such a system of unitary tax with formulaic apportionment operates between states in the United States and it could well operate here. Why do we not introduce it? That would put an end to the loss of tax capacity and tax revenue in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> on securing the debate. This is a very topical issue and he presented the case extremely well. Rightly, the focus has been on tax havens&mdash;the common theme is secrecy&mdash;which my colleague, the noble Lord Oakeshott, called</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2" class="indent">&quot;sunny places for shady people.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2009-03-26.772"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 26 March 2009; Vol. 709, c. 772</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/3">People go to the British Virgin Islands or the Caymans not because they want financial expertise but because they have got something to hide, even if there are other reasons why people want secrecy.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/4">The debate is on the revenue side. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> rightly asked for an evidence base. There is fragmentary evidence. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs estimated three years ago that the British Exchequer was losing something in the order of &pound;10 billion to &pound;40 billion a year&mdash;a wide range&mdash;to tax avoidance and evasion activities of various kinds. Richard Murphy, who has rightly been praised for his practical work on the matter, has estimated that HMRC is losing something in the order of &pound;18 billion specifically through tax havens. High net worth individuals account for about half of that through legal avoidance; &pound;3 billion is lost through corporates; and the rest is lost to illegal evasion. A lot of evidence has come through in the past few years, for which <i>The Guardian </i>has rightly been praised, on corporate tax avoidance, as distinct from evasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/5">In 2005-06, a third of British companies in the FTSE 100 paid no tax at all on their profits&mdash;none whatever&mdash;and a third paid very little. We have an extraordinary state of affairs. The average corporate tax rate for small companies in Britain is 21 per cent., which is supposed to be concessional, but the average tax paid by big companies is 20 per cent., because the latter have access to the lawyers and accountants that the former do not. That is utterly perverse.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/6">Before I go any further, we need to clarify the language. We all use the words &quot;avoidance&quot; and &quot;evasion&quot;, but there is clearly a continuum&mdash;it is not one or the other. On the one hand, there is outright criminal activity, and on the other the form of tax avoidance that all taxpayers engage in when the Government, sometimes rather foolishly, openly give a differential that invites people to take advantage. We had a good example in the Budget: we now have a 50 per cent. top rate tax on earnings, but only an 18 per cent. rate on capital gains tax, which is an open invitation to perfectly law-abiding individuals to turn their income into stocks so that they can pay tax at a much lower rate. We cannot blame people for that. The measure could have been simple incompetence, but it could also have been deliberate.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/7">Somewhere between avoidance and evasion is a very grey area, on which the debate has centred. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1600" name="Austin Mitchell">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> helpfully described the complex structured arrangements in which organisations such as Barclays engage. I believe that Barclays has 110 specialists working on the absolute edge of the margin between evasion and avoidance, so that they stay on just the right side of the criminal law. They nevertheless have the very clear intention of avoiding paying UK taxes, which is our main concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/8">The big question that the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire asked was, what do we do about it? It is partly about taking international action and partly about domestic policy. Internationally, the fundamental issue raised by the G20 was transparency, and he raised two of the three key issues, the first of which is the automatic exchange of information. The current OECD white list is very good at creating transparency, but it leaves substantial hurdles when it comes to getting information from tax havens. Information exchange has to made automatic to be effective. As he mentioned, the Government are resisting such a measure. There are good reasons for resisting automatic exchange in some cases&mdash;one would not want automatic exchange of information with, say, Mugabe's Zimbabwe, for human rights reasons&mdash;but, as a general principle, between countries that have satisfactory human rights, automatic exchange of information should be the norm.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/9">The second transparency issue that the hon. Gentleman raised was country-by-country accounting. As several hon. Members mentioned, it is an issue for the IASB. There is a lot of foot-dragging, and political leadership is needed, but that is the way to stop the systematic abuse through transfer pricing, the manipulation of profits and the minimisation of corporate tax payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/10">The hon. Gentleman did not mention the third transparency issue, namely the identification of the beneficial owners of trusts and companies. A lot of tax avoidance through tax havens takes place by hiding the names of the ultimate owners. The EU savings directive precludes that, but it is not being enforced. One difficulty that the UK has in being righteous about the matter is that our trust system is incredibly opaque. Many trusts are never registered and other countries might reasonably ask, &quot;Why are the British getting heavy-handed about this when their own system of tax law in relation to trusts is so opaque?&quot; Until we deal with that problem, it will be impossible to crack down effectively on the tax haven system.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/11">On the specifics, the Prime Minister has now taken the initiative of writing to all our Crown dependencies and overseas territories and challenging them to come up with standards of behaviour that meet the requirements of the G20 and OECD systems. That is a step forward. One could legitimately ask why he did not take that step 12 years ago, but he has done it now. I guess that he did not introduce the measure earlier partly to protect the City, which has sustained many such relationships, and partly because DFID encouraged many of the territories to get into tax haven activities supposedly as a way of making their economies sustainable. That was foolish, as the hon. Member for Banbury pointed out, but we are stuck with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/12">What action is going to be taken to follow up that initiative? I have two specific questions for the Minister. First, what sanctions are going to be taken against the seven British territories that are on the OECD grey list which do not even comply with the OECD's fairly modest demands? What powers do we have in respect of those territories to which the Prime Minister has written? I suppose that we cannot be too draconian. Fifty or so years ago, when General de Gaulle was annoyed by the tax avoidance activities of Monaco, he cut the water supply off; by the following day, Monaco complied. We are not in a position to do that, but I assume that sanctions against British territories are available. If so, what are they?</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/13">Secondly, the three United Kingdom Crown dependencies&mdash;Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man&mdash;comply to pretty high standards under the OECD rules, but they do not automatically exchange information. What steps are being taken to make them comply with that higher requirement which, I think we have agreed in the debate, is necessary to make the crackdown on tax havens effective?</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/14">That deals with the international dimension, and I wish to pose a series of questions to the Minister on domestic policy in my remaining three minutes. First, what resources are the Government putting into HMRC to crack down on avoidance activities such as the complex structured arrangements in the banks that have been described? My understanding is that the budget for the relevant department within HMRC was cut by 5 per cent. for the current financial year. Is that true? What is being done to ensure that HMRC is properly resourced to pursue its activities? Is it true, as I have been told, that HMRC is not yet even so much as investigating the information that came to light as a result of the German crackdown on Liechtenstein? That brought to light a lot of British names. As far as I know, they are not being investigated. Is that true? What will be done following the Government's promise to name and shame companies and individuals who are engaged in systematic tax avoidance? What form will that action take and when will it start?</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/15">Secondly, as the hon. Member for Leeds, East said, we cannot be in a position in which the Government are guaranteeing banks and simultaneously allowing them to participate in tax avoidance activity. There is a lot of ambiguity about that. It is clear that the Government intended that the beneficiaries of the asset protection scheme comply with British tax rules, but in subsequent statements, including to me, the Chancellor has said that it is a separate issue. How separate an issue is it?</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/16">On the legislative provisions&mdash;several hon. Members referred to this&mdash;there has been a general expression of belief that we need to move to general anti-avoidance rule processes. What is the Government's time schedule for that, and do they have any specific provisions to introduce a purposive rule in order to ensure that the courts, when dealing with marginal cases, are clearly directed to ensure that companies and individuals seeking to avoid paying taxes are prosecuted?</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/17">The hon. Member for Great Grimsby correctly described how companies establish subsidiaries for the purpose of avoiding tax. My understanding is that such subsidiaries are required to be disclosed under the Companies Act 2006, but evidence unearthed by newspapers investigating the issue suggests that they are not being registered. They are not compliant with the law. Are the Government investigating the matter? Is action being taken against companies that do not comply with those legal processes?</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/18">Thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Hancock. I think that we all recognise that raising revenue is now a critical task, given the serious problems with the public finances. We should start by cracking down on the people who do not pay the taxes that they should pay.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.1/1">I am delighted to be having this debate at such an appropriate time, and I am very pleased to see the Minister, with whom I often exchange shots across this Chamber. I am also very pleased to see, behind me, the hon. Members for Stafford (Mr. Kidney) and for Cannock Chase (Dr. Wright), who have been, and are, closely involved in whistleblowing issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/2">The debate is absolutely relevant. First, the country was staggered by the revelations from mid-Staffordshire, after which people inevitably asked why no doctor or senior nurse appeared to have spoken out. Then, at almost the same time, we got the answer with the case of the whistleblower from Brighton. She admitted that she had done wrong in breaching confidentiality, but felt that she was doing good by exposing publicly and effectively the standard of hospital care. She thought that was exactly the right thing to do, but she has been struck off. That has raised an absolute furore in the press, and there has been a petition by the Royal College of Nursing. The letter that I liked best was a short and brief one in <i>The Independent</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-20">20 April</phrase>, from a lady called Fleur Ball, from Plymouth, who wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/3" class="indent">&quot;I surely can't have understood this properly. A nurse has been struck off, not for failing to care for elderly, terminally ill patients, but for breaching their confidentiality by revealing how little care they received...And this only after alerting managers to the appalling lack of care given on that ward.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/4">I looked up the Nursing and Midwifery Order 2001 and discovered that the conduct and competence committee has four options of punishment when it feels that allegations that have come before it are well founded. In this case, it elected to give the harshest punishment because, according to the report of the judgment, the panel's view was that</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/5" class="indent">&quot;the misconduct found is fundamentally incompatible with being a nurse.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/6">It is not my place to express a particular opinion about the correctness of that decision, because it could well go to appeal, but one can say that it has been an absolute disaster for anyone in the NHS who was thinking of whistleblowing. Surely, the habit of leaving helpless elderly patients in pain, in filthy beds, without food or fluid, is incompatible with being a nurse, or indeed a doctor, if he or she condones it by not speaking out.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/7">Recently, the Select Committee on Health had a trip to New Zealand, which was a long way to go, but was extremely useful. I have the Chair of the Committee's permission to comment on one or two things. We met the chair of New Zealand's Quality Improvement Commission, who told us:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The excuse, 'I'm too pushed to do better,' is rubbish.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/9">The Royal College of Nursing has produced a very useful booklet called, &quot;Dignity at the heart of everything we do: Defending Dignity&mdash;challenges and opportunities for nursing&quot;. It says in the executive summary:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/10" class="indent">&quot;As one nurse explained: 'I believe there is always a way around obstacles and primarily it is you, yourself, your actions, standards and behaviour that deliver care.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/11">So, however pushed people are, it is up to them to get over those obstacles, and that should be possible even on the most stressful occasions. Otherwise, people should at least speak out and say that they cannot do something, and say what they need to be able to do it. Therefore, I ask the Minister an absolutely straight question: is there no way of reviewing or reversing the independent panel's decision to strike that nurse off, other than appealing to the High Court?</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/12">Turning to Stafford, about which much has been said and written&mdash;there was an exemplary debate on it in this place recently, which was led by the hon. Member for Stafford&mdash;several hon. Members have expressed their amazement that there were apparently no staff whistleblowers there. Dr. David Colin-Thom&eacute;, the Government's GP tsar, wrote in the introduction to his review of the lessons learned in mid-Staffordshire:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/13" class="indent">&quot;What has particularly shocked and disappointed me is that no NHS organisations, staff or representatives of the public reported any serious concerns about emergency services in the hospital. Yet patient complaints and patient surveys all pointed to poor care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/14">We need to know whether senior doctors and nurses attempted to speak out and whether they were silenced. I know that the Government are against it, but an independent inquiry is probably the only way to find out. I have permission to raise this matter in the Health Committee tomorrow, when I will see if its members will consider taking on an inquiry into whistleblowing. Personally, I am not sure whether that would be the best way of getting at doctors and nurses, and I might suggest, tomorrow, that a small group of Committee members, who are not in any way related, geographically, to the problems in that area of Staffordshire, could go there and meet one or two representatives, completely anonymously, just to talk about what they tried to do, if they tried to do anything.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/15">My interest in whistleblowing arose after a number of complaints at home about the out-of-hours service that has taken over in Worcestershire. Three staff have talked to me about their concerns, which I quickly passed on to the chair and chief executive of the primary care trust, with whom I have a very close relationship, and I am glad to say that they are taking it very seriously, having ordered an independent review. Already, sources tell me, that service is improving, so I have not had to go to the press about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/16">Why are staff scared? Allegations of bullying in the NHS are rife. If we look at back editions of the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, the editions of <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-02">2 April</phrase>, <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-16">16 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-23">23 April</phrase> all had articles about bullying in the service. Thinking about it from the point of view of senior nurses and senior doctors, they are dependent on their managers for their jobs, their mortgages, their advancement, their salary and their salary increments. What has changed from my day? I am often accused of being a dinosaur, and it was some time ago, but in my day a hospital was run by a team that included a senior nurse, a consultant and an administrator. They were all part of the team that ran the hospital, delivering the best care possible for their patients, and there were no secrets&mdash;they knew what was going on. If they had a bad doctor, or if the standard of nursing was appalling, they knew about it and addressed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/17">The Minister probably will not like what I am going to say next, but since the purchaser-provider split, the emphasis has had to be on finances, competition and targets, primarily, other than patient outcomes. A split has occurred between managers and staff, and that can lead to these sorts of disasters. In some cases, but not all, it is noticeable that when a doctor or nurse moves from a purely clinical role to one that involves a large amount of management, their loyalty is tested. Are they fully loyal to the patients and staff, or to the management of the trust? That is where a problem arises. What can be done about that? I have one or two suggestions.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/18">First, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 is vital. I obtained a copy of a health service circular produced way back in 1999, at the back of which an annex provides a summary of the main provisions of that Act. The most useful paragraph is the one headed &quot;Wider Disclosures&quot;, which is so important I must read it out because I desperately want the Minister to publicise it widely. The circular states:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Wider disclosures (e.g. to the police, the media, MPs, and non-prescribed regulators) are protected if, in addition to the tests for regulatory disclosures, they are not made for personal gain and if they satisfy a further two provisions. That is the concern must have been raised with the employer or a prescribed regulator, unless, there was reasonable belief of victimisation...there was no prescribed regulator and there was reasonable belief that there would be a cover up, and the matter was exceptionally serious. If one of these preconditions is met and the tribunal is satisfied that the disclosure was reasonable, the whistleblower will be protected.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/20">My first suggestion is that that paragraph is widely publicised.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/21">The hon. Member for Stafford had two&mdash;he had more, actually, but I refer just to the first two&mdash;board meetings in public. Of course such meetings have to be in public. People must be given a chance to report what is going on and their suspicions. Again, in Prime Minister's questions today, I think the right hon. Gentleman mentioned that there should be stronger patient and public involvement. We have these funny things called LINks&mdash;local involvement networks&mdash;which are very variable across the country. Where were they in Stafford? Presumably, they had not really got off the ground&mdash;in fact, all over the country LINks have been slow to set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/22">I shall mention another point from New Zealand. In one hospital that we visited, it was a strategy for all the staff to ask whether the patient would pass the granny test&mdash; &quot;Would you mind your grandma being in that hospital?&quot; I do not think that I have quoted <i>Private Eye </i>before, but I have a regard for that publication and what it sometimes publishes. In the 17 to <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-30">30 April</phrase> issue, we were reminded:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/23" class="indent">&quot;In a 2006 Healthcare Commission survey, only 27% of Mid-Staffs staff said they would be happy to be treated in their own hospital&mdash;a powerful indication that standards were unacceptable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/24">What a condemnation!</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/25">Since this debate was announced, I have had a number of communications. A helpful communication was sent by Dr. Rod Storring, who asked why the question to which I have referred is not still asked. He points out that a number of related questions can be answered by staff anonymously and he suggests that those could be used</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/26" class="indent">&quot;as litmus paper as to whether a Trust is functioning well&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/27">These statements are, I think, still in the staff survey:</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/28" class="indent">&quot;I am able to do my job to a standard I am personally pleased with...I can decide on my own how to go about doing my work...I am consulted about changes that effect my work...Senior managers where I work are committed to patient care...Care of patients is my Trust's top priority...I am able to deliver the patient care I aspire to...Senior managers act on staff feedback.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/29">I agree with Dr. Storring. Those statements should be put to staff anonymously as a litmus paper test of how the trust is doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/30">Finally, I do not know whether this is possible in the UK, but I shall mention a radical change. In New Zealand, they have a health and disability commissioner who is accessible to patients and staff through outreach work. He believes&mdash;these are not quotes; they are his thoughts on the matter&mdash;that patients must have an independent medical opinion available to them and an easily available advocate, which he regards as his job. He would welcome whistleblowers, provided they have a real case about which to blow the whistle and they are absolutely honest. If the mid-Staffordshire and Brighton cases achieve anything to improve the future quality of care, it will be to blow wide open the fact that there is protection for whistleblowers and that they can speak out without fear of victimisation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-06a.130.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1594" speakername="Paul Clark" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="130"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090506/halltext/90506h0011.htm#09050674000083">
	<p pid="a.130.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> on securing this debate on an important issue, and I take on board her request for my Department to consider the issues that she raised. I am proud, as is she, of the Government's achievements and our commitment to our older citizens and those with disabilities to provide the freedom and opportunities, which did not necessarily exist before, of widening the scope of travel. Indeed, in 2000, for the first time, older and disabled people in England were guaranteed some form of minimum concessionary travel regardless of where they lived. That scheme introduced half-price local travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/2">In 2006, the Government developed the scheme to provide greater freedom and extended it to provide free local travel within someone's local authority area. At that time, we allocated a further &pound;350 million through the formula grant&mdash;the rate support grant mechanism&mdash;that funds local authorities to pay for that improvement in service. My hon. Friends will remember that in 2006 the then Prime Minister announced that 11 million older and disabled people would be able to use off-peak local buses free of charge anywhere in England from April 2008. That very scheme, to which my hon. Friend referred, is appreciated by the concessionaires who use it. Whenever I visit places in England, I always take the opportunity to ask people who might be using the concessionary fare about their experience of it, the freedom that it has given them, the improvement that it has made to their quality of life, and the inclusion in society that it has provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/3">To expand the scheme to free local travel England-wide, we allocated a further &pound;212 million through the special grant agreement, which was debated on the Floor of the House, and forms a three-year funding package. There was &pound;212 million last year, and there is &pound;217 this financial year, and another &pound;223 million for 2010-11. The special formula that we introduced made generous allowance for the number of those 11 million who would take up the option, and the number of journeys that they would make. The formula grant was consulted on widely, particularly with local authorities, and took account of hot spots, so that places to which people might travel regularly, such as tourist areas, shopping areas or areas with a large number of concessionaires aged over 60, received more of the pot than others. Overall, there is &pound;1 billion in the system for the statutory concessionary scheme, to which my hon. Friend referred. It comes from central Government pots, and we believe that it is enough to cover the scheme overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.0/4">I turn to some of the options and points that have been raised. My hon. Friend asked why her constituents cannot have the same benefits as people in Wigan, Southport and elsewhere. They can, because the Transport Act 2000 introduced a statutory national minimum scheme, and all local authorities may introduce additions, but they must obviously fund them over and above the &pound;1 billion that we provide collectively.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-06a.131.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-06b.131.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-05-06a.131.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1594" speakername="Paul Clark" colnum="131"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090506/halltext/90506h0011.htm#09050674000085">
	<p pid="a.131.0/1">It was agreed through the usual channels, principally the Local Government Association, that the special grant arrangement should be separate from the formula grant process that funds the lion's share of local government expenditure, and that it should not be ring-fenced. Indeed, my hon. Friend will be aware that our general ethos is to give more power to local government and elected representatives whom we presume will be responsible in meeting the requirements of their constituents and the people whom they represent and work on behalf of.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/2">At the beginning, my hon. Friend asked why those who were gaining did not use the money to improve the service. As the Minister responsible, I say that the powers exist for local authorities to use moneys that are there, whether those moneys have been given through the special grant formula and they have more money than they require or whether they are using their own funds to enhance the statutory minimum that applies throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/3">Let me talk about the reimbursement process, because that will allow me to go on to the claim that fraudulent tickets are possibly being used as a method of reimbursement. I ask hon. Members to bear with me on the reimbursement process. I am the first to admit that it is complicated. However, it should not be beyond the wit of all of us, and indeed it is not in the vast majority of cases throughout the length and breadth of the travel concessionary authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/4">Local authorities have the statutory responsibility to reimburse bus operators for the costs of carrying concessionaires. Therefore, individual authorities need to satisfy themselves that their payments are accurate and need to carry out relevant checks to validate the information passing between them and the bus operators. The underlying principle of the concessionary scheme is that bus operators should be no worse off and no better off. They should not be making a profit out of a national scheme; equally, they should not be making a loss. It is recognised that there are additional costs in carrying people who would not otherwise have travelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/5">The Department for Transport issues guidance to local authorities and bus operators on how to calculate reimbursement. As I said, the process is complicated, which is why I ask hon. Members to bear with me. Two key factors have to be taken into account. The first is the lost revenue from the people who are now concessionaires but would have travelled anyway. Someone in that group might be, say, 61, still going to work and would have travelled anyway, but they will not be paying now because they have access to the Government's generous scheme. The percentage of people who are travelling under the concessionary bus scheme and would have travelled anyway represent lost revenue to the bus company.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/6">The second element is additional costs associated with people who would not have travelled without the free scheme that we have introduced. What are the costs associated with them? There is additional wear and tear from the use of the seats and so on. Additional fuel may be required because of the additional weight. All of those are real things. This is where the tarot cards might have come in useful, because judgments have to be made at local level about who those people are, how many would have travelled anyway and how many would not have travelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/7">Then there is the issue of reimbursement and how payment is made. The most important factor to note is that the element of reimbursement for lost revenue should be based on the average fare that each concessionary traveller would have paid if there had been no scheme. We are starting to see some of the complications that come into the negotiations that have to be conducted at local level with local bus companies. Generally, the DFT advises that the average fare should be based on a basket of fares, taking into account the existence of commercially discounted and multi-journey tickets that would have been purchased by older and disabled people in the absence of a free scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/8">If local authorities are reimbursing bus operators in line with our guidance, it should not matter, for the purposes of reimbursement, what type of ticket is issued to a concessionaire on boarding a bus, because there is no direct correlation between the individual ticket issued and the amount paid to the operator. The most critical issue is where the journey started, because that authority will be charged for the person. Where the person travels to is not a factor in the guidance that we give in relation to the reimbursement to the local bus operator. The key pieces of information that bus operators need to record to facilitate accurate reimbursement are how many concessionary journeys have been made and in which local authority area those journeys began.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/9">However, I will take on board this point; indeed, I raised it not long ago in the Department and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1534" name="Natascha Engel">the Member for North-East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)</phrase> has raised it. I am referring to the confusion that arises if someone is given a ticket that says that they started at A, which is true, but that they are going to B when they are actually going only to C, which is in-between. People will assume that that is what is being charged for somewhere. The confusion that is caused could undermine the scheme if we are not careful, because people will think that that is what is being charged for and it is fraudulent.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/10">I will come to the specific issue of Lancashire in a moment, having outlined how the reimbursement process operates. I share the concern that my hon. Friend has expressed about where the reimbursement is being undertaken using the method that has been described. There is a potential fraud but, as I said, the DFT's guidance is that the element of reimbursement should be based on the average fare and that that should be based on a basket of fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/11">We have discovered through research done by Passenger Focus that 39 per cent. of passholders are making more local journeys by bus now than before they obtained their pass and that 13 per cent. are travelling further than they would have done, because it is free. The DFT guidance is clear. There should not be a correlation between the actual journey taken and the payment, because we would end up with the companies making a profit out of a concessionary scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/12">I am particularly concerned about the claims of fraud in Lancashire. As I said, there is no need for any local authorities to base their payments on tickets actually issued. My officials have made that point to administrators of the Lancashire scheme. I am confident that none of the bus companies would condone overcharging by its drivers. However, it does appear that in Lancashire, the scheme is paid for on the basis of tickets issued. That is certainly a cause for concern, because it is not in line with the guidance given by the DFT.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.0/13">I take on board very strongly the issues raised in the debate. That is a reason why I have met a number of colleagues on both sides of the House to discuss issues relating to the concessionary scheme. We are talking about a minority of the 290-odd travel concessionary authorities, but there are some issues to be dealt with. It is one of the reasons why, since April of last year, we have been considering how we can change the administration of the scheme. In the last week or so, we have issued a consultation paper on the administration of the scheme&mdash;on keeping it as it is, taking it to upper-tier levels or even having a centrally based scheme. That is out to consultation. I urge all hon. Members to read the document themselves and consult, and to take the opportunity to get their local authorities to respond as well.</p>
