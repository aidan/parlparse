<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-18a.243.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" speakername="Derek Wyatt" colnum="243"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080618/halltext/80618h0001.htm#08061892000417">
	<p pid="a.243.2/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this morning, Mr. Chope. It is four years since the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs, the body that is supposed to represent English MPs, has met. We do not have a Grand Committee like the Welsh, Northern Irish or Scottish. The English do not have Secretaries of State, Assemblies or Parliaments. The English have something that has rarely met since 1997: the Standing Committee on Regional Affairs. That is the best that we can do for the largest proportion of voters and the largest number of constituency MPs. That is not appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/2">Today, I shall make some radical proposals for the long-term reform of the British constitution and public finances. They will set me at odds with the policy of my Government and party, but I am convinced that standing still is not an option. The present arrangements are producing growing resentment all over the United Kingdom, particularly in England. I hope that my party will not trap itself by defending the status quo for ever, as that would put the future of the United Kingdom at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/3">This debate has a simple theme. My constituents are living in a half-finished house that costs them money, and they are beginning to resent it. The half-finished house in our country&mdash;the United Kingdom&mdash;has, like so many historic houses, grown up over the centuries without a master plan and according to the needs or whims of successive owners. Nearly 90 years ago, after a long and bitter dispute, we gave the neighbouring property to its sitting tenants&mdash;although some preferred to go on living with us. We spent the next 70 years or so trying to improve our house to make it a better place in which to live and trying to protect it from outside attack. We made no changes to the structure of the house and all the rooms and facilities were shared among all the residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/4">However, in the past 10 years, there has been some major remodelling of the property. We converted the upstairs into a separate flat for the Scots and created another flat with inferior facilities in the west wing for the Welsh. We then persuaded the Northern Irish to live in another flat in the orangery&mdash;although many of them wanted to live with their neighbours next door. All that remodelling failed to create any special space for the English. They went on living in the property, but the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish were still free to walk in and help themselves to the fridge and the drinks cabinet. They could even make rules for the English that they themselves did not have to follow. Meanwhile, the English went on paying most of the household bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/5">More and more of the English, including many of my constituents, are finding that an uncomfortable way to live. They put up with it when there was plenty of money coming into the house, but now that money is scarcer and outgoings are rising, they are beginning to question it. I propose some restructuring of the property so that we can all live in the way that we want to without imposing on one another. I am also calling for a fair and transparent system of meeting the household bills. That will entail replacing the Barnett formula, which, as we know, was intended to be a temporary expedient that would last six months. However, the formula still regulates the financial relationships between the separate devolved entities of the United Kingdom. Our household settles its accounts through arrangements that were set up in the 1970s for reasons that no one can remember and with results that no one can understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/6">Our present constitutional settlement creates anomalies and inequalities. The people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have acquired distinct powers over key public services and other matters that are denied to the English. Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs can vote for policies that apply only to the English and that they have never sought for their own constituents. Despite the recent reduction in the number of Scottish MPs, there are distinct disparities in the value of votes in general elections between different parts of the United Kingdom. The Library note on this debate points out that a Scottish elector's vote is worth 8 per cent. more than an English one, a Northern Irish vote is worth 13 per cent. more and a Welsh vote is worth 21 per cent. more. Where is the equity in that system?</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/7">The people of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have used their new powers, particularly in health and education, to make their experience and entitlements notably different from those of the English. Those are funded by a complex and opaque system of financial transfers. To the English at least, it appears that the other parts of the United Kingdom are being shielded from the full financial consequences of their decisions, for example in relation to free personal care for the elderly. In the measured words of Professor James Mitchell of Strathclyde university:</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/8" class="indent">&quot;the current situation in which the Scottish Parliament provides more generous public policies than elsewhere without having to pay the additional cost is leading to a problem of legitimacy in England.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/9">Before going further, I would like to thank Dominic Webb of the Library's economic policy and statistics section for two papers of great clarity on the murky subject of the Barnett formula. I have also drawn on the work of David Heald of the university of Sheffield and Alasdair McLeod of the university of Aberdeen.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/10">The financial relationships between the nations of the United Kingdom were created haphazardly and with the minimum of public debate. Money is transferred directly in outright grants to the devolved Administrations. Those grants are strongly influenced by the Barnett formula, which automatically allocates increases in public expenditure to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis of their population. Money is also transferred indirectly by the operation of the UK-wide tax and social security system and through public spending on UK-wide public services, such as defence and diplomacy. Official statistics give us some information about the first of those indirect transfers, but not the second. Finally, money is removed from the United Kingdom by the European Union and partially returned to each of its different regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/11">Turning to the Barnett formula, it is universally agreed that no one expected it to last this long&mdash;certainly not its author Joel Barnett who is in another place. He did not even know that it had been named after him and it was not mentioned in his memoirs. We have only debated the Barnett formula twice since 1997&mdash;once when I initiated a debate in 2001 and once recently. I welcome the commitment of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to publish a paper on the Barnett formula in the near future, as a contribution to the Calman commission on Scottish devolution. However, as an English Member, I am concerned about the commission's terms of reference. For a start, it is a Scotland-only review and it will not look at the impact of financial transfers to Wales or Northern Ireland, still less at their impact on England. More importantly, the review aims to come up with recommendations</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/12" class="indent">&quot;that would enable the Scottish Parliament to serve the people of Scotland better, that would improve the financial accountability of the Scottish Parliament and that would continue to secure the position of Scotland within the United Kingdom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/13">The review will be paid for largely by English taxpayers. It is hard to reconcile all those aims.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/14">As many authorities have pointed out, the Barnett formula does not determine the overall size of the grants to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland; it is a mechanism for increasing those grants automatically. The formula therefore perpetuates favourable settlements that were made years ago. However, that was not its intention; quite the opposite. It was meant to produce convergence in public expenditure per capita in each part of the United Kingdom. That has simply not happened. There is a persistent and widening gap between different countries and regions within the United Kingdom in identifiable per capita public spending. Identifiable public expenditure means that which is directed at a specific country or region, or that which has generated a payment or benefit to its inhabitants. That therefore excludes the UK-wide items that I mentioned earlier. However, it does cover 83 per cent. of all public expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/15">Let me unfold some of the figures. In 2007-08, identifiable per capita public expenditure for the UK was &pound;7,790 per person. That works out at &pound;7,535 for the English, &pound;8,577 for the Welsh, &pound;9,179 for the Scottish, and &pound;9,789 for the Northern Irish. Out of all the English regions, the south-east does worst. Each of my constituents receives only &pound;6,512 in identifiable public expenditure. My constituency has the fifth and sixth poorest wards in England. I should like an explanation of how it is that we pay the most tax and it is shifted around the regions but not spent in my constituency. That is undemocratic and unfair. To rub salt in the wound, the south-east region is also one of the most heavily taxed.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/16">Other hon. Members can dispute the calculations&mdash;although they come from the Library&mdash;but they explain why my constituents are becoming tired of living in a half-finished house. The time has come to finish the building and complete the billing arrangements for all the people who live there. All the peoples of the United Kingdom should have the same power to shape the laws and services that shape their lives, but they should also have the same responsibility for paying for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/17">That is why I propose a new kind of Parliament. I accept that the journey will be tortuous and argumentative. Therefore, it cannot be done overnight. I propose a 10-year constitutional convention, at the end of which, I would hope, we would agree to four separate lower Parliaments representing England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. Each would have the same powers. The budgets of the four lower chambers would be settled by those Parliaments. There would not be an income tax for the United Kingdom. There would be an income tax locally; the lower Parliaments would be free to raise income in whatever way they wished to do so, for example by a sales tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/18">Why do I say that? I do not have the figures, but since 1945 the Governments of this country, irrespective of party, have spent billions and billions of pounds trying to create wealth in this country. However, in the last year, the only three regions of Britain that are a plus on the Exchequer are the east of England, London and the south-east of England, so even though we have handled massive subsidies relating to the public sector and private sector investment from overseas, we have yet to find the entrepreneurial spirit in many of the regions and nations of this country. We can go on thinking that we can do that, but I remind hon. Members that in China, as one example, the growth rate in the economy this year is 10.6 per cent. That is 10.6 per cent. of what will be the largest economy in the world in 2020. If we care about what is happening in China, India, Russia and Brazil, we have to frame our constitution and the funding of that constitution with a modern way of looking at what is coming over the mountains, especially from India and China.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/19">I am British and proud to be British; I sign into hotel rooms as British. I want to retain the United Kingdom, so the solution for me constitutionally is to place over the four lower chambers an overarching Parliament, whether it is called a senate or a house of representatives, that will bind in the four countries of the United Kingdom. I would abolish the House of Lords. How each chamber voted and what it did would be a matter for the lower houses, but the upper house might deal with issues such as the environment and foreign policy. It would be for the constitutional convention to resolve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/20">It would be a long and contentious process to agree the powers and responsibilities. That is why I propose a consensus-building mechanism in the form of the convention, with representatives of all the parties and each nation and region of the United Kingdom. Its deliberations would be in public and published and would be open to online participation by voters.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/21">During its 10-year life, the convention would also take the opportunity to define a relationship between all the chambers and the European Parliament. There is a major problem with the MEPs and the 27 countries. Only in Finland are the MEPs charged with coming back to talk in the Chamber in Helsinki. I think that that is a very good idea. I would like to see MEPs not charging down to Strasbourg every fourth week, but being told to come to their national Parliaments to give an account of what they are doing, so that what happens in Europe matters to us in the national Parliament. There is a grave error in the constitutional way in which Europe works currently.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/22">I would expect the convention, at the end of the 10 years, to come up with a set of proposals for each of the chambers. How they vote and so on is a matter for them. All those proposals should be put to the peoples of the United Kingdom in a referendum. I hope and believe that, at the end of the 10 years, the convention would make our government and finances clear, more 21st century than 19th, with a separation of powers and responsibilities, and revenues understood and endorsed by our citizens in an open and transparent process. In each chamber, every representative and every voter would have equal power. In the UK as a whole, all taxpayers would know where their money was. There would be no hidden transfers, and all taxpayers would have control over the spending of their taxes.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/23">It has been argued that a federal system cannot work in the United Kingdom because England is so dominant in terms of population and economic strength. I disagree with that argument. Whatever system we have, the English will always be bigger&mdash;look at the size of the country, the population and the economy. However, we can have a clear separation of powers to allow each nation to create a sphere of influence of its own, escaping the dominance of the English nation at the price of relinquishing any subvention from the English nation. I believe that only a separation of powers will allow the survival of British politics and parties on non-national lines. The real danger is in keeping the status quo.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.2/24">Of course I accept that my proposals are contentious, but we simply cannot carry on as we are. The present constitutional and financial relationships cannot endure. They are arbitrary and opaque, and allow everyone in the United Kingdom to believe that the system is unfair to them. The resulting mutual resentments will lead, I believe, to the break-up of the country in confusion and acrimony. Unless we introduce a constitutional convention, that will happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Is not the problem worse than he describes? A Scottish Westminster MP can vote in this place on hospital provision for my hon. Friend's constituents on the Isle of Wight, but not on hospital provision in his or her constituency in Scotland because it is a devolved matter for the Scottish Parliament. Scottish Westminster MPs can interfere in English affairs, but are not able to interfere in many matters in their own constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.2/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase> not only on obtaining this debate but on his thoughtful and considered contribution. I agree with his central point, that we are dealing with a half-built house&mdash;a constitutional settlement that is unfinished. Devolution for Scotland was a political necessity, as it was for Wales, but the structure of the constitution left after devolution was not thought through. That is why I entirely agree with what I take to be the hon. Gentleman's central proposal, which is that a constitutional convention should take place over an extended period to produce a new constitutional settlement that is fairer and clearer for all the people of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/3">I agree with what the hon. Gentleman said about MEPs and their place in our political life. Their separation from us is one reason for the apparent lack of democracy and democratic legitimacy faced by the European Union. However, although I am not sure how the constitutional convention would end, I am pretty sure that the hon. Gentleman's proposal would be a major runner in the process. I also agree with him that the Barnett formula needs to be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/4">There is some public feeling about the West Lothian&mdash;or West Wight&mdash;question. There is a constitutional anomaly, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> said. However, I do not believe that it bothers people much, as evidence from public opinion polls shows. There is an old saying in Hollywood: if someone says to you, &quot;It's not the money, it's the principle,&quot; then it is the money. That is the point that needs to be grasped.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/5">It is true that if the Barnett formula were to be properly reviewed, if we rethought its needs basis and considered again precisely where the money should go, it would not necessarily have the dramatic effect that those who call for a review sometimes seem to hope for. In any case, the figures on which the arguments are based are not entirely straightforward. The hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said that the figures usually cited are based on about 80 per cent. of public expenditure and do not include such things as defence. That is based on the theory that defence, as a service, is for the entire national community. However, that is not quite true when it comes to expenditure, because defence expenditure is rather more specific in particular areas than is the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/6">If one considers expenditure by region, it can be seen that London does rather well, even without defence. It comes well up the table on expenditure per head, higher even than Wales. That makes me wonder whether there is a relationship between demand for devolution and how much money can be got from the Government. Many, many years ago, I wrote my first academic article: I studied regional expenditure and policy in the 1970s, and the only useful conclusion that I could draw was that the best predictor of regional expenditure was votes for third parties in the 1974 election. I wonder whether the political structure has now changed slightly, such that to the extent that there is a demand for regional devolution, one can get money out of central Government. The south-east and the eastern area of the country is my area, and I am a Liberal Democrat in favour of regional devolution, but to be frank there is little demand for it there. Those are the areas that get the least money.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/7">Underlying the comments of the hon. Members for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner) and for Kettering&mdash;this is slightly less true of the comments of the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey&mdash;about where we should go from here and what constitutional arrangements should be put in place, is some confusion about the idea of representation. If English MPs were to join together to defend the interests of England as England, there would not be a problem. There are so many of us that we could abuse our position to do whatever we wanted. The problem is not representation in the sense of protecting the interests of our constituents&mdash;we are in a strong position to do that as English MPs. The problem is set to arise if Government proposals for specific measures may get through only with the votes of non-English MPs, despite the fact that the measures affect only England. That is a different sort of representation. That is political representation&mdash;the representation of political views.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/8">There are several problems with the idea of representation put forward by those who argue for English votes for English laws. The first is that it does not apply all the way down. When Parliament was dealing with the Greater London Authority Act 1999, we did not have votes for London MPs only. When we discuss the Bournemouth Bill, we do not restrict debate to MPs from Bournemouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/9">Secondly, from a Liberal Democrat point of view, the most important point is that MPs elected for English constituents are not representative of English political opinion. That is because the electoral system&mdash;the first-past-the-post system&mdash;is not representative of political opinion in that way. It is difficult for opponents of proportional representation to argue in the way they often do for English votes and laws. Those of us who support PR have less need to worry about the anomaly in the first place. Why? The main argument against PR is that it leads to minority Government, and it is true that that outcome is more frequent than coalitions. However, it is interesting that all the proposals except that made by the hon. Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey imply that we could have a UK Government with a majority at UK level, but a minority in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/10">Those who propose such an arrangement think that that is all right. In fact, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase>, who has been arguing for what might be called the &quot;English Committee Stage&quot; solution, said in <i>The </i><i>Scotsman</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-23">23 April</phrase> this year&mdash;an interesting date&mdash;that, under his proposal:</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/11" class="indent">&quot;On entirely English business, the government may not get its way. Some people say the government wouldn't be able to function. That is absolute rubbish. Alex Salmond doesn't have a majority in the Scottish Parliament, but nobody says Scotland is ungovernable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/12">It is interesting that those who propose such interim solutions to the problem of English representation do so in a way that undermines their simultaneous objection to proportional representation. They cannot have it both ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/13">The main argument for the first-past-the-post system is that it exists to elect a Government, not to represent political opinion. That is the clearest argument for the present system. However, if we apply first past the post to the problem of English representation, we must conclude that there must be a separate Government for England, and not simply a separate representative body. Will people find that acceptable? There are some problems with such a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/14">That is also the conclusion if we think about maintaining one United Kingdom Government who also run England. It is perfectly possible, especially under the present arrangements, for a Government to have a majority in the UK, but a minority in England, as I said. However, something far more radically challenging is also perfectly possible: namely, a situation in which a UK Government are formed from a party that is in a minority in England, when another party have a majority in England. That would be an extraordinary situation. Such a Government would face defeat on everything all the time. In fact, the Opposition's position would also be quite extraordinary, because they would have a majority in the legislature for their part of the Kingdom, but no ministerial office or responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.2/15">Solutions to the problem that do not include a separate English Government face extraordinary problems of coherence. However, if we look at public opinion and the demands for some sort of solution to the West Lothian question, we see little support for a separate Government, because, as is well known, people are not in favour of creating extra layers of paid politicians. That was one of the main reasons why the referendum on regional devolution in the north-east went the way it did&mdash;the idea went down. People do not like the idea of those extra layers.</p>

	<p pid="a.256.0/1">It is a pleasure to be here under your distinguished chairmanship, Mr. Chope. I am grateful to everyone for leaving me a very reasonable amount of time in which to address all of these complex and important issues. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1819" name="Derek Wyatt">the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey (Derek Wyatt)</phrase> on securing the debate. As we have heard, these are immensely important issues for our country and it is good to have the opportunity to discuss them. We have had a number of very interesting contributions from the hon. Members for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing), for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner), and for Cambridge (David Howarth) and, briefly, from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>, who sadly had more pressing business than to stay for the conclusion of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">We have had a very interesting debate, but I am afraid that I can agree with very few of the propositions that have been put forward. Instead, I want to make the case for the Union, for the United Kingdom, and for the measures that will support it. The starting point for everyone we have heard today is that the Union is a very precious institution for all the peoples of these islands and that we must do everything that we can to preserve and enhance it. I was very pleased to hear the stirring defence of it by the hon. Member for Epping Forest. I agree with every word that she said about that, but unfortunately with very little else that she said, but I will speak about that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">What lies at the heart of all the concerns that have been expressed today is a belief that, somehow, devolution has threatened the continued existence of the Union. That belief is mistaken. It is our view that devolution is not a threat to the United Kingdom; it secures the Union. The virtue of our Union's constitution is that for centuries it has been able to accommodate the differences within these islands. It does so on the basis of asymmetry. Constitutional arrangements to protect the interests of minorities inevitably differ from arrangements to protect the interests of the majority, and this nation, as hon. Members have said, has an asymmetrical balance of power in which England is overwhelmingly dominant in terms of both population and representation in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/4">Asymmetry is what gives rise to the West Lothian question, among other things, but it is not the same as imperfection. The hon. Lady sought to say that it was, but I am glad that she slid away from that proposition in her later remarks. At the beginning, she seemed to be hankering after some perfect symmetry. I think that that also lies behind the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/5">Asymmetry in our constitutional arrangements is nothing new. It has existed for hundreds of years. Legislative devolution in Scotland built on the distinctive Scottish institutions that remained after the Union of 1707, including the legal and educational systems. Extensive administrative devolution, built around the office of Secretary of State for Scotland from 1885, also provided the basis for the creation of the Scottish Executive and Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.3/1">I shall address the question of Select Committees now, because I want to address the idea of an English Grand Committee and say what we are doing to introduce proposals to reflect my hon. Friend's concerns. I accept that we need to do more to consider how better to represent the regions of this country. Since last year, we have been introducing proposals, which I shall address shortly. My hon. Friend asked me what I am proud of. I am proud of this Government's record on constitutional reform and renewal. It is genuinely radical, and it is doing a great deal for the people of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.3/2">There has been a lot of discussion about an English Grand Committee. The hon. Member for Epping Forest said that it should be actively considered. We are actively considering it. We have actively considered it, and it is difficult to see what benefits such a Committee would bring. An English Grand Committee that directly mirrored the other two would have 529 members. It would be impossible for such a Committee to work in the same way as other Grand Committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.3/3">We have, however, proposed the establishment of regional Select Committees to ensure that English regions' different views are taken properly into account, which would support the network of regional Ministers that we have introduced, and which is already working well. We believe that to be a much more effective way in which to ensure that the varied needs of the English people are given focused consideration, particularly in relation to matters that cross the boundaries of even the largest local authorities. Although I cannot agree with my hon. Friend's proposals in their entirety, I hope that he would agree that our proposals at least address the sorts of concerns that he outlined, and believes me when I say that we will bring this forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.1/1">I hope that the hon. Lady will forgive me for not giving way, but I want to come on to the second myth. I was&mdash;very generously&mdash;left a lot of time at the beginning of my remarks, but I have many more important points to make about, for example, the Barnett formula, among other things, which I am sure that hon. Members would like to hear.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/2">A second myth has been floated: that it is possible to define an English Bill. It is in fact extremely hard, and anyone who has observed the legislative process in this House will realise just how difficult it would be to define one. The Higher Education Bill was adduced as an example of how the current system is unfair. At the time, in 2004, that Bill was dubbed a West Lothian Bill by the Conservative party, because student finance is devolved. I think that point was made earlier. However, part 1 of the Bill provided for the Arts and Humanities Research Council, which extended to the whole of the UK. In other words, this Bill, which so often is adduced as an example of an English Bill, was nothing of the sort.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/3">Much more important, however, is the difficulty of isolating any Bill from having an effect throughout the United Kingdom, partly owing to the way in which the Scottish block grant is determined. However, there are other reasons, and I can do no better than to quote the Kilbrandon royal commission on the constitution, because it put the point extremely well. It said that</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/4" class="indent">&quot;any issue at Westminster involving expenditure of public money is...of concern to all parts of the United Kingdom since it may directly affect the level of taxation and indirectly influence the level of a region's own expenditure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/5">That is not a party political point; it is the extremely astute and elegantly expressed comment of a royal commission, and we should all bear it in mind when we discuss these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/6">I come to the Barnett formula and funding, which I think all hon. Members have mentioned today, and which is always a lively issue. We have heard a lot about the inequities of the system, and I should like to correct some common misconceptions about the way in which it operates. Some high-profile devolved administration decisions and much of the associated media coverage have created the impression that there are&mdash;to use the hon. Member for Epping Forest's phrase&mdash;unfair differences between public services in different parts of the UK, and that the devolved administrations receive funding for services additional to those available in England. That is not the case. They receive a block grant to spend on the public services for which they are responsible. The mathematical formula that underpins the Barnett formula has not changed since its inception, including through 18 years of Conservative Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/7">Devolved administrations have pursued some policies that are not replicated in England, but that is what they are there for. By increasing spending in certain areas, such as by giving free prescriptions and personal care, they inevitably have to make reductions in other key public services. That is the part that we do not hear about in all the public discussion on the spending policies of the devolved administrations. This year, universities in Scotland, which are an important part of the infrastructure, will have a real-term reduction in funding, whereas the total grant to the Higher Education Funding Council for England, which distributes public money to universities and colleges for teaching and research, will rise 2.5 per cent. a year between 2008 and 2011. Similarly, health spending in England will rise in real terms by 4 per cent. a year for the next three years, whereas in Scotland it will rise by only 1.5 per cent. We do not often hear about that sort of discrepancy, but it matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/8">It is inevitable that devolved administrations will have different priorities and will make different choices, but that is not necessarily unfair&mdash;it is just different. The two are not synonymous. Another important issue is respite care for the parents and carers of disabled children. In England, it is funded by the Government through a &pound;340 million programme, but in Scotland it is not guaranteed. That is another discrepancy, but it is not necessarily unfair to the people of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.1/9">I was pleased to hear an hon. Member&mdash;not my hon. Friend, but the hon. Member for Cambridge, I think&mdash;mention the importance of need when considering funding. The Barnett formula depends on assessment of need. My hon. Friend did some careful and nice per capita calculations, but with spending figures, the crucial consideration must always be need. That is what determines fairness&mdash;to pick up on the hon. Lady's phrase again. Fairness is absolutely essential; the Government believe that above all else. If one considers fairness in spending, one has to consider need. There will be differences in how precisely one defines it, but it is fundamentally important and one must bear it in mind when one considers the figures. I hope that my hon. Friend will remember that.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.1/1">I am not a London MP, and I hesitate to trespass on these extremely delicate issues. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that if any London MPs were present, they would strongly contest what he says. It is inevitable, with definitions of need, that individual areas will tend to put their priorities highest. Local authorities are always complaining about how unfairly they are treated, whichever part of the country they are in, because their definition of their needs and the priorities given to them are always different. That is true across local authorities and regions, and between Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England. It is inevitable that there will be such differences and arguments. There probably will never be a settled conclusion on precise definitions of need. That is democratic debate and we could discuss it for ever. Need should always be borne in mind, and I am very glad that it was brought into the debate. I hope that my hon. Friend will remember that when he discusses these figures in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/2">We have had an interesting debate, which has shown that devolution will continue to be a matter for discussion, but we believe that it has secured the future of the Union. It is easy to forget what the situation was like in the 1990s when feelings were running extremely high in Scotland. I remind the hon. Member for Epping Forest that the people of Scotland felt that it was being used unfairly as a laboratory for the divisive social and economic policies of the Conservative Government of the time. The people of Scotland still have not forgotten that they were used to test the implementation of the poll tax. Such issues raised tensions to an extremely high level.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/3">Whatever one thinks of the current Administration in Scotland, most people would accept that we have a vibrant devolution settlement. The recent mayoral elections in London, although they did not turn out as I wished, were nevertheless a good advertisement for our vibrant devolved democracy, and will continue to be so. Our measures on devolution have enhanced the constitutional arrangements of this country and have preserved the Union. They deliver essential flexibility and allow the devolved administrations and legislatures the ability to deliver distinctive policies, and it is right and proper that they should do so. The fact that there is also a single Government taking a UK-wide view has enabled us to have the stable macroeconomic policy that has delivered growth year on year for the past 10 years and has kept us in good shape to face the turbulent global economic challenges that lie ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/4">Our constitutional arrangements have delivered a common social security system that assists those who are most in need across the UK, building the common sense of identity that is so important. We have been able to adopt a common approach, which, I hope hon. Members agree, is important for dealing with the challenges of terrorism and formulating common policies on defence and foreign affairs. It is our profound belief that the Union benefits all the people of the United Kingdom. It reflects our shared history and heritage, and supports the successful participation of all the peoples of these islands in a global economy. It promotes our international standing, and I hope that none of us will do anything to damage it. I know that my hon. Friend agrees with me on that, but I am afraid that his proposals would risk&mdash;inadvertently, I am sure&mdash;damaging the Union that is so precious to us all. I hope that he will reconsider his proposal, but I welcome his continued contribution to this debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-18a.264.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1607" speakername="Linda Riordan" colnum="264"  time="010:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080618/halltext/80618h0004.htm#08061892000457">
	<p pid="a.264.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate, which allows me to put on record my concerns about the whole academy programme, both nationally and in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/2">I do not think that anybody will deny the investment that this Government have made in education since 1997, but the debate is about the academies programme. Despite considerable evidence that that system of educational reform simply does not work, the Government recently indicated that the scheme was to be expanded. Whatever Ministers and private sector investors might tell us, the academies programme is the privatisation of our education system in all but name. Why would private investors and multinational companies, one of which phoned me this week to try to influence the debate, be so keen to get their hands on our schools if not for the purpose of profit? The academies scheme is a flawed and futile way to reform education, and will further only the marketisation of public services, not investment and achievement in education.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/3">I do not doubt Ministers' sincerity when they say that they want to improve standards in schools. No one wants a school to decline. However, our main argument should be about how best we can achieve our aims of improvement, attainment and fulfilment, rather than do the opposite. The pro-academy lobby talks about standards purely to justify a move towards a system to which most people are essentially opposed. For example, it looks at a failing or underperforming school and asks people whether they want it to improve. Of course, everyone in the local community rightly says yes. A take-it-or-leave-it offer of an academy school instead of the existing failing school is then put on the table. As one would expect, the investment is welcomed by all, but I am yet to hear a convincing argument that similar investment in a new comprehensive or a smaller through-school would fail to achieve the same aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/4">It seems that Ministers are convinced by the argument that academies work where comprehensives do not, yet the pure facts do not back that up. In my constituency, the Ridings school, a former comprehensive that many hon. Members will have heard of, is merging with Holy Trinity Church of England school to form a new, supposedly state-of-the-art academy venture. It is expected that attainment standards will increase because of the merger, which is the argument that the pro-academy lobby has used to perpetrate the case for academies. However, it is not likely that children who are underachieving in their present schools will receive the care and attention that they require to improve in an academy of 1,000-plus children. Furthermore, it has not been proved that removing accountability from local education authorities is of any potential benefit to a community that is already struggling to keep up with neighbouring areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/5">Although it is premature, the decision to have an academy in Halifax has been taken. However, I am appalled that not enough consideration has been given to whether that fleeting venture will really work and benefit people in that part of my constituency. It seems a short-term fix for a long-term problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/6">I have heard similar stories about academies from across the country. They are seen as an easy answer to the difficult task of providing adequate education in deprived areas with schools that have with low attainment levels and poor Ofsted reports. The idea is attractive to most, with its promises of increased investment, new buildings and a new beginning for underachieving areas&mdash;at least until we scratch beneath the surface. Consultations are rushed and local opinions are generally not surveyed. For example, consultation with parents in Halifax was held during the school holidays, even though the decision had actually been taken well before. So much for being in touch with the feelings of local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/7">Alas, it seems that a new academy will shortly open in my constituency. What worries me most is that it does not seem that enough attention has been given to how it will fit into the current education structure. Perhaps the Minister will tell me differently. With two grammar schools, faith schools and local comprehensives, Halifax does not have the most uniform of school systems. Parents who cannot get their children into the local grammar or Church schools are forced to play the system and send them to comprehensives away from their catchment area, for instance in the neighbouring Calder valley. What is left in Halifax is a last resort for most parents: a modern secondary, the Ridings school. I admit that it has had disappointing exam results in recent years, but it is likely to have an even more unstable future as a new academy after the merger.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/8">Of course something needed to be done about falling standards, but why an academy and why now? In my opinion, the whole ideology behind the academies system has an economic, not an educational purpose. The merger of a well performing faith school in Halifax with an underachieving comprehensive school in an effort to make one super-school, has aggravated many people in the community. Will the Minister tell me what the point of the consultation was, given that my constituents' views were not even taken into account? Are people's views taken on board, and if so, why have they not been reflected in Halifax?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/9">I believe that academies are wrong for four fundamental reasons. I hope that hon. Members will agree with me when they have heard the debate. Those four points have led me to believe that rather than roll out the academies programme further, the Government should consider scrapping the whole thing in favour of a system that local communities actually want. In my case, that is smaller through-schools covering the ages of four to 16 or 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/10">First, academies are anti-democratic. The sponsors nominate the majority of school governors and academies are not under the control or direction of the local authority. In effect, there is no accountability. Secondly, the sponsorship system is flawed. Sponsors are not required to declare who gives them money, so they are entirely unaccountable and out of the control of local councils. Newcastle city council recently wrote to the Department for Children, Schools and Families requesting that an academy sponsor with somewhat dubious habits be removed. Why does that need to be a central Government, rather than local government, decision?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/11">Thirdly, academies practise covert selection. For example, the intake of children with special needs, who may carry poor academic records, can be restricted. Surely we are not encouraging a system of exclusion in this day and age. Furthermore, as academies receive considerably more capital funding than community or foundation schools, they have the potential to undermine local admissions policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/12">Finally, academies have not been proven to rectify poor attainment levels as one would have hoped. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-11">11 June</phrase>, a full list of failing schools was published. Barnsley academy rated sixth from lowest in the country, with only 20 per cent. of its students achieving five A* to C GCSE results.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/13">Despite that, the Government seem determined to drive on, unaware of the dangers that lie ahead. The move away from the comprehensive ideal is contrary to the values and visions at the heart of the Labour movement, and I profoundly regret it. I am not saying that change was not needed in Halifax, but I have not discounted the possibility of better ways to improve education than this back-door privatisation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.1/14">With your permission, Mr. Chope, I shall hand over to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1935" name="Ken Purchase">the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase)</phrase>, who is the chairman of the anti-academies alliance.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.0/1">The new money is almost entirely coming from the Government, because none of these sponsors can say, hand on heart, that they have put their hand in their back pocket and produced &pound;2 million. No one can find evidence of that, simply because they have not done it. What they have done, in many cases, is to sell services to the school that they now own and then pretended that they sold those services at a discount rate, and somehow that counts against their &pound;2 million contribution. I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman has been taken in.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/2">The real boost to education spending has come from Government sources. I must say that the Minister for Schools and Learners, who is here today, has made some real progress, for example, in tightening up the admissions criteria. However, there is little doubt that the academies have found ways and means by which they can overcome the proper restrictions that the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families has put upon them.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">Academies have found ways of expelling more than the average number of students who are expelled from schools. In Walsall, which is next door to my constituency, the new academy replaced a school that had 50 per cent. of its children receiving free school meals. The figure for children receiving free school meals is understood to be a very good single indicator of deprivation within a school population. Guess what, though? The academy in Walsall now has just 11 per cent. of children receiving free school meals. So I share all the fears that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax has expressed about her own constituency and the deprivation there, which I know she deals with daily.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/4">Regarding the sponsors that we have for academies, I mentioned at Prime Minister's Question Time some time ago a conversation that was alleged to have taken place between Lord Harris of Peckham and Lord Adonis, who is a former member of the Social Democratic party, I think. In this conversation that is alleged to have taken place between them, Lord Harris is reported to have said, &quot;Well, he&quot;&mdash;that is, Lord Adonis&mdash;&quot;will ring me up and say, 'Look, I've got this school, it ain't doing this and doing that.' Then, I say to him, 'What's it like with so-and-so?' And if I like it, I say, 'OK, I'll have it.'&quot; Now, in my opinion, that is not the way in which an Education Minister should be conducting affairs that affect the future of thousands of young people, if not many more.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/5">Even more than that, what do we get? Francis Beckett, the journalist, interviewed Lord Harris on these matters and he said that he got his first taste of the entrepreneurial edge that such men can bring to our schools. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/6" class="indent">&quot;I was sat in the back of Lord Harris's limousine. First, he phoned round all his stores and asked for their sales figures, then he phoned round all his schools&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/7">He did so to find out who was in school that morning. That is the kind of nonsense that we are now into.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/8">Education is supposed to be done by educationalists. There is absolutely no evidence at all, not even in the Government's PricewaterhouseCoopers report, that can substantiate in any real sense the claim that academies have brought to the party what they were supposed to bring. They were intended initially to replace really difficult, so-called &quot;failing&quot; schools in our inner cities. When that plan did not work, Lord Adonis announced that he wanted to expand his programme. Would you believe that we now have private schools looking to the Government to help them to become academies and to give them the kind of support that they have craved from the very beginning?</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/9">So now we have a position where, in an interview in <i>The Spectator</i><i>&mdash;</i>Mr. Chope, you will be aware that <i>The Spectator</i> is the Tory house magazine&mdash;Lord Harris stated his view that the only achievement of comprehensive education in this country had been to &quot;destroy&quot; good grammar schools. Lord Adonis is the person that our former Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, who has now retired from that office, put in charge of the Labour party's education policy. I find it absolutely extraordinary that a man who was so opposed to everything&mdash;everything&mdash;that the comprehensive ideal had tried to achieve should be put in charge of that policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/10">I finish by reminding hon. Members of the history. When Butler produced his famous Education Act in 1944, it opened up the possibilities, for the first time, of education for all. In the 1960s, an heroic Labour Government produced the circular that allowed comprehensive education to become the norm. Lady Thatcher actually closed more grammar schools than any other Minister before or since. We have had a genuine advancement of opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/11">However, what we are seeing now is a process of closing down opportunities again, so that we have faith schools, specialist schools and trust schools&mdash;you name it, you can have any school you like, except you cannot get into them. The problem that we now have is not one of diversity; what we have now is the break-up of a truly magnificent ideal of comprehensive education. I say now that, if this academy movement is allowed to succeed, the long, long road that we have all been fighting on to get comprehensive schools available to all, will be further diminished and this country will be the poorer for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1607" name="Linda Riordan">the Member for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan)</phrase> on securing this debate. Along with my other hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1935" name="Ken Purchase">the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East (Mr. Purchase)</phrase>, she has raised some important points and it is helpful for me to have the opportunity to clarify the Government's position.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/2">I will start by providing some context. As, I think, my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax said, it is our ambition that every child benefits from a good education; from a good-quality place in a local school, where high standards set them on the path to achieving all that they are capable of. That is what every parent wants from their local school.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/3">In the children's plan we have made a commitment that, by 2020, at least 90 per cent. of young people will achieve five higher-level GCSEs or more by the time that they reach the age of 19. In order to do that, we have created a floor target under every school, which states that, as an important step towards that 90 per cent. figure, at least 30 per cent. of pupils in every secondary school in the country should achieve five higher-level GCSEs including English and maths, which are the priority subjects, by 2011.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/4">Over the last 10 years, we have made major inroads, which is largely down to the efforts of teachers, pupils and school leaders. In 1997, more than 1,600 secondary schools&mdash;more than half of secondary schools&mdash;were falling short of that 30 per cent. figure. Today, that figure is down to 638, which is about 22 per cent. of secondary schools. However, even one school that falls below that basic floor target is unacceptable. We are aiming for, and will achieve, a target of zero schools failing to reach the target figure by 2011. That is why the Prime Minister is committed to ensuring that every school is above the floor target by 2011. Those that are not will be subject to a formal intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/5">That is why last week we announced the national challenge, which is the next stage of our improvement strategy to help those remaining schools and their local authorities to address the issues, to meet the floor target and, crucially, to provide their students with the good education that is so essential to success in later life. As part of the national challenge, they are being offered a range of support and intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/6">Many schools are progressing well. They are successful but need just a little more support, not radical intervention. Others need considerably more support in respect of leadership, governance, teaching and pupils, and still others need more radical solutions. Even then, different circumstances require different solutions, depending on the particular challenges a school or area faces. That is why we are asking local authorities to prepare plans for their schools. They may involve a merger with another school, closure, or replacement with a national challenge trust school or, of course, an academy, the subject of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/7">The national challenge programme is backed by an additional &pound;200 million reprioritised from existing resources, on top of &pound;200 million already made available in the Budget. That is &pound;400 million of extra funding to support those schools over the next three years. The funding will support the range of interventions and preventions that schools and local authorities need. We will have local authorities' plans by the end of the summer term, and they will include academies. My Department will work with the 26 academies currently below the floor target on exactly the same basis as we would with other schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/8">Academies have a proven track record as a successful solution. They allow staff and pupils to make a clean break from the past and, often, from a legacy of generations of underperformance. They offer new leadership, stronger governance and curriculum freedoms. They have all the ingredients to be able to offer much more flexibility to deal with the problems and circumstances that resulted in their predecessor schools letting down generations of young people by providing an inadequate education. From that flexibility comes real innovation and a stronger ethos. Academies are supremely popular with parents.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/9">As a group, academies continue to have the fastest improving academic performance in the country. Their overall absence rate is down by twice the national rate of improvement. Academies with underperforming predecessor schools saw the proportion of their pupils gaining five or more higher-level GCSEs double between 2001 and 2007. If we include English and Maths, the improvement was still considerable&mdash;more than 11 percentage points, which is significantly higher than the national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/10">Academies are in some of the most challenging areas, and they succeed some of the most challenging schools in the country, often with high proportions of children with special educational needs. My hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton, North-East raised some questions about that. The average number of pupils with special educational needs in academies is 29.5 per cent., compared with the national average of 19.2 per cent., so academies are doing more than their fair share in respect of SEN. The national average for the number of children with free school meal entitlements in secondary schools is 13.1 per cent. In academies, it is 33.8 per cent., so they are doing more than their fair share in terms of educating the more disadvantaged pupils in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/11">They are finally giving our most disadvantaged communities good education and a route to self-improvement. My hon. Friends do not have to take just my word for it&mdash;the fourth PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which was published last year, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The general picture in relation to pupil performance in Academies is one of overall improvement against a range of indicators at Key Stage 3, Key Stage 4 and post-16 levels.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/13">PricewaterhouseCoopers is currently undertaking its fifth and final review, which is due to be completed in the autumn.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.3/1">I must make some progress, because there is a limited amount of time. I know that my hon. Friend will be friendly in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/2">Of the academies that have so far been inspected by Ofsted, 96 per cent. were judged to have good or outstanding leadership, compared with 62 per cent. of secondary schools in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Halifax has raised concerns in the past that the academies programme represents the privatisation of state education. She repeated that today. Let me firmly reassure her on that point, which is simply not true. Academies are state-funded schools. They are funded directly by my Department&mdash;by the Secretary of State&mdash;and they provide free education, often to our most deprived communities and without selection by ability. Whether from the private, voluntary or education sector, academy sponsors bring to their schools a track record of achieving when faced with difficult challenges. They bring dynamism, a commitment to excellence and the backing that the principal and the staff need to succeed in a tough educational environment. Academy sponsors do not and cannot make a profit from their involvement in academies.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.3/4">The most recent changes have been to allow universities and others with a strong educational track record to waive the &pound;2 million entry fee for sponsorship. Also, in July 2006, we set up an endowment model so that the &pound;2 million could be paid over five years, with &pound;500,000 in the first year as part of the endowment. The sponsors of the new academy in north Halifax will be a local university, a local college and a local council, and they will be led by the diocese of Wakefield&mdash;that is hardly privatisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.1/1">The NAO and the Public Accounts Committee work together. I do not think that there is anything biased about the NAO, which gave the academies programme a clean bill of health.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/2">All the sponsors of the academy in north Halifax have considerable expertise in education in the local area and a vested interest in making the school a success.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/3">Academies may not be popular with my hon. Friends the Members for Halifax and for Wolverhampton, North-East, but they clearly benefit staff, parents and pupils and can reverse the fortunes of struggling schools in a short space of time. I am confident that, in time, my noble Friend Lord Adonis will be viewed as a hero of the Labour movement, thanks to the transformation of education in London under his stewardship. London schools now outperform the national average, and in large part academies have been an essential ingredient of that success.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/4">That remedy is something that my hon. Friend the Member for Halifax can look forward to in her constituency. Currently, there are not enough good-quality school places for all the children who need them. As she said, about one third of children are obliged to travel to schools outside their local area. The Holy Trinity Church of England senior school is oversubscribed, with a significant loss of pupils at 16. The Ridings school has twice been in special measures and has been unable to shake the bad reputation it gained in 1996. That is why the decision was taken last year by Calderdale council to close the school in August 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/5">The broader scene in Halifax is much brighter. Holy Trinity school is doing well, with an unauthorised absence rate well below the national average, and 56 per cent. of its pupils achieve at least five higher-level GCSEs including English and Maths. Sadly, only a narrow proportion of local children are able to benefit from its provision, due to the admissions arrangements of the school. The situation will be transformed by an academy with enlarged numbers, which will impact positively across the community. Admissions will be based on proximity, with more choice being opened up to more pupils to be educated locally. An academy will bring a stronger community focus to the local area, drawing together a more diverse population and therefore creating provision that better reflects the area it serves. Crucially, it will drive out some of the failure that the system has seen in recent years and will raise standards for the pupils of Halifax.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.1/6">Academies are not an easy solution. There never is one. For some schools, a bit of extra support will be enough. For others, more profound changes are needed. The programme is about improving schools in a way that best serves the needs of their communities. We believe, along with the local authority and the diocese, that an academy in north Halifax is the right solution. Academies are a proven route to success, to raising standards and to fairer access to a good education for all. The children of Halifax deserve nothing less.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.2/1">May I say how pleased I am to have this opportunity to raise a matter that is of huge importance in my constituency of North Wiltshire and across the county of Wiltshire? Other hon. Members from elsewhere in England will be watching the progress of this debate, because many of my arguments would apply in most other counties across the nation of England. So this is a debate with a broader aspect, despite its title. In that context, I am glad to be joined by two colleagues from Wiltshire: my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase>, who has flown in on the red eye from Washington especially to be here, for which we are grateful, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> sends his apologies: he has an urgent engagement in Salisbury and has been detained there. He would have been here otherwise and I understand that he supports what we will be saying during the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/2">This is a grave and great matter, particularly in my constituency. In the past month or so North Wiltshire district council has been consulting on whether and where it should allow a new gypsy encampment, currently for 24 pitches but, potentially, for 48: there may be two sites of 24. The excellent firm, Humberts, which carried out a survey into the matter came up with a list of six possible sites for this encampment in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/3">It will be no surprise to hon. Members to hear that the people who live next door to each of those encampments have been expressing their opinion on the subject forcfully. There was a meeting in the town of Calne, in my right hon. and learned Friend's constituency last night, attended by 750 people. That is a bigger public meeting than I have seen in my 11 or 12 years as a Member of Parliament. Similarly, a public meeting in Wootton Bassett last week was so large that it had to be divided into three separate groupings. There was a huge demonstration through the town of Chippenham a couple of weeks back, even though we folk in Chippenham do not have many public demonstrations. Public meetings have been held elsewhere. It is a matter of great and grave concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/4">I thought that it would be useful to have this debate and to attempt to focus public attention particularly on where it ought to be and away from where it ought not to be. I entirely deprecate and distance myself from those people who argue on this matter by saying that, in their view, Gypsies and Travellers&mdash;I will return to the precise use of the words in a moment&mdash;are people whom we would not necessarily want to live near. I have to say that that is not my experience in Wiltshire. I know a good number of Gypsies and many of them, particularly the traditional Wiltshire Romany Gypsies are perfectly charming. The police tell me that there is no evidence whatsoever that they are less law-abiding than the rest of us or that they leave more fly-tipping waste. I had a briefing this morning from the Country Land and Business Association, which said that there is no evidence that they are more guilty of fly-tipping than anyone else. I know of no evidence that they are necessarily less good neighbours than the rest of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/5">I deprecate and distance myself from those who have used extreme and difficult language during the debates that we have had in Wiltshire, indicating that as a group or a race these are people whom we do not want near us, because that is not so. It would be wrong if we had this debate along those lines. This debate must be about planning, which some people might think is a boring, dreary matter in some contexts. Nevertheless, it is about planning and the way we handle the need for sites for these people, in the same way as we deal with building houses for those of us of a settled nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/6">Just a word on the way that we describe Gypsies. I use the word &quot;Gypsies&quot; as a shorthand term. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1395" name="Jacqui Lait">the Member for Beckenham (Mrs. Lait)</phrase> picked me up on this matter earlier and suggested that we must be careful about our use of language. She is right. The difficulty with the Government's policy in this area is that they do not differentiate, racially, as it were, between Romany Gypsies and other groups. We have a good Romany population in Wiltshire and they are a particular racial group that tends to use the name Smith&mdash;Maggie Smith-Bendall is one of their great spokesmen&mdash;and has particular genes and chromosomes; they are a discernible racial group. Then there are the Roma, many of whom are coming into this country from Romania, as the name indicates, the Irish Travellers&mdash;we have quite a large number of them&mdash;and the assorted new age travellers, hippies and general drop-outs of one sort or another. The trouble with the Government's consultation on this subject is that they neither differentiate between those groups of people nor where they come from. Some of them have nothing whatever to do with the county of Wiltshire: many of them come from elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/7">At the moment, the southern Irish Government are busy tightening up their rules and regulations about Gypsy encampments and I understand that a substantial number of people in southern Ireland are currently eyeing up England and considering whether to move here. Of course, the standard of life in Romania is extremely poor and large numbers of people there are, equally, considering whether it might be useful to move their caravans to England and, presumably, to Wiltshire, among other places. It is important that we differentiate between the different groups and I will do so. For the sake of shorthand, I will use the term &quot;Gypsy&quot; to encompass all of them. However, it is important that we are clear in our discussions about precisely whom we are talking about and that we do not lump them all together.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/8">An unfortunate episode occurred in a recent planning discussion with regard to the Gypsies who are illegally camped at the village of Minety in my constituency and who have been there for some five years. I will return to that in a moment. During the inspector's consideration of the matter in Monkton Park in Chippenham, the Wiltshire Romanies said that they did not want to live at Thingley junction, a Gypsy encampment near Chippenham with plenty of vacancies available for them, because the people at Thingley were Irish and they were Wiltshire Romanies and they did not like the Irish and did not want to live with them. Equally, the family of Smiths who left Thingley junction some years ago, where they were illegally camped&mdash;they are now camped legally in Pudding Brook in Chippenham&mdash;also fell out with the Irish at Thingley.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/9">That is all very well, but if somebody comes into my constituency surgery next week and says, &quot;I am a Scotsman. I want a council house, but I am not going to stay in the one I'm in at the moment, because the person next door is Welsh and the person on the other side is French and I don't want to live near them,&quot; I will say, &quot;I am extremely sorry. My duty is to help you find proper accommodation, but if you don't like living next door to Welsh people, that's your problem, not mine.&quot; I do not accept that the racism within the Gypsy and Traveller community is any more acceptable than racism outside it. I shall return to that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/10">Before I move on to general policy with regard to Traveller provision in Wiltshire, I shall mention a peculiarity in respect of the site at Minety near Malmesbury in my constituency. Travelling people bought the land that the site is on some five years ago and moved on to it in large numbers over a bank holiday weekend, which is the normal way such things are done. They came on to the site and nobody knew anything about it, concreted it over and built toilet blocks. It was a substantial operation. From memory, there are now 30 or 40 caravans on that site. It is entirely illegal: they have no planning permission&mdash;it is the middle of the countryside&mdash;and they should not be there. The district council concluded that the site breached planning law and that the people should be removed from it. As always happens on such occasions, they have gone through the entire process of the law and explored every corner of the planning law. The final consideration of their illegal encampment is due to be heard in Chippenham from <phrase class="date" code="2008-07-08">8 July</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/11">The conundrum is that the inspector has already said that unless North Wiltshire district council is able to demonstrate that it has provided a site elsewhere for the people at Minety, he will be inclined to allow them to remain in their illegal encampment. Hon. Members might say, &quot;Fair enough. If they can't go somewhere else, fine. Let them stay where they are.&quot; But just think of the precedent that that is setting: it would be saying to Gypsies anywhere, &quot;You may plonk yourself down in any field anywhere and if the district council cannot come up with a decent permanent site for you, we will allow you to stay there forever.&quot; In other words, we are saying to the Gypsy population throughout the world, &quot;Please do break planning law, because that'll force the district council to do what you want it to do to provide more sites.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/12">Let us imagine that a group of homeless or inadequately housed people come to me and say, &quot;I know what we're going to do Mr. Gray. We're going to build a village in the countryside. We're going to put up rickety tents, old houses, tin shacks&mdash;you name it. We're going to live there until the district council builds more houses. We want a house; we can't get a house, so we're going to build an illegal encampment in a field.&quot; Those people would be thrown out in the twinkling of an eye. The ordinary settled population would not be allowed to do such things. It is only because these people call themselves Gypsies&mdash;in the case of the Minety lot they are Gypsies or proper old-fashioned Romanies&mdash;that they are allowed to breach planning law in such a way.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/13">I submit that that is quite wrong. The law&mdash;planning or any other law&mdash;should apply to Gypsies and Travellers in precisely the same way as it does to the settled population. My duty is to help the settled population find accommodation and I am happy to do so. I happily do the same thing for the Gypsy population, but I do not see why they should be given rights that other people do not have. Everyone should be treated in precisely the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/14">Leaving Minety aside, I shall talk about the current situation regarding provision in the county of Wiltshire. In comparison with most other counties in England, we are reasonably well supplied with sites for Travellers in Wiltshire. Wiltshire county council manages six residential sites and there are 96 pitches all together. Each pitch has two caravans so there are 192 pitches and 200 residents. There are also transit sites consisting of 12 pitches. Wiltshire is therefore one of the best county's for Traveller site provision in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/15">So, people might well ask why more sites are needed? Is Wiltshire littered with dozens and dozens of Travellers looking for somewhere to go? No, is the answer to your question, Mr. Chope&mdash;had you asked it, which you did not although I could see it in your face. Wiltshire is not particularly littered with large numbers of caravans looking for somewhere to go, so why is North Wiltshire district council&mdash;and the other district council, to which I shall refer in an moment&mdash;being asked to make permanent provision for large numbers of Gypsy caravans? It is because of a rather peculiar document called the regional spatial strategy. Incidentally, I do not think we live in a region. I do not believe in regions or in the so-called south-west region. I certainly do not believe in an unelected, appointed, unanswerable, peculiar organisation called the South West regional assembly. I have no clue what that organisation is. I have never been there; I have never seen its minutes. That organisation is not elected and it is not answerable to the electorate in any shape, size or form. However, whoever the people at the South West regional assembly are, they have produced a document called the regional spatial strategy, and, off the top of their heads and for reasons best known to themselves, they have stated in that document that somehow or other Wiltshire has to take large numbers of these sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/16">That seems to me to be fundamentally undemocratic. If the councillors at Wiltshire county council or North Wiltshire district council say, &quot;It is our duty as a council to make provision for these people in the same way that we must house the homeless,&quot; that would be perfectly fine. They are elected councillors and if they get it wrong by having too many or too few sites, they are removed from office in the next election because they have done a bad job as councillors. The South West regional assembly has no such democratic accountability. The people there have been appointed and we do not know who they are or why they are doing this.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/17">The South West regional assembly is not acting entirely off its own bat; it is replying to a document that the Government produced last year. That consultation document is entitled &quot;The Road Ahead&quot;, which is appropriately titled for a Gypsy consultation&mdash;although we are not talking about being on the road ahead; we are talking about people settling down for long periods in fixed encampments. In that document the Government concluded that they wanted 4,000 new pitches across England. Do we know why they want 4,000 new pitches across England? Not really.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/18">I have a number of questions to ask about how the Government came up with that figure that I shall come back to in a moment. The Government said that they want 4,000 pitches across England and they dished them out to the regional assemblies. The South West regional assembly divided the pitches up among the counties; the counties divided them up among the districts; and in a wonderfully obscure, Stalinist, centralist way, the conclusion is that North Wiltshire district council needs 48 new pitches. That is not because there are sufficient Gypsies to fill 48 pitches or because we need them, but simply because something called the South West regional assembly has answered some centralised Government diktat and has concluded that it should do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/19">I mentioned that there were two or three things about which I felt unhappy in relation to the methodology used by the South West regional assembly. Without delaying the House too much, I shall mention one or two of those issues. First, each county had to produce a Gypsy and Traveller accommodation assessment, which is a GTAA to those of us in the know. The truth is that each of those GTAAs differ from county to county, and it is up to each county to set up its own GTAA, which undermines the process by which the assessment is arrived at. Secondly, the GTAAs are based on consultations with Gypsies and Travellers, which one might say is reasonable enough. As the report from the panel states:</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/20" class="indent">&quot;this helps inform the process of allocating pitch numbers to each district.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/21">However, the likelihood is that Gypsies and Travellers will exaggerate the number of pitches that they need. They are hardly likely to say that they want fewer than they need&mdash;they are likely to exaggerate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/22">The South West regional assembly went on to suggest that the compound growth of the Gypsy and Traveller population will be 3 per cent. a year until 2016, which is why we have to come up with so many sites. If my arithmetic is correct, those figures mean that the Gypsy and Traveller population will have increased by some 27 per cent. by 2016&mdash;3 per cent. compounded through until 2016. The Government say that the British population will grow by 8 per cent. in the same period. Perhaps the Minister will tell us why it is presumed that the Gypsy population will grow three times faster than the settled population because there is no logic in that at all. I recently had a meeting with some Gypsies and I said to them, &quot;Where are all these extra Gypsies coming from?&quot; and in a rather nice Wiltshire understatement they said, &quot;From their mothers, I reckon.&quot; I suppose that is true&mdash;although that would happen no faster than the settled population.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/23">In justifying its figures, the panel criticised the Wiltshire GTAA. It said that North Wiltshire has produced unrealistically low figures because of</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/24" class="indent">&quot;the strength of enforcement action carried out by the County having displaced need from the County to elsewhere&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/25">So, lower figures have been produced because of the effectiveness of enforcement action. In other words, the police have done their job and moved people on when they are illegally parked, and because they have done so rather well, we need more sites. The police were simply doing their job and the report has criticised them for that. It goes on.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/26">It seems that in some areas, the individuals who undertook the survey work were people whom the local Gypsy and Traveller communities distrusted&mdash;well, it would not be much good if they had used their mates. It seems perfectly reasonable for people in authority dispassionately to assess how many places are needed. The report goes on to refer to Travellers living in houses who might want to return to caravans if new sites are provided. Is it necessarily a duty of society to provide people who have decided to settle and who have been allocated permanent housing, presumably by the local authority or housing association, with sites? Is it up to us to spend large amounts of Government money&mdash;incidentally we are talking about &pound;70 million of Government money altogether across the nation&mdash;to provide sites so that we can encourage people to leave houses and go back to their preferred way of life in caravans? I am not sure that it is and I am not sure that the voter out there thinks it is either.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/27">The whole approach to this seems to be flawed. The way in which they came up with these figures and allocated them around the area seems to be flawed. The Government want 4,000 new pitches, as I said. North Wiltshire alone will increase its number of pitches by 48, plus 12 transit pitches. Each of those pitches has two caravans, so roughly speaking, there will be a further 120 caravans in North Wiltshire. In addition, they want 14 more pitches in Swindon, 18 in Salisbury, five in Kennet, and 14 in West Wiltshire. There will be 200 more caravans in the county of Wiltshire, and driving around Wiltshire, as I do all weekend, I am not aware of 200 caravans hanging around Wiltshire wondering where to go. I do not believe the figures are accurate; they are a centralist, Stalinist estimate made by the Government and the South West regional assembly and I challenge the Government to justify them.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/28">I will not enter into discussions about the merits and demerits of the six sites that North Wiltshire district council has proposed. Each of them are unacceptable to the people living there and I am inclined to think that all of them are quite wrong and none of them should be chosen. My problem is not so much with where they should be, but with the principle that lies behind the way in which the Government are saying they should be provided. My view is that the provision of Gypsy encampments fulfils a kind of Parkinson's law: the more sites we have, the more Gypsies appear to fill them. As evidence of that, let me cite a few statistics. When the Labour Government passed the Caravan Sites Act 1968, they conducted a census and concluded that there were about 3,000 Gypsy caravans in England and that it was right that we should provide 3,000 pitches for them to go to. We did so; indeed while the Act was in place, we provided not 3,000 but a total of 7,000 pitches&mdash;some two and a half times the number required. Theoretically, that should have meant that all the Gypsy caravans in England were more than happily accommodated, yet by the time that the Conservative Government repealed the Act in 1995, there were 12,614 caravans in England, more than half of which were illegally parked. By July 2007, 17,134 caravans had been counted in England. We went from 3,000 to 12,000 to 17,000 caravans.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/29">The paper produced by the independent taskforce says that it does not know how many Gypsies there are in England; estimates vary enormously, from 82,000 to 300,000. Incidentally, that paper gets the count of caravans wrong. It says that there were 16,000 caravans at the time to which I referred, so the authors get their statistics wrong in the introduction to the Government paper. I am not sure how their statistical analysis can be relied on beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/30">We believe that there are very substantial numbers of Gypsies around. The number seems to increase exponentially. We have gone from 3,000 caravans in 1968 to at least 17,000 caravans today, with possibly up to 300,000 people living in them&mdash;an astonishing series of figures. The provision of sites&mdash;I think that there are now about 12,000 pitches in England&mdash;has done nothing to accommodate them. In other words, the more sites we provide, the more Travellers appear.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/31">That brings me back to my original point about who these people are. Quite a significant number of them are new age travellers of one kind or another&mdash;people who have chosen to live a nomadic lifestyle, rather than having been born into it. In philosophical terms, perhaps one should consider whether it is right that society is required to provide, at large public expense, sites for people who have chosen to go and live in broken-down old buses around our countryside. I am not certain that that is something that the taxpayer would necessarily ask us to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/32">All of that is without considering how many Gypsies around the world may be considering coming to this country. This is how the people who produced the paper went about their business: they put their finger in the air and came up with an imaginary number, then local authorities were required to provide sites for that imaginary number of people. That is like asking how many people are living in Europe today, how many might want to come and live in England and therefore how many new houses we should require local authorities to build for them. It is an absurd calculation and it should not be done; it should be done precisely the other way around. We should be saying to local authorities, &quot;It is your duty to provide for people of a settled disposition, just as it is your duty to provide for people of a travelling disposition. If you don't&mdash;if you provide too few sites&mdash;then come the next district council election or unitary council election&quot;&mdash;as is the case in Wiltshire&mdash;&quot;the people of your area will judge you on your ability as councillors to have carried out your statutory duties.&quot; We should be working from the bottom up&mdash;with councillors being given the responsibility to do those things&mdash;rather than working from the top down, which is absurd. In concreting over the countryside, as the Government are requiring local authorities to do to provide sites, they are also concreting over local people's opinions on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.2/33">I look forward to hearing from my hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham from the Front Bench shortly. In 1995, while we were in government&mdash;I declare an interest: I was special adviser to the Secretary of State for the Environment at the time, which is why I take a keen interest in these matters&mdash;we did, after all, abolish the requirement on local authorities to provide sites. Let me talk about what might happen in the event that there is a Conservative Government two years from now. Who knows? I suppose that that is at least theoretically possible. I would not want to offend the Minister by putting it any more strongly than that.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.2/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> is confusing two or three things. The abolition of the Caravan Sites Act in 1995 removed the requirement on local authorities to provide sites in answer to further demand. The 49 sites that have been closed have therefore been closed because of lack of demand or because they were past their sell-by dates. Furthermore, the &pound;18 million to which the hon. Gentleman referred represents the police costs involved in moving illegally parked Gypsies on. That is an enforcement and planning cost and has nothing to do with the repeal of the 1968 Act.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.3/1">On the first point, I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman and I am pleased that I have not pushed too hard on the issue. I have been looking at this field of legislation this week, so I will hold fire until I have finished reading about it and I will take in good faith what he says. However, the second point is related to today's debate, because the &pound;18 million is connected with the issue of Gypsy sites. It represents the cost that we have incurred by not having a particularly sustainable strategy for dealing with sites. The biggest shock in what the hon. Gentleman said, however, was his revelation that he had had lunch with the Minister. The Minister was very coy about that, and, frankly, I am shocked. I expect a similar favour at some point, as long as it is worth less than &pound;500 so that I do not have to put it in the Register of Members' Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/2">Authorised sites are vital for community cohesion, and that has a bearing on the bill to the police. If we have fewer unauthorised sites, enforcement is easier for local authorities. Authorised sites also ease community tensions, as long as there is proper consultation. In addition, managed authorised sites allow for easier access to public and financial services, which would improve the quality of life of Travellers.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/3">Authorised sites could also have the interesting financial consequence of enabling councils to force Gypsies to pay council tax. There are issues with that, but the underlying point is that authorised sites need not be free and could be maintained by rents and licence fees. Local authorities do not even need to buy them.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/4">The numbers of authorised caravan camps have decreased, and about 90 per cent. of planning applications by Gypsies are refused, which is one reason why they end up camping illegally. At the macro level, therefore, there are strategic questions to be answered. Perhaps the Minister can shed some light on how Government policy will become more sustainable. He alluded to that in our previous debate in this Chamber, but perhaps he can tell us more about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/5">I should tell the hon. Member for North Wiltshire that I am very familiar with Romania, which is a country that I love&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> There is an individual Romanian that I love, too. On all the occasions that I have been there, however, I have never seen a long queue of caravans waiting to come to north Wiltshire at the first sign of an increase in the number of authorised sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/6">Nevertheless, I must sympathise with the hon. Gentleman because his constituency appears to be bearing the brunt of the regional spatial strategy. The plan is to increase the number of Gypsy encampments by 15 per cent. in the south-west, but by 50 per cent. in north Wiltshire. There is no reason based on natural justice why that should happen. We must ensure that the distribution of sites across the region is even and fair. The Minister is obliged to explain to the hon. Gentleman how the Government have allowed this situation to come about and, more importantly, what action they will take&mdash;probably in partnership with local authorities&mdash;to ease the pressure on his constituency. The current proposals do not make sense and are bound to increase local tensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/7">Was there a lack of consultation? Gypsies must be involved in finding an alternative site, but so must the local community. A huge number of residents attended the meetings in Wootton Bassett this month and last month and signed up to the six-week consultation, which suggests that consultation has not been extensive enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/8">There seem to be double standards regarding the Lindisfarne proposal. I understand&mdash;the hon. Member for North Wiltshire can confirm whether this is the case&mdash;that residents were told that the area was a conservation site. Those who had tried to extend their gardens were denied permission to do so, but were then told that the area would be proposed for use as an authorised camping site. If that is the case&mdash;I seek his guidance on this&mdash;it is hardly surprising that there are tensions.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">Given the sensitivities in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, I fully understand why he has taken that sensible view. I used the Lindisfarne example simply to demonstrate the contradictory messages that are being put out, with the unsurprising consequence that there is resentment among local residents, who do not feel that the system is fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">I have looked into the cost of eviction, and it is obvious that the benefits of authorised sites far outweigh the cost of creating them. The &pound;18 million that the police have spent on eviction is part of that cost. As I mentioned in our previous debate, Bristol city council reduced its annual enforcement costs from &pound;200,000 a year to &pound;5,000 a year by providing a &pound;425,000 authorised site. Moving Gypsies several times over is expensive and serves only to increase problems. The evidence shows that having authorised sites not only represents a tension-reducing strategy, but leads to a cost saving.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3">Authorised sites would also assist the police in monitoring and enforcing the law. All of us who have looked at the issue will be aware of the Stanley park incident. As a result of the absence of an authorised site, Gypsies ended up disrupting a football game that had been scheduled for the youth teams at Stanley park. The police reached an accommodation with the Gypsies, but it should not be for the police to make such tactical decisions; the regulatory framework should provide us with reliable solutions so that things do not reach that stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/4">I have mentioned the idea that authorised sites would encourage more Gypsies and Travellers into the country, but I think that it is unfounded. What is actually happening is that people from unauthorised sites are gravitating to authorised sites that have been established. However, the same issues affect countries across Europe. Perhaps the Minister can comment on what we can do Europe-wide to deal with the issue. He will know that things have got far worse in other countries. In Italy, caravans just outside Rome were actually set alight by the local community. These issues are not, therefore, unique to Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/5">The existence of Gypsies is nothing new. The Gypsy lifestyle is rather more traditional than having a flat in London. In that sense, Gypsies have every reason to be respected and to expect facilities to be made available so that they can pursue their lifestyle. As the hon. Member for North Wiltshire quite rightly said, these are not horrible people. They are lovely people who have a breadth of experience and culture that serves to add to the social fabric of the country and not take away from it. However, there must be sufficient force in the regulatory system to make them responsible citizens. Authorised sites would allow the police and local government to create a partnership that is sustainable in the longer term. It would also allow the police to act swiftly in cases of trespass rather than face the delay that weakens the case for prosecution, as was made clear in the Stanley park incident. Some &pound;18 million a year is spent in pointless enforcement costs. That money could be much better used in other ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/6">In conclusion, I ask the Minister to comment on the very good points made by hon. Members today and to indicate whether he intends to consider the issue on a pan-European basis because there is a degree of migration from one country to another. Such consideration would help us to see whether best practice in other countries could be reapplied here.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.0/1">It is with some trepidation that I tiptoe into this male bonding session. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> on his experience in Romania. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on obtaining this very important debate. The issue of Travellers applies not just to Wiltshire, but much more widely. It even affects&mdash;dare I say?&mdash;someone who represents a London constituency because we also have a travelling population. The borough of Bromley has long been the home for the showmen during the winter, and they are a key part of the travelling population. So, we, too, in London have our experiences. I have visited a Travellers' site in Lewisham. Getting the amount of caravans on to that site was a miracle of engineering. It was exceedingly tight, but they managed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/2">My right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase> also made a contribution, telling us about his very deep experience of Traveller sites in Scotland. His points were valid because they can also be applied to England. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> made a helpful contribution about costing and the imposition of costs on council tax payers.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/3">I have great sympathy with those hon. Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire, who have illegal encampments in their constituencies. From time to time, many of us have suffered from such encampments and experienced the ugly scenes when Travellers resist being moved on. Some have experienced the difficult situation in which Travellers have to be moved on because they are causing a nuisance within the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/4">I hope that my hon. Friend will be relieved to hear that when we are in Government, which will be sooner rather than later, we will conduct a review of the Human Rights Act 1998 and apply it to the situation of Travellers to ensure that the planning laws are applied equally across the population. I hope that that small assurance will be useful to my hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/5">The comment was made that so much of this matter is down to planning law. Therefore, we will also deal with the issues to do with that law. As my hon. Friends know, we abhor the top-down imposition of targets, whether they relate to Traveller sites or the increase in the number of houses that we have to provide. We will get rid of the regional spatial strategies and we will ensure that local councils and local communities are on top of the development of their community so that it suits them rather than the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/6">I, too, will join the calls from everybody on the Opposition Benches for an explanation of how the Government have reached their target figures and how they have imposed them through the regional spatial strategies. I must warn my hon. Friends that when the Housing and Regeneration Bill goes through, the regional assemblies will no longer have power over housing numbers. Because a number of councillors were nominated on to those regional assemblies, there was an element of democratic responsibility. However, that will go and the power will be handed over to the regional development agencies. The planning powers will also go with it under the new Planning Bill, unless we can bring it to a grinding halt, hopefully in the Lords&mdash;the Minister may like to take that point on board. We will see completely unelected quangos imposing housing and planning targets on unwilling populations.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/7">My right hon. and learned Friend, who made the point about the Traveller sites being in entirely the wrong place, will know very well that when we have the centralised target-driven system, the chances are that the site will be in the wrong place. Since the 1960s, we have been grappling with developments that have been in the wrong place, whether they are Traveller encampments or town centres. That has had a very negative effect on many of our communities, and we want to see that changed. However, we are convinced that the Government's proposals for centralised control will not achieve what they want to achieve. Sullen resentment is possibly the best way to describe the mood. Potentially, we can see a very inflamed situation. The meetings held in my hon. Friends' constituencies provided an indication of how inflamed the population can be about the wrong sort of proposal and consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/8">We also plan to make intentional trespass a criminal offence. We believe that it changes the balance of law in a way that offends a local community. It gives rights and responsibilities in a way that is unacceptable to the settled community.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/9">We also want to stop irresponsible land speculation. By that I mean the movement on to a site over a weekend, and the instant digging for drains, standpipes and electrical supplies. Again, that outrages the local community and, in turn, ensures that it will not accept a group of Travellers. Therefore, we have to ensure that, if we are going to see a travelling population that has a settled relationship with its local community, the local community is accepting of the Traveller population as much as the Traveller population wishes to settle, even temporarily, in one place. As was so wisely said, Travellers travel and they will not necessarily be on a site permanently.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/10">Crucially, when we come into Government, we have to ensure that it is local people and local councils who feel in control of the provision of sites. As has been said, in Wiltshire, there is an acceptance of Travellers. There is an appreciation of what they add to the local community and culture. Therefore, if the proposal is accepted locally, consulted on properly and if the site is properly positioned and considered, one can see the local community accepting a proper settled Travellers' encampment. However, if the will of local people is not there, I foresee a continuation of the problem. There will be hostile receptions&mdash;I saw this myself when I represented Hastings and Rye which has a number of travelling communities&mdash;and it could potentially lead to violence on both sides. That is completely unacceptable in the kind of world that we wish to live in.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/11">I congratulate my hon. Friend once again and I hope that my brief comments help in his constituency&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.289.1/1">I am happy to clarify that. It is easy to fall into jargon, but merely abolishing the regional spatial strategy indicates that there will be no top-down targeting or pressure on councils to provide a set number over which they have no control. I am sorry that I used jargon&mdash;we all know who is to blame for it, and it is not those on our side of the Chamber. I reassure my hon. Friend that councils will be in control of the process. Indeed, it will be a challenge to councils to initiate and involve people so that they can develop a vibrant community that will allow all groups and people to live together in harmony. That will be a big challenge, but I am sure councils will rise to it if they feel that there is virtue and value to their community for so doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/2">I commend my hon. Friend for initiating the debate and I hope that my few words have been of some help.</p>

Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on securing the debate and those who spoke on their contributions. I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman secured the debate because it gives us the chance to debate Gypsy and Traveller policy for the second time in less than a month, following the enjoyable and important debate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-22">22 May</phrase> on the provision and enforcement of Gypsy and Traveller sites to which I and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, among others, contributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.2/3">I shall begin as I did in that debate by talking about the importance of responsibility. Let me dispel the myth that has been mentioned a number of times today and that is perpetuated in some quarters, that there are somehow strict laws in place for the settled community and a laissez-faire attitude to the Gypsy and Traveller communities. That was mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> in his first-class contribution. Let me put the record straight: everybody in this country lives under one set of laws. Our expected standards of behaviour extend to everybody in society, not just a narrow or selective band. A range of powers are in place and are available to landowners, local authorities and the police to deal with unauthorised encampments.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.6/1">If the Minister is right that planning law treats two people in precisely the same way, will he explain why the planning inspector, speaking on behalf of the Secretary of State, has said that the Gypsies who are illegally camped on their own land at Minety in my constituency can remain unless the district council provides accommodation elsewhere, whereas, just down the road, an organic farmer who currently lives in a caravan on 30 acres of organic farm, has been told that unless she removes the caravan immediately, enforcement procedures will follow, and that she cannot appeal the decision? That demonstrably is not a level playing field. The Human Rights Act 1998 is relevant here: the people in the Gypsy caravans have human rights, but the organic farmer who is being evicted does not.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.2/1">I shall be delighted to do so. The Minister's special adviser has done a sterling job in digging out ancient quotes that seem to me to be perfectly consistent. What I said was that it is perfectly reasonable for local authorities such as North Wiltshire district council to designate land that Gypsies could buy so that they could then apply for proper planning permission and put their caravans there. That is absolutely fine. What we do not want is situations such as that at the Minety site, where Gypsies are illegally encamped on their own land. Nor do we want the Government, in the form of the South West regional assembly, saying, &quot;You will take 48 pitches and 200 caravans in North Wiltshire, and you will put them on these sites, and we don't care whether those Gypsies exist or not.&quot; The two statements that the Minister's special adviser carefully dug out are perfectly consistent.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.1/1">Let me move on to talk about the policy framework and Government policy. There are two days left to contribute to the consultation on where new sites in North Wiltshire should be. I hope that the hon. Member for North Wiltshire and others will take the opportunity to reassert the earlier view that recognition and identification of sites is just as important in 2008 as it was in 2004. We definitely need that.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/2">The Government believe that everyone has the right to a decent home and a secure and authorised place in which to raise their families. For years, local authorities have assessed the housing needs of the settled population to plan strategically for the future requirements of their residents. That is entirely appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/3">Local authorities identify land for all uses in their local plans, which are available so that the public can see at a glance what type of development is likely to take place in their neighbourhoods during the coming years. There is no reason why land suitable for use as Gypsy and Traveller sites should not go through the same process. It is not appropriate for housing for Gypsies and Travellers to be treated differently from housing for the settled community.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/4">The policies that the Government have put in place ensure that our record on equality now extends to Gypsies and Travellers through the planning system, as it should. Everyone in our communities, whether they live in a house or on a Gypsy and Traveller caravan site, needs to know that local authorities are planning for the housing needs of future generations. This Government have pledged to deliver 3 million new homes by 2020. The need to provide equality of opportunity for Gypsies and Travellers is tiny in comparison. As the hon. Gentleman mentioned, we are talking about 4,000 pitches by 2011 to accommodate all caravans on all currently unauthorised sites, which means that less than1 square mile of land is required throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/5">The hon. Gentleman commented on the exercise by North Wiltshire district council. I praise the council for taking steps to identify suitable locations to address the need for additional sites within its area. As I hinted, the hon. Gentleman knows that I cannot comment on the proposals, but the council's approach in recognising the need to plan proactively for authorised sites must be the right one in tackling unauthorised sites. That evidence-based approach seems to be entirely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.1/6">I reiterate a point that I made earlier, which is important. Regional spatial strategies should be established using a robust and credible evidence base. The GTAAs to which the hon. Gentleman referred naturally form part of that evidence, but if he or any other hon. Member who has contributed today believe the evidence to be less than credible, I suggest that they make their views known through the statutory consultation process.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.3/1">That is a wider point that I cannot comment on in three minutes, but it is an important point in terms of immigration policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.3/2">Let me move on to how the situation in the south-west of England relates nationally to the Government's commitment to provide equality of opportunity for Gypsies and Travellers throughout the country. The Panel report recently submitted to the Secretary of State sets out how many new pitches should be provided in the south-west. I commend the work that has been undertaken in the south-west to bring forward the delivery of new pitches so far, and we will publish our proposed changes to the regional spatial strategy in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.3/3">We want that progress to be replicated throughout the country. There is an established need for new houses throughout the south-west. It is right, and expected, that they will be provided. It is similarly right, and expected, that the number of new homes required will be carefully and meticulously studied. Regional spatial strategies are to be founded on a robust and credible evidence base, subject to examination in public so that everyone has the chance to comment. That is the process that has been followed in the south-west, enabling all those with an interest to probe or challenge the assessments of the need for more Gypsy and Traveller sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.3/4">I hope that it is clear to the hon. Member for North Wiltshire and others that in this age of equality what is right and expected for members of the settled community becomes right and expected for Gypsies and Travellers too. I started by saying that there is one law for all. Gypsies and Travellers should abide by the planning system. They should apply for planning permission before developing land that they own, and local authorities have swift and appropriate enforcement action to deploy if they do not do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.3/5">We will not see a reduction in unauthorised camping if new sites are not provided to meet the needs of the Gypsy and Traveller communities. The task group stated that when there is a demonstrable need, local authorities should begin work on identifying sites now. I am glad that in the south-west the regional spatial strategy is close to concluding how many pitches should be provided. It will then be for local authorities such as North Wiltshire to ensure&mdash;not by a top-down approach&mdash;that they provide homes and accommodation for those who need them most.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship today, Mr. Chope.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/2">I am certainly pleased to have the opportunity to debate this subject, although I do not think that it will be very contentious. It will probably be one of the easier debates for the Home Office to respond to, because the subject is one deserving of celebration rather than one that requires the Home Office to intervene or take any particular action.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/3">As I say, I am pleased to have secured this debate. Although the subject is Crimestoppers in Great Yarmouth, this is really a celebration of the fact that the nationally recognised and successful Crimestoppers scheme started in Great Yarmouth some 25 years, on <phrase class="date" code="1983-06-24">24 June 1983</phrase>; the exact anniversary is next Tuesday. The scheme was started by Detective Inspector Mike Cole and was ably supported by the then manager of the Woolworths store in the town centre, Jim Carter; both of them are visiting Westminster Hall today to enjoy the celebrations of what was achieved in Great Yarmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/4">I want first to express my appreciation for the initiative, which, as I say, was taken by Mike Cole and Jim Carter to start the scheme. I would also like to mention the then local chief superintendent, Peter Howse; the then chief constable, George Charlton, and the late Peter Ware, who was the editor of the <i>Yarmouth Mercury</i> at that time. Each of them had their own input and helped to make such a success of the new scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/5">It is only fair that we look at the humble beginnings of the scheme, which were in another country, where the idea first came about to encourage members of the public to give information on suspected criminals. The scheme started in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in 1976. A young man had been shot dead during a robbery at a filling station, and having made little headway in finding the perpetrator, police decided to set up an anonymous phone line for witnesses to come forward with information. Within 72 hours, arrests were made, but what amazed the New Mexico police was the number of people giving information on other, unrelated crimes. The Crimestoppers concept was born.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/6">It was another six years before a youthful Detective Inspector Mike Cole was on a police visit to Peoria, in Illinois. He took a particular interest in the scheme that was being run by a sergeant in the community relations department. Working from a dedicated room, the sergeant was taking information from the public about crimes. The difference was that this information was given anonymously, and callers giving information that led to an arrest put themselves in line for a reward payment from money donated by local businesses. That was Crimestoppers Illinois-style.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/7">Mike Cole was so impressed by the scheme and its results that, on his return to Great Yarmouth, he submitted a report daring to suggest that it be tried out in the town. Both his chief superintendent and the chief constable gave their approval. However, it was by chance that Jim Carter, the manager of the local Woolworths, who had been in that post for only about a year, received a letter from Chief Superintendent Peter Howse asking for support. The bottom line was that both Mike and Jim saw this scheme as an opportunity to get the community involved in crimefighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/8">At this juncture, I want to take time out to pay tribute to another of my constituents, Carol Saldinack, who I am sure some people will have heard about from the media. She was the lady who reported her two sons to the police for their vicious attack on a father of two from Chichester. She reported them because she saw it as the right thing to do. Although she was not able to have anonymity&mdash;indeed, she did not want it&mdash;her action does give us hope that there are people who recognise that it is not the job of Government or the police alone to catch criminals; we all have a responsibility. I have met Carol and she wants to continue getting the message out about the need for all of us to take responsibility. If that means using Crimestoppers as a way of giving information anonymously, that should be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/9">Returning to the road that led to Crimestoppers, the next step was to convene a meeting of all the local businesses and, of course, the media in Great Yarmouth. Peter Ware, who was the editor of Yarmouth's local paper at the time, was on board from day one, giving the required space in the paper to fuel the Crimestoppers trial. The local business community willingly donated some cash and then &pound;10 per month into the Crimestoppers account.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/10">The scheme was officially launched on <phrase class="date" code="1983-06-24">24 June 1983</phrase> and the anonymous calls came in to a collator's office from 9 am until 5 pm, with an answer machine taking calls outside those hours. Once any information was received, the real police work began, with police gathering their own evidence, because anonymous information never could and never should be treated as evidence to be put before a court.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/11">The scheme was a huge success and it had a positive effect on the crime figures. Other forces took a keen interest, and it was not long after officers from the Metropolitan police visited Great Yarmouth that the scheme went nationwide. Recalling the visit by the Metropolitan police officers, Mike Cole said:</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/12" class="indent">&quot;I was in the office one day when the switchboard said they had two superintendents from London in the front office. Their names were Harley and Street, so I thought it was a wind-up, but it was on the level.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/13">Thus, the scheme began in what Jim Carter described as:</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/14" class="indent">&quot;the sleepy backwater of a Norfolk seaside town.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/15">Just four years later, Crimestoppers began to expand, with Thames Television adopting the idea and promoting it in the capital. Locally, the next huge step was the involvement of Anglia Television in promoting Crimestoppers throughout the Anglia region. The irony is that the then head of programming at Anglia, Jim Wilson, went on to become chairman of Norfolk police authority and of Anglia Crimestoppers.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/16">From humble beginnings in Norfolk, Crimestoppers has spread to every part of the British isles. The essence of Crimestoppers has never changed. Mike Cole and Jim Carter feel very proud&mdash;quite rightly, in my opinion&mdash;to have been in at the start of one of the country's best crimefighting initiatives. They still recall those early days when the rewards were paid out under the town hall clock. I do not know if they had to wear a red rose for identification, but I do know that this wonderful scheme is a huge success story. Great Yarmouth should be proud of having been in at the start.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/17">Having looked at the scheme's humble beginnings in Great Yarmouth, I shall look at some of the successes of Crimestoppers nationally over the last 25 years, up to the present day. After its infancy in a single Great Yarmouth office, operating from 9 to 5, Crimestoppers now has 39 regional boards across the UK, Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. In its first year as a national venture, it received fewer than 5,000 calls; last year, it received more than 80,000 calls.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/18">As well as its network of permanent staff, Crimestoppers has more than 400 people volunteering in their spare time to help to fight crime, and it is supported by a 24-hour call centre, ensuring that calls can be answered around the clock every day. With this supporting network, Crimestoppers has been no small success. Since the scheme went national in 1988, 84,000 arrests and charges have been made; nearly 1 million actionable calls have been received, and as a result, more than &pound;100 million-worth of goods have been recovered and more than &pound;145 million-worth of drugs have been seized. To put those impressive figures into context, some 17 people are arrested every day as a result of information given to Crimestoppers. In addition, every five days one person is charged with murder as a result of information given to Crimestoppers.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/19">Following on from these impressive successes, Crimestoppers is now a leading player in a number of successful crime reduction partnerships. Teaming up with the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre, Crimestoppers has been a partner in &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, an initiative that has been in place since November 2006, which helps to catch some of Britain's most dangerous criminals and missing convicted sex offenders. As part of the launch of &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, five appeals for missing offenders were posted on the initiative's website. Within hours, as the result of the widespread publicity, Gordon Stewart, one of the five missing offenders, surrendered to the police. The website has received more than 8 million hits; more than 1 million appeals were viewed by the public when the campaign was launched, and to date nine offenders have been located.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/20">Crimestoppers has also had success abroad, leading the campaign alongside the Serious Organised Crime Agency to catch British criminals in the Costa del Sol. Operation Captura in the Costa del Sol encourages anyone who recognises the wanted criminals on its website to call Crimestoppers from Spain, to give information anonymously on a dedicated Spanish free phone number, which is&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.301.1/1">I crave your indulgence, Mr. Chope, as I turn to the multi-agency operation Pentameter 2, which launched last October to protect victims of the sex trafficking industry. Anonymous Crimestoppers intelligence has assisted the police in Leicestershire in rescuing six females from brothel premises, closing four brothels down, and arresting two persons who were subsequently charged with running a brothel and controlling a prostitute. Through its youth arm, Shadow CS, Crimestoppers is now targeting the London boroughs that are hardest hit by gun and knife crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/2">It is through collaborative partnerships and joint working between the police, businesses and the media that Crimestoppers has had the success that it has had, and will continue to have, I am sure, for the next 25 years and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/3">Another element that is key to Crimestoppers having any success at all is the information provided to it by members of the public. Without people picking up the phone to make that call, the thousands of arrests and solved cases would not have been possible. So as we celebrate 25 years of successful crime stopping, we should also stop to recognise the individuals who come forward. Often that is not an easy thing to do. People may feel under pressure not to come forward because of the potential consequences; they may know the person who they are reporting. Crimestoppers teams and the general public must be congratulated on their efforts to bring criminals to justice. Those behind the scenes can look back with pride and highlight the fact that it all started in Great Yarmouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/4">Crimestoppers has gone international. The fact is that without the two gentlemen who started the project, Jim Carter and Mick Cole, who are here today, the 80,000 or so arrests that have been made, not just in the UK but internationally, since Crimestoppers began would never have been made. I pay personal tribute to those two individuals from Great Yarmouth, to the community in Great Yarmouth for taking the initiative forward, and to successive Governments who have supported it.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/5">Most of all, I encourage as many people as possible to use the anonymous phone lines and to listen to the words of Carol Saldinack, who is a constituent of mine. She did not have anonymity but she gave up her two sons because she thought that that was the right thing to do. She says that it is up to socially responsible people in society to use whatever measures are available, including Crimestoppers, to report criminal activity, wherever it takes place, so that we can help the police, and help the Government to bring down the crime statistics.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Chope. I believe that it is the first time I have done so in my ministerial capacity. I wholeheartedly congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1601" name="Anthony D Wright">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing another debate about his constituency. I know from a visit to his constituency that I made not too long ago how much he involves himself in the local community and how he does his best to work with all the local organisations and people not only to tackle crime but to deal with a great many other issues as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/2">Crimestoppers UK, the national charity, celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, but, as my hon. Friend said, it all started in his constituency five years earlier thanks to the innovation and public-spiritedness of two men. I pay tribute to them and thank them for what can only be described as pioneering work.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/3">Visiting Peoria, Illinois, in 1982, Detective Inspector Mick Cole of Great Yarmouth police came across a scheme where a sergeant, sitting in a room on his own, took anonymous information from the public about crimes. When information led to an arrest, the callers put themselves in line for a reward from money donated by local businesses. Mick had the foresight to recognise the opportunity that that presented for policing in Great Yarmouth and, on his return, got his senior managers' backing for a trial in the town. Crimestoppers is a tribute to him. Many of us often see lots of good, exciting ideas and we think, &quot;That is a good idea,&quot; but that is all we do about it. Great credit is due to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/4">Jim Carter was managing the local Woolworths at the time. When he received a letter asking for support for the scheme, he thought it a brilliant idea, the sort of thing that businesses concerned about crime rates should support and a good way of getting the community involved in fighting crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/5">From that pairing in Norfolk to the scheme's adoption by the Metropolitan police five years later to its roll-out across the country, from the receptiveness of the police to radically new ideas to wholehearted support from newspapers and television companies, Crimestoppers over the past quarter of a century has been a story of success. The 25th anniversary of Crimestoppers in Great Yarmouth and the 20th anniversary of its force-wide introduction in London provide us with an opportunity to reflect on that success, praise the results that have been achieved, and thank the many volunteers, including many of our constituents, who have been involved in mounting campaigns and fundraising locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/6">This year, Crimestoppers will receive its millionth actionable call. Since its inception, intelligence given anonymously by members of the public has led to more than 84,000 arrests and charges, the recovery of goods worth &pound;101 million and the seizure of more than &pound;148 million-worth of drugs. Seventeen people are arrested every day as a result of information given to Crimestoppers, and, as my hon. Friend said, one person is charged with murder every seven days. When people reflect that that was made possible by the imagination of two men 25 years ago in Great Yarmouth, they will realise that it a phenomenal achievement, and one to be justifiably proud of. Many people looking at today's agenda for our proceedings in Parliament will have looked at the title of this debate and wondered whether the subject was not a parochial one. But, when we reflect on it, we see that the impact of Crimestoppers in Great Yarmouth and in our country has been phenomenal. I hope that some of our hon. Friends take the opportunity to read some of the facts that we have laid out in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/7">I pray for your indulgence for just half a minute, Mr. Chope, as I make my next point. Reaching abroad in support of SOCA last year, Crimestoppers UK's campaigning led to the capture of 11 fugitives believed to be on the run in Spain. Indeed, as my hon. Friend said, Crimestoppers works closely with the child exploitation and online protection unit to catch many missing convicted sex offenders on the Most Wanted website.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/8">The results speak for themselves. The potential that Mick Cole and Jim Carter saw 25 years ago in Great Yarmouth has certainly been realised. I also point out that, as a consequence of that scheme, among other things, Great Yarmouth has had significant achievements recently on crime. The Great Yarmouth crime and disorder reduction partnership was set a target of reducing British crime survey comparator crime by 18.9 per cent. but by the end of March this year, it had achieved a 28.5 per cent. reduction. That equates to a reduction of 2,045 crimes against a target of 1,376. Crimestoppers will clearly have played a real part in that. Since 2003-04, theft from a motor vehicle has fallen by 69 per cent., domestic burglary is down 56 per cent., robbery is down 44 per cent. and theft of a motor vehicle is down by one third. Violent crime has also dropped significantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/9">The strong performance on crime in my hon. Friend's constituency is reflected across Norfolk. Crimestoppers across Norfolk, including in Great Yarmouth, has clearly been of significant help in reducing the crime figures. Alongside that, there are now 114 more police officers in Norfolk than in March 1997 and some 230 community support officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/10">However, real challenges remain to be faced. Not only must we continue to cut crime and make communities safer, but we need to secure the confidence of communities in doing so. Crimestoppers in Great Yarmouth and elsewhere is crucial to that. We are serving a public who, quite rightly, expect and deserve better information, improved accountability, and timely and effective solutions across our public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/11">In tackling crime, one of our greatest challenges is meeting the needs and expectations of the public, winning their confidence and bringing them in as part of the solution. Crimestoppers helps us do that. From its origins in Great Yarmouth, a network of 39 regional boards has grown across the UK, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. More than 400 people are now involved, donating their spare time to the fight against crime. The campaigns that they mount, using funds that they raise locally themselves, target messages directly to members of the public to inform them about particular incidents where the police need help or to raise the community's awareness of a more general issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/12">It is incumbent on all of us to report crime that we witness or know something about so that offenders may be brought to justice. By providing a mechanism to pass information to the police and others reliably but anonymously, Crimestoppers helps people in communities to fulfil this citizen duty, even where they are in difficult, vulnerable, or dangerous circumstances. I pay tribute to those people&mdash;it would be remiss of us not to&mdash;who, through Crimestoppers or in other ways, try to support the police, often in difficult circumstances, to bring to justice offenders who are sometimes dangerous. As well as providing a means for people to report crime, Crimestoppers makes an important statement in every community in this country, effectively saying that we will do something about those who seek to undermine us and gain from their criminal behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/13">As Mike Cole saw on his visit to Illinois 25 years ago, Crimestoppers enables information to come to light that the police would simply not be able to get through traditional routes. For that reason, the Crimestoppers Trust charity has received Government funding in recent years as a strategic partner in our work to reduce crime. This year, that money is part of &pound;4 million provided by the Home Office to third sector partners involved in crime reduction, crime prevention and victim support work, with the Crimestoppers Trust being the largest recipient. Most recently, it has benefited from &pound;50,000 to pilot a new service aimed at young people to allow them to contact Crimestoppers anonymously by sending an SMS text message&mdash;an innovative approach that is already showing results, just as an anonymous phone line in Great Yarmouth first did 25 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/14">It is important to remember that Crimestoppers started in the communication age that existed 25 years ago and it was appropriate then. I hope that the example that I have just given demonstrates that Crimestoppers has to be an evolving concept, which remains true to its principles, but responds all the way along the line to the new communication age in which we live. Certainly, we should bear in mind the principle of people's being able to report crime anonymously and do their public duty in the way that Crimestoppers makes possible. We can now do that through SMS text messaging, and who knows where we go with this in future? The continuing development of Crimestoppers is important. As Mike Cole and Jim Carter reflect on that now, I wonder whether 25 years ago they would have thought that young people with mobile telephones would be able to report crime anonymously to the police through text messages. Sometimes, I wonder where we will be in 25 years with Crimestoppers and what the appropriate mechanism will be then.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/15">Since 1997, the Government have been successful in bringing down crime. The excellent results seen in Great Yarmouth in the last few years are an example of what can be achieved when efforts are properly targeted. For the future, it is right that we focus on working in partnership and building public confidence, both of which are at the core of the Government's plans to reduce crime and increase community safety. They were also at the core of what Mick Cole and Jim Carter set out to achieve 25 years ago when they brought the idea of Crimestoppers back from Peoria and set it up in Great Yarmouth. They foresaw its potential for the town, but I wonder whether they could have imagined just how it would take off and expand, thanks to the hard work, generosity and commitment of numerous others.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/16">As I said earlier, I am glad that we have had the opportunity in this debate to pay tribute to two men whose foresight has made each and every one of our communities safer. I am also pleased to pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth for supporting that work and for introducing this debate today, the importance of which is not necessarily reflected in its short title. However, when people read the debate's content and see the impact that Crimestoppers has had in bringing people to justice and leading to arrests&mdash;not just for small crimes, important as those are, but for murders, too&mdash;they will reflect on the brilliance of Mike Cole and Jim Carter in having the imagination to pick an idea up, seeing its potential and, above that, having the confidence to drive it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/17">I congratulate Mike Cole and Jim Carter and my hon. Friend. I hope that in 25 years, on the 50th anniversary of Crimestoppers, we shall reflect on a further 25 years of massive achievements and advancement.</p>
