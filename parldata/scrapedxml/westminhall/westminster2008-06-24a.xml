<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.6.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="6"  time="009:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0001.htm#08062481000467">
	<p pid="a.6.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> on his good fortune in securing the debate, on his choice of subject, and on the reasoned and persuasive way in which he presented his case. A long time ago I spent three years in the city that he has the privilege of representing. Whether the college that I occupied was a house in multiple occupation I am not quite sure; however, the issues that he has mentioned, of poor-quality accommodation outside the colleges, are as live now as they were then.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">Housing is nearing the top of the political agenda at the moment, having spent quite a long time in the relegation zone. The Government's ambitious target of 3 million homes by 2020 is looking increasingly ambitious. One could argue that of the three main housing sectors&mdash;owner-occupation, social renting and private renting&mdash;the one that we are debating is the only one operating effectively at the moment. Supply is way behind demand for social renting&mdash;below the levels of the 1990s. In the owner-occupation sector, builders have stopped buying land and are closing building sites, and mortgage finance is scarce and expensive. One could argue that the sector that is broadly in balance is private renting, with some 2.6 million homes being rented from more than 500,000 private landlords. Of course we need more good-quality rented accommodation, and since the market for private renting was liberalised in the 1980s there has been a continuing and steady expansion in supply. Indeed, I see from <i>The Independent</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2008-06-09">9 June</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Demand for rental properties is at record levels&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">In a debate about the private rented sector, of course one needs to consider the issues of regulation that the right hon. Member for Oxford, East has touched on, but one should also look at the broader issues of the role of the private rented sector, to see what more might be done to encourage responsible supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">I confess that when I saw that there was to be a debate about the regulation of the private rented sector a frisson ran through me, because we must not go back to the bad old days of statutory rent control and lifetime security of tenure, often lasting through two generations. There may be some who want to turn back the clock to regulation of that kind. I am delighted that the right hon. Member for Oxford, East did not make that case. With the housing market in the fragile state that it is now in, and with the need to reinforce measures to increase the supply of housing, we should not deter potential investors with unnecessary bureaucratic controls and regulations. Let us indeed have a sharp look at the abuses, some of which the right hon. Gentleman mentioned; but I need to be persuaded that the universal and rather bureaucratic registration scheme advocated by some is the right way forward, not least because I suspect that the costs would filter through to the tenants. In parallel with the issue of regulation that the right hon. Gentleman has raised, we should debate measures to promote the continued healthy growth and expansion of the private rented sector. It provides flexibility and choice and helps people in housing need. Indeed, with rents underpinned by housing benefit, the private rented sector has a key role to play in helping local authorities to meet their statutory obligations on homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/6">The report of the Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, &quot;The Supply of Rented Housing&quot;, provides a helpful background to the debate. I found it a good and balanced report. I should have liked a little more on pages 96 to 98 about what more could be done to encourage the private rented sector, to balance the slightly longer section on how we might regulate it. However, in paragraph 308 the Committee says:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/7" class="indent">&quot;We recommend that CLG investigate, in cooperation with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Treasury, reforming the taxation system and introducing other measures:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/8" class="indent">to promote greater institutional investment in the private rented sector&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/9">I want to spend a moment examining that proposition. Ever since the sector was liberalised in the 1980s there has been an imperative to get serious, respectable, long-term institutional funds invested in property for rent. If quoted companies and pension funds would invest in that sector of the market, that would provide responsible and stable institutional funding, underpinning or replacing the rather fragile investment to which the right hon. Member for Oxford, East referred. Of course they would employ good agents to manage the property&mdash;possibly registered social landlords. That would generate additional investment in housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/10">The right hon. Member for Oxford, East focused on HMOs in Oxford, but I hope that he will forgive me if I consider the slightly broader aspect of his debate&mdash;the regulation of the private rented sector&mdash;rather than wandering around Headington, Cowley, Blackbird Leys and other attractive areas in his constituency. When the Conservatives left office 11 years ago most of the spadework for the new framework for the private rented sector had been done. We had consulted the Council of Mortgage Lenders, the British Property Federation and the City, and the response was very positive. There was all-party support for a new fiscal regime for what were called real estate investment trusts. There were models for the approach in other parts of the world, and this country pioneered investment trusts for shares. A REIT is in effect an investment trust for property.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/11">After some delay the Government took the debate forward, and I give them credit for that. We had the Kate Barker report, and then in March 2004 the Treasury produced a consultation paper, which stated at paragraph 1.14 that a real estate investment trust</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/12" class="indent">&quot;structure in the UK would therefore set a challenge for the industry to encourage development of new housing, which could...be managed within&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/13">a REIT structure. It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Improvements and expansion to this sector could enhance efficiency and flexibility in the housing market&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/15">and added:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/16" class="indent">&quot;The Government is keen to encourage greater renewal in the property sector, and the development of new...residential buildings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/17">Finally, it said that the Government wanted</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/18" class="indent">&quot;to stimulate greater development activity in the residential market providing a vehicle into which new properties can be converted and managed more efficiently.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/19">It is a matter of deep regret that some two years after the Finance Bill 2006 changed the regime for REITs, there has not, to my knowledge, been a single REIT investing in residential property. There have been several REITs, but they have been for commercial property, where there is not the same demand for fresh investment. If one wants to invest in commercial property there are many vehicles for that, and there is no shortage of institutional capital for commercial property as there is for accommodation for rent. Why has the Kate Barker vision not been achieved? Why have the Government's ambitions, as described in the passages I quoted, not been secured? Will the Minister now kick-start the debate to get respectable institutional funders engaged in the market, to the benefit of those who need good-quality accommodation for rent?</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/20">The right hon. Member for Oxford, East referred to the review of the private rented sector that the Government have announced. I am not absolutely convinced that the issue of increasing investment and supply is at the top of its agenda. The fourth in a series of bullet points asks:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Given the recent regulatory changes, what more should or could be done to ensure a professionally managed and quality sector to meet demand pressures?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/22">I do not think that that quite takes the trick as to the urgency of reviewing the fiscal regime and restarting the dialogue with potential investors to get things going.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/23">I have a brief final point to make. We need to harness the resources of the private rented sector much more effectively than we have so far, to help those in desperate housing need. Many local authorities have developed a dialogue with their private landlords, who have rent deposit schemes, rent guarantee schemes and the like. All too often, however, local landlords are still reluctant to take nominees. I hope that the Minister will do all that he can to promote a wider and deeper partnership between local authorities and responsible private landlords, to make sure that good-quality accommodation is made available to those who are confronted with homelessness, and that there is not exclusive reliance on the social rented sector. I wonder whether it is time to dust down a scheme called HAMA&mdash;housing associations as managing agents&mdash;by which the local authority or housing association takes a lease on a property owned by a private landlord and guarantees the private landlord the income stream from the rent, vacant possession when he wants the property back, and the return of the property in the same good condition as when it was leased.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/24">The scheme has much to commend it. The landlord gets a reliable tenant with a guaranteed income stream, namely the local authority, and, crucially, the tenant, who may well be vulnerable, gets a responsible managing agent, namely the housing association or local authority. It seems to me that there is merit in driving forward that scheme, or re-activating it if it is not being used as extensively as it might. Given the amount of property overhanging the market, some of it might be acquired using back-to-back finance from the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/25">I welcome this debate. There is a case for reconsidering the regulatory regime; it is somewhat ramshackle. I have no objection to the sort of review proposed by the right hon. Gentleman, but given the state of the housing market, a review of regulation needs to be accompanied by radical measures to increase supply.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.2/1">My right hon. Friend makes a strong point. If half the residents who move into such a property have cars, the number of cars on that property doubles, as does the number of spaces required to park them if there is no off-road parking, with the effects that he described.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/2">I should say immediately that it is not that steps have not been taken in recent years to recognise how rented accommodation affects communities and how tenants in rented accommodation, and indeed good landlords, can be protected properly. I take on board the suggestions made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase>, who emphasised that a good and viable rental sector must operate in order to fill the needs of a section of the population, and that the landlords of those properties need reasonable circumstances in which to rent them. I suggest that the Housing Act 2004, among other things, created circumstances that benefit good landlords and disbenefit the occasional bad landlords who, unfortunately, purchase properties with no thought for how they might be managed and then simply let them run down, with the consequences that I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/3">The tenant deposit scheme has benefited good landlords and tenants alike, and has worked well. Under the registration system introduced in the Housing Act 2004, good landlords can be licensed and participate in arrangements to ensure that properties are well maintained as far as health and safety and environmental features are concerned. I suggest, however, that those schemes do not take into account a good proportion of what any member of the public realises to be homes in multiple occupation. That is a central feature of this debate. A house occupied by six or seven people is, by anybody's reckoning, a house in multiple occupation, yet in law it may not be, depending on what kind of law is applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/4">The Housing Act 2004 introduced a new definition, for registration purposes, of a house in multiple occupation: it is a house in which a number of people live who are unrelated to each other, whether or not they live as one household. Under planning law, a house in multiple occupation must be divided into separate flats, and each person in that house must have separate services. Otherwise, in most circumstances, the house is regarded under planning law as a house in shared occupation and not a house in multiple occupation.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/5">That means that virtually all student houses in cities such as Oxford, Southampton and Brighton are not regarded as houses in multiple occupation for planning purposes, when everybody can see that they are. A landlord who wishes to purchase a property and move in six or seven people&mdash;they may well be students, although I do not wish to make any anti-student comments, because it is extremely important that students have somewhere to live in the cities where they study&mdash;can do so without making any changes to the house or being subject to any planning regulation whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/6">A full registration under the Housing Act 2004 makes it possible to register smaller HMOs under the definition in the Act. As my right hon. Friend said, there is still some concern about whether the registration of a whole city is what was envisaged under the Act's special registration arrangements, or whether particular red-lined areas of HMO stress might instead be the concentration.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/7">The effect on Southampton can be seen in terms of those two possibilities. It is certainly true that Southampton has areas of high HMO stress. On one street, for example, some 55 out of 75 homes are now HMOs. In one small estate, built relatively recently in my constituency, out of 25 houses, 19 have now been purchased as HMOs, and as a result the whole nature of the estate has changed rapidly within just a few years. In Southampton, out of an estimated 12,000 HMOs, only 500 are registered under the Housing Act with its current definition.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/8">If we were to align the definitions in the Housing Act with those in planning, and recognise that in reality there is a change of use when a house is purchased and place under the sort of management that I have described, matters could be very different, and local authorities could regulate to a much greater extent how that change takes place. Of course, that would place an onus on local authorities to institute a sensible planning framework in which those changes could be reflected. They would also have to address questions about, for example, the number of HMOs in a particular area relative to properties in other kinds of use and about planning arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.2/9">The simple fact that planning and housing legislation were aligned would not mean, of course, that all local authorities would have to put in place those arrangements. Many local authority areas have a low HMO density, so it would not make much sense, and would serve no great purpose, to have an excessive regulatory regime in such areas. However, to provide local authorities with the ability to say to a landlord, &quot;You need planning agreement for your proposed changes; we will not necessarily withhold it, but we will consider their wider effect on the community first,&quot; would represent a modest but important change to the regulation of this market.</p>

	<p pid="a.11.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point, and we ought to consider the economics of many such arrangements: seven people paying fairly substantial sums per room in a property where they live and share facilities will always effectively outbid a family under the same sort of circumstances. I do not blame landlords for choosing that route&mdash;that is the economics of their housing arrangement&mdash;but nevertheless it changes the complexion of neighbourhoods. Furthermore, families who might otherwise reasonably expect a house to be available on the rented market find themselves excluded. Although it is important that the rented market overall is kept healthy, surely it is not right ultimately that such distortion should be endemic, as it appears to be, in the rented market.</p>
	<p pid="a.11.1/2">Modest changes in the way that local authorities can consider the operation of HMOs would be widely welcomed in many towns and cities across the country. I welcome the Government's recent announcement of a review of the presence and effect of HMOs, and I hope that consultation papers will follow. If that ameliorates the situation, I will welcome it greatly. None of the suggestions heard today are panaceas that will revert communities to an imagined past in which people skipped down the street happy and contented, with their front walls beautifully kept up and hedges trimmed. However, they might change the circumstances under which people view their communities, so that everyone&mdash;be it those living in student houses, rented properties, either as families or individuals, or owner-occupiers&mdash;can live in greater harmony, understanding the circumstances applying to each of their forms of tenure. If we can make that change, we will have taken a very welcome step forward for housing and communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.12.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit Öpik" colnum="12"  time="010:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0002.htm#08062481000475">
	<p pid="a.12.1/1">The hon. Lady speaks from personal and tragic experience in her constituency and makes a very sensible point. Her strategic suggestion is that regulation is required to reduce the risk of death and injury resulting from fires in HMOs. I am sympathetic such an idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/2">Why are the Government willing to preside over such a differential in relative risk between single-occupancy houses and those under state regulation, and the private rented HMO sector? Are the Government really not willing to legislate? In the Minister's defence, Britain is in the grip of a housing crisis. We need to be more imaginative in finding solutions to that problem, and that means increasing housing density and making the most of brownfield development and the maximum use of the UK's 850,000 empty homes. However, we must recognise that the Government are under pressure, because although the Minister is unlikely to admit it, if they were to regulate HMOs and deal with overcrowding, it would add to the housing crisis. If accommodation density were reduced to improve its quality, the people displaced from such overcrowding would necessarily have to join the homeless list. I am sympathetic to the unspoken argument that the Government have to address, but we must recognise that they have a choice: either they can tacitly accept that the absence of regulation is, in some ways, necessary if the housing crisis is not to be exacerbated; or, more courageously, they can admit that because the private rented sector plays such a vital role by providing homes for more than 2 million families, it is difficult to see how one can square the circle.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/3">My second question is therefore whether the Minister is willing to be candid and to acknowledge that one consideration, limitation and resisting factor to such regulations is the Government's private acceptance that to introduce them would make the homelessness problem even worse. There is no shame in admitting that. If the Minister were to say so, I do not see how it could be harmful, because after all, successive Governments have done exactly the same. If the Government do, and the Minister can, admit it, however, we can start talking about what we can realistically do to use the private rented sector&mdash;regulated, as it could be&mdash;as part of the solution, while handling the difficulty of causing more displaced individuals and homeless people. If we can improve the image of the rented sector by encouraging best practice and making the most of new legislation, the benefits for Britain's housing market could be significant. The benefits for the residents would be unquestionable, but more than anything, we could seriously start to close the differential between houses and homes under state regulation and those in the private rented sector, which as right hon. and hon. Members have pointed out, remain largely unregulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/4">I want to think about some specifics and to ask the Minister three further questions. The tenancy deposit scheme that was introduced in the Housing Act 2004 offers real opportunities for landlords and tenants&mdash;the issue has been touched on indirectly already&mdash;because it will protect both the reputations of good landlords and those tenants who might have had bad experiences. It will also encourage landlords and tenants into the sector. The scheme should be not an encumbrance but a promoter of good practice and a safeguard for tenants and landlords if problems arise. As far I can see, however, it has not had a very wide take-up. Does the Minister have a view on that? If so, does he agree that we should more assertively drive that very useful element of the 2004 Act, which the Government introduced, in order to improve the relationship between landlords and tenants and to give landlords more confidence to rent out their property, even if they have previously had bad experiences? That could release accommodation and improve the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/5">The Minister may know that with one quarter of the energy that we use in this country being consumed in our homes, the Liberal Democrats believe that energy efficiency in the home is fundamental to tackling climate change. As part of the drive to create homes that are more energy-efficient, we would introduce a scheme to reassure householders that standardised packages will improve energy efficiency. We propose an energy mortgage: a long-term loan, secured on the property and repaid through the household's energy bill. Such a &quot;warm home&quot; package would normally ensure that the householder's energy bill falls by at least as much from the reduced energy use as it rises to pay for the energy saving package. Does the Minister have a view on that? It would take away the large up-front cost when the money was invested and ensure that it was paid back in a sensible and measured long-term way. It sounds like common sense to me, and I cannot see how the Government can achieve their environmental targets unless they take on a similar scheme. I hope that the Minister will say whether he has any sympathy with that Liberal Democrat proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/6">The Government have done good work in improving standards in social housing, but they have almost entirely disregarded the private sector. Once again, we return to the difficulty of a two-tier scheme. The difficulty could have been resolved during proceedings on the Housing and Regeneration Bill, but it was not. The issue is writ large in the energy efficiency situation, because private tenants are now least likely to have double glazing, central heating, insulation or draught-proofing. It is also difficult for private landlords to invest in improving their properties in that way, because although most landlords would prefer to provide a decent home to their tenants, the necessary repairs can be uneconomic.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/7">In order to help the private sector to deal with that situation, will the Government consider cutting the VAT that is paid on repairs to homes, potentially making the improvements needed affordable for landlords? We would also encourage elderly or disabled tenants to invest their winter fuel payments in energy efficiency products. Will the Government do anything to support the same kind of thing?</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/8">The wider social repercussions of encouraging good landlording can be significant. In dealing with antisocial behaviour, for instance, the Government have tended to focus on monitoring the behaviour of the tenant. I have argued that the promotion of good standards of housing would also lead to a reduction in antisocial behaviour by helping to create a climate of responsibility that encouraged responsible tenants and owners. My final question to the Minister therefore is whether he would be willing to enter a serious dialogue about the opportunities for creating sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/9">I am very sceptical about whether antisocial behaviour orders are doing much good. Indeed, they are a badge of honour in many places. Considerate construction&mdash;bearing in mind the human need for association&mdash;and natural flow lines have created successful local communities and done much more to reduce antisocial behaviour than any investment in policing and in suppressing the opportunity to be a bad tenant or neighbour. Is the Minister willing to enter a sensible and, I hope, cross-party dialogue to see whether we can establish what, in terms of the built environment, differentiates successful from unsuccessful communities? That would be very important for the private sector, because, assuming we hit upon some general guidelines, we could require such good practice to be built into it. We do need to build more social housing, of course, but we do not have to depend on the majority of it being built in the public sector. Similarly, we do not have to run away from the benefits of the HMO sector simply because, currently, it is difficult for some people to achieve the standards that they wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.1/10">I am glad that we are having the debate and very pleased to have had the opportunity to ask the Minister those half-dozen or so questions. I hope that he will engage in dialogue rather than sidestep them or say that we cannot reopen the issue and that he is fundamentally opposed to regulating the private rented sector. If he must take that line, he will need to explain why. Conversely, if he sees some merit in ensuring that the same standards apply to the private rented sector as they do to the public rented sector, notwithstanding the fact that we have missed the opportunity with the Housing and Regeneration Bill, I hope that we can find another way to ensure that those standards are improved. No one can doubt that multiple occupancy will continue and that we will continue to depend on the private rented sector for a significant proportion of housing, but no one can doubt either that unless there is some regulation, there will still be the lamentable differential between the private and public sectors in terms of the risk of fire and in terms of quality of life. I do not believe that a Labour Government can, with any conscience, allow such a differential to persist.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.2/1">And the hon. Gentleman, indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> on his well-presented, well-researched and passionate contribution, which was based on his unique experiences representing a seat in the city of Oxford that faces the problems that he mentioned. He focused substantially on houses in multiple occupation, which resonated with me. I shall focus more on the wider sector, but I shall speak about HMOs later.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/3">The private rented sector accounts for about 10 per cent. of all homes in the UK and has the potential to play a much fuller and more effective part in meeting future housing needs. Private landlords could play an important role in bringing under-utilised or empty properties into occupation. The sector is diverse and based on flexibility, and it offers tenants choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/4">There is some consensus between the parties about the Housing Act 2004, and we concede that we agree with a lot of things in it. Current legislation empowers local authorities through health and safety rating systems, HMO regulation, licensing and voluntary accreditation schemes, and there is broad support for that from organisations such as the National Landlords Association and the Association of Residential Letting Agents.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/5">We welcome the current review of both HMOs and the private rented sector, under the auspices of the university of York&mdash;the Rugg and Rhodes review. It is important that we restrict any moves towards regulations or legislation until we have the full results of that review. Its first two terms of reference are important, stating that it must consider:</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/6" class="indent">&quot;What is the composition of the private rented sector and the regional characteristics? Who lives in the sector and who are the providers?</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/7" class="indent">Given demographic and social change, what impact might this have on future demand and supply pressures in the sector and how should key players respond to this?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.2/8">The right hon. Member for Oxford, East, rather body-swerved the important point made by my erstwhile hon. Friend, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>. It is important that there are significant pressures on the delivery of public services, including housing, in a number of hotspots. There has been a particular impact on the private rented sector. The review might assist in informing the Government much more coherently of where those pressures are, without there necessarily being a need for further regulation and legislation.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.3/1">Far be it from me to dispute fiscal policy with a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, but we must use the regulatory system and fiscal policy to drive up standards and deliver what we all want&mdash;better homes for people who have made their own choice that they do not want to be housed in social housing or become owner-occupiers. We cannot pursue solely a stick policy, although, as I shall argue later, it is important to concentrate in regulations and legislation on clamping down on rogue landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.3/2">The recent position paper by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors urged the Government to consider capacity, quality and choice in the private rented sector as part of the role in creating sustainable communities, a point that the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire mentioned. It also pointed out that the sector's benefits to tenants, such as the</p>
	<p pid="a.16.3/3" class="indent">&quot;freedom and flexibility to move around and the opportunity to leave the family nest without the burden of home ownership&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.16.3/4">are an important factor in its viability. In that respect, it offers</p>
	<p pid="a.16.3/5" class="indent">&quot;benefits in terms of mobility of labour&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.3/6">The RICS cautioned against radical moves to regulate the sector further, which may reduce profits and choke off investment in it. It is as well to mention that the buy-to-let sector has so far sustained relatively little damage from the credit crunch and associated economic problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.3/7">This issue is not just about propping up profits; it is about recognising the fact that if profits are hit and investment dries up, that will have an impact on housing supply and rents for some of the most vulnerable people in the private sector, as we have conceded. The focus needs to be on the lower end of the private rented sector to improve standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.3/8">Returning to the issue of energy efficiency&mdash;a point raised by the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire&mdash;I suspect that the Minister will not fully concur with the typically well thought out Liberal Democrat policy on energy efficiency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.17.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" speakername="Stewart Jackson" colnum="17"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0003.htm#08062481000484">
	<p pid="a.17.1/1">However, I think that there is a broad consensus across the House that there needs to be further incentives. We welcome the landlords energy saving allowance, which dates from 2004, but perhaps it has not been as well-publicised as it needs to be, and we need to expand the publicity for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/2">Overall, we need to get the balance of rights and responsibilities between landlords and tenants right; the same is true of the balance between enforced self-regulation and further legislation. We must be careful not to target good landlords with burdensome regulation while letting unscrupulous landlords operate with impunity. Further regulation will pile on time and cost pressures in a market that is already potentially precarious.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/3">I agree with hon. Members who have referred to the tenancy deposit scheme. Again, the Conservative party believes that that scheme is a sensible way forward and should be expanded. The fact is that the worst case scenarios envisaged in and informing the Housing Act 2004 have not come to fruition, and self-regulation and self-accreditation have been successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/4">An important point raised by all hon. Members&mdash;I mentioned it earlier myself&mdash;is the resources for local authorities. It is extremely important and pertinent to understand that often local authorities do not have the resources to deal with the commensurate pressure on the private rented sector by means of houses in multiple occupation; that includes my own local authority in Peterborough, for instance, where we have had 15,000 to 20,000 new EU migrants coming into the Greater Peterborough area in the last four years. Local authorities do not have the staff and they certainly do not have the money to deal with these huge pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/5">Again, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire, who is the Liberal Democrat spokesman, is quite right on this question: it is about not just absolute numbers but cultural issues. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">The hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> also touched on it in her brief intervention earlier. It is something that the Government need to look at, following on from their review of houses in multiple occupation and the university of York review.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/6">If the housing market was stronger, I do not think there would be such an imperative to examine this area, but there is such an imperative. The Residential Landlords Association has made the point that we need to develop more comprehensive self-regulation, so that local authorities can then focus more time and energy, through environmental health officers, selective licensing schemes and so on, on those rogue landlords who are mistreating and abusing tenants, often illegally.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/7">It is also as well to concede the very important point that my right hon. Friend the Member for North-West Hampshire made: it seems unbelievable that, after 11 years of a Labour Government, we have not moved on in developing more innovative schemes to free up the market, using market mechanisms. In particular, he referred to real estate investment trusts and institutional investment, which have gone nowhere since the Barker report was published two years ago. He also referred, quite rightly, to the dialogue between local authorities and local landlords and the potential development of the housing association management scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/8">I would also like to mention the importance of leaving in place, at least until the review, and in my opinion beyond that, section 21 of the Housing Act 1988, because that measure is the centre of the legislative framework for the private rented sector. I believe that we do not need to amend the 1988 Act, because if we did it would send a significantly negative message and have a negative impact on the market, particularly on investment in the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/9">In conclusion, we await the university of York review and hope that it will properly inform a debate on the future of the private rented sector. Until then, we should reserve judgment on further legislation and regulation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.18.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="18"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0003.htm#08062481000485">
	<p pid="a.18.0/1">Unlike <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the hon. Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase>, this is not the first time that I have served under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. Given that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> are also here today, this debate very much feels like a reunion of the Housing and Regeneration Public Bill Committee, which was so excellently chaired by your good self.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">I would like to begin by congratulating my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> on securing this very important debate. His excellent contribution this morning set the tone for the rest of the debate, given that it was considered, measured and reasoned. All the contributions this morning have demonstrated those traits.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/3">As a Government, we want to ensure that people have access to the right sort of homes, and the private rented sector makes a real contribution to that aim. The sector is by no means a homogenous market: nearly two thirds of households in the private rented sector are categorised as economically active; and more than three quarters of tenants in the sector are under the age of 35. For these people, who are often in the first stages of their career, the attraction of private renting is its flexibility. However, as has already been mentioned, the sector also provides housing for vulnerable people; just under a fifth of all tenants in the private rented sector are on housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/4">The introduction of the new local housing allowance is giving those tenants greater choice about where they live, as it will allow them to see in advance the properties that they can afford. It was particularly apt that my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East secured this debate, because I cannot really think of anywhere else that has as diverse a range of housing supply as Oxford, particularly within the private rented sector. In Oxford, there are the universities, there are affluent professionals, who may be working in the City or commuting to work elsewhere in London, and there is also a range of vulnerable people. So it is incredibly appropriate that he was able to secure this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/5">One point that has been mentioned is the importance of landlords being able to secure a return on their investment. It is important to stress that we recognise that private landlords are running a business and therefore expect to secure that return. However, what I am clear about, and it is a point that has been touched on already in this debate, is that that should not be at the expense of adopting a professional approach to letting, and offering a quality product to the tenant.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/6">In an important part of his contribution to the debate, my right hon. Friend mentioned the issue of retaliatory eviction. I am very aware of the possibility of landlords evicting tenants who seek to enforce their rights, and also that some tenants may be reluctant to complain about poor conditions for fear that their landlord may then seek to end the tenancy. That situation seems to be an unintended consequence of section 21 of the 1988 Act. I have such a situation in my own constituency, with constituents coming to me in my surgeries and telling me about such problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/7">The practice of retaliatory eviction should be stopped. However, I think that all hon. Members will also be aware of the fine balance between landlord and tenant rights. I am very keen to see an end to the practice of retaliatory eviction. Equally, however, I want to ensure that landlords do not face problems with tenants failing to pay the rent and committing antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/8">To help us achieve that vision, we need not only regulation but regulation that is targeted and focused, recognising, as we should, the balance between encouraging good landlords&mdash;to ensure that we raise the standards&mdash;and trying to get rid of rogue landlords. We must protect the interests of both good landlords and good tenants, while moving away from unprofessional landlords and bad tenants. That targeted balance is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/9">We had a commitment to bring appropriate levels of regulation to the private rented sector and we fulfilled that commitment in the Housing Act 2004, an Act that has been mentioned a number of times this morning. In introducing that legislation, we took a measured view of the costs, benefits and deliverability of statutory regulation of the private rented sector. We were very keen not to stunt the growth that had been seen in the sector over the last decade or so. However, we were equally keen to send out a signal that poor management and unsafe property conditions were absolutely unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/10">The changes are based on an assessment of how risks can best be identified and addressed. They empower local authorities to act to secure good standards on both a statutory and a voluntary basis. Targeted regulation can be used to underpin the development of sustainable partnerships between landlords and the local authority. I shall mention several measures in the 2004 Act that demonstrate our commitment to those principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/11">Mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation has been a major theme of the debate. The Act defines HMOs as buildings of three storeys or more that are occupied by five or more people in two or more households. Real progress is being made by local authorities using their powers to tackle potentially the most problematic parts of the sector, but I recognise that there is much more to do, as has been said this morning. Local authorities cannot rest on their laurels. They have to get out and enforce against landlords who have not come forward to be licensed. We should not forget that the Act also puts in place legislation about the management of HMOs more generally which all local authorities can use if they find problems in particular properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/12">We are now starting to get applications from some councils to establish discretionary licensing regimes to cover smaller HMOs and ordinary private rented property. We have made it clear that any schemes should be for small, discrete parts of an authority, be targeted at specific problems, and have agreed outcomes. For such schemes to be successful, they have to be a tool within a wider package of intervention and regeneration initiatives in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/13">So far, we have approved seven selective licensing schemes. Several more selective and additional licensing schemes are being developed by local authorities including my own&mdash;Hartlepool&mdash;and Oxford. I took on board what my right hon. Friend said in support of the application in his area. The knowledge that local authorities can and will take targeted steps to deal with problem areas will give people confidence when they make their decision about where to live.</p>

	<p pid="a.21.4/1">I am grateful to the Minister. Actually, I feel quite intimate towards him as well. In response to all the interventions, he implies that the Government would sort of like to regulate the private sector and so on, which is great. He said that they would like to regulate on the basis of considerations of costs, benefits and deliverability. Further to what the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire said, surely it is obvious that the Government are loth to regulate the private sector to the same standard as the public sector, primarily because they are frightened that, if they take away or harm the profit motive, there will not be enough private sector accommodation to help alleviate the housing crisis. It is a simple matter for the Government to admit that. If the Minister will not admit it, can he tell us what the motive is for the differential between the private and state sectors?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.21.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="21"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0004.htm#08062481000493">
	<p pid="a.21.5/1">I disagree with the hon. Gentleman's line of questioning, to be honest. I thought that I had made it clear that I would like bad landlords moved away from the sector altogether. That might reduce the amount of stock, but I would be more than happy to see it. I know that it would cause housing supply pressures, but bad landlords are not good for the sector or for housing policy, full stop.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/2">I would like targeted regulation that builds on the good work in the 2004 Act, to ensure that we incentivise good landlords and penalise bad ones, and to ensure that the private rented sector is a good housing choice for some people, even if it is not appropriate for others. I want to encourage the private sector. It is a good offer in the 21st century, and we would like more of it, but not at the expense of good, professional standards. I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/3">The third element, which was touched on by the hon. Gentleman, is the protection of tenants' deposits. That is a good example of regulation, and I sense from the debate that it has the general approval of the House. We introduced schemes to safeguard tenancy deposits just over a year ago. They target another potential abuse of tenants. Since the launch, more than 1 million deposits have been protected, and almost &pound;1 billion of cash has been safeguarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/4">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said that it seems the scheme is not working very well. I take issue with that: I think that the figures speak for themselves, and that the scheme has been a big success.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/5">A major part of today's debate has been about the so-called 'studentification' problem and issues relating to HMOs. I believe we can all agree that students can make a substantial contribution to sustaining and regenerating communities. However, I appreciate, as I imagine all hon. Members do, that high concentrations of students living together in certain parts of university towns can lead to problems such as antisocial behaviour, the possible closure of under-used community facilities such as schools and churches&mdash;I saw that vividly during my recent visit to Loughborough&mdash;and reduced opportunities for first-time buyers to enter home ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/6">I stress that my Department and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills are working closely together on the matter. I had a meeting last week with the Under-Secretary with responsibility for it. We have a cross-governmental approach to ensuring that this Government's policy of university expansion and the expansion of student numbers, which is right, goes hand in hand with considerations about housing policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/7">I was taken by some of the points made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East and by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> about HMOs and possible changes to planning designations. I am considering at present how the problems associated with high concentrations of HMOs, particularly in areas of student housing, can be addressed. I am focusing on possible changes to planning legislation as well as exploring existing measures. I propose to consult later this year on proposals to amend the use class orders in respect of HMOs, which I think will be a welcome step. It will allow us to have a full and frank debate on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/8">Several hon. Members mentioned the independent review of the private rented sector. Again, I detected cross-party consensus and approval. The review has a wide remit to consider how the sector meets current needs and expectations, and whether and how the experiences of landlords and tenants might be improved. In the context of future demand and supply pressures in the private rented sector, the review will investigate what needs to be done to ensure that private renting offers people the right type of homes of good quality, both now and in the future, and what more should or could be done to raise professionalism among private landlords&mdash;a point that I addressed to the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/9">The review will also consider the important matter of security of tenure when exploring whether more needs to be done to improve the experiences of private sector landlords and tenants in respect of their rights and responsibilities. I get from my constituency surgeries, as I imagine other hon. Members do, the idea that people would like some sort of security of tenure. I think that that means increasing the supply of social rented homes, because people like the idea of security of tenure but it might not be on offer in the private rented sector. Providing a wide spectrum of choice is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.5/10">I very much look forward to receiving the findings of the report in October. I want a strong private rented sector that encourages and assists the majority of well-intentioned landlords to stay in the sector but shows less professional landlords the door. That means striking a balance between the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants, and between regulation and voluntary initiatives. Whether we have struck that balance or need to do more is something that I imagine will come back in our weekly sojourns to this place&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.27.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" speakername="David Laws" colnum="27"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0005.htm#08062481000497">
	<p pid="a.27.1/1">The only one in Somerset, and one of two in the entire area.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">For those who do not know Hinton St. George&mdash;there may be some&mdash;it is a beautiful village in the centre of south Somerset. I say that not just because all our villages are beautiful&mdash;no doubt they are in all constituencies&mdash;but Hinton St. George is particularly striking. It is a historic heritage settlement with a population approaching 500, not including the many people who pass through daily to get to the school, and the many tourists and others from the surrounding catchment area of 1,500 people. The main part of the village is a wide main street lined with hamstone cottages, many of which are thatched. The guide book states that it has a &quot;thriving shop&quot;, which is true, but unfortunately that thriving shop is where the post office is located. It is threatened with closure, although it has been a post office since 1840 and the era of the penny black.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/3">The village is not on a main road, and the roads that come into it are single track with no pavements. That adds to the village's quiet and calm and the feeling that it is from a pre-car age, but that also means that it is difficult for my constituents to access services outside the village because of public transport and because they cannot walk along roads with no pavements. I shall come to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/4">There is a popular village school, an excellent tea shop, a pub with a national reputation, and, notably for the purposes of the consultation, one of the largest retired populations of any village in Somerset, with 37 per cent. of its inhabitants being of pension age, which is a high proportion by any standards. There is a strong sense of community in the village, and that has been on display since the announcement that the post office was included in those earmarked for closure a couple of weeks ago. There has been a lot of media attention, both in the local area and in the region, about the possible closure. A packed public meeting in the village was attended by half of its residents, and people overflowed from the main village hall to outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/5">The postmasters, Peter and Sue Knight, are both popular and have run the post office store for more than 20 years. They are keen to continue the business, and an active campaign committee has already been established in the village. I pay tribute to the committee, which is leading a non-political campaign. It consists of Les Farris, Derek Esp, Liz Davis, Matthew Bryant, David Clements, Andrew Norton and Kerry King, as well as three representatives from the parish council, chairman Fred Voss, and members Jane Bourne and Brian Smith. The campaign hopes to have a public meeting with Post Office Ltd and to meet the Postwatch group. I have already met Post Office Ltd's regional manager, Tony Jones, who kindly travelled at short notice from Bridgend in Wales to discuss the matter. That was much appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/6">I hope that the Minister will get the message that there is a lot of passion about keeping the post office open, as there often is, but it is even greater than normal. The extremely strong business case for keeping it open is particularly striking, even by the Government's criteria, and I shall touch on three or four of the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/7">One issue is distance and proximity to other post offices. There is a small postal service at the garage in the village of Merriott, which is about 1.5 miles away, but it has not been earmarked by Post Office Ltd as one of the two alternative post offices in the branch access report because it does not provide the range of services necessary to meet the access requirements. Indeed, it has gone out of business in two different forms and under two different managers during the past 18 months. It has only just found its feet again in the petrol station and retail unit in the centre of the village. I understand that it is doing extremely well under its new managers, but like all units located in larger retail and petrol station outlets in rural areas, it is bound to face many pressures over the years to come. However, because it does not supply a full range of post office services, it does not meet the criteria specified in the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/8">The other post offices that Post Office Ltd has suggested as alternatives for that community are at South Petherton and Crewkerne. South Petherton is 3.5 miles away, and there is no direct public transport link; and Crewkerne is 3 miles away. The Government's minimum access criteria, which are supposed to have informed the consultation and closure programme, are that 90 per cent. of the population should be within 1 mile of the nearest outlet, and that clearly will not be met if the closure goes ahead; and in rural areas that 95 per cent. of the population should live within 3 miles. It seems to me that the case for closure fails both tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/9">On the question of access and public transport, the Post Office was very open, saying that access to the alternative post offices was not good. The lanes out of Hinton St. George are narrow, single-track roads without pavements. It would be unrealistic to expect anyone, particularly the elderly or those with young children, to walk along those lanes, as they are extremely dangerous. South Petherton has no direct public transport link. On the option of not using public transport, the branch access report states that</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/10" class="indent">&quot;the terrain between the branches is hilly along a narrow country lane with no pavement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/11">It also states that parking is difficult near the post office, which as I said is 3.5 miles away.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/12">Merriott, which is not the main alternative, would be impossible to reach on foot, and the only public transport service that would bring passengers back to the village from which they had departed runs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays&mdash;and that involves waiting two hours for the next bus back.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/13">As for Crewkerne, which is 3 miles distant, the branch access report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The terrain between the branches is hilly along narrow country lanes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/15">There are only two bus services a day, one of which involves a two-hour wait for the return service; the other means waiting for four hours and 10 minutes. The parking facilities in Crewkerne are restricted and under pressure. The branch access report claimed that</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/16" class="indent">&quot;parking facilities are available within 60 yards of the branch&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/17">but there are only four or five spaces, with limited time, and in my experience they are almost always full. The distance to the branches is great, there is little or nor public transport, people are not able to walk to them, and the parking facilities are poor.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/18">Disabled access and access for elderly people is another big issue. The existing shop and post office in Hinton St. George is ideal for the elderly and disabled because it gives them easy access, with generous parking facilities outside. However, as I said earlier, 37 per cent. of people in the village are retired, and a large number are very elderly and find it difficult to walk long distances. The village also has a large number of people with physical and learning disabilities. Although it is easy to gain access to the existing facility in Hinton St. George, that is not the case for the alternatives. Access to South Petherton is a long journey over hilly terrain. The branch does not have disabled access; indeed, there are steps up to the post office, and there is no wheelchair access. As I said earlier, there is no direct bus service.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/19">As I said, it is not possible to reach Crewkerne on foot, and disabled access is not readily available on the bus. Only one bus in the local fleet has a wheelchair lift, but apparently it is broken and the bus company has said that it cannot afford to replace it. Even if it is replaced, there is no guarantee that it would be available on that route. Although there are some low-platform buses in that part of Somerset, there are not many, and they cannot be used on any of the services to and from Hinton because of the narrowness of the lanes in the surrounding area. On distance, public transport and disability, the alternative post offices have serious impediments, so they should not be considered as viable alternatives to the existing post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/20">The assumptions that the Post Office makes on the transferability of services&mdash;I understand that they are an important part of judging which post offices should stay and which should go&mdash;may not be sound. The Minister may be able to clarify the matter, but I understand that we are not allowed to know what those assumptions are, nor to see the ranking list of post offices. They are ranked according to four sets of criteria, and those criteria are fundamental in determining which post offices should stay and which should go. I ask the Minister to consider giving us sight of the criteria for Somerset, because it might help in determining whether assumptions are based on a realistic judgment of the Hinton post office and the alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/21">I also raise the issue of other post offices in the area that are at risk of closure. I hope that Post Office Ltd will be able to find new sub-postmasters for the post offices at Buckland St. Mary and East Chinnock, as one has left and the other has said recently that he will be leaving. What will happen, given that East Chinnock is relatively near to the area that we are discussing, if either or both of those post offices close? Although East Chinnock is a substitute closure, will there still be a determination to press ahead with finding an additional office to close&mdash;even if, by default, another post office closure turns out to be unavoidable?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/22">Given that those other post offices seem similar in some ways, or have even smaller catchment areas than the one in Hinton St. George, could we not see the ranking list at least for the Yeovil constituency element of Somerset in order to determine the relative ranking of those post offices that appear to be at risk of closure by their own means? I am far from convinced that we would find a rational basis for ranking them that far apart. Will the Minister say whether it would be possible to establish how far apart they are, and the basis of that calculation?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/23">I hope that I have made it clear that we have seen not only a huge decline in the sub-post office network in Somerset over the past 10 or 20 years, but that it has been particularly acute in the past five to 10 years. That is having a devastating impact on many of the rural communities that rely not only on the sub-post office service but on what are often the last retail outlets in quite large villages. I hope that pressure from many hon. Members will eventually persuade the Government to think again about their national strategy, which is well under way. I also hope that by raising these issues today, the Minister and Post Office Ltd can be persuaded to think again about the post office closure at Hinton St. George, which is highly valued in the local community. It seems totally inappropriate to consider it for closure, given the details that I have set out today and given what has been clearly set out in the branch access report.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1951" name="David Laws">the Member for Yeovil (Mr. Laws)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has a pressing issue in the case of Hinton St. George and he is absolutely right to make the case for the post office in that village. I know it well and I also know well some of the individuals who are fighting vigorously for its retention. Is it not most extraordinary that a post office that was not on the closure list was added to that list at a late stage simply because a single post office in Street, in a totally different part of the county, was reprieved because the Post Office had apparently not done its homework sufficiently well on the population in the area? I am sure that if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1916" name="David Heathcoat-Amory">the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory)</phrase> were here, he would say, &quot;But many other post offices in the Wells constituency have been closed.&quot; That has also been the case in Bridgwater, and I am sure that if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the hon. Member for Bridgwater (Mr. Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> were here, he would make that point. The idea that we have this tit-for-tat closure of a post office that until a few weeks ago was considered safe is sufficient to be of concern, and I want to give any support that I can to the villagers in Hinton St. George in trying to retain their post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/2">Overall, I have the most overwhelming sense of despair and anger at what is being done to the post office network in Somerset. Let me spell out what has happened in my constituency. We have lost seven post offices to outright closures and a further two are closures in all but name&mdash;they are to be replaced by so-called outreach facilities. I see no evidence in the whole so-called consultation process that a single word of what was said to the Post Office against the closure of those post offices was given proper consideration. I do not believe that the process could have gone as far as it did if the Post Office had taken into account the feelings of the community and of every elected representative for the area and the points that were raised, quite properly, in support of those post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/3">We are to lose the post office in Kingsdon. The villagers of Kingsdon were told that they had alternative facilities in Yeovilton, but there are two problems with those alternative facilities. First, the post office is on Royal Naval Air Station Yeovilton and therefore people have to get past two armed marines to access it. Secondly, Yeovilton is also on the list for closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/4">We have also seen the closure of the village post office in Holcombe, which is also the village store. The Post Office had failed to take into account the fact that there was a sheltered housing scheme almost directly opposite the post office, which was serving the needs of those elderly people. It failed to take account of the fact that the post office was also the place at which medicines were dropped off from the general practitioner dispensary at Coleford and that that facility would not longer be available to those who relied on it. None of that was taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/5">We have the closure of the post office in Bower Hinton. Bower Hinton is about a mile and a half from the centre of Martock, but it is a very hilly mile and a half. The post office serves a quite distinct community. Martock post office, which is a very good post office, is already overused, and there are always queues. The elderly people who were served by the shop and post office in Bower Hinton now have to trek a mile and a half down the road to use a post office where they will have to queue&mdash;there are always queues there&mdash;and that is considered progress in the service provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/6">We have the closure in Bayford. The situation in Bayford is unique. We had letters opposing the closure from not only Somerset, but Dorset, because it was recognised that the post office in Bayford served several Dorset communities, but of course Dorset was a different closure programme, so those communities were not formally consulted. Only the villages in Somerset were consulted, despite the fact that the post office was on the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/7">Keinton Mandeville, a very large village, will now be without its post office and is gradually seeing a reduction in the services available to it. We also have the closure of the post office in Sparkford, which I opened a few years ago. Post Office management attended, and they thought that it was a wonderful thing to open the post office there, but they now think that it is an equally wonderful thing to close it. How can we make any sense of such economic planning?</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/8">Two of the post offices that will be closed will be replaced by so-called outreach, although there is no clarity about how it is to be provided. It is not clear whether there will be a van, although the service apparently will not be provided through the shops in North Cadbury and Charlton Horethorne. I have asked repeatedly what will happen at the end of the three years, but the Post Office will not tell us. We all assume that three years is what we will get and that the post offices will then close&mdash;it is not a reprieve, but a delayed closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.0/9">The consultation was a sham. I would be interested to see the information that my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil asked for on the ranking of post offices; indeed, I would be interested simply to see the objections that were made, rather than the Post Office version of the accumulated objections. Let us see first hand what people had to say about their local post offices so that we can make a judgment about whether their views were taken into account. Will the Minister give me an assurance that the letters of objection and the plans that were submitted will be available? Do I have to make a freedom of information request to get them? Will my request be blocked for reasons of commercial confidentiality, even though this was supposed to be a public consultation?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.32.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" speakername="David Heath" colnum="32"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0005.htm#08062481000500">
	<p pid="a.32.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. His area is very different from mine, but that is a valid point. Let me corroborate what he says by mentioning a constituent of mine who was keen to ensure that his objections were taken into account. On the last day of the so-called consultation, he tried to send his letter by registered mail to ensure that it was delivered, but he was told that it was impossible to send registered mail to an address without a postcode. The post office would not, therefore, guarantee delivery of a letter of objection to the closure of a post office. That is an absurd way of doing business, and I hope that the Minister will respond to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/2">What has happened underlines the fact that the Post Office and the Government&mdash;the Government cannot hide behind the Post Office, because we all know that we are talking about Government policy&mdash;are turning their backs on our communities and failing to recognise the valuable role that our post offices play in them. For heaven's sake, we do not have much in our village communities any more. The pubs and schools are closing, and the churches are becoming redundant, so we are losing our community facilities. The post office is one of the last remaining facilities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil said, the shop is often dependent on the post office; we cannot have the shop without the post office and we cannot have the post office without the shop, so to lose one is to lose both. We therefore end up with dormitory communities in rural areas that have no services.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/3">The Government and the Post Office are turning their backs not only on our communities, but on environmental policy. What on earth is the point of forcing people to drive further? People will not be using public transport. My hon. Friend explained the paucity of public transport in some of our areas. In my village, there is one bus a week. What use is that in providing a service to anywhere else? We should be encouraging local facilities in villages to cut down on the amount of driving that people must do. Instead of local facilities for local people we have a policy that flies in the face of that and forces people into the hands of Mr. Asda, Mr. Sainsbury and Mr. Tesco in the nearest big town.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/4">Lastly, the Government and the Post Office are turning their back on the elderly. What is happening is a particular blow for the elderly population who often cannot get access to private motor cars. Often they are dependent on the village shop and post office for their needs. It seems that we simply do not care, as a society, about people who happen to be elderly, who are not very well off, and who live in the countryside. That seems to me to be a dereliction of duty on the Government's part.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/5">There is still one outstanding issue on the table&mdash;the award of the Post Office card account contract. I do not know why it is sitting in the Government's pending tray, but I have my suspicions. I do not know why they say that they will come to a decision in the summer, when the House is conveniently not sitting, and when there will be the minimum of publicity, but I have my suspicions. We have already heard from my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil about how the Post Office card account was forced through, and the Government gritted their teeth because they did not want anything to do with it; but it was embraced by many people who wanted to continue to use post offices for drawing their pensions and benefits in cash.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/6">Every obstacle was put in the way of people's use of the account. Now we are told that the Post Office network may not win the contract for Post Office card accounts. We hear from the National Federation of SubPostmasters that the consequence of that decision would be the closure of 3,000 more post offices, simply because of the loss of revenue. If I total up what we have lost already, and add to it the post offices under threat simply from natural wastage&mdash;the sort of thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Yeovil has already pointed out&mdash;and add another 3,000, I conclude that that is the total loss of the rural post office network. It is no good the Government boasting about all the money they say they are putting into the network, if the result is that it is closing. That is the reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.1/7">I want an assurance from the Minister&mdash;he will not give it but I want it&mdash;that the Post Office card account will not just be awarded to the Post Office network, but will be enhanced to provide better services for those who are not well off, and to fight actively against social and financial exclusion in a way it fails to do now. I know that that is not likely to happen, and that is what worries me. It reinforces my view that old people, poor people and people who live in the countryside do not count in new Labour Britain. That is profoundly worrying. If the Post Office card account is awarded to anyone other than the Post Office, it will be an act of economic and social vandalism of the highest order, and if the Government do that, they should be ashamed of themselves.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-24a.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" speakername="Alison Seabeck" colnum="67"  time="013:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080624/halltext/80624h0011.htm#08062481000522">
	<p pid="a.67.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her clarification. It is important to remember that temporary work can and does provide a route into employment for those who were previously excluded. It can also provide a route into employment for those returning to work after career breaks or those who were economically inactive. It can meet the needs of individuals who may wish to work on a temporary basis for short or long periods; and it can provide a stepping stone to permanent employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">As my hon. Friend has just said, the case that she highlighted is not the norm. Studies have demonstrated that temporary employment can encourage up to a third of women employed in seasonal or casual work to move on into permanent employment. Clearly, that is not how Sally Avis will view her experience. As I am sure my hon. Friend will appreciate, I cannot discuss individual cases. However, as a general principle, there is considerable flexibility in contractual arrangements, on both sides, between agency workers and the agency. If a worker is engaged through an agency, his or her assignment can be terminated at any time, subject to any notice provision in their contract with the agency. It is in the nature of agency work that it is flexible, for some of the reasons given by my hon. Friend, and that assignments can be ended, for example, when the hiring company experiences a downturn in demand. Flexibility works both ways. An agency worker can leave a job giving little or no notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">Agency workers are usually considered to be &quot;workers&quot; under the relevant legislation and are entitled to core employment rights, but not to claim unfair dismissal or statutory redundancy. The agreement on the EU directive, as reflected in the Warwick agreement, will not change the employment status of agency workers or affect their entitlement to existing rights, such as those regarding unfair dismissal, by the end user or hirer. I will certainly draw to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister the specific concerns so clearly voiced in the debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">A court will consider individual claims based on the facts of the case. Over many years, the body of case law has been consistently adapted and refined by interpretation in tribunals and higher courts. In relation to employment status, the courts have defined a number of tests which examine the individual's circumstances and consider all aspects of the relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5">As we set out in our March 2006 document, &quot;Success at Work: Protecting vulnerable workers, supporting good employers&quot;, we considered the current framework of employment rights, including for agency workers, to see if it was appropriate and fair and supported the aim of high participation in work. That followed a consultation in 2002 on the differing rights and responsibilities in employment law of employees and workers, such as those employed through employment businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/6">We found that temporary work, such as agency work, is greatly valued by employers and many individuals. We were given examples of abuses and of the lack of knowledge about existing rights, and that is quite important in this process. However, there was a lack of evidence suggesting that the only appropriate remedy was wholesale change to the current system. Having reviewed all the evidence, we concluded that the present framework reflects the wide diversity of working arrangements and the different responsibilities and rights in different employment relationships. We believe that it meets the labour market's current needs and that there is no immediate need for further legislation on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/7">Nevertheless, we are keen to help people better understand the current framework, the rights to which they are entitled&mdash;whether they are an employee, a worker or self-employed&mdash;and how to enforce those rights. We will improve guidance through the new employee pages on the Directgov website, and work is progressing on developing an associated interactive tool. For those who do not understand what an associated interactive tool is, it is simply a good online guide, with a question-and-answer system built in, which gives people a much clearer idea of their legal position to ensure that they are not wrongly deprived of their rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/8">Agency workers are protected by a combination of general legislation that gives them core rights and specific legislation that governs the conduct of their agencies. Those protections include the right to be paid at least the national minimum wage; entitlements under the working time directive, including paid annual leave and regular rest breaks; social security provisions, such as maternity and paternity pay; and coverage by anti-discrimination laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/9">I want to focus on some of the current initiatives to improve protections for agency workers. The Conduct of Employment Agencies and Employment Businesses Regulations 2003 provide essential protection for agency workers and all those using the services provided by employment agencies. Amendments to the regulations came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-06">6 April 2008</phrase> giving workers the right to withdraw from services provided by an agency, such as accommodation and transport, without suffering any detriment. That is quite an important change. In addition, the current Employment Bill includes measures to increase penalties for offences under the Employment Agencies Act 1973 and improve the investigative powers of the employment agency standards inspectorate&mdash;the EAS.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/10">Those additional rights will be backed by additional resources for enforcement. We will double the number of EAS inspectors from 12 to 24. EAS inspectors have a good record and investigated more than 1,600 agencies in 2006-07. The EAS follows up every relevant complaint that indicates a possible breach of the legislation and carries out targeted inspections on the basis of risk. In 2006-07, more than 1,300 complaints were investigated and more than 300 targeted inspections were carried out, resulting in 558 corrective letters being sent to agencies. Following such action, five individuals were prohibited from being involved in running an agency on the ground of unsuitability due to previous misconduct.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/11">The Government are determined to ensure that the enforcement regime is effective in dealing proportionately with rogue employers who are determined to flout the law&mdash;an issue forcefully raised by the Unite campaign. We must understand the nature and extent of the abuse of vulnerable workers and get behind the anecdotes to look at the hard facts. To do that, we established the vulnerable worker enforcement forum last year. The forum is chaired by the Minister for Employment Relations and Postal Affairs and brings together the TUC, the GMB, the Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians, Unite and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, as well as enforcement agencies, business groups&mdash;including a representative from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation&mdash;and Citizens Advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/12">The forum is considering evidence on the nature and extent of the abuse of workers' rights and other employment legislation, including evidence from the TUC's commission on vulnerable employment, and we are considering that evidence extremely seriously as part of the vulnerable worker pilot schemes. The forum is also looking at the effectiveness of the enforcement regime. It is an important focal point in terms of getting at some of the real issues that vulnerable workers face. At the moment, evidence is often anecdotal, because people, because people are frightened to come forward and give evidence. Hopefully, the group will get beneath that. It is already proving valuable in identifying issues with the reporting of abuse and a need for closer working among enforcement bodies, and highlighting the resources needed to ensure effective implementation of the laws passed by the House. In the forum's report, we will announce further measures to ensure that agency workers are better aware of their rights and that those rights are more effectively enforced.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/13">I have listened carefully to the concerns raised by my hon. Friend. She asked a series of questions that I will ensure are passed on to my colleague the Minister. She asked about redundancy pay and whether we should be making changes to it. Further consultation will be held on that issue. I hope that that partly answers that concern.</p>
