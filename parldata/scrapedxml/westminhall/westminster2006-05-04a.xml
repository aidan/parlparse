<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-04a.517.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" speakername="Alun Michael" speakeroffice="The Minister for Industry and the Regions"  colnum="517"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060504/halltext/60504h01.htm#60504h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.517.3/1">May I confess at the start that I am slightly disappointed, Mr. Bercow? This is the first time that I have sat under your chairmanship, and I sincerely trust that it will not be a humbling experience. However, it also means that I will not be able to enjoy your usual vigorous interventions, and I am tempted to say that putting you in the Chair is probably the only way to keep you in order. None the less, a poacher turned gamekeeper can demonstrate characteristics that have not previously been seen, and I am sure that you will be strict. Sincerely, though, I am pleased to speak under your chairmanship for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/2">Enterprise is a term that covers the formation of new businesses and the expansion of existing businesses, and being seen as enterprising is of great importance if an area is to attract businesses. To take a personal perspective, the issue is important to me because I entered Parliament as a result of the frustration that I felt working with unemployed young people in parts of Cardiff, including parts that are now in my constituency. Those young people had no hope, no future, no inspiration and, therefore, no enterprise, but that situation has been transformed over recent years as a result of the strength of the economy and initiatives such as the new deal. Such initiatives have given young people opportunities and encouragement as a result of a genuine partnership between the Government and business. That underlines the fact that many of society's problems cannot be adequately dealt with without successful businesses, a strong economy or enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/3">In essence, enterprise is about having a can-do attitude to life, whether people are motivated by the wish to run a business, to be the best at something or to change the world around them for the better. Many successful business people are inspired by all three of those factors, as well as by the motivation of making money, and there are also enterprising people in the public sector and the third sector. There is evidence that we can inspire young people to be entrepreneurial&mdash;to have that can-do attitude&mdash;and encourage business growth if we create the right environment, and that is certainly the Government's aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/4">The UK has great enterprise potential, and a recent World Bank study, for instance, places us in the top 10 of the world's top 30 economies in terms of business-friendly regulation, but that does not mean that we should rest on our laurels. We are committed to one of the world's most ambitious programmes of reducing the burden of regulation on business, and steps to do so are well in hand. We are simplifying our regulatory approach and our enforcement structure, we are reducing the number of enforcement bodies from 31 to seven and we are consulting on new measures to ensure that enforcement and penalties strike the right balance. Such issues rightly come up every time I meet representatives from different sectors of industry and business, and they agree with our engagement, but always encourage us to go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/5">The other side of the equation is also extremely important. Government procurement is enormously important in encouraging business, which is why we are working to simplify the way in which businesses can get into the business of supplying the Government. The Supply2.gov portal provides an opportunity to reduce the duplication that is such a burden on small businesses and increase opportunities for them to be part of public sector procurement. Sometimes, the problem is that everything is too complicated, and sometimes things have genuinely been too burdensome, but sometimes the problems are a matter of perception. By providing a simpler methodology and making use of the internet and web-based opportunities, we can genuinely open up the possibilities for small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/6">That is crucial because small businesses represent 99 per cent. of all businesses in the UK and are the backbone of the UK economy. At the beginning of 2004, there were 4.3 million small and medium-sized enterprises, and the majority were small, with fewer than 50 employees. That was up from 4 million in the same period in 2003, so there has been an increase in the number of small businesses, and that in itself reflects a growth in enterprise.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/7">As I said in respect of regulation, we need to strike the right balance. Balance offers opportunities. Women comprise 51 per cent. of the UK population and 46 per cent. of those who are active in the labour market. Nearly 1 million women are self-employed, but only 27 per cent. of all self-employed people are women. The Government recognise that the pace of development needs to accelerate if we are to tap the massive economic potential represented by the development of women's enterprise. Indeed, at Department of Trade and Industry questions earlier today, one of my Back-Bench colleagues made a comparison with the USA, and my hon. Friend the Minister for Women and Equality said that we would have about half a million extra businesses in the UK if we had the same level of entrepreneurship and start-ups among women as the United States of America. However, she also said that things have improved, as not so long ago the figure would have been 750,000 extra businesses, so there has been progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/8">Given that we have been missing out on many women's potential contribution to the economy, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry approved the setting up of the taskforce on women's enterprise. It is to be operational in June and its objective is to provide high-profile leadership to accelerate women's enterprise development and promote confidence and a can-do attitude among the many women who have the talents and ability to contribute to the economy. The taskforce will be light on process and heavy on delivery to achieve the greatest impact in the shortest time.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/9">Throughout the UK, more than 250,000 black and ethnic minority enterprises contribute &pound;13 billion a year to the British economy, and many of them are high-quality and growing businesses. Despite so much entrepreneurial activity, however, a great many people are still disadvantaged because of their ethnicity or gender or because they live in deprived neighbourhoods, and they need our help. To use a business term, we need to segment our approach to ethnic minority communities, because some have a background in business and more ready family experience of it than others. We need to develop an inclusive approach to encourage those who do not have such a family or community background to go into business.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/10">In December 2004, the Chancellor asked the National Employment Panel what could be done to increase the employment and business growth of ethnic minority and faith groups. The panel, working with the DTI's Ethnic Minority Business Forum, made 10 recommendations at the conclusion of its work. The Chancellor accepted them, and a cross-Whitehall working group is taking them forward as part of a larger taskforce, which is looking at ethnic minority employment issues in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/11">A key barrier for black and ethnic minority entrepreneurs is access to finance. That is why the DTI's Small Business Service is undertaking an ethnic minority booster survey as part of the in-depth Bank of England-led Big Survey, which will compare results from five key ethnic minority groups with the experience of white-owned businesses. The evidence from the booster survey will help us to understand the implications of ethnicity, and perhaps some of its diversity, for raising finance and it will inform future action on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/12">The Small Business Service is committed to working with banks and financial institutions to break down barriers and increase the availability of start-up finance, loans and risk capital. From <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase>, regional development agencies became responsible for community development finance initiatives. Incidentally, they also became responsible for the local delivery of Business Link in their regions, which is a welcome step forward. We want the Business Link brand to be provided consistently in every part of the country, and a regional emphasis on performance can drive that agenda forward. However, on the community development finance initiatives, I am pleased that there are signs that the financial needs of the Muslim community are being recognised by the private sector. The Islamic Bank of Britain has been created and at least one international bank is now advertising sharia-compliant financial products.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/13">I want to include a word about social enterprise. People start a business for many different reasons, as I mentioned earlier. Some are inspired to use a business model to solve what they see as a social or environmental problem. They want to do good as much as they want to make money, and feel that they can do that better by independently generating the finance to run a genuine business than by depending on charitable means or public subscriptions.</p>
	<p pid="a.517.3/14">The Government have a strategy to support and raise awareness of the strength and contribution of social enterprises. Department of Trade and Industry research on social enterprise last year revealed that there are at least 15,000 social enterprises in the UK employing more than 450,000 people and contributing more than &pound;5 billion a year to gross domestic product. It is difficult to be totally sure about the figures, because there is not one model for social enterprise. Some enterprises will be registered as companies, some will be partnerships, and some will be owned almost individually or by associations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-04a.527.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="527"  time="014:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060504/halltext/60504h01.htm#60504h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.527.1/1">Probably when I am trying to persuade my wife that I have done all the things that I was meant to do. I suspect that I will have to pay a fee for the patent on that remark, given that it is the Minister's.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/2">So the taskforce will be light on process, heavy on delivery. To that end, when can we expect tangible changes that women entrepreneurs will see in the marketplace?</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/3">Success at increasing ethnic minority entrepreneurship has also been limited. Again, the Minister touched on that, but glided over it rather professionally. Although the total number of people from ethnic minorities who are self-employed has increased, the population of ethnic minorities has increased at a higher rate, so the proportion of our ethnic minority communities who are self-employed has again fallen. That is a concern. Will the Minister give us his thoughts on why the policies are not succeeding?</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/4">The Minister talked about perception, which is crucial. Getting more people to consider working for themselves is a challenge, particularly if the perception of business, entrepreneurship and capitalism is negative. It is fair to say that until recently the broadcast media was either indifferent or rather cynical about the business world. Few programmes dealt with the question of business, and almost none tried to understand what makes business people tick. I vaguely recall&mdash;perhaps you can assist me with the title, Mr. Bercow&mdash;that Sir John Harvey-Jones used to do a rather good programme about this in the '80s, but there has been little else since. That is why programmes such as &quot;Dragons' Den&quot; on BBC 2 have been immensely helpful. I understand that nearly 3 million people watch that programme, which is about entrepreneurship. It is quite cut and thrust, but it demonstrates&mdash;along with &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, &quot;Make Me a Million&quot; and other such programmes, which I am obviously far too busy to watch, but try to see when I can&mdash;that there is an appetite to learn more about how business works. It also demonstrates that anyone&mdash;I stress anyone&mdash;can become their own boss.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/5">Countering that positive step is the anti-enterprise language that we hear from too many journalists and some politicians. Those who break the law in business must be brought to book, but some politicians and, sadly, senior Ministers, are far too quick to use terms such as &quot;fat cats&quot; to bash business. Bashing business might produce popular headlines, but it undermines the goal of promoting enterprise. I hope that the Minister will, if the Chancellor is again tempted to make negative remarks, immediately correct him on them. I look forward to that moment perhaps less than he does.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/6">Being positive about business is important, particularly if we are to foster more social enterprises. The Minister and I had a small exchange on that subject. As he pointed out, a social enterprise is a business with primarily social objectives. There are over 15,000 such businesses in the UK, which, I have written in my notes, generate approximately &pound;18 billion per annum. Having checked this with the Minister earlier, I will say simply that they deliver many billions of pounds per annum to the economy and employ nearly half a million people.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/7">The Government have made some hopeful and positive steps in fostering more social enterprises. My party and I share that ambition wholeheartedly. We need to encourage more bold resourcefulness&mdash;to use the definition of enterprise&mdash;in creating opportunities for the young and employed, protecting our environment and renewing our communities. For example, Jamie Oliver has, with his London restaurant, Fifteen, seen 37 graduates, many of whom come from disadvantaged or broken homes, through the process of becoming chefs. That is to be applauded. As a Cornishman, I am delighted that he is taking that idea to Watergate bay in Cornwall, where he hopes to repeat the process. I add my support to that welcome idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/8">We must actively encourage the work of people such as Jamie Oliver and of familiar social enterprises such as Caf&eacute;direct and <i>The Big Issue</i>, which is, I suppose, a pioneer in this field. I believe that the Government intend to publish an update to their social enterprise policy on <phrase class="date" code="">18 May</phrase>. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that. If it is the case, we very much wish to engage positively with the Government in that area. If we can do so in a way that will help to encourage more social enterprises, I would very much welcome the opportunity to have whatever discussions the right hon. Gentleman thinks appropriate to find areas of bipartisanship that will enable us to push forward that worthy process.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/9">One sector that makes a significant contribution to the economy but is often overlooked is that people who run their own businesses or provide services from home. That is different from home working, which involves people working for employers. According to Microsoft, about 8 million people run their own businesses from home. Approximately 2,000 people each week start a new business from home. When one looks at the demographics, one finds that those are the very people whom the Government wish to encourage. They are often parents, older people and women, who find it particularly helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/10">The advantages of home-based businesses are significant and various. Being based at home allows owners to work flexibly, which means that they can much more effectively juggle their many other family commitments such as bringing up young children or caring for elderly relatives. That type of working brings wider benefits to society. People working from home are more likely to spend their money in their local communities, and less likely to commute, thus reducing congestion and CO <sub>2</sub> emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/11">Such working also has an impact on neighbourhood safety. I used to have a home-based business and worked at home, travelling for my clients when I needed to, as technology allowed me to work in that way. That meant that along my road, there was always someone around in the day, as I was one of about three such people in a street of 20 homes. I know from talking to my local police that burglaries happen pre-eminently during the working day. People working from home make it far more difficult for burglars to break into homes with impunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/12">Another benefit to having a home-based enterprise is improved quality of life. In this House, we talk a great deal about the work-life balance, and rightly so. What better solution for many people than to be able to work from home? That is a rarely recognised, hidden benefit. For all those reasons, and as technology develops, it is interesting that the home is now the preferred location from which to start a small business. That is often not recognised in this place or the economy as a whole, but it is time that the Government recognised it, and acted to ensure that home-based businesses are encouraged and supported. Regulatory barriers need to be reduced, and the benefits to individuals and communities that I have mentioned should be recognised and promoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/13">Sadly, the Treasury has, in recent years, been the enemy of the home-based business. Measures such as IR35 make it far harder for people to be self-employed. I hope that the Minister will have the courage to recognise the real worth of home-based enterprises and the self-employed, and positively champion their needs to the Treasury and the Chancellor. I have decided to make some progress on this, and will meet representatives of home-based businesses such as the Professional Contractors Group and Shout99, and organisations such as Enterprise Nation, to make sure that the Conservatives fully understand the contribution of that sector. We intend to identify how a future Conservative Government could help.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/14">Let me turn to the role of another group in the community. Local enterprise supports communities in many ways, but that support is best illustrated by the retail sector, particularly small, independent shops. Whether in rural, suburban or, for that matter, urban communities, small shops are often the focal point. They can provide much more than just services. I tend to think of my constituency, where in many communities, whether they be small towns or villages, small shops provide the personal contact that is missing elsewhere. The owner will often know the customer, their family background and their trials and tribulations, and will be able to engage with them. They are therefore able to provide the personal touch that communities, frankly, need more than ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/15">The Government have a duty to consider how their actions affect small independent shops. About six weeks or so ago, I called on the Minister's colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)</phrase>, to try to lead a debate on the future of small shops. Sadly, nothing has happened to date. Many independent businesses are getting frustrated and they feel that they are running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/16">I have tried to take the lead, organising a summit of the industry's representative bodies to discuss the challenges that face independent retailers. There are many issues. We can consider Sunday trading, supermarkets, local parking schemes, planning and the fact that business crime is not included in police force statistics; they all impinge on small shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/17">I was encouraged by the positive wish across the political spectrum to see a set of sensible and balanced policies that encourage consumers to recognise the value of their shops, and encourage small shops to be able to compete better, whether by removing the barriers that Government create locally and nationally or by trying to ensure that large players do not abuse their position. That is why I have made it clear that my party and I strongly support a full and comprehensive investigation by the Competition Commission to ensure that we resolve once and for all whether allegations made against the large players in the grocery market, the supermarkets, are correct and, if they are, that they are acted on.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/18">I do not know whether those allegations are correct, but I do know that a restricted inquiry, which considers planning or land banks but not the broader questions of the supply chain, late payments and so on, will satisfy no one. It will not be in the interests of consumers or of shops, large or small. Those are all reasons why the issue needs to move forward, and I hope that the Minister will take back to his colleagues in the Department a genuine wish to seek out the steps that we can take to help small shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/19">In recent weeks, following on from that summit, I have tried to do a number of other things. I have been actively involved in supporting the <i>Evening Standard</i>'s excellent &quot;Save our Small Shops&quot; campaign. My party and I have endorsed the Friends of the Earth &quot;Shop Local First&quot; campaign. Those campaigns are simply about encouraging people to recognise the value of those shops and to realise that unless they use them, they will lose them.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/20">Enterprise has many roles in society. First and foremost, it generates the wealth that pays for the services on which the rest of us rely, but its values run deeper. Entrepreneurs epitomise one of the reasons why I came into politics and why I am a member of the Conservative party. No matter who someone is, whatever their background, colour, creed, race or gender, if they have the ability, ambition and will to work they can be their own boss and can make their own living in the world. That value applies to all forms of enterprise, whether they are home-based, local shops, the self-employed, large and small enterprises, or social enterprises. Fostering and nurturing that sense of aspiration and enterprise should be the role of Government, not stifling entrepreneurship through undue regulation and an unhealthy aversion to risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.527.1/21">Making this country the best place in which to set up and run one's own business has so far eluded the Government. I hope that they will recognise their mistakes and change course. If they are prepared to do so, the Conservatives will be the first to commend them.</p>

	<p pid="a.531.1/1">I hope that that will go on from here, so that there is a definite one-in, one-out approach. If that is the case, I am certain that both Liberal Democrat and Conservative Members will support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/2">We would also like to see the Government take on board the recommendations from the Prime Minister's Better Regulation Task Force report and implement them fully.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/3">One issue, which the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford raised earlier, is that, although we recognise that the Government are making an attempt to tackle over-regulation with the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill, it goes too far. Some Members have nicknamed it the Abolition of Parliament Bill, which is not inappropriate. In practice, it would move powers to amend legislation in almost any area from Parliament to Ministers. Although everyone agrees with the aims of the exercise, as was shown by the fact that the Bill was passed on Second Reading with no opposition, the Government's proposals have been disproportionate. It would be a shame if the valid intention of deregulation was derailed by the Government's trying to take too much power away from Parliament. I hope that when the Bill returns to the Floor of the House, it is returned to its original intentions and does not overstep the mark so much.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/4">The grocery battle is exercising many people at the moment, as has already been mentioned. I have received letters from a number of keepers of small shops&mdash;as I am sure all hon. Members have&mdash;including one from the managers of every single Spar store in my constituency, which raises their concerns about the possible increase in Sunday trading hours for supermarkets. They are worried about the impact that that will have on their businesses and their ability to stay afloat.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/5">The power of the supermarkets is having a huge impact not only on other retailers but on small businesses across the country that produce and process food, such as businesses in the agriculture sector, abattoirs, small-scale processors and so on. That is a worrying development. I would like to see a better balance between small and large businesses. It is not in the interest of our communities to allow small retailers, processors and producers to be squeezed out by much larger businesses&mdash;the balance between the two needs to be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/6">As has already been mentioned, smaller retailers, such as Spar and other convenience stores, play a crucial role in our communities that should not be underestimated. My constituency is a mix of inner-city urban areas and suburban ones, and for those with mobility problems and the elderly, such shops are much easier to get to than out-of-town superstores. They are a very important part of those people's lives. In rural areas, such as the one where my parents live, there are large supermarkets, but they may be an extremely long way away from where people live. Local shops and convenience stores are the heart of the local community, and if they are put out of business, that could have a devastating impact. Because of their economic role, the important social function that they fulfil must be protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/7">We would like the Government to introduce more proactive measures to tackle the current situation. Deregulation and lifting the burden of paperwork would be a good start, but as the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford said, we would like the Competition Commission to investigate all the issues fully. We would like more and better use to be made of the existing set-up at the Office of Fair Trading, which could consider the issues proactively.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/8">In the long-run, the Lib Dems would like an independent ombudsman to be created, to take up complaints confidentially and hold inquiries into market fixing, supermarket supply chains and so on, so that smaller producers and retailers do not have to put their neck on the block. There is a lot of evidence that the businesses of people who complain publicly end up having major problems afterwards. Therefore, we would like there to be a confidential route by which people can complain so that investigations can be carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/9">Please do not take my words as being anti-big business. Big businesses play a crucial, although different, role in our societies. Without the jobs, investment, services and products that they provide, our economy would grind to a halt. Large businesses ensure that we have a vibrant and flourishing economy and the Government need to work through all Departments to ensure that those businesses have the well-educated and healthy work force that they need to keep operating.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/10">I represent an inner-city seat and there are a large number of big enterprises in my constituency. They contribute a massive amount to the life of the city, in terms of jobs and financial impact, but also by their charitable and social involvement. Several of them involve their work force in local projects: they work with local charities and make many financial donations to local organisations. There are some very interesting examples of work in local schools. For example, bank employees will spend an hour during their lunch break once a week to help children learn to read in schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/11">A big impact can be made by employers who are open-minded and take on board their wider social responsibilities by getting involved in the local community. That is definitely to be encouraged. That is one of the reasons why the Lib Dems were so supportive of the requirement for an operating and financial review of listed companies, which we felt was an example of good regulation. As hon. Members will know, most listed companies already produce this information informally&mdash;a lot of companies provide it as part of their commitment to corporate social responsibility&mdash;and the proposals were widely welcomed at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.531.1/12">OFRs are a good way to ensure that businesses consider and account for the social, ethical, community and environmental impact of their operations. In an increasingly global economy, it is a question not just of the impact that businesses have in the UK but of their broader impact wherever they operate in the world. We support the reduction of the regulatory burden on business, but that should not be done by chucking out good regulation before it is introduced. It should be done by getting rid of over-regulation and bad regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.534.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr. Prisk)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1480" name="Jennifer Willott">my neighbour, the hon. Member for Cardiff, Central (Jenny Willott)</phrase>, for their constructive contributions to the discussion. Some of the things that they said were challenging to the Government, which is entirely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/2">I entirely agree with the point about the role of Government with which the hon. Lady concluded her remarks. Our role is to work with business and nurture enterprise, rather than to take a top-down domineering approach in which we assume that we can do everything ourselves. It is clear that we need to create the right environment. As the hon. Gentleman said, we have the ambition to make this country the best place to do business, and we have made considerable progress with that aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/3">Both hon. Members referred to regulation. I recognise that reducing regulation and cutting down the strands of OFR are difficult challenges for the Government. In terms of regulation, one must consider the instinct not only of the Government but of Parliament. Whenever a problem appears, the instinct of Members from all parties is to demand that Parliament deal with the issue. We need to be careful of that. I am fond of quoting Gibbon's remark in &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Laws cannot always prevent what they forbid.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/5">My philosophy and that of the Government is to consider where we can work with business to find the right response to a problem, and to ask ourselves whether it needs legislation, a new organisation, a new requirement, or whether there are more intelligent ways of dealing with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/6">I can point to a couple of examples from my own experience. The Gangmasters (Licensing) Act 2004 was a response to what all parties agreed was a human tragedy. The practice had existed in many rural communities for many years, but it was brought to public prominence and attention by the events in Morecambe bay. The legislation was designed in conjunction with all sides of industry, and industry representatives now sit on the agency that was created to implement the 2004 Act. It is a good example of co-operative legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/7">Another stunning example concerns something that all Members abhor: internet child pornography&mdash;or child abuse, because behind every example of child pornography is an example of actual abuse. It has been acknowledged that we have achieved more in a year or so without legislation than we could have achieved in five years with legislation. The reason is that people in industry, who for a long time said, &quot;It's impossible to regulate this issue effectively,&quot; sat down with the Government, child protection agencies, children's charities, the police to find a way of cutting off access to the more horrific sites. I underline the engagement of business in that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.534.1/8">There are plenty of other examples, but Members from all parties must acknowledge that the temptation is always to add to the burden of regulation as soon as something goes wrong. It may be that a small percentage of business is engaged in an activity that causes problems. Our question is, can we deal with, let us say, the 10 per cent. of people who are doing the wrong thing, without creating a bureaucracy that imposes on others? The challenge to all of us as parliamentarians is to bear that in mind, as well as to tackle the mischief that our constituents bring to our attention.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-04a.535.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-04b.535.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-04a.535.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="535"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060504/halltext/60504h01.htm#60504h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.535.1/1">The hon. Gentleman seeks to place all responsibility on the Government. Often, the pressure comes from parliamentarians and, behind them, constituents to deal with a particular mischief. I invite him to consider the number of calls for legislation that Members of Parliament make, and the number of early-day motions that call for legislative action. They are far in excess of the amount of regulation and legislation that we have introduced. I do not say that in a partisan way. It is almost human nature, and it is the nature of the environment that has developed in Parliament over many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/2">Both hon. Members are right to challenge the Government about their performance in reducing regulation, but all parliamentarians have a collective responsibility to create a different, more engaged environment in which we consider the best ways of dealing with the mischief without providing the burden. That more holistic approach should commend itself to us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/3">In my opening speech I said that the UK has great enterprise potential, but I acknowledged that all is not yet well. In spite of our potential, entrepreneurial activity in the UK remains lower than in some of our G7 competitors, and we have almost 50 per cent. less entrepreneurial activity as a proportion of the population than the United States. I referred to the statistics for women's enterprise. There is a significant challenge in closing that enterprise gap between ourselves and our competitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/4">The Government can find figures that point to the good things, and the Opposition can find those that point to the bad things or the failures in what we set out to do. So rather than bandy about figures, we should work together to try to improve performance and target the right improvements. That has been the atmosphere of today's debate: it has had quality, if not quantity. It is in all our interests that the economy succeed and entrepreneurship grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/5">On the positive side, the UK economy is strong. Employment has increased by more than 2.3 million since 1997. Inflation is low and stable, and interest rates remain low by historical standards. In the period since 1997, GDP growth in the UK has been more stable than in any other G7 country. By contrast, between 1979 and 1996, growth in the UK was the most volatile in the G7, with the exception of Canada. We must work together to ensure that we make the most of the stable situation, and ensure that it continues for the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/6">Comparisons are sometimes made between ourselves and our European colleagues&mdash;or friends, neighbours or competitors, depending on which relationship one favours most&mdash;and it is sometimes suggested that we do not perform to the best of our ability. However, unemployment is below the EU average and redundancies are at an all-time low. The employment rate in France is 63.1 per cent. on 2004 figures, compared with almost 75 per cent. in the UK. The unemployment rate in France is 9.3 per cent. compared with 5.1 per cent. in the UK. While we consider the plusses and minuses, of which there are always some in any comparison, we should bear in mind that overarching strategic position.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-04a.536.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="536"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060504/halltext/60504h01.htm#60504h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.536.1/1">The hon. Gentleman might have the generosity to acknowledge that the comparison I made about enterprise activity generally and about women's activity was with the United States of America, because I said that we ought to aspire to reach those levels. In relation to China, India, Korea and a variety of other countries, I have said on several occasions that our ambition must be not to worry or to treat them as people who will undermine our economy because they operate at a low pay level and can therefore undercut us, but to compete on the basis of quality. We should recognise that China and India aspire to compete with us on research and development&mdash;high output activity&mdash;and that should not be seen as a threat. China, with its fourfold growth over 20 years, presents us with an enormous opportunity as well as a challenge. I hope that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that the Government's level of aspiration is almost boundless, and certainly as high as he would wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/2">I turn now to manufacturing. It is sometimes said that it has slid down the order of priorities in this country, but it certainly has not as far as the Government are concerned. It is true that manufacturing has been declining as a percentage of gross domestic product, but it still accounts for one sixth of our national output. It produces more than half of our exports and employs more than 3 million people&mdash;that is far from insignificant. Because manufacturing has such an important role in the UK economy, it is important that the Government's manufacturing strategy is monitored and driven forward effectively&mdash;those activities will benefit from the interest and engagement of Opposition Members&mdash;and that is why we formed the manufacturing forum in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/3">The forum predates my current role as the Minister for Industry and the Regions, but, frankly, I have found my engagement with it exciting. It is jointly chaired by Kevin Smith, the chief executive of GKN, and me, and it brings together representatives from industry, the trade unions, academia, regional development agencies and organisations such as the Engineering Employers Federation and the CBI.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/4">In its first year, the forum focused on three priority areas: skills, image and public procurement. It has stimulated new actions, including the development of a national manufacturing skills academy, which will be of enormous importance across a range of manufacturing industries in the future, and the proposal for a manufacturing media centre, which will ensure that accurate information is provided about what is being done by manufacturing businesses. The forum is about to establish a working group to look at barriers to investment, which is also an important issue for manufacturing companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/5">On the stimulation of enterprise, this year I asked Enterprise Insight to develop a significant manufacturing element in the &quot;make your mark&quot; campaign. There will be a manufacturing day during enterprise week, and the forum will support this important opportunity effectively to engage young people in modern manufacturing. I have had very positive responses from large businesses such as European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company and from the CBI. The current approach is to find existing initiatives that work with schools and industries throughout the year so that Enterprise Insight can support, expand and showcase them.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/6">However, the enterprise gap between us and our competitors is not our only concern. There are significant differences in the rates of enterprise across and within our own regions, and that is also something that we must tackle. Based on my experience in both regeneration and enterprise development at a local level, I strongly believe that the two are closely related. We cannot have social regeneration without economic development, and we cannot have economic development without social regeneration that involves the community and its aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/7">Therefore, to promote enterprise and jobs in deprived areas, we launched the local enterprise growth initiative, which is jointly supported by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasury. My hon. Friends the Minister for Local Government and the Financial Secretary share my vision that enterprise can be used as a tool to tackle deprivation, as well as being worth while in itself, and the objectives of wealth creation that the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford rightly underlined in his remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/8">The local enterprise growth initiative, or LEGI, as it is becoming known&mdash;I do not do acronyms, but I suspect that that one will stick&mdash;will be worth &pound;50 million in 2006&ndash;07. It has the principal aim of releasing the economic and productivity potential of our most deprived local areas through enterprise and investment. The funds will be channelled through the economic development and enterprise block in local area agreements and will be linked with the work of local authorities and their partners. The programme provides an opportunity for complementary funding for successful bids that reach across to other policy areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/9">The emphasis in developing LEGI has been on quality. We ran a process that engaged private sector partners to choose those bids that appeared to have a real prospect of making transformational change and of stimulating enterprise. The best of the bids were excellent and will make a real difference in some of the lowest performing local economies in the country, but we want to go a step further. We want the money to make a real difference by showing how to achieve real change. If the team in an area that has low enterprise activity failed to produce a high-quality bid, it could be evidence of a double whammy of low economic activity and low-quality strategic thinking or leadership, which could trap a community at the bottom of the pile. Therefore, we will put even more effort into challenging and helping some unsuccessful local teams to lift their game in the next round of LEGI bids, and we will do that with a great sense of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/10">The Government are serious about real change being effected in the most deprived areas, and about the part that enterprise can play in that. LEGI has the potential to be a vital element in regeneration and increasing business activity, but we want to avoid duplication and to pursue simplification&mdash;or de-proliferation, as the hon. Gentleman rightly termed it earlier. There are too many strands of business support duplicating each other's work, so we do not want LEGI to make matters worse. There must be one front door on which people knock to get help in starting or growing a business. Business Link, with the support of the regional development agency, must be at the heart of local initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.536.1/11">The importance of enterprise should not be underestimated. Whether it is formation of new businesses, the expansion of existing ones or attracting businesses to an area, enterprise is a key driver of the economy. I referred to the fact that small and medium-sized enterprises employ more than 50 per cent. of our private sector work force. They account for more than &pound;1 trillion of private sector turnover each year. But of course it is the potential for growth of those businesses, as well as replication, that is essential for long-term success.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-04a.539.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1482" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="539"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060504/halltext/60504h01.htm#60504h01_spnew22">
	<p pid="a.539.1/1">No, we are planning a three-year programme of funding&mdash;there will be continuity in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/2">LEGI is also an opportunity for regional development agencies and local government to focus on the areas that perform least well in enterprise activity to see how they can be lifted. The lessons that come out of LEGI will be significant for local authorities' civic leadership in the economy and for regional development as well as for business partners. As with the work on encouraging enterprise activity and ambition among young people, there will be lessons learned that we will expect to roll out much more widely as time goes on.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/3">Both hon. Members made specific comments that were quite significant. The hon. Gentleman underlined the importance of enterprise in generating wealth, and I agree with him entirely. Indeed, my first point was that without economic prosperity and creation of wealth, there will not be jobs, and without jobs there will not be local prosperity. There is no difference between us on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/4">The hon. Gentleman also said that many company directors believe that it is harder to run a business. I suspect that that is true. It is a tough climate for business, and that is caused not just by Government regulation but by the amount of competition faced by businesses of all sizes. We are going through a period of intense change and major global competition, to which he referred. I believe that the Government have done more than he acknowledged to strip away regulation and relieve regulatory burdens. We have exempted nearly 900,000 companies from audit requirements on their accounts by raising the annual turnover threshold from &pound;1 million to &pound;5.6 million. That saves companies at least &pound;94 million a year. We have provided the highest VAT threshold in Europe: from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April 2006</phrase>, firms with a turnover of &pound;61,000 or less do not have to register for or pay VAT. We have reduced payroll burdens for 1.2 million businesses, and there has been &pound;300 million-worth of savings for businesses through reforms to tax administration in the 2005 pre-Budget report.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/5">Efforts are being made to speed up the planning system. The introduction of financial incentives for SMEs to file payroll returns online has benefits for the Government and businesses. A new, simplified self-assessment return for those whose affairs are simple&mdash;for example, self-employed people with a turnover of less than &pound;15,000 as well as employees and pensioners&mdash;is being developed. Forty pieces of out-of-date excise duty legislation were withdrawn or simplified on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-01">1 March 2006</phrase>. It is important to provide clearer information for businesses on regulatory changes and we have set up the <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">www.businesslink.gov.uk</a> website to help SMEs to find out how regulations apply to them and to engage with businesses and, through that, to link with the Supply2.gov.uk portal to simplify the opportunities for SMEs.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/6">I am not suggesting that everything in the garden is wonderful. There is a lot of work to do and both hon. Members referred to some of the things that we need to do, but I hope that it is clear from that list that significant developments have continued to remove burdens on small businesses. We will certainly continue to work on non-proliferation and I am glad that we shall have the support of the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford when trying to deal with the many strands of support that have been built up by successive Governments. I know from my experience at DEFRA that it is not easy to tackle those issues, but it is worth trying.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/7">The hon. Gentleman asked which current schemes are under-performing and which should be scrapped, but he missed out those that should be combined. In some cases it would be possible to combine a number of different strands in a broader strand so that people can receive a more flexible response. In the longer term, there will be enlightenment on some of the issues that he raised as a result of the comprehensive spending review, which is considering how to lighten the burden of regulation as well as looking at where the benefits are greatest.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/8">I am happy to respond positively to the hon. Gentleman's request to keep the House informed about the progress of the women's enterprise taskforce. I know that my hon. Friend the Minister for Women and Equality will be enthusiastic about doing so. The hon. Gentleman referred to failures; that is a matter of deciding whether the glass is half full or half empty. Almost 1 million women are self-employed, which is up 10 per cent. over the past four years. Of newly self-employed people, 36 per cent. are women compared with 27 per cent. of the currently self-employed. There is a particularly high increase in female entrepreneurial activity in the east of England, Scotland and the south-west, and we must look at why that is happening in some regions and not all. It is difficult to provide figures, but many women seem to be taking leadership roles in social enterprises. That may be due to a more value-driven approach and the link between that and their approach to family and community. That contribution can be valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/9">Over the past year I have found it inspiring that many business leaders are willing to try to inspire others. I have referred to Kevin Smith of GKN, Duncan Mitchell of Cisco and other senior people who have engaged with the information age partnership. It is essential that that area grows if we are to achieve the levels of productivity that all hon. Members in the Chamber aspire to. Roger Putnam of Ford is putting in time to improve the quality and reputation of the supply side of the motor industry. Those businesses and others have worked with us on the company law reform agenda and the &quot;think small first&quot; philosophy which is built into that.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/10">Business leaders in the construction industry have been working on the TrustMark scheme to try to provide assurance for consumers as well as a level playing field of a higher quality within the industry. We have also seen business leadership among the chairs of the regional development agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/11">The hon. Gentleman referred to home as the place in which to start a business. He is right, but that should be balanced with the mutual stimulus and shared learning that is available when individuals who are starting up in business work together in nursery facilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.539.1/12">The hon. Gentleman also referred to the effect of crime on the retail industry. I sponsored the shopfront security group in the House of Commons when we tried to persuade a Conservative Government to take the issue seriously, and I welcome his comments. There are schemes such as the crime reduction partnership under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and police community support officers, who often engage with retail businesses, particularly on estates, and in smaller shopping areas and smaller towns. The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 was another of my babies and provides support for local authorities in partnership with business. I can also claim parentage of antisocial behaviour orders. All are important in helping business in relation to the crime that is a challenge to them. It was interesting that that was a topic, with healthy eating, at the Retail Consortium's parliamentary event which I attended in the House only last week.</p>
