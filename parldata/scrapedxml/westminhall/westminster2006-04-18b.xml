	<p pid="b.1.3/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. The request for this Adjournment debate arose from the visit a number of hon. Members made in January to the United Nations headquarters in New York. I thank the Minister and his officials for arranging that visit and supporting us so effectively. The purpose of the visit was to learn more about the UN and to consider the challenges that it is facing. It was also aimed at increasing our knowledge of the importance of UN reform and how the process of reform is developing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/2">At the outset, it is worth saying that the visit was extremely useful. The group decided on our return to do what we could to raise the profile of UN reform with our fellow MPs; hence today's debate. It is always important for MPs to learn more about the UN, but the timing seemed particularly acute because of the proposals for reform agreed at the world summit in September 2005&mdash;an important year for the UN as it saw its 60th anniversary. Obviously, that gave added impetus to the process of reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/3">In broad terms, the summit agreed that reform should happen across a number of fronts simultaneously. The first tranche covered institutional innovations, such as    establishing the Peacebuilding Commission and reforming the Security Council. There was then a second tranche about management and secretariat reform, such as reviewing existing financial and human resource rules, and budgetary review. A third tranche concerned policy co-ordination.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/4">The wide-ranging reform package is intended to make the organisation more fit for purpose for 21st century needs. The role of the UN is a changing one, and has been changing especially in recent years. Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General, has summarised the changes thus:</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/5" class="indent">&quot;In the 16 years since the cold war ended, the Organization has taken on more than twice as many new peacekeeping missions as in the previous 44 years . . . Over half of its . . . civilian staff now serve in the field&mdash;not only in peacekeeping, but also in humanitarian relief, criminal justice, human rights monitoring and capacity-building&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/6">That is the background, but there are other reasons for the need for reform. We look to the UN to prevent conflicts, broker solutions to disputes, lead the fight against world poverty, disease and malnutrition, and tackle environmental issues, especially climate change. There are also concerns about the UN's past failure to respond effectively to crises such as Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur, not to mention the thorny issue of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/7">In order to respond to these issues and challenges, the Secretary-General put together a high-level panel to consider reform, which published a report in December 2004. The reforms were outlined at the world summit, and they largely followed the report but with some changes. We can conclude that the expectations of the role that the UN can and should play have never been higher. The reform programme is essentially about trying to deliver a UN that can meet current and future expectations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/8">Opinion about whether the reform programme goes far enough is varied, with probably about 191 versions&mdash;one or more for each member state. The Secretary-General has expressed his unhappiness that it has not gone far enough, especially in tackling the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. That is pertinent at present, given the situation with Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/9">In general, there seems to be a degree of agreement that with so many different&mdash;and often competing&mdash;agendas at the UN, it is perhaps surprising that reform has got this far and that it is so wide-ranging. There is even a website that documents the process of UN reform. Our Library has put together an excellent briefing, which I am drawing heavily on in today's debate. I am also relying on the report put together by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> on behalf of the group who attended the UN in July.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/10">Where are we now with the reforms? I hope that the Minister will ultimately answer that question, but I have a few issues to throw out for consideration. First, I want to centre on the tranche of work on institutional innovations. That sounds as though it could be quite a minor task, but it is absolutely huge. It includes putting together the Peacebuilding Commission, the human rights council and the central emergency response fund and tackling Security Council reforms, the mandate review and the General Assembly review.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/11">I will turn first to the Peacebuilding Commission, which was created in December 2005, just before our visit. It aims to fill a gap in bringing together relevant actors and resources to advise on and propose integrated strategies for post-conflict peace building and recovery. That is an enormous task. Negotiations are continuing about representation on that, and I would appreciate an update from the Minister. It is fair to say that the group saw the establishment of the commission as an important step forward for the UN. We were a little surprised to find that 18 peacekeeping missions are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/12">In the many meetings on the topic that we attended, there was complete agreement that security and development needed to go together hand in hand. It was hoped that by co-ordinating post-conflict work more effectively in a country through the Peacebuilding Commission, some of the issues underlying conflict might be addressed, which might reduce the likelihood of conflict erupting again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/13">It is worth looking at Sierra Leone as an example of a country that the UN is due to leave in the near future and where the Peacebuilding Commission may have a role. We discovered when we were at the UN that there was some uncertainty about what the UN's leaving would mean for Sierra Leone. The ambassador was unsure not only of the possible consequences, but of the time scale. A ministerial update would be helpful, in particular a comment about how the Peacebuilding Commission could help.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/14">Most importantly, the Peacebuilding Commission is seen as a vehicle for reconstruction post-conflict, to co-ordinate the multiplicity of institutions that can become involved in reconstruction. It would be interesting to know whether other agencies, including non-governmental organisations, are willing to co-operate with the Peacebuilding Commission's activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/15">I move on to the human rights council. When we visited New York, one of the issues that was causing greatest concern was the establishment&mdash;or rather, the lack of it, at that stage&mdash;of the human rights council to replace the largely discredited UN Commission on Human Rights. The issue was raised by a number of countries, and it was clearly divisive. The establishment of the council was eventually agreed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March 2006</phrase>. The new council will be smaller than the commission, with improved status as a subsidiary of the General Assembly rather than the Economic and Social Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.3/16">The human rights council's membership is still being debated. Notably, the United States opposed its formation because members will be elected by simple majority rather than the two-thirds favoured by America. Elections are scheduled for <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May</phrase>. America argued for the two-thirds majority because a simple majority vote for membership would enable rogue states to become members, and the presence of rogue states in the membership of the commission had been responsible for eroding its credibility. Despite that view, some changes have been made, however, and members that commit gross or systematic human rights violations can now be suspended by a two-thirds vote, although we shall have to see whether that happens. However, there is probably some relief that the US is still on board to the extent that it is applying for membership and giving financial support. I am sure that the Minister's comments on how he sees the human rights council developing will be interesting.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.0/1">I hope that the hon. Lady and other colleagues concur that it is welcome indeed that the original muted suggestion of automatic, universal council membership has been abandoned. Would she also agree that it is important that neither geography nor the principle of Buggins's turn should determine the chairmanship, which should be determined at least in part by the behaviour of the state involved?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.3.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="3"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.3.1/1">I absolutely agree and I shall come to some of those points when I discuss the appointment of the new Secretary-General.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/2">The idea for the central emergency response fund was very much pushed by the United Kingdom Government. Incidentally, the group got the impression at the UN that the UK Government were very highly regarded because of their efforts to push forward not only the central emergency response fund, but the reform agenda more generally. The aim of the fund is to improve the UN's ability to respond rapidly to humanitarian crises by ensuring that critical funding is available immediately, and I am sure that all hon. Members would welcome that. The fund was officially launched on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March</phrase>, and the Secretary of State was much involved. The fund can receive donations from corporations and individuals, as well as Governments, although the UK Government are currently the largest donor.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/3">As we saw during our visit, the issue of the new human rights council led to heated debate, but that pales into insignificance beside the debates and competing views about Security Council reform. Indeed, so many different views were expressed that I hardly know where to start summarising them. None the less, I shall try, and the Minister and others can add to, correct or amend what I say, as necessary. There seemed to be little consensus about the number of new permanent members and who they should be, whether new permanent members should have a veto, whether current permanent members should maintain their veto, what the number of permanent members should be, whether there should be new non-permanent members, and if so, how many. The list went on and on; there was very much a lack of consensus, with many competing and contested views. Currently, about six different draft resolutions for increasing the number of permanent and non-permanent members are on the table for discussion, and we shall have to see how the international debate on them plays out. Again, the Minister may be able to give us an update.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/4">One positive point to arise from reform of the Security   Council is the extension of the mandate to include a responsibility to protect. Establishing such a responsibility addresses the anti-genocide clause in the world summit report of September 2005 and recognises the need for the international community to act if states fail to protect their populations from war crimes, mass abuse of human rights, genocide and other crimes against humanity, such as ethnic cleansing. It is also intended to respond to some of the UN's previous perceived failures in handling crises in Bosnia and Rwanda. Again, it is very much to be welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.0/1">Before my hon. Friend moves on, let me say that I am particularly interested in that aspect of the visit undertaken by her and her colleagues. Did she sense that there had been any movement on the debate about the appropriate moment for the UN to act when it perceives that the population is not being properly protected or is being abused?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.4.1/1">We had some discussions about that, but the view at this stage is that it is important to put in place the principle and the recognition that the UN must be able to intervene in countries before there is mass starvation or ethnic cleansing. To my recollection, however, we did not discuss the exact trigger for that intervention, although other hon. Members might correct me on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.1/2">On the mandate review&mdash;</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.4.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.4.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, because the Minister has raised perhaps one of the key points about the issue of UN reform. Our group discussed the responsibility to protect, which features in our report, but the whole matter was encapsulated in our discussions with the Kenyan permanent representative to the UN. Leading him on, I asked, &quot;Should we have intervened sooner in Darfur?&quot; and he said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I asked, &quot;Should we be intervening in the possible dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea?&quot; and he said, &quot;Yes.&quot; I then asked, &quot;Should we have intervened earlier in the Zimbabwe situation?&quot; and I got a great deal of waffle. In the middle of it, however, was the word &quot;solidarity&quot;, and that is the problem with the UN organisation: there are too many vested interests, so it is difficult to achieve agreement between 191 nations.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.5.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.5.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that most helpful intervention. Those discussions did indeed take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.0/2">Let me move on, however, because I am anxious for other hon. Members to have an opportunity to participate.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.5.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" speakername="Peter Bottomley" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="b.5.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, particularly because I must go to a planning inquiry in my constituency and cannot stay to the end of the debate. Does she agree that the difficult cases that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> rightly mentioned should not prevent us from trying to agree internationally about what should have happened in cases where the international community clearly failed? We could then start to make significant progress more often in more places, and such action would be necessary on fewer occasions.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.5.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.5.2/1">I absolutely agree. The group concluded that the duty to protect was an important step forward for the UN. It is important that there is continued discussion about how best to intervene and that there is dialogue with some of the countries that are affected so that we can find a way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.2/2">I shall not dwell too much on mandate review. It is a bureaucratic task, but we came to see it as increasingly essential in terms of reform. The remit is that all mandates that are older than five years should be reviewed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.5.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" speakername="John Bercow" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.5.3/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way, because I know that she wants to make progress, but can I press her a little on the responsibility to protect in relation to Darfur? Does she believe that there is now a challenge to show whether the responsibility to protect is a serious attempt to prevent genocide or simply a rather vacuous exercise in moral posturing? Surely, the purpose of intervention should be not to minimise casualties, but to stop violence and, where necessary, to enforce peace.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.5.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="5"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h01.htm#60418h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.5.4/1">I absolutely agree. Again, the group's view was that the responsibility to protect was an important step forward for the UN. Our collective view was that it will not get us anywhere if is just words; it must be backed by action, and that means taking some tough decisions. Indeed, our view of the whole reform process was that it should enable tough decisions to be taken more quickly and readily.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.4/2">I know that mandate review is boring, but perhaps I can return to it for just a moment. Not only does the UN have too many mandates, but those mandates do not have time scales, and they are continually added to&mdash;or are not removed. In a sense, they clutter the UN agenda. In his preliminary report, the Secretary-General said that the reporting mechanisms were burdensome, that there was too much overlap and an unwieldy and duplicated architecture for implementation, and that there were gaps between mandates and resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.4/3">Straightforward as the task may appear&mdash;it would seem to be a bureaucratic tidying up&mdash;we were again surprised at the suspicion that the process engendered in some member states. I understand that some progress is now being made, but we were genuinely shocked at how even that fairly bureaucratic process was being contested.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.4/4">The second main problem is with the overhaul, oversight and audit arrangements. Almost every element of that aspect of reform produced suspicion in some quarters. For instance, we might think that forming an ethics office would be fairly straightforward. We would be wrong. It was as much bound up in conspiracy theory as major reforms, such as that of the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.4/5">Nevertheless, and despite the tensions, an ethics office has been established and a whistle-blower policy has been agreed, as have policies on preventing fraud and corruption and so on. There will also be a review of existing financial and human resources, although as a recent review in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> by Francis Harris demonstrated, there is still some way to go. Staff reacted angrily to Kofi Annan's proposals to overhaul the secretariat, and an update on that from the Minister would be useful.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.4/6">The last main area is policy co-ordination. In February, the Secretary-General put together a high-level panel to tackle the problem, so it was very much the topic of conversation while we were there. It will lay the groundwork for a fundamental restructuring of UN operational work. The panel is expected to complete its work in the summer&mdash;it is good to have such a short time scale&mdash;and its recommendations will go before the General Assembly in September. It is a 15 member panel, and the UK is ably represented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.4/7">I turn briefly to development. Undoubtedly a great deal of reform was geared towards delivering on the millennium development goals. However, getting development agencies such as UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the UNDP to work together more closely seemed to be fraught with difficulty. Again, I hope that the Minister can update us on that. We were pleased to see so much emphasis being placed on delivering on the millennium development goals. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase>, who was with the delegation, pushed strongly on climate change, and I am sure that he will want to say something about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.5.4/8">An important challenge will be the appointment of the new Secretary-General. The dilemmas facing the UN in that respect were excellently summarised in a recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> by Lord Hannay of Chiswick, who stressed the need for transparency, the need to get the best person for the job regardless of region and the need for that person to have a policy platform. One innovative idea was that the Secretary-General should serve one seven-year term rather than two terms, so that he did not have to pander to the needs of particular sections or blocs to get re-elected. Some of those ideas are worth discussing.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way so generously, especially as she initiated the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.0/2">It seems to us that reform is fraught with controversy because of vested interests&mdash;for instance, Brazil being blocked by Venezuela. Does the hon. Lady agree that, when we come to budgetary talks, there is a great need for more nations to contribute to the UN? How can they be expected to contribute more to the UN if they are not allowed to participate in greater numbers at the Security Council?</p>

	<p pid="b.7.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. It underpinned our discussions with a number of countries that feel left out of that core group, and the reform process will have to address that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/2">I turn to our overall conclusions. At times, we saw the process as being very much like a huge tanker with ships attached to it trying to turn around against a gale force wind. That might be an exaggeration, but progress seemed at times to be frustratingly slow.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3">We also felt that bloc prejudices got in the way of rational discussion. I know that it is politics, and that one should not let the facts get in the way of a good argument. However, it seemed to us that such prejudices were preventing important discussion on key issues. We certainly witnessed the playing out of the starkly based divisions on north-south and east-west lines. That was evidenced in our discussions on such matters as ethics, human rights reform, peace building, Security Council form and mandate review.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/4">Amid all the suspicion and contestation, progress has taken place. That leads me to wonder whether, underneath the posturing and rhetoric, there is a deep understanding that if the reform progress were to fail and the UN failed with it, it would be not only a missed opportunity but a catastrophe for humankind's ability to tackle global issues and concerns such as climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/5">Time and again, we heard that if the UN failed it would have to be reinvented. However, it seemed that the precious nature and fragility of the institution was not always fully appreciated, and with that comes the recognition that the UN needs to change if it is to survive. That will doubtless mean that the various blocs and factions will need to change.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/6">I do not want to end on a negative note. We saw much in our visit to inspire, and dialogue is at least taking place. Improvements are happening, albeit slowly, and in the current climate that must count as progress. We saw a number of ambassadors during our visit, and I thank them. I also thank everyone who contributed to our discussions and information-gathering tasks, particularly Tony Kay of the Foreign Office and Emyr Parry Jones, our ambassador to the UN, for his effective support.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.0/1">It is a pleasure to contribute to this debate. The debate is long overdue, and I hope that I am not alone in thinking that it should be an annual fixture, and held more properly on the Floor of the House. Every year, we debate our relations with European Union, and it is right and proper that we should do so. It is an important international organisation, and we are part of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/2">As a permanent member of the Security Council, and with the United Nations taking such incredibly important decisions, I would certainly welcome an annual debate on the UN on the Floor of the House. Judging from the nods that I see from all sides of the Chamber, I think that we might seek that through the powers that be. We could ask the Leader of the House whether that can be brought about, because it would spread an interest in and a greater knowledge of the UN among all Members. That would help bring pressure on the Government of the day to ensure that the UN moves forward, as it must. Reform is being examined closely across the organisation. It is absolutely right and proper, so that the UN can focus on what it needs to do and to do it as well as it can.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.0/3">A one-page sheet of all the different UN organisations was helpfully given to those of us who visited the UN earlier this year. There are quite a number of them, many of which, I suspect, most of us have never heard. For example, there are regional commissions that report to the Economic and Social Council. Were Members present aware that there is a UN Economic Commission for Europe, which is known as the ECE? I wonder whether it has ever come into the consciousness of anyone present from a news report of something that it has said or because of any useful contribution that it has made to debate on economic affairs in this continent of ours. I confess that the first I heard of it was when I looked down the sub-divisions of the regional commissions, of which there are four across the world, with a budget of $50 million or so. We need to question the value of such parts of the UN organisation, and whether that money would be far better spent on the front line of development or peacekeeping work, where it is really needed and would really make a difference. I hope that every part of the UN structure is considered in the reform.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.1/1">I intervene before my hon. Friend moves on from the subject of regional commissions, as I had hoped that he might mention the UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, which is based in Damascus. It has a budget of $50 million per annum and the tallest building in that city, but has never, to my knowledge, produced a single report. That is an example of where the UN is in desperate need of reform.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. He adds further evidence to my point. I think that the commission's headquarters may be in Beirut, rather than Damascus, but his point is absolutely right none the less. There is a sense that such organisations exist just to give jobs to senior UN diplomats, or to reward certain countries which believe that it is their turn, or right, to have an important international post. It is right and proper that there should be international parliamentary scrutiny of such organisations, so that we can get rid of them if they are not justified. If they are justified, let us see what they are doing and make use of their reports, but if they are not worth the considerable sums that go into their budgets, they should properly be got rid of.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.2/2">The UN gets a bad press from time to time because of issues of malfeasance and financial irregularity, on which it is right that there should be a spotlight. I understand that the financial reporting limit for gifts to    UN staff members is $10,000, which seems extraordinarily high. Certainly, for this country and many others around the world, that is a considerable sum. The UN should focus on small points such as the need to clean up its act and make sure that it is properly immune from charges of acting in an irregular manner. I hope that the current review will look into that.</p>

	<p pid="b.9.0/1">I am intrigued by the hon. Gentleman's point. Is $10,000 the limit on the value of a gift, or the point at which the UN representative must notify Kofi Annan that he has received the gift, in which case it could be much more expensive?</p>

	<p pid="b.9.1/1">The Minister is right to press me; unfortunately, I cannot give him further detail. The five of us who visited the UN were given that figure by the assistant United States ambassador to the UN. Feeling quite moral and upright, I replied that the limit in the UK Parliament is only &pound;250 per gift, but I had the ground cut from under me when the American deputy ambassador replied that it is only $250 for American politicians&mdash;so, in America, they have even higher standards than us. I am sure that the Minister can find out further details through his officials and our excellent mission to the UN in New York, and ensure that the UK lobbies on that point as part of our reform negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/2">I shall address the three areas on which the UN concentrates. On the first page of the UN charter, its purposes are helpfully laid out, the first of which is peacekeeping&mdash;or maintaining &quot;international peace and security&quot;, as the charter puts it. For all the criticism that comes the UN's way, it is not well known that it has 85,000 personnel&mdash;troops and military support staff&mdash;deployed across the world, keeping the peace in 18 different operations. By any yardstick, that is a formidable achievement, which the UN would do well to speak of more. If people knew that it has that level of commitment across the world, they would be extremely impressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.1/3">Will the Minister tell us, in his reply, whether the UN has ever, to his knowledge, been short of either the number of troops that it needed on the ground, or of specific types of troops to mount peacekeeping or other UN operations? It has occurred to me from time to time that it is a slightly chaotic system, given that despite the UN's significant military presence in many countries, it does not have the ability to call, in some systematic way, on military support. Will the Minister tell us whether that has caused difficulties for the UN and is an issue? Does he think that there should be a formal mechanism to ensure that it has under its command the troops that it needs to mount such operations, or at least at its disposal the ability to call on them in a fairly ready and easy manner?</p>

	<p pid="b.9.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that a particularly apposite example of an inadequate force, in terms of both mandate and numbers for the task that needed to be fulfilled, was that in Rwanda in the early 1990s? That was an indictment beyond expression of the world as a whole. If he has not yet read &quot;Shake Hands With the Devil&quot; by Lieutenant-General, Rom&eacute;o Dallaire&mdash;I rather suspect that he has&mdash;I tell him that it is a very good and searing read.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.0/1">My hon. Friend is more than generous, as always, and credits me with having read a book that I am ashamed to confess that I have not yet read. It will have to be summer reading, as it has obviously escaped my Easter reading pile. Hopefully, there will be time to make up for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/2">My hon. Friend again makes an important and serious point. What happened in Rwanda is a scar on the conscience of the whole world, and is something that we must never allow to happen again. I know that the horror of what happened there motivates my hon. Friend and many others in keeping a beady and watchful eye on what is happening in Darfur. Indeed, I am interested to know whether he thinks that the UN has all the necessary troops on the ground in Darfur to ensure that things run there. He indicates that he does not think that it has, which, perhaps, makes my point. I am, of course, aware that there are political considerations: the UN might be able or want to put more troops in, but might be prevented by the political situation on the ground or arguments within the African Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/3">The second main purpose or pillar of the UN is human rights. That was achieved only by the considerable efforts of a very doughty lady&mdash;Eleanor Roosevelt&mdash;in the late 1940s and 1950s. She fought passionately to ensure that the promotion and safeguarding of human rights across the world was a fundamental and principal part of the UN's remit. It is surprising that the money spent on human rights has only just gone past 1 per cent. of the UN's total budget. Last year's summit brought about the responsibility to protect, which is a step forward in philosophical and political terms. It puts an obligation on Governments across the world to prevent genocide and to look after their own people rather than abuse them. The question is how to enforce it on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/4">One of the most disappointing meetings that we had in New York was with a senior official of Mrs. Arbour, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. When we pressed him about how the responsibility to protect would be enforced on the ground the response was vague. I, like most Members present, did not come away from that meeting with any confidence that there were real teeth to this measure, that it could be enforced and would mean something, and that there were mechanisms in place. We were unsure whether a ratchet effect would occur if a Government ignored the responsibility to protect. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, who accompanied us on the trip, put his finger on that in his intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase>. There was talk about a sense of solidarity, particularly among some African countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/5">It is high time that we started to name and shame some of the countries in the United Nations who are voting against resolutions on human rights issues. The European Union has done good work trying to raise several such issues at the United Nations; it has recently done so on Iran, Burma, North Korea and Uzbekistan. The United Kingdom played an important part in getting the issue of the house clearances in Zimbabwe raised at the United Nations not so long ago. All credit to the Government and to our staff in New York for bringing that about. I understand that nine countries voted for in respect of that in the Security Council. None the less, five&mdash;Russia, China, Algeria, Benin and Tanzania&mdash;voted against. In addition, Brazil abstained, even though it would like to be a permanent member of the Security Council.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/6">It is high time that the actions of countries in the United Nations such as those are well known and well publicised. Every time a delegation of parliamentarians, sports people or business people from those countries comes to this country it should be asked why its Government have voted against protecting the human rights of some of the most downtrodden peoples in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/7">Things can change, albeit slowly. Governments are not immune from pressure from their own people. We must get the facts more out in the open. They need to be much better known, so that we can bring pressure to bear on such Governments. It is high time that that was done. I hope that our Government can do their part to publicise how some countries are acting in the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/8">The third pillar of the United Nations is humanitarian development. The start of the charter of the United Nations talks about its purposes and puts this in rather roundabout terms. It talks about &quot;international problems&quot; whose nature is</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/9" class="indent">&quot;economic, social, cultural or humanitarian&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/10">International development rightly falls within that phrase. The United Nations properly devotes a considerable amount of its resources&mdash;for example, its personnel and management time&mdash;to development work.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/11">It seemed to us all that there is a proliferation of UN organisations. It is not necessary to have a massive cull of them, because there are small or specialist organisations that it is right to keep. One such example would be the World Health Organisation. Such organisations are internationally respected and do an extremely good job. However, the case for some form of rationalisation and for some form of proper reporting structure at least is clearly overwhelming.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/12">There are currently 12 different UN agencies working in Tanzania&mdash;to name but one country&mdash;all of which have different reporting lines and so on. If one talks to UN staff at headquarters in New York about the development work that they are doing, one finds that they sometimes despair about the separate fiefdoms that the UN maintains. One former UN Secretary-General referred to the heads of the main UN agencies as being barons in respect of the power that they exercised over their organisations. There is no doubt that the UN's work would be better focused if there were better co-ordination and clearer reporting lines. Less developed countries should have a clear head of all UN operations within the country accountable to the Government as a whole. I hope that our Government will press for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/13">I shall discuss climate change in relation to the purposes of the UN and the reform programme that is occurring. It should come as no surprise to any of us that climate change does not feature at all in the UN charter, because it was not an issue when the UN was being founded in San Francisco in 1946, shortly after the second world war. The UN is the only organisation in the world with the international scope and moral authority to take all countries to task on the issue. We asked senior UN officials about it when we were there.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/14">The UN, to some extent, has a role in tackling climate change; the recent Montreal meeting was known as the 11th conference of the parties to the UN framework convention on climate change. However, no one would pretend that tackling climate change is a central core purpose. There is a principal thrust to what I want to say. The UN currently has three pillars: international peace and security, human rights and development. They should be in place, but the case is overwhelming for adding a fourth pillar and making tackling climate change and safeguarding the future of our planet a principal and primary purpose of the UN.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/15">No other organisation will have the moral authority in that area. The G8, and the Kyoto protocol and other international agreements, have some merit in this respect, but the UN has an unparalleled and incredibly privileged position to speak with amazing authority to every country. It can monitor what is going on, rank how countries are performing in this area, encourage the development of technologies, and name and shame countries that are emitting carbon way above limits agreed on on an international basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.10.0/16">Among the many UN organisations is the World Meteorological Organisation, which is based in Geneva. I was alerted to its existence by someone who is shortly to move into my constituency. He is something of a climate expert and he suggested that that organisation should be given greater prominence and should take the lead as the key UN body to take us forward on the issue of climate change. I hope that the Minister will give us some comfort that the Government are seized of the importance of this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.12.0/1">I shall be brief, as I arrived late, for which I apologise to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase>. I congratulate her on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.0/2">I shall begin my brief contribution by referring to some words of one of the first Secretaries-General of the United Nations, taken from his spiritual treatise &quot;Markings&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="b.12.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Never look down to test the ground before taking your next step. Only he who keeps his eye fixed on the far horizon will find his right road.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.12.0/4">However, it is important that we also look at the steps in front of us, and the reform process that my hon. Friend was outlining as I entered the Chamber is absolutely to do with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.0/5">I was particularly taken with my hon. Friend's reports on her recent visit to the UN. I visited it in 2000; I was similarly struck by how it had grown like Topsy, and there seems to have been no pruning in the intervening years. However, I admire the work of Kofi Annan and the high-level panel. Members have been a little critical in this debate, but appendix 1 of part E of the very good Library briefing lists various areas of reform: &quot;Institutional Innovations&quot;, &quot;Secretariat/Management Reform/Oversight&quot; and &quot;Greater Policy Co-ordination&quot;. Therefore, a range of things has been achieved in short order compared with how things have historically happened in the UN, so we should not be too down-hearted about the progress that has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.0/6">I wish to make one key point about the Peacebuilding Commission, which I hope will provide much of the framework for ensuring that the UN's reform process delivers on the ground. Now that it has been established, will the Minister tell us what he thinks are the prospects for it doing robust work in this area? It will set out benchmarks and help things to happen over time in a way that, perhaps, has not been built into the work of the UN before. In the past, when a crisis has emerged and the response has been made, many parts of the UN have kept tabs on what has been going on, but not in a coherent way, and not at the top level. I hope that the Peacebuilding Commission will help us to do that. We can commend the direction of travel that has been identified and mapped out.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.0/7">Harking back to the contribution of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase>, I agree that many aspects of what the UN currently addresses, such as the environment, are to do with scientific matters that were not envisaged at the time when the UN was set up. That is particularly the case in respect of the way in which the environment can impact on poverty and development across the piece. Can the Minister tell us what we are doing to ensure that good advice is available when and where it is needed? I understand that the Department for International Development has appointed a scientific adviser, and that the UN agencies, the World Health Organisation and UNESCO are now doing a bit better in this regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.12.0/8">I shall now conclude, because I know that at least one other Member wishes to make a contribution.</p>

	<p pid="b.13.0/1">I am surprised at your choice of the order of speakers, Mrs. Dean, as I was present from the start, and I have been left with little time to say what I want to say about this delegation to the United Nations, of which I was a member.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/2">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> for organising the trip. It was an eye-opener for me. I had taken considerable interest in the UN, but I had not seen it at first hand, and I count it as a privilege to have been a part of the delegation, which visited it in January.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/3">As I must truncate my remarks, I will first refer to the work done on our behalf by the ambassador, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, and Mr. Tony Kay of the Foreign Office. They put together a fabulous programme. I might be corrected on this, but I think that we had 14 meetings in four days&mdash;which was a very light and moderate programme. If anybody wants to go to a restaurant in mid-Manhattan I recommend Positano&mdash;a rather economical restaurant, where the prices might even surprise <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/4">While we were there, we managed to meet three and a half permanent members of the Security Council: Sir    Emyr Jones Parry, Mr. Denisov, the Russian ambassador, the Chinese ambassador, and the deputy ambassador of the United States. The only people we did not get to meet were the French. I do not know whether that says something about our relations with France.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/5">Our meeting with the ambassador for China was the most unbelievable meeting I have ever attended. It was led by the leader of our delegation, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling. The ambassador referred all his remarks to us via him. We were interested to know what the UN was going to do on reform of human rights, because that is an important issue. One of the basic human rights is the right to self-determination, which is, of course, denied to the people of Tibet. That is a pressing issue. I asked the ambassador for China about his views on extending democracy to Tibet, and he told me that it already had it, which was a surprise to me, because I did not think that the Tibetans had self-determination. The recent decision to erect a massive statue of Chairman Mao in Tibet is also, perhaps, an affront to the Tibetan people.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/6">We did not get a chance to address the issue of Burma. The UN has a great deal of work to do on human rights in that country. That is a serious matter, and I know that our Government have made great efforts to take it forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/7">I have three remaining minutes, and I wish to press the Minister. I know that the UN charter was drawn up 60 years go, but even in its reformed state following the crisis where it failed to follow up UN Security Council resolution 1441 on Iraq and subsequent developments in the 21st century, I do not think that the UN is a panacea for all the global problems that we currently face. It has been mentioned that there are 18 zones of conflict, with 80,000-plus UN military and civilian personnel active across the world. Ten years ago, $9 billion was spent; now, $18 billion is being spent, primarily on trying to involve them in conflict resolution. What we need is a proactive&mdash;rather than a reactive&mdash;organisation that gets into countries and regions where there are crises.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/8">It is in that regard that the African Union must deliver, by playing its part in attempts to resolve conflicts in Africa, where we face huge problems to do with AIDS, the lack of education and the achievement of the millennium goals. I have been extremely disappointed in the role South Africa has played in trying to resolve the conflicts in that continent. It should have done much more over Zimbabwe, and it could certainly be more active now in respect of Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/9">In the middle east, Hamas made ridiculous statements yesterday welcoming the Tel Aviv suicide bombers. We have a new Israeli Government who will try to determine their borders without negotiation, which is a backward step. We have real problems with Syria and Lebanon. We have problems to do with Iran and North Korea, in terms of their attempts to establish a nuclear energy policy or a nuclear weapons policy. We also have UN representatives in Afghanistan and Iraq. We have problems in Chechnya, too, and we have had problems in Niger. We face serious issues, some of which the African Union needs to address. It ought to try to exploit the activities of the Egyptian Government&mdash;a secular Government of a Muslim country that has good relationships with both sides in the middle east. It can speak to Iran about its actions in respect of nuclear weapons; that is how it could help to take this agenda forward. We need to redefine the UN&mdash;to state what its proactive role is in its global activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.13.0/10">I will finish on climate change. We arrived in New York on a sunny spring day; the day after, there were sub-Siberian weather conditions. After that, there were hurricanes and monsoons, and then it returned to being quite nice weather. There are those changing conditions in the United States; there are floods in the Balkans; and there is drought in Africa. If the United Nations does not think that climate change should be on the agenda, it really ought to think again.</p>

	<p pid="b.15.1/1">This has been an important and impressive debate. Like others, I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> for securing the debate and setting out the issues so comprehensively at the outset. I extend that tribute to those who went on what was clearly a worthwhile visit to the United Nations. I echo the comments made about the value of going to the UN to see for oneself its range of activities and its complexities. I certainly gained enormous benefit from going there myself a few years ago. In common with others, I pay tribute to British diplomats and officials in the UN for the excellent work that they do, day in, day out. The fact that Britain punches above its weight is in large part due to the skills, expertise and approach of our diplomats in important places such as the UN.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/2">I shall pick up on a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> about the prospect of an annual debate on the UN. I have recently returned to the foreign affairs brief, but I recall that just over a year ago the current Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning pledged that there would be such a debate&mdash;and, indeed, for two years we have managed to secure one, albeit usually in Westminster Hall on a Thursday afternoon. Nevertheless, that is important, and I hope that today the Minister will confirm that it is still the practice and the intention of the Government to provide such debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/3">The United Nations matters more than ever because of the uncertain nature of our world; collective security is vital to us all. It also matters because, as contributors have said, there is still the huge issue of the lack of human rights and democracy across the globe; that remains an absolute disgrace. The inequalities of wealth and opportunity in different continents is, to borrow a phrase already used once this morning, a scar on the conscience of us all.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/4">The hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire was slightly critical of the prosaic language in the UN charter about the different pillars of the organisation. I refer him back to the preamble, in which the lofty ideals of the representatives in San Francisco are set out in slightly better language, which says,</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/5" class="indent">&quot;to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war . . . to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights . . . and . . . to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/6">Those ideals are still relevant today, across the world. Recent debates about reform of the UN have brought them into even sharper focus.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/7">In a recent speech to the British Council, Mark Malloch Brown&mdash;the new deputy Secretary-General of the organisation&mdash;stressed the centrality of security, development and human rights to the reform programme that is now under way, following the world summit last autumn. He emphasised that reforms had to be underpinned by radical change in the organisation and in the management of the UN itself&mdash;a strong theme in our debate this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/8">The oil-for-food scandal undoubtedly rocked the UN, and it lapped uncomfortably close to the Secretary-General himself. To his immense credit, he has not shied away from facing the weaknesses and rot that were exposed by that scandal and others referred to this morning. He will need strong support from Governments such as ours if he is to carry out the painful processes that he has outlined and now seeks to implement.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/9">It is always pretty easy to set out a list of the failures of the UN, or the differences between its high-blown rhetoric and the often grubby reality. On security, there have been failures in Rwanda, the Balkans, the Congo and now Darfur; on human rights, there is the embarrassment and disgrace of the old commission's having Zimbabwe and Libya as members; on development, there is the horrible reality that we are barely on track to meet the millennium development goals&mdash;the basic targets set in a flurry of good intentions five years ago&mdash;by 2015. Also, as contributors to the debate have stressed, there is a worrying lack of attention to perhaps the most important challenge for all of us, climate change, which we need to tackle with great urgency.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/10">The attempts at reform are well documented. The high-level panel and the world summit last year got that process firmly under way. The world summit was a mixed bag, perhaps reflecting the mixed motives of the participants. However, we should recognise the achievements, not least of which is the fact that a debate was started on intervention for humanitarian purposes&mdash;the so-called &quot;responsibility to protect&quot;. Also, a peace-building commission was set up, and&mdash;not at the time, but subsequently&mdash;there was agreement on the human rights council. Also, a new emergency development fund was created; the UK has led the way in terms of its contributions to it. I pay tribute to the Minister and the Government for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/11">Alongside those strengths of the summit, there was a worrying failure to tackle the issue of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, or to make any mention of disarmament. Even the Secretary-General himself branded that &quot;a real disgrace&quot;. Also, the issue of pre-emptive strikes&mdash;which have undermined the United Nations since the war in Iraq started some three years ago&mdash;was not referred to. Although there was unqualified condemnation of terrorism, there is as yet no working definition of it. Those are serious disappointments, but it is not time to give up. It has been said that we get the United Nations that we deserve. Sometimes there is a risk of our treating the UN as if it were a fully autonomous and independent organisation. The reality, of course, is that the UN is very much a creature of its individual member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/12">The UN is not beyond meaningful reform or irredeemably damaged, as long as there is the political will to sort it out. It is unlikely that we will have a &quot;San Francisco Moment&quot; in which to put it all right, but effective and deep reform is possible if a coalition of democracies, the United States placed centrally among them, perseveres in the development of an effective United Nations. That means that we need a more open approach to the UN from the United States. Its ambassador, John Bolton, has characterised his approach as &quot;muscular diplomacy&quot;, but was recently rebuked by the <i>International Herald Tribune</i>, which said that there have been plenty of illustrations of the muscle, but not many of the diplomacy. We need to rebalance that approach. Britain has an important role in persuading the Americans of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.15.1/13">As others said, we need to recognise the realities of the 21st century, and not only the post-war realities of 1945. We need to consider seriously Security Council reform to bring others such as Brazil, Germany, India, Japan and a representative from Africa into the Security Council, if they meet the high standards that we should all expect of them. It is in nobody's interests for the impetus for United Nations reform to fail. The world needs a strong UN to face the complex challenges of the 21st century. However damaged it is, and however marginalised it has been in recent times, no other organisation can compete with it as a source of global legitimacy. At a time of worrying developments in Iran and the middle east, and of catastrophe in Darfur, the world needs a United Nations that works.</p>

	<p pid="b.17.0/1">It is delightful to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> on securing this debate and on her excellent contribution to it. She is obviously a fast learner; I have no doubt that she will go far in her party.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/2">Much has been said about the importance of UN reform. Excellent speeches have been made not only by the hon. Lady, but by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>. I congratulate the hon. Lady on her courtesy in cutting short her speech so that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1914" name="Mike Hall">the hon. Member for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall)</phrase> could make his contribution, which was particularly about human rights but also ran the gamut of world problems. His contribution was valuable and it would have been a pity to have missed it.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/3">As has been mentioned, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase> led an excellent delegation, which included Members present today, to the United Nations in January. However, we missed the presence of any Liberal Democrat Member; that party would have benefited greatly had it been able to send one.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/4">The members of the delegation learned a huge amount, and the hon. Gentleman, aided by contributions from other members, has produced an excellent document that summarises the totality of UN reform as encompassed by the summit, and particularly by the fifth committee and the budget reforms that led right up to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-23">23 December 2005</phrase> and were a great tribute to all the nations that participated. That had to be done by consensus. It is fitting to pay tribute to our permanent ambassador to the United Nations, Sir Emyr Jones Parry, and Tony Kaye, whom I see here today and did so much organisation during our visit.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/5">Members have referred to the fact that in 1941 it was Churchill and Roosevelt's vision that led to the founding of the United Nations as we know it today. After the catastrophe of the second world war, that was an important vision. However, the weakness of the League of Nations was one of the contributory factors that led to the second world war, and we have to grasp the nettle of that same spirit of Churchill and Roosevelt in 1941. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire came out with one of the most apt phrases that I have heard in a long time. He said that the UN had the international scope and moral authority to take nations to task, and that was precisely what Churchill and Roosevelt had in mind in 1941.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/6">Unless we take the opportunity to reform the United Nations so that it becomes competent, we shall see more global catastrophes and problems. In my view, the UN failed on Iraq. Diplomacy is always preferable to war. With the <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-28">28 April</phrase> deadline set for Iran, we now have the next low-water mark for the UN. If we fail on that as well, we are heading for deep trouble. Reform is particularly important today, and I hope that the Minister will take that message back to the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister, and that the British Government will use their special relationship with the UN.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/7">The UK Government are now the second largest contributor to the UN; the USA is by far the largest contributor. If the largest and second largest contributors cannot effectively push this reform, particularly given their special relationship, I do not know what will be able to. The Prime Minister has a special relationship with President Bush; we hear that they speak for half an hour every week. Let us hope that some of those conversations can be directed towards achieving some real and positive UN reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/8">Mention has been made of a number of reforms; perhaps the most important is the budgetary reform, to which I referred in my opening remarks. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-23">23 December</phrase>, the fifth committee decided that each tranche of the half-yearly budget would be released only if progress on reform was made. During my meeting with him, John Bolton was adamant that the United States would not sanction the next half-year's budget unless progress towards reform was made. I hope that the British Government will support the United States on that, because only through budgetary discipline will reform be forced through. Given that a nation as small as the Tuvalu islands has the same vote on the General Assembly as the United States, it is difficult to get reforms through.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/9">The contribution of the United States is massive at $24.2 billion and it therefore has a right to have a say in how the UN should be reformed. We need to pay great heed to Ambassador Bolton's words. I hope that there will be reform on the budget and the other areas that I am going to talk about.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/10">Budgetary reform is vital and has been highlighted by the oil-for-food programme scandal. During the seven-odd years of that programme's existence it dealt with $64 billion-worth of potential aid for food. When we think that Saddam Hussein skimmed off up to $10 billion of that, we see the scale of the scandal. We must never allow that extent of fraud to happen again. Such things require proper safeguards and external audit.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/11">I turn to the issue of Security Council participation. We cannot expect nations to contribute more to the UN unless there is some enlargement of the Security Council. The issue of the G4 group is fearfully controversial; Venezuela does not want Brazil in it, Pakistan does not want India in it and other African countries do not want South Africa in it. It is difficult, but we have to try to make progress on Security Council reform, especially given that Japan is the second largest contributor to the core budget and one of the major aspirants to becoming a member of the Security Council. It is perhaps the most deserving of them all.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/12">Time is limited and I shall skate over much of what I was going to say. The UN needs to concentrate more than anything on two areas: first, the transformation from the Human Rights Commission to a human rights council. We have to make sure that the human rights council is more effective; the commission failed too often in the past. In 2003, it was under the chairmanship of Syria; other nations with poor human rights records such as Zimbabwe, Cuba and Sudan have been members of that three-nation commission. Any nation that fails in implementing at least basic human rights should not be a member of the council, and certainly should not be able to influence its role.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/13">Peace building and whether there should be pre-emptive action has been mentioned. That issue is important and the UN needs to address it. I quote Ambassador Bolton:</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Some member states are attempting to engage in 'mission creep' by redefining the scope of the Peacebuilding Commission and attempting to involve it in pre-conflict situations or long-term development. We do not believe this should fall under the purview of the Peacebuilding Commission, which needs to have a clearly defined and specific mission and mandate in order to maximise its effectiveness.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/15">The issue of whether the United Nations should have a more pre-emptive role is difficult. Currently, there is a potential conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Whether the UN should intervene to stop those nations, among the poorest in the world, going to war is a big question.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/16">I have almost come to the end of my time. We face some difficult world threats. Terrorism is on a scale that we have never known before. If we fail on United Nations reform, the world will suffer&mdash;we will all suffer. Today, one nation's problem can well have consequences for another nation on the other side of the world. Environmental reform has been mentioned; a lady using hair spray in Australia will affect global warming in America. It is no good the Americans standing aside on the environmental issues of the day. We need to bind them in to what is happening in the international community and the world today, not only on the environment but on peacemaking, peace building, conflict resolution, terrorism resolution, human rights and all the other ways in which the UN gives assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/17">I learned the other day that in Uganda between 2001 and 2004, the figure for poverty&mdash;the number of people living on less than $1 a day&mdash;rose from 30 to 40 per cent., yet millions of pounds-worth of aid were poured into Uganda in that time. The world needs to wake up when it comes to how it helps poor countries. It needs to link aid with better government and a move towards democracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/18">I conclude with this phrase, which is what the issue is all about. It comes from Kofi Annan, the Secretary-General of the United Nations. He says that the reform is a</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/19" class="indent">&quot;once-in-a-generation opportunity for the world to come together and take action on grave global threats that require bold global solutions. It is also a chance to revitalise the United Nations itself. It is in short, an opportunity for all humankind.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.17.0/20">If we fail, the world will suffer.</p>

	<p pid="b.20.0/1">I reiterate the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1558" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the Member for City of Durham (Dr. Blackman-Woods)</phrase> for initiating the debate and for her comments. I welcome the interest that Members of both Houses take in the United Nations and in the crucial reforms that that organisation faces. What a pleasure it is to follow such fine contributions from the hon. Members for Cotswold, for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore) and for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), and my hon. Friends the Members for Weaver Vale (Mr. Hall) and for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy).</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/2">The Government are a strong supporter of the United Nations. We have been a staunch ally of the Secretary-General in his reform efforts. We want those efforts to result in a more effective and efficient UN, better able to meet the interlinked challenges of development, security and human rights. My hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham drew us a vivid picture when she said that reforming the UN was like trying to turn around a huge tanker with several ships attached to it. As someone who once had a shot, unwisely, at using a ship simulator and managed to sink a 100,000-tonne coal carrier, wreck the navigation pier at Avonmouth, block the Severn navigation channel and cause a major pollution hazard, I know exactly what she means. We need to communicate vividly the importance of reform, and the hon. Member for Cotswold explained its importance very clearly.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/3">We continue to work hard to achieve the objective of reform. I am pleased that several colleagues present at the debate were able to see for themselves, when they visited New York in January, the challenges that the UN faces and the energy that we are devoting to help it to meet those challenges. I agree with the assessment of our team working in New York. Sir Emyr Jones Parry has a superb team and is one of our best diplomats. No doubt hon. Members can play a role in furthering the good work in which they are engaged on the reform agenda. Debates such as this are welcome and important. With regard to the comments of the hon. Members for South-West Bedfordshire and for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, I will take that valid message to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House. The issue is hugely important and I believe that this needs to be a regular debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/4">The reform debate of the past few years culminated in the 2005 UN world summit last September, which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister attended along with 152 other Heads of Government. Some people expressed disappointment at the outcome of the summit, but it was a significant step forward for the UN and delivered an essential package of reforms and commitments by the international community. We have heard about those this morning. We must try to channel that energy and enthusiasm so that our representatives and those of the EU and other progressive forces in the UN can take the reform agenda forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/5">The UK, when it had the presidency of the EU, played a crucial role in the negotiations leading up to the summit. The Government intend to lay before Parliament a Command Paper on the United Nations shortly. That will include our assessment of the progress made on implementing the reforms agreed at the summit and on the outstanding issues to be addressed. Hon. Members might welcome a brief assessment of where things stand on the implementation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/6">The agreements reached in New York on development and climate change&mdash;I was glad to hear hon. Members mention those issues&mdash;reflected several important Gleneagles and EU commitments. Those included the need to accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals, to address the special needs of Africa and to create, as my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham said, a new central emergency relief fund to strengthen the UN's ability to mobilise quickly and effectively resources to tackle humanitarian crises.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/7">The challenge now is to ensure that those commitments are fulfilled. We continue to lead by example, as shown by our recent commitment to spend at least &pound;8.5 billion on aid for education over the next 10 years. I was glad to hear my hon. Friend and the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire mention the discussions that have been held on the role that the UN should play in seeking to fulfil environmental commitments. At the world summit, there was an agreement to explore the possibility of a more coherent UN institutional framework, including a more integrated structure built on existing institutions and instruments. I was glad to hear the hon. Gentleman point out something that we do not think about enough, which is that no other organisation in the world has the ability to speak to all nations as the UN does. We are pleased with the raised profile that the General Assembly president, Jan Eliasson, has given the issue. I shall consider carefully the interesting examples of possible intervention by the UN that the hon. Gentleman suggested.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/8">We hope to make progress on the EU's goal of transforming the UN Environment Programme into a specialised agency with a revised and strengthened mandate and improved financing. That will enable the UN's environmental pillar to tackle better developing countries' needs, to strengthen the scientific basis of decision making, to focus on emerging priorities such as the environment and security, to improve co-ordination at policy and operational level and to ensure sustained delivery in respect of environmental priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/9">The world summit invited Kofi Annan to launch further work to consider how all the UN operations that we have talked about this morning could be managed more tightly around three pillars: development, humanitarian assistance and the environment. The development, humanitarian and environmental efforts of the UN have become increasingly fragmented, with multiple agencies competing for donor funds, different agencies occupying the same policy space, and overlap and duplication at both headquarters and country level. As many hon. Members pointed out, that is inhibiting the UN from making as significant a contribution as it could make to the achievement of internationally agreed development goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.20.0/10">The Secretary-General's panel on system-wide coherence in the areas of humanitarian assistance, the environment and development is therefore crucial. It heartened me to hear many hon. Members mention that. I am proud of the contribution that the UK made to the world summit's success and of the continuing efforts&mdash;</p>

	Territorial Army Rebalancing
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.23.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" speakername="Ann Winterton" colnum="23"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.23.1/1">May I say at the outset of my contribution on the future of the Territorial Army within the Army structure what a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair this morning, Mrs. Dean? I believe that this is the first time that I have served under your chairmanship.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/2">I am delighted to have secured this debate. It could not have come at a more appropriate time, bearing in mind the Minister's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase> concerning the rebalancing of the TA and, hot on its heels, the National Audit Office report of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> on reserve forces. I have been following the changing role of the TA for some time, not least because of its position at the base of the pyramid that will form the future Army structure.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/3">One could describe the TA as the bedrock of the Government's policy. For several years, successive Ministers have clarified what is expected of it. It will play nothing less than a vital role in future operations and will be fully integrated with regular forces in all types of military and, in the case of the TA infantry, civil operations. There is nothing to criticise in that ambitious objective, as long as the limitations of the arrangement are fully and clearly understood.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/4">The words &quot;territorial&quot; and &quot;reserve&quot; hardly seem appropriate these days, as the TA is operating as nothing less than infill. By its very definition, a reserve force is one that is held back from the line of battle to be used to assist where necessary, or that is called up in an emergency. I do not believe that the Government's present objective for the TA falls into either category, as the TA undertakes all the roles of the regulars without being on the permanent payroll.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/5">The key difficulties in the Government's present strategy for UK armed forces personnel are to do with recruitment, retention, integration and, especially, maintaining morale. As the Minister knows, my initial interest in the infantry stemmed from the recent changes to my local regiment, the Cheshires, and from the strategic defence review, which proposed a 55 per cent. cut in infantry TA. We now face a further reduction of 900 personnel&mdash;or, to be accurate, 910. It is not clear whether they are to come from present strength or from establishment. If that further cut is to come from strength&mdash;this is based on figures from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> last year&mdash;the infantry will be the same size as the logistics, have the same establishment as the medical services and be not far ahead of the Royal Engineers. It is fair to say that the backbone of the Army, the infantry, which has the greatest experience of command in the British Army, is in terminal decline.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/6">I did not understand the part of the recent statement that dealt with medical services, and the Minister's replies to questions did not make it any clearer. Have the Government given up trying to get strength up to establishment in that area? What is the meaning of combat medical staff? Surely all medical staff are combatants to some degree or other; if not, what do they do? For the Ministry of Defence not to know the time span between deployments of regular and TA medics to Iraq is just not good enough. I know one medic in the regulars who will shortly be going to Iraq for the third time.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/7">It is also puzzling when the Ministry says that 13,450 personnel are available for deployment as at <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-01">1 June 2006</phrase> from all TA units, yet the Department cannot or refuses to give exact numbers of unit availability. Does the Department genuinely not know the number? If it does not, how did it arrive at the figure of 13,450? It has been stated that the figure excludes those who have exceeded the MOD's limit on mobilised service of a total of 12 months in every 60. However, most deployments in Iraq have been for around 10 months. Technically, with two months of obligatory service yet to be served, those soldiers could be counted as part of the force of 13,450. I also suspect that the personnel who are available are those such as officers and non-commissioned officers, who are not in particularly short supply, rather than privates, who are the soldiers most needed in such deployments and who operate under the most pressure.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/8">What are the recruitment figures for individual TA centres? I suspect that those that have low recruitment have high retention, as recruits are told openly that, after completing basic training, they will be called up within a year for a 10 to 11-month deployment. Why does the Ministry not know the figures for those who have completed basic training? That is a vital piece of information for understanding what is happening on the ground in respect of recruitment and, thereafter, availability for deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/9">On the basis of information straight from the horse's mouth, I know that infantry privates are not only in great demand but are being put under considerable pressure. That was the subject of a written question that I tabled in January but to which I have not yet received a reply. I remind the Minister that my question asked which main areas of the TA were identified as    undermanned and which required increased recruitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Mr.   Howarth)</phrase> recently mentioned that the present strength of the university Officer Training Corps stands at 5,750 and is 2,250 over establishment. Those personnel are, of course, non-deployable. The OTC is an excellent organisation for students and an extremely successful tool for future recruitment, but should not those figures be kept separate from figures for deployable troops? It seems dishonest to bulk up the overall figures with those who will not be available in an active sense for a considerable time.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/11">From the figures that I have been given in response to written parliamentary questions, it appears that the TA consists of a hard core of as few as 17,000 to 20,000 personnel, which is far short of the establishment figure of 42,000. In 2003&ndash;04, the number of TA bounties paid for classification year 5 was 14,585. The figure was 2,288 for year 3 and only 2,098 for year 1. We need to know the latest figures, as it appears that there is high turnover. I cannot believe that the Ministry does not know how many have left the TA shortly after returning from deployment in Iraq. That is another crucial piece of information that is missing&mdash;at least, it is not in the public domain.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/12">I suspect that some of the numbers in respect of the stated TA strength of 31,680, excluding the OTC, are what I call paper figures: the personnel do not exist in reality but are figments of creative number crunching. As the Minister knows, TA centres are under tremendous pressure to keep numbers up at all costs, and some are not efficient in clearing from the statistics those who have fallen by the wayside.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/13">Many TA centres are fearful of being downgraded or closed down completely because of reducing numbers. It is a fact that a small number of units will be disbanded and a handful of underutilised TA centres will be closed. However, it is nothing but a joke to say that displaced personnel will have the chance to transfer to other units. Does anyone really imagine that they will make a round trip of some 50 miles to go to another unit? In that way, TA members' service will end involuntarily for logistical and practical reasons, yet we cannot afford to lose even one person, as numbers are so low at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/14">Many civil servants who were told last June that their TA units would be downgraded and that further information would be given in October still do not know their fate. When will they be informed about their future prospects, and is this not a case of bad man management? Nothing erodes confidence and motivation as quickly as uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/15">Another concern is that the TA is required to contribute to the civil contingency reaction force, which is another creation of the European Union and part of its continuing regionalisation policy. If there were a long-term crisis in the future, the requirement of 12 out of 60 months' service for TA personnel would soon be used up for the simple reason that most would have already served between 10 and 11 months. Surely, therefore, more people would be excluded from long-term CCRF service. I find it extraordinary that the Department cannot respond to the query concerning how many personnel from each TA infantry regiment are signed up for CCRF duties. Does the Department know the answer or does it not?</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/16">That brings me to the terms of service: a legal requirement of one year in three, possibly extended to five, which translates into a six-month deployment. That can be compared favourably with the USA equivalent of a 12-month deployment in three years. It is true that the United States is running into difficulties with recruitment, retention and morale in the national guard. How can anyone have a successful civilian career when they may be required to disappear for such long stints, especially those in the specialised professions, whose expertise and career advancement may be adversely affected?</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/17">I know that the Minister appreciates the contribution of employers, especially those in smaller businesses. The work undertaken by SaBRE&mdash;Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers&mdash;is excellent, as are the holiday training packages offered to TA personnel after deployment. As the Minister knows, that requires a great sacrifice of both time and finance for those left at home holding the fort.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/18">Let us not forget that those in the TA are, first and foremost, civilians, and although it may be true, as the Minister has stated on more than one occasion, that the TA cannot be distinguished from regulars on active duty, it has to be recognised that its members are in a totally different category without many of the services or the back-up available to members of the regular forces. I understand fully that the Government are trying to create a smaller, high-tech, medium-weight Army, backed up by a highly professional and well trained part-time force, but the integration process is nevertheless fraught with difficulties. Integration between territorial and regular forces is working well in the run-up to Operation Telic 8 because a well established system has developed, not least because the situation in Iraq has gone on for so long. It would be a different story should a war-fighting mission develop, and the difference in capability and experience would then become obvious.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/19">I note the Minister's statement that recruitment has been changed to incorporate regulars and TA, although I doubt that the present financial commitment to recruitment can be maintained. That is the subject of another written question that has remained unanswered since January, when I asked the Secretary of State for Defence</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/20" class="indent">&quot;what spending has been allocated to Territorial Army recruitment for</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/21" class="indent">a) the last three quarters of 2005,</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/22" class="indent">b) the first quarter of 2006 and</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/23" class="indent">c) 2006&ndash;07?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/24">I also feel that the TA does better when undertaking its own recruitment. I welcome the commitment to allow TA volunteers to undergo short deployments that will give them tremendous experience when working with the regulars, but care must be taken not to produce a small mercenary force.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/25">We must ensure that the new infantry TA battalions linked directly to their equivalent regular regiments work well in the integration process, but we must fully involve the local communities upon which they rely for recruitment. Sometimes those developments, which are part of the plan for the future Army structure, overlook the small details that create good morale and good working relationships. If recruitment can be maintained only by a massive level of funding and it falls when the foot is taken off the accelerator, we have to ask what is wrong with the conditions of service&mdash;the cause of the recruitment and retention problem. We know that there is a manning crisis because units go into deployment undermanned. Are falling numbers a direct result of long deployments? If the TA is continually expected to fill the gap, we should ask why people are not attracted to recruitment into the regulars. The differentials between pay and conditions play a part in that.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/26">The TA is no longer seen as the reserve force to be called up in an emergency, but as a continual front-line force instead. However, whatever civilian skills the TA can bring to the Army, it is not the equivalent of the regulars. Its officers do not have the same in-depth training and experience, and it is a tragedy that so many Sandhurst TA places remain unfilled each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/27">Although the TA does an excellent job, it should never be expected to be equal to the regulars. Instead, it should be considered a very capable back-up, trained to the highest degree, bearing in mind the limitations in the hours of service volunteered. When the TA is on deployment, including on second or further deployments, those involved are paid their equivalent civilian wage or salary, which is often far in excess of that of equivalent ranks in the regular forces. It has been drawn to my attention that some TA personnel working alongside regulars have bragged about the differentials in pay rates and remuneration. It has even been alleged that they have rigged their civilian wages in order to get higher pay, and a recent example of this happening in Belize was pointed out to me. I am sure that that situation could be checked out through cross-referencing with the Inland Revenue, but the point is that care should be taken when dealing with soldiers on two different pay scales&mdash;without which, I hasten to add, there would be no volunteers or recruits. The regulars should be informed about the pay procedures of the TA, and those in the TA should be briefed not to damage morale on deployment by flaunting superior pay rates.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/28">The continuing problem of overstretch has been raised many times in debates and it is one of the reasons why the TA is in such demand. Understandably, regulars like to be deployed where there are varied tasks, which is one of the reasons why they signed up in the first place. I suspect that some of the more boring operational requirements are down to NATO and European Union commitments. I understand that the Gurkhas, who were recently in Bosnia, were deployed to check on illegal logging and undertook patrols without arms, which seems to me to be quite extraordinary for an infantry regiment. At present, the TA in some regiments is being deployed to a far greater extent than its regular cousins, which is another factor that can cause friction and which needs to be monitored.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/29">I cannot stress enough the importance of good morale to the retention of our armed services personnel, who are undoubtedly respected and admired by the British people. With numbers in the regular forces shrinking, the TA is carrying out a greater variety of roles today, although numbers available for deployment are decreasing, as the Minister knows. With so much change taking place, the impetus is to consider the big picture, but it is important not to overlook the small details that, if forgotten, can quickly damage morale.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/30">There are many serving in the Army today who feel resentful because their cap badges have been taken away&mdash;although obviously not from those in the Scottish regiments&mdash;and they have been forced into different regiments or re-roled into different functions. Will the Minister respond today to the written question I tabled in November 2004 about the progress of the re-roleing of the three regular infantry regiments that were being disbanded? The same situation is now occurring in the TA infantry.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/31">One of the purposes of this debate is to emphasise that armed services personnel are people who, in this day and age, are not compelled to do what they do on behalf of us all. They should not just be pushed around. They need to have a strong inner conviction to be able to serve and they need to know what this country stands for and what it expects of them. We are immensely proud of their achievements, but it has to be recognised that when an army is downsized it is difficult to manage that downward spiral and it is essential that morale is maintained, often by attending to the small details that can make such a difference. We must listen to those who serve at the base of the military pyramid, and I hope that the debate will highlight some of the issues that most concern them.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/32">We live in times of great political and military change, do we not? The Government are walking a tightrope with a huge future financial and technical commitment to the field of defence. The whole package has to be delivered if it is to be successful. As financial constraints kick in, as they surely will, the choice will be between cutting the number of personnel, obtaining new, up-to-date and expensive equipment, or pushing back further the dates of implementation. Quite honestly, it is a frightening scenario for the Government who will be in office between 2010 and 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/33">Although no one will admit it, I believe that the UK is heading quietly and stealthily towards participation in a fully integrated European Union force. The Minister will, however, be relieved to learn that that is not a subject to pursue this morning, although I intend to return to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/34">I shall listen with great interest to the Minister's contribution and to others who catch your eye, Mrs Dean. I am grateful to the Minister for listening so carefully to what I have had to say.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> on securing this debate. Having served with the infantry in the Guards and, during the latter part of my military career, in the Royal Army Medical Corps, I wish to discuss the two key areas highlighted by my hon. Friend as being severely overstretched.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/2">The integration of the Territorial Army with the regular forces has changed beyond belief in the past 20 years. In the 1970s when I served with the infantry in the Guards, the TA was, to be frank, a laughing stock among the regular forces. The two never worked together or integrated, and they rarely trained together, apart from an annual two-week exercise in Germany&mdash;and we usually ran out of fuel, bullets and everything else, because we were so badly funded.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/3">I congratulate the Government, because in the past 10 years, the integration and training of the TA have worked fantastically. Thank goodness they have. The armed forces are now so small that without the TA&mdash;which comprises civilians who, as my hon. Friend said, work with the armed forces&mdash;how would the infantry and the Royal Army Medical Corps cope when serving this country so brilliantly throughout the world?</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/4">I have two concerns about the way in which the Government propose to deal with the cuts in the TA, and they are cuts; there is no argument about what is happening. We can put as much spin on it as we like, but they are cuts, especially to the infantry and to the medical corps.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/5">First, I fear that we shall use and abuse the TA even more. I have raised that issue many times with the Secretary of State and the Minister on the Floor of the House. There is no shortage of volunteers, but each time they are the same volunteers&mdash;guys and girls&mdash;who are keen to serve their country and gain experience. They are not the people who are leaving in their droves. In my constituency, TA recruitment is suffering. One reason is that TA centres locally have been closed and there is a huge distance to travel between centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/6">Another reason is the pressure on married serving TA members as well as regulars. People want to be with their families, and such people tend to have the experience in that they have served in the armed forces and now serve with the TA. They want to serve and to be deployed but they do not want to go back time and again. The people who tend to volunteer time and again are single and without the experience and training that are desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/7">By deploying so often, there is a massive problem with training. One reason why there are so many problems with the bounty is that people can be deployed with the TA to Iraq, but when they return, they are not guaranteed the bounty, because they have not done the training. At first, I thought that that was wrong, but the jobs that TA members undertake on deployment do not form part of the training needed for deployment elsewhere. TA members undertake not only long deployments, but further training on their return. That puts even more pressure on their relationships, job prospects and careers. That is why so many people are leaving.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/8">I am not surprised that the Government have not answered the questions tabled by my hon. Friend, because I think that they are embarrassed about the problems with recruitment and retention levels in the armed forces as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/9">For my sins, I am taking part in the armed forces parliamentary scheme this year by serving with the Army. I know that I am getting a bit long in the tooth to be wearing uniform, but having been around some units, I have been shocked at the age of some of our NCOs and their lack of experience. Everybody needs to be made up and given responsibility. I was lucky: I joined the Army as a junior guardsman and just about made guardsman, so I have no experience of promotion in the armed forces. However, the people who commanded tended quite rightly to have the experience and, within the regiment or battalion, the necessary kudos to lead. I have been to Iraq twice and seen the training regiments and some of the people who are training our armed forces. They are very young and they have limited experience, partly because we are losing so many experienced people.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/10">My second concern is about pay and morale. My hon. Friend highlighted an interesting point when she said that there are two types of unit: those made up of regular soldiers, whose pay is better than it was when I served, although we would all accept that it is still not great; and, often embedded with the regulars, those made up of the TA personnel who match their civilian salary.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/11">There is a third category, however, about which I was surprised to learn. I have raised this matter before with the Secretary of State and the Minister. Agency staff are brought in to supplement units in Iraq, especially the Royal Army Medical Corps field ambulance units. The regulars are on their set pay, the TA units are on theirs, and then agency staff are brought in to fill the gaps in the TA medical units. When I was in al-Amara in Iraq just before the election, I witnessed that situation and its damaging effect on morale within the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/12">I compliment the bravery of agency people who have gone in to such environments as untrained civilians. However, the effect on the morale of the armed forces is phenomenal. Without high morale, we do not have armed forces. We cannot deploy them throughout the world and ask them to do what we ask, week in, week out, if morale is low. Morale is low in certain parts of the Army, and particularly in the infantry, partly because of the reorganisation and abolition of regiments, and partly because of the sheer size of the deployment. That issue must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/13">I cannot see that the shortfall in the Royal Army Medical Corps will be addressed by cutting back the TA medical services. It seems illogical. If the Government have admitted defeat in their attempts to recruit people to the medical services, perhaps we need to consider how other countries have recruited successfully. The Americans have an excellent system. Their medical services are some of the best in the world, because they encourage people to undertake commitments as part of their civilian and military career structure. If one moves on in the US civil guard medical services, one moves on in one's civilian career. It is a twin-track approach, and perhaps it is something that we need to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.28.0/14">We have a fantastic Territorial Army. Without it, we should never have been able to do any of the things that we have done in the past 20 years throughout the world, from the Falklands, through the two Gulf wars, to Afghanistan and so on. We must not use and abuse TA personnel. We must not assume that those people will volunteer every single time. They are young and enthusiastic, but sometimes common sense must prevail. I hope that we can consider that issue, and I look forward to the Minister's answers to the debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.30.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the research that she has put into preparing her speech. I congratulate also <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase>, because he brought to the debate not only a sense of what is happening today, through his participation in the parliamentary armed forces scheme, but his experience as a soldier in times past. The most important aspect of his contribution was his reference to the way in which the Territorial Army has changed in the past 20 years. The change is positive rather than negative, because it used to be said unfairly of the TA that its members were the SAS&mdash;the Saturday and Sunday soldiers. If it were ever true, and I doubt that it was, it is certainly not true today. I place on record my appreciation of all the reserve forces and, as it is the subject of today's debate, the TA in particular.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.30.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" speakername="Ann Winterton" colnum="30"  time="011:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.30.1/1">I welcome what the hon. Gentleman said about the professionalism of our TA and reserve forces. However, would he not agree that we have perhaps been over-reliant on them? In the future, that subject must be addressed by the Government of the day or else we will not be able to deploy the troops that we need for the roles that we undertake throughout the world.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.30.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="30"  time="011:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.30.2/1">I was going to come on to that, but the hon. Lady has made the point well in both her speech and her intervention that we must not become over-reliant on our reserve forces, the Territorial Army. The situation has changed. The reference to it being used as an infill to perform all the duties of the regular forces should be taken as a compliment rather than a criticism. That is exactly as it should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.2/2">I was a member of the Armed Forces Bill Committee, and we visited Iraq only a month or so ago. Some time into a conversation with a group of four young soldiers, we realised that they were from the Territorial Army. Indeed, their immediate officer was a university student who was taking a year out. Spending two back-to-back tours in Iraq must be the most interesting gap year experience ever. We were so proud of and impressed by those young men, who were serving their country. They had been called up, but it was clear that they had volunteered for that. There is a system in the Territorial Army, which we need not go into, whereby its members are not necessarily pressed into service in Iraq but they let it be known that they are content to be called up.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.2/3">Yes, the Territorial Army should be rebalanced, and its role is changing, but we should be proud of the fact that its soldiers are performing duties along with the regulars. However, I take on board the point that we should not become over-reliant on them. The Government need to address the point that both our regular and reserve forces must be of a size sufficient to deal with the commitment that the Government of the day wish them to perform.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.2/4">Not for the first time, the Minister will have heard the phrase &quot;under-strength and over-stretched&quot;. That is certainly the case for the regulars and, in many cases, it could also be said of the TA. Many of those young men and women&mdash;I want to stress the increasing numbers of young ladies in the regular forces and the Territorials&mdash;provide a large part of that strength in Iraq or wherever they are asked to serve. Without them, we would be in even more of a difficult state. We should also place on record our appreciation of the increasing number of young ladies in the forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.2/5">The footprint of an Army presence in the United Kingdom is important. I can say that with some degree of detachment, because I represent one of the four super-garrisons and the Army is there from day to day. Not only do we have a strong TA unit, the Royal Signals, but the rebalancing means that Colchester will get two more TA detachments, one at the military corrective training centre and the other for medics. I take on board the hon. Lady's point and ask the Government seriously to consider the matter. The footprint of TA bases, as well as Navy and Air Force bases where relevant, is for many people the only visible presence of the Army in the United Kingdom. That is an important part of recruitment into the regulars as well as the TA, and can be a route into the forces in the same way as the Army cadets.</p>
	<p pid="b.30.2/6">I was also impressed in Iraq with the brigade commander in Basra, who told us that he had written personally to the employer of every TA soldier who he had serving to thank them and inform them of the excellent job that their employee or employees were doing. I know that the Government, and previous Governments, have shown appreciation to employers. Perhaps we should collectively do more. Many employers take the view that having one or more of their staff serving in the reserve forces is of benefit to their company, because of the managerial skills, team leadership and participation required. The employer also benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.31.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The point that I sought to make, which is important and valid, was that medium to large companies&mdash;certainly big companies&mdash;can afford to have one of their key personnel away for lengths of time because they can cover what that person does. However, it is a tremendous loss to smaller businesses, especially if the person goes on a second deployment fairly quickly. In such cases, it is absolutely critical. I commend the commanding officer who wrote to the employers. That is an instance of the small detail that is extremely welcome.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.0/1">Obviously, the smaller the firm, the greater the impact will be if a member of staff is deployed, or is not at work for whatever reason. Members of the House have, of course, been called up to serve in Iraq. Far be it from me to say whether the House suffered from their absence, but it is fair to say that the House is the richer for those hon. Members, on their return, informing us of their experiences. That is something that we should also show appreciation of.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/2">It has been said that the establishment figure for the Territorial Army is 42,000. It is not unreasonable for the Government to say what the shortage is, if any, within that 42,000 establishment. It should not be too difficult for the Ministry of Defence to ascertain the number of recruits, the number of people who leave, the length of time that recruits stay in the Territorial Army and their reasons for departure. I assume that, as a good employer, albeit of a volunteer force, the Government and the Ministry of Defence would seek to establish such figures so that they could learn why there are shortfalls and why recruitment is not going as well as it might, as well as what can be done to encourage retention. The same questions also need to be addressed for the regular Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/3">I ask the Government to up the praise of the Territorial Army. I am sure that they praise it at every opportunity, but sometimes one has to keep saying it so that people appreciate it. Employers need to be encouraged and be shown the appreciation of the nation for allowing members of their work force to be called up. The Government also need to look seriously at whether they expect too much of our reserve forces. I know that the young people we met in Iraq were keen volunteers, but I question whether, if they are asked to return there next year or the year after, that enthusiasm will wane. That also goes for members of the regular Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.0/4">Ministers need to ask whether they have cut the regular Army too much, whether the rebalancing and reconfiguration of the Territorial Army has struck the right balance, and whether there is a case to encourage the voluntary ethos by seeking to retain as many TA centres across the country as possible. Indeed, they should consider population shifts to see whether there are some places where the establishment of a new TA centre might be in everybody's best interests.</p>

	<p pid="b.32.1/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> for securing this worthwhile debate. I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> for bringing to the House his experience both on the ground and as a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme. Finally, I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> for bringing to the debate his knowledge as a constituency Member for a garrison town&mdash;one that will be more prominent with Territorial Army personnel&mdash;and his interest in the subject generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/2">One of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton ably made related to the change that the Government have brought about in the role of the Territorial Army, which they have moved from being a reserve to being a much more regularly mobilised force. That has some advantages, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead drew attention to the training and the better integration between the reserve and regular forces. Those developments are welcome, but there is concern that the Army is being asked to do more and more with less and less, as full-time regular forces are reduced, and that the reserves are taking some of the strain.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/3">The recent National Audit Office report on the reserve forces said:</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/4" class="indent">&quot;In the future, the Territorial Army will primarily be used to augment the Regular Army for a large-scale operation. For smaller operations, the Department is planning on the basis that a fully-manned, restructured Regular Army should be able to provide most of the necessary capability on its own, supplemented by a small number of specialist Territorial Army units. The Territorial Army will continue to be mobilised for small and medium-scale operations, including enduring operations&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/5">this is the key point&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/6" class="indent">&quot;when Defence Planning Assumptions are exceeded, as they are at present.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/7">One risk highlighted by the National Audit Office is that exceeding defence planning assumptions for the foreseeable future might put too much of a burden on the reserve forces, and those assumptions have been exceeded in every year but one since 1999. Given the state of the world, with the continuing challenges that we face in Afghanistan and Iraq&mdash;who knows what might happen there?&mdash;and the pressures on humanitarian forces in Africa, our defence planning assumptions are likely to be exceeded, thus putting pressure on our regular and reserve forces. The time might have come for the Ministry of Defence to revisit those assumptions and reset them for the world in which we live.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/8">The National Audit Office report highlighted one further risk, which is worthy of comment from the Minister. It relates to the effect that the regular deployment of reserve forces has on the number of forces available for deployment. If the Ministry wants to keep to its guidelines and deploy such forces only once every five years, it must realise that the more we deploy reserves on operations other than big war-fighting operations, the fewer will be available to be deployed. If we also take into account the fact that new reserve forces are not yet trained, we see that a shrinking percentage of the available forces is available for deployment. If we needed reserve forces for a war-fighting operation or a civil contingency, they might simply not be there, or the Ministry might have to resort to the legal position under which it can call such forces out once every three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/9">Let me touch on the civil contingency aspect of the reserve forces. The new chapter of the strategic defence review, which was written post-9/11, stated that the reserve forces would be part of the civil contingency reaction forces if something happened at home. Sadly, as we know from the events of last year, such things do happen at home and need to be responded to. In 2001, the then Secretary of State for Defence, who is now Leader of the House, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The role of the Reserves could be crucial, as we do not want to be committing significant numbers of our Regular Forces that might be required overseas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/11">In other words, regular forces might be required for overseas operations, as they have been, and the reserves would have a significant role to play in being available for reaction forces at home.</p>
	<p pid="b.32.1/12">As to the resources that that might require, the new chapter of the SDR states that a reaction force would, on average, contain 500 volunteer reserves in each region. In principle, that would give about 6,000 volunteer reserves nationwide. As my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton said when she discussed the actual and paper numbers available, those 6,000 reserves represent half the Territorial Army strength available for deployment. I have significant concerns that if, God forbid, something happened in the United Kingdom requiring those reaction forces to be called out in significant numbers, we simply would not have the numbers available to react, which would leave us significantly weakened at home. It would be helpful if the Minister said how many members of the Territorial Army have volunteered for civil contingency reaction duties as part of their Territorial Army role, because they regularly have to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.0/1">Does my hon.

Indeed, although I highlighted the difficulties, that policy is working well, but does this change not go against what is being undertaken?</p>

	<p pid="b.34.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. There is a balance to be struck in these things. My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead made some good points about the advantages of better training and better integration between the reserves and the regular forces. Indeed, as the hon. Member for Colchester said, the Territorial Army has played a critical role in supporting our regular forces on deployments overseas. However, we can have too much of a good thing and take such deployments too far, and if we do, we miss out on the benefit of having reserve forces. There is supposed to be something in reserve to cope with unexpected situations; indeed, a key issue in defence is that threats often come from unexpected quarters, and few people would have predicted some of the challenges that we now face.</p>

	<p pid="b.34.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the Territorial Army still operates as a stand-alone unit and that it integrates only when it is called up? For example, the young soldiers whom I mentioned are all members of the West Midlands Regiment. They operate as a self-contained Territorial Army regiment in this country and join and integrate into the Regular Army only when they are called up or volunteer. Are those not already stand-alone units, which integrate as the circumstances require?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.34.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="34"  time="011:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.34.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. The point that I was making is about the availability of forces&mdash;although it might be obviated somewhat by the extent to which members of the reserve forces volunteer&mdash;and the data in the National Audit Office report. Given the number of reserves being used on operations, the turnover among such forces, which I shall discuss in a minute, and the number of those who are not yet trained, the strength of the Territorial Army is little more than 30,000, and only about a third of that number are available for deployment. If we keep deploying reserve forces regularly on operations, we may be lucky, and members of the Territorial Army might volunteer for further operations, but, legally, the Government will not be able to call them up. That might leave us short of resources if we needed them in an emergency.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.3/2">A second, related point involves the personal pressure that we put on those in the reserve forces and on their employers. If we regularly use reserves for operations and then need them for something unexpected, we will put a considerable burden on them and their employers, which might have an impact on the time that some are willing to serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.3/3">I turn to the motivation of those who serve in the Territorial Army. Like those who have spoken so far, I am proud of the role that the Territorial Army plays and of its professionalism. The fact that people who are in the reserves, and are not therefore full-time soldiers, can go on operational deployment and be indistinguishable from their full-time colleagues is a tribute to those involved, to the training that they receive and to the armed forces generally. However, there is one issue that we must consider. If we increase pressures on them&mdash;one reason cited by those leaving the Territorial Army is its effect on their relationships and personal life, as well as the lack of support that they receive&mdash;we will risk increasing the rate at which people leave. That is the conclusion of the National Audit Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.3/4">The Government, in their report &quot;Operations in Iraq: Lessons for the Future&quot;, note that the risk of using reserves solely to plug shortfalls will increasingly affect recruitment. The annual outflow of personnel from the Territorial Army is about 10,000 a year, or a third of the force. That has two impacts. First, we are losing all the skills and training that were so hard won, which will have to be regained at a cost in time and money. Secondly, even if the numbers on board remain the same, the high turnover will reduce the number of deployable people. Although there will be an inflow of new volunteers, the fact that those troops cannot be deployed until they are properly trained reduces by a significant margin the number available for deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.3/5">As my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton said, if we put the Territorial Army under too much pressure, we will increase the rate of departure, increase training needs and reduce the number available for deployment. We return to the central problem that the Territorial Army is being asked to do more than it can with current manning levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.34.3/6">I turn next to medics. The subject has already been drawn to our attention by my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead, who served in the Army medical corps.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.1/1">I apologise to my hon. Friend. The subject was drawn to our attention also in a recent statement by the Minister of State on Territorial Army rebalancing. The volunteer reserves, especially the Territorial Army, have been used to supply the Regular Army with a significant number of specialists, particularly medics. The specialist Territorial Army units, such as Army Medical Services, have a shortfall of more than 40 per cent., which was drawn to our attention by the National Audit Office report. Reserves will continue to be crucial in providing deployed medical capability, and we see how valuable they are when we realise that 88 medical specialists were deployed more than once in the past five years. That demonstrates our need for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/2">The problem is that there are significant pinch-points with medical personnel. Indeed, the requirement for medical consultants is stated to be 110, but manning can be as low as 10. In a statement on Territorial Army rebalancing, the Minister of State said:</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/3" class="indent">&quot;As fewer volunteers will be required as signallers, logisticians and combat medical staff, there will also be reductions in a number of other arms and services.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-03-23.427"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 March 2006; Vol. 444, c. 427&ndash;28</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/4">That did not seem to stack up with the shortage of medical personnel. Indeed, the Minister of State was pressed on that point by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> and by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase>, but he did not satisfactorily answer them. He said that one difficulty in recruiting medical personnel for regular and reserve forces is increased recruitment to the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/5">This is not banter, but a serious question: given the changes in the health service and the consequent redeployment of personnel and resources, would it not be sensible for the Ministry of Defence to consider whether some of those being let go from the NHS would like a role in the armed forces&mdash;or, if they are changing career, whether they would be interested in joining the Territorial Army?</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead made a very good point about integrating career structures. Medical personnel in the United States are employed in the private sector, but they can better integrate their career progression in the private sector with being in the armed forces; that gives the forces better retention. In this country, where medical personnel are employed primarily by the NHS, joined-up government would mean that we could much better integrate career progression in the NHS and in the armed forces, and thus enable more of our medics to serve in our reserve forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/7">I return to what I said at the start. It is clear why we use the reserves. It is probably good that people should join the Territorial Army in the expectation that they will be mobilised at least once, and it is right that we should use the Territorial Army to support our regular forces. However, a balance has to be struck. If we push that balance too far and put too much pressure on the Territorial Army, it will not be able to support our armed forces and we will not be able to use it at home.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/8">I conclude on that note. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Congleton for initiating the debate and look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say in response to the wide-ranging questions that have been asked.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.0/1">As this is the first opportunity that a Defence Minister has had to appear before the House since the break, I hope that you, Mr. Caton, will think it appropriate for me to pay tribute to Lieutenant Richard Palmer of the Royal Scots Guards, who was killed in Iraq on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-15">15 April</phrase>. I am sure that all who have read the comments in the press over the past few days will know that this young man was committed to his job. He was greatly loved by his family and he will be sorely missed. I am sure that our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family at this time. I doubt whether any of the 600-odd Members of Parliament could think of a better epitaph than the one that appeared in the <i>Daily Express</i> today, which said that this young man was trying to make lives better for others. He demonstrated a hugely moral and wonderful commitment. I have no doubt that his loss will be greatly felt by his family and his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/2">I take the opportunity to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> on securing this debate. I am in regular correspondence with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> on the Armed Forces Bill; indeed, when we have finished with that Bill, there will be a huge gap in his life and mine. If the day comes when the hon. Lady stops sending me questions about reservists, there will be a similar gap in our lives. She is certainly assiduous in pursuing such matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/3">I have no doubt that the hon. Lady understands the nature of the changes to the Territorial Army that my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, who is responsible for the armed forces, referred to in his statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>. I apologise again for his absence; he is abroad at present. The changes that he spoke of are essential to maintaining a British Army that works as well in this century as it did in the previous one.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/4">The job that our soldiers do today is every bit as important as the job that their predecessors did during the first and second world wars. However, the challenges that they face are, as we all know, very different. Today's soldier must not only engage in combat, but must play the part of peacekeeper and sometimes peace enforcer. The modern British soldier may be fighting to overthrow a dictator one day, keeping peace the next, and rebuilding schools, bridges or power stations the day after. Those are all potentially hostile environments, and they often work under the auspices of different organisations such as NATO or the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/5">A British soldier's job is not easy. He or she must be capable of changing not only what they do but the way in which they react to particular situations. They are dedicated, brave and committed men and women, and I have no doubt that all hon. Members are justly proud of their commitment and service. This constantly developing role, which reflects not only the changing nature of warfare but the changing world in which we live, demands British forces who are even more responsive and effective while maintaining their reputation for professionalism and fairness&mdash;points made earlier in the debate. That is why changes are being made to the Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/6">Today's debate is about the Territorial Army, but I emphasise that the TA is an integral part of the British Army, part of the &quot;one Army&quot; concept to which most hon. Members referred. The Territorial Army was set up almost 100 years ago. Since then, TA volunteers have time and again proved their mettle and their worth, from the battlefields of the first and second world wars to Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. Indeed, the Chief of the General Staff, General Sir Mike Jackson, said that our forces are busy&mdash;they all are&mdash;but that our commitments are not unmanageable. He said that</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the Reserves have always delivered everything we have asked of them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/8">He said that he was confident that they would continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/9">It is fair to say that there are few places in which the British Army has operated in the past decades where it has not had some TA colleagues alongside. The House does not need to be reminded that they are volunteers&mdash;a point made by Opposition Members&mdash;who give up their time for small reward to serve their country. They are serving right now, in the UK and around the world. Although they are called upon to serve less often than their regular counterparts, in some ways, the job is even more difficult&mdash;as colleagues fully understand. When they are deployed, they must be as professional and well disciplined as their regular counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/10">Last year, the Government announced changes to the Regular Army that will help to prepare us for new challenges. We live in a world in which challenges to democracy, fundamental rights and freedoms, and the rule of law are more prevalent than ever. We cannot choose to ignore those global challenges in a global world. They require a different British Army to deal with them. The Regular Army is now far enough down the road of those changes for us confidently to say that we must now tackle the shaping of the Territorial Army in order that it can best support and be integrated with the Regular Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/11">We are confident that we have found the right solutions not just because we have carefully analysed our future defence needs, but because we have consulted widely with members of the Territorial Army and others. My right hon. Friend the Minister of State paid tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> in the debate on the Floor of the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>, when he said that he had had a good meeting with the hon. Gentleman and that he was grateful to him for asking a range of questions that he put to his officials, thus helping him to be better informed when taking ministerial decisions. We have consulted on the need to adjust for the future and the manner of that adjustment. Only after careful consideration of all the relevant factors did we come to the right solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/12">I do not want to spend too much time repeating what my right hon. Friend told the House less than a month ago, because the details are well known to colleagues. The changes are good for the TA, the Army and Britain. As colleagues know, the size of the TA will remain unchanged, with a current liability of 38,500, excluding the 3,500 in the Officer Training Corps. We will, however, deploy our men and women and their equipment more effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.0/13">At this stage, I should make a point about the proportion of the TA that is currently deployable for operations. That issue was touched on by Opposition Members. There have been several reports of late about manning shortages in the TA, and I would like to provide some context, which might help colleagues. About 13,000 TA soldiers are classed as being available for deployment, whereas our current requirement is about 1,200 a year&mdash;about 10 per cent. of those available for deployment. A similar number are classed as being unavailable due to the Army's intention that soldiers should not be mobilised more than once every five years. If we were to work to the less rigid provisions of the Reserve Forces Act 1996, which states that TA soldiers may not be mobilised more than once every three years, the number of soldiers available for mobilisation would be about 17,000. I accept the points made by the hon. Members for Congleton and for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning) about the numbers available for deployment, but the current requirement is about 10 per cent. of the number who are available.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.0/1">The Minister is quite right, but the whole point of reserves is that they are available for unexpected situations. For example, when we were involved in the heaviest part of the Iraq conflict, more than 8,000 reservists were called out, which would be half the number available. There is supposed to be a large number of reservists available for deployment, but not necessarily used. It would be appalling if we were using the number who are available at all times. There is supposed to be a gap: it is an insurance policy against unexpected events.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. In a moment, I will respond to the hon. Lady's comments; she made an important point about morale. We must all be careful about what we say, although I do not suggest that anyone has said anything in this debate that would badly affect morale. There is sometimes a perception that the number of forces available is close to the numbers that we need at present; I was simply trying to get across the point that we currently need to deploy about 10 per cent. of the force that is available, and that the situation does not merit the extreme concern that some people have expressed in the media.</p>

	<p pid="b.40.0/1">I have made a note of the hon. Lady's questions, and will, if she will permit me, come to them when I respond to her remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/2">New specialisations are being created to reflect the changing demands placed on the Army as a whole. A new custodial capability will help to ensure that we continue to treat any prisoners we take with due respect and dignity. A new unit will be trained to support the Apache attack helicopter in the field, and a new military intelligence battalion will be formed to enable intelligence staff to focus more on specific areas of their specialisation. More opportunities are also being created through expansion in areas such as engineering and armour.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/3">All that means a Territorial Army that is structured to be more relevant across a full range of operational requirements. The Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Engineers, the Royal Military Police, the Intelligence Corps and the Army Air Corps will all increase in size, but in order to achieve those enhancements within the existing liability, reductions will have to be made elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/4">Let me stress that this is not simply a matter of balancing the books. If we had thought it necessary, we would have considered increasing the establishment of the Territorial Army, but it is not. We are aligning TA structures with those of the Regular Army so that the regulars have the support that they need when and where they need it. We are doing that by ensuring that the Territorials are available in the right numbers and with the right specialisations and the best and most appropriate training. We have reduced the infantry by one battalion, bringing the TA infantry structure into alignment with the Regular Army infantry structure, with most battalions adopting the new regimental names of their regular counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/5">As well as new units being created, some units will change roles&mdash;from infantry to engineers, for example&mdash;and others will change their specialism within their branch, such as a Royal Artillery air defence unit changing to the 105 mm light gun. A small number of small and poorly recruited units will disband completely. Three centres will lose their TA presence, but will remain open to accommodate their existing cadet detachments.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/6">Every soldier who finds himself or herself displaced by their unit being disbanded or re-roled will be offered a post in another unit as close as possible to their home or in a nationally recruited unit. However, I take the point that was raised by hon. Members that that there can be a problem with distance. I emphasise that no TA soldier's service will be compulsorily terminated as a result of the rebalancing exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.40.0/7">There will also be a reduction, on paper, in the size of Army Medical Services, which several colleagues mentioned in their speeches. The reduction must be understood in the wider context. First, changes to the regulars announced last year mean that regular medical units have about an extra 380 personnel, making them better structured and positioned to deal with operational demands. Secondly, for many years, the TA has had difficulty in recruiting the numbers of medical personnel required to fill all the established posts. As part of the integrated, &quot;one Army&quot; approach, we have chosen not to chase an impossible target by holding several hundred posts open with little chance of filling them. It is better to make expectations more realistic, but only after the enhancements to regular medical units announced by my right hon. Friend the Minister of State. That will not only enable better operational planning, but will allow us easily to increase the number of established posts in other specialisations with a greater chance of actually filling them.</p>

	<p pid="b.41.0/1">The Minister said that the number of medical personnel in the regular forces was being increased. In the Ministry of Defence's own annual report and accounts for 2004&ndash;05, the medical area was deemed to be one of critical shortage. We touched on that during the Minister of State's statement about TA rebalancing and did not get a satisfactory answer. Will the Under-Secretary be clear about the number of medical personnel required in both the regular forces and the reserves, and the number that we currently have available?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.41.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="41"  time="011:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h02.htm#60418h02_spnew21">
	<p pid="b.41.1/1">It might be helpful if we were a little more open in the way we tackle the recruitment issues. If I may, I shall refer to that later on, because it is important. We all have a role to play, because we all passionately believe in the success of our forces, and the TA in particular. Colleagues in all parts of the House could play a role that would be beneficial to our forces. I take on board the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/2">The changes to which I have referred not only enable better operational planning, but allow us easily to increase the number of established posts in other specialisations with a greater chance of actually filling them. The reality, therefore, is that while there is no reduction in the operational requirement for the TA medical services or in the numbers employed, enhancements are under way to the regular medical services.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/3">Earlier I mentioned that the TA faces a constant challenge in maintaining a level of training that enables it to operate effectively alongside its regular counterparts. That is why we must do our utmost to ensure that the training it receives makes the best use of the available time and other resources. Our aim is for TA soldiers, when mobilised, to be fully prepared for even the most difficult of environments. Rebalancing will pair TA units with regular counterparts, forming strong links between the units and, whenever possible, allowing TA soldiers to train alongside the regulars. Where limited, high-value equipment is involved, and if it is appropriate and realistic, regular units will make such equipment available for TA soldiers to train on. Such measures will enhance the training of TA soldiers. I assure colleagues that every TA soldier, whichever branch they are in, will be given the support and training needed so that he or she can continue to serve our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.41.1/4">Hon. Members will be aware that much has been said in recent months about the TA losing &quot;500 soldiers a month&quot; and about recruitment being in decline. While those figures concentrate only on the numbers leaving and make no mention of the numbers recruited, it is fair to say that recruitment and retention, to which the hon. Member for Congleton referred, have been giving us cause for concern. That impacts on the other issue that she mentioned: morale. TA strength has stabilised in recent months, but we are not out of the woods yet, and we remain committed to concentrating our efforts in order further to improve manning and retention in the TA.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.0/1">If we are losing soldiers and gaining recruits, we are not gaining the experience. It will take a long time to get the catch-up required for those troops to be operational to the standards of the ones lost. If they are deployed so often, how is the training being done? I have spoken to TA soldiers who have returned. When they come back, they need some rest and recuperation and some TLC from their loved ones. The last thing that they want to do then is to go off again to training. If people are coming in and coming back, there will be a shortfall in the trained operational troops who can go anywhere in the world. That is where I think the figure that was mentioned is coming from; the pinch point will be in the experienced soldiers, not in the new recruits.</p>

	<p pid="b.42.3/1">Currently, including our OTC, our establishment is about 42,000 and we are about 6,600 below that at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.3/2">Since the 1990s, when the TA moved away from its cold war role towards a more flexible, mobilisation culture, members of that historic service have been increasingly asked to serve our country overseas. They have come to expect to be mobilised and deployed on a range of operations in support of our defence policies overseas. Indeed, the most frequent reason for joining given by new recruits to the TA is to be mobilised and serve on operations. About 12,000 reserves have deployed in Iraq alone since 2003. They have adapted, in just a few years, to the changing and very demanding circumstances of this new century, and the House has frequently acknowledged their courage and service, as I do again today.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.3/3">Currently there are 495 Territorials serving in Iraq, 47 in Afghanistan, 23 in the Balkans and two in Sierra Leone. My right hon. Friend's announcement to the House last month on TA restructuring ensures that we give those brave men and women the training, opportunities and structures they need best to do their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.3/4">I will refer to some of the points made by colleagues during the debate. I return to three important words used at the beginning by the hon. Member for Congleton: &quot;recruitment&quot;, &quot;retention&quot; and &quot;morale&quot;. They are all linked. I have tried to demonstrate that we believe that recruitment and retention are vital and that failure in those areas can have an adverse impact on morale. I parted company with her when she said that she thought that the numbers were in terminal decline; I note that in the debate in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-17">17 November</phrase> she talked of &quot;meltdown&quot;. I do not agree that that is occurring. Following remarks that I shall make in a moment, I hope that she might be persuaded that it is not taking place.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.3/5">The hon. Lady went on to praise SaBRE&mdash;Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers. I have the highest regard for its work, which makes a considerable difference. It helps our reservists, and ensures that they can deploy when we need them. She also said that uncertainty is a bad thing, and I agree with that. There is no doubt that there are always lessons to be learned. Leaving people in a vacuum in which they are unsure where they will be and what will happen is bad for morale, and that affects recruitment and retention. We return to that important triangle.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.3/6">I shall examine the comments that the hon. Lady has made further when I get my copy of <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow. She has been properly persistent in asking questions. If she is willing and would like to come to the Department, perhaps I might arrange a briefing, during which we might get to the answers to some of the things that still concern her. I shall telephone her this afternoon on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.2/1">I should be grateful to receive the answers to those questions. I am not pestering the Minister. I believe, like he does, that the answers should be in the public domain.</p>

	<p pid="b.43.3/1">I accept that. I made the point earlier that being more transparent about these matters helps everyone to understand the difficulties that we face and allows people to contribute. They could put forward solutions that might help, just as the hon. Member for Canterbury did in his meeting with my right hon. Friend, the Minister of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.3/2">The hon. Member for Congleton asked which were the main areas of undermanning and the targets for recruitment. Medics, logistics and the Intelligence Corps are all areas where we have had difficulties and where we are seeking to put things right. She asked whether the Government have given up recruiting to establishment; we have not. As I said, we had the opportunity to change the establishment, but we did not feel it necessary at present. I have no doubt that more of these points will come out if she accepts my offer and comes to the MOD for a briefing.</p>
	<p pid="b.43.3/3">The hon. Lady also asked why we did not know the figures for the time between deployments. The information is not held, as the key figure is about the total service in any one period, in accordance with the Reserve Forces Act 1996. Again, I would be happy to explain that in more detail if she were to come to the Department. My doing so would give her a better understanding of the situation. She also asked why we did not know how many members of the TA have left following service in Iraq. That information is held at unit level, but we are considering conducting exit surveys, which are a useful way of getting this information, so that we can have a better picture of what influences people.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.1/1">We have extensive surveys about all aspects of the operation of our forces. The point I am making, in response to remarks by the hon. Lady, is that we are looking at exit surveys to try to get a better and more accurate understanding of this matter. We have a lot of anecdotal information, and other bits of information are fed in, but if we were specifically to target the group that causes concern&mdash;people who are leaving, for whatever reason, following deployment&mdash;that would give us the information we seek.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.5/1">Pained expressions are pained expressions, but we as a Government have a duty to be as open as possible about these matters. I strongly believe that&mdash;as, I know, does the Secretary of State. There are difficulties, which I have explained, but we will examine what we can do to ensure that this information can be provided to colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/2">The hon. Gentleman brought to his comments the experience of having served in the forces. He welcomed the integration of the TA with the Regular Army, and I thank him for that. However, he was concerned about the TA being deployed too often, and he talked about morale and issues to do with pay. I think I have answered some of his points, but I will look further into that when I refer to <i>Hansard</i> tomorrow, and if there is a need to respond in more detail, I will do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">The hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> can also speak with considerable authority because of his background: he represents a large garrison town, so he knows a lot about some of the key issues. He talked about the TA footprint being important in recruitment. I strongly agree; where we have that strong footprint, recruitment is good. That is clearly an important message for all of us to take on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/4">I also welcome what the hon. Gentleman said about the employers who support the TA. The hon. Lady also mentioned that. Without the support of many employers, it would be difficult for people who have a life outside the forces to give the commitment and service that we often ask of them. I wish to take this opportunity to pay particular tribute to His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, who last year held an event for employers at Highgrove. I met a number of employers there&mdash;not the large ones that we often think of, but those who employ two, three or four people, and who have somebody who is in the TA and on deployment. I understand the difficulties that they face as a result. They make a huge contribution by giving their support to our reserve forces. We cannot thank them enough for what they do.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> made some important points. He talked about our defence planning assumptions. They are, of course, kept under constant review. All Governments do that, and it is right and proper for them to do so. He also referred to the National Audit Office report on deployment. I tried to cover that when I explained that approximately 13,000 people in our force are available for deployment and our current need is about 1,200.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/6">The hon. Gentleman went on to talk about the close links between the MOD and the NHS. That is an important point that we need to explore. Those two organisations must be brought together even more closely, as there would be huge benefits in doing so. When I visited Selly Oak last year, I saw evidence of the benefits of the close collaboration between our Army Medical Services and the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/7">During the century of service that TA volunteers have given our country, they have proved their adaptability in meeting the requirements of national security in all its guises. They, like their regular colleagues, continue to be a force for good in dealing with the challenges of this new century, and they are a more integral part of our land forces than ever. They do a tremendous job for our country. We are hugely in their debt.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/8">I have no doubt that the comments made by all colleagues were intended to reinforce the understanding that we value, appreciate and cherish the work that they do, and the service and commitment they give. It is up to all of us&mdash;Government, Opposition and all Members&mdash;to do everything that we can to ensure that they know that they are valued, and to make sure they have all the resources and everything else they need to carry out the tasks we set them.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.5/9">From the tone of the debate, I have no doubt that there is a willingness on both sides of the House to ensure that our reserve forces know that they have the complete backing of Members, and that we will do everything we can to ensure that they continue to carry out their job effectively. I feel certain that that message will go back to our forces as a result of the comments made in this debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.1/1">My interest in this subject was prompted by a visit paid to my constituency office by a 74-year-old gentleman, Mr Tomlinson. Until having an accident recently, he worked as a lorry driver. He was productively employed, earning good money, not claiming benefit and working while claiming his pension. His visit led me to explore some issues around working after what we generally accept as retirement age.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/2">I want to touch on two general themes. The first is individual freedom&mdash;ensuring that people are genuinely free to choose for themselves whether to work after retirement age&mdash;and the second the economic functionality of encouraging people to work after 65. The Government will address the former in October, when they seek to implement the European Community directive on age discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/3">On current projections, a quarter of the population will be over 65 by 2051. Life expectancy continues to increase, as does active life span. We are not just living longer; we are living actively longer. Evidence suggests that continuing work, whether paid or voluntary, can assist in prolonging the health of an individual in retirement. In any case, many older people seek additional income to supplement what they receive in their retirement. It makes very little sense for a workplace to dispose of the valuable skills that many older people have. Research commissioned by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development showed that employers placed particular weight on the reliability, commitment and&mdash;importantly, nowadays&mdash;customer services skills of older people. Simply putting those people out to pasture, with a big sign on them saying &quot;Post-65&quot;, is a tremendous waste of economic skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/4">Furthermore, the choice to work on after retirement age has substantial economic impacts on our country. Mr. Tomlinson is a case in point: at 74, he was paying income tax and national insurance as a worker, but now&mdash;after being injured&mdash;he is receiving housing benefit and pension credit. From being a net contributor to our society in general, he has become a net drawer on it, although admittedly he has contributed substantially to his entitlement to that receipt.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/5">There are many obstacles to working beyond 65 being considered something that anyone can contemplate. I shall run through some and then attempt to deal with them. First, there is the issue of expectations. Surveys show that most people recognise that we are living longer, and are living actively longer. The difficulty is that they do not personalise that with regard to their behaviour and choices. Somehow, they do not believe that that will necessarily happen to them, although it might be happening to people they know. They feel that they are likely to face an earlier death and that they should prepare themselves for a quiet period of retirement after their working lives. That slightly gloomier view still seems prevalent.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/6">We can do more to make people understand that working beyond retirement age is likely to be an enduring opportunity. For example, my father is 81 and still does active voluntary work. He regards himself as someone who looks after older people, although they are actually a lot younger than he is. I see that as one model of retirement. He does not earn money from his work, but it is an important part of the social contribution that people can make.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/7">A second obstacle is that there is a good deal of rhetoric of the &quot;work 'til we drop&quot; kind, which is propagated by some newspapers. That was particularly the case when there was discussion about fixing a retirement age. The assumption is that Government policy is somehow forcing people into a position whereby they must work until they die and so will never claim retirement. I have to say that trade unions provided additional support for that view by highlighting the fact that some people die before they receive a pension. That is undoubtedly true. Nevertheless, the evidence is clear that there are people with valuable working skills who are available to work beyond that point in their lives, and who are willing to do so. I want to turn to some reasons why that does not necessarily happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/8">There is a belief that if we encourage people to work after 65, a requirement to do so will gradually be built into the rules of company pension schemes, and that, effectively, people will say, &quot;That's fine. We can expect people to work longer, which should mean that we save money on our pension schemes.&quot; My retort to that is that, in an increasingly informed society, a pension scheme is a valuable recruitment tool. Frankly, companies with pension schemes that sought to take advantage of those changes would place themselves at a disadvantage when putting forward their package of employment emoluments. I do not think that a likely response by companies to people working beyond retirement age, but nevertheless it is one argument that is presented as a possible barrier.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.1/9">The other obstacle, to which I shall return, is the lack of either fiscal or benefit encouragement to a work choice after 65. We can do more on that.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.0/1">I have a constituent who is 65 and due to be retired against his wishes this June. His pension goes on until he is 72. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that it is quite outrageous for us to remove people from the workplace, irrespective of their ability to do their job, purely because of their age? We would not remove them because of the colour of their hair or eyes, so why because of their age?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" speakername="Mark Todd" colnum="47"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h03.htm#60418h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.47.1/1">I shall cover that point, and the hon. Gentleman will find that I entirely agree with what he says.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/2">There is also the issue of companies compelling retirement at a particular age. In October, the Government are to take a step that I do not agree with, and there is evidence that some members of the Government do not agree with it either. There was a lively debate between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Work and Pensions on the correct approach to allowing employers to continue to enforce a retirement age of 65. That is still seen by some people as a barrier to continuing to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/3">Of course, there is also continuing prejudice against employing older workers. That has been shown to be declining, partly because the code of practice that the Government have promoted has been widely understood, although not widely enough, as only 37 per cent. of employers know that there is a proper code of practice for dealing with age discrimination. We have much ground to make up.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/4">Next, there are poor employment practices. Older workers are not given proper advice on the interface between retirement and future working, and there is a lack of promotion of part-time opportunities to older workers. That would allow them to move gradually from full-time employment to retirement, using their skills valuably&mdash;often as mentors or by providing their specialist skills in a narrower time frame.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/5">There is a great deal more to be done in terms of simply promoting better-quality employment practices among employers. Only 30 per cent. of employers offer employees part-time options in preparation for retirement, which is ridiculous. In the Norwich Union survey commissioned on the subject, 68 per cent. of respondents thought that they would move to part-time employment before retirement. However, 25 per cent. said that that would be determined by their behaviour at the time. The evidence is that if a relatively small number of employers offer that opportunity, many people who fully intend and wish to work part-time will not be given that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/6">Moving to my final point on this area of poor employment practice, there is very little monitoring of the age profile of employees. A major difficulty is the fact that employers do not properly understand their work forces. They are not able to analyse what proportion of their employees is coming towards retirement or to devise sensible policies to deal with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/7">Steps have already been taken. I have referred to the code of practice and its weakness; after three waves of promotion, still only a minority of employers know about the code and have acted on it. There is also the European Union age discrimination directive, which I have touched on and which the Government intend to implement this October.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/8">The directive has many welcome features&mdash;it will permit equal access to work-related benefits and employment protection for workers over 65&mdash;but it will still build in the potential for a review period in which employers can insist on retirement at 65 provided that, beforehand, they have given the relevant individual the opportunity to request part-time working. The employee would have the right only to make the request; the employer would have no obligation to provide such work. The individual could say, &quot;I would like to continue to work beyond 65. Are there opportunities for part-time work?&quot;, and the employer would have to consider that, but he could then say no and terminate the individual's employment without recourse to law.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/9">My view is that the Government have made the wrong choice. As the Turner commission felt, it would have been better to have fixed the retirement age higher than 65&mdash;perhaps at 70&mdash;or for there not to have been one at all. I think that there should be no retirement age and that employers should have adult discussions with employees about their capabilities and ability to perform duties at a particular age. They could then reach a normal decision that would be implemented through normal employment policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/10">If we are to facilitate working after what is now the normal retirement age, we must consider other measures. First, we can consider reducing or even eliminating employer national insurance for workers over 65. The evidence from surveys&mdash;the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development conducted a survey on this particular aspect&mdash;indicates that smaller employers in particular would find that useful. In fact, there was evidence that smaller employers particularly value older workers and would value direct encouragement to continue the employment, or to facilitate the new employment, of older people. Someone might apply for a new job after they were 65; they would not necessarily continue to work at the same place.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/11">The first step is to consider the burdens on employers. Secondly, the workers themselves should be given specific advantages if they continue to work after 65; such advantages could be linked to tax or national insurance and allow them to reduce the costs of their continuing to work. There are strong economic arguments for discriminating in favour of those over 65 who continue to work in some way or other. I am sure that the precise rules&mdash;the hours required and so on&mdash;could be given greater thought, but there is a strong argument for continuing to encourage older workers' economic contribution to our country. We should be prepared to make appropriate provision in our national insurance and tax policies to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/12">There might also be benefit in giving greater help to those who defer taking the state pension. At the moment, that appears to be a direct, pound-for-pound transaction. If a person puts off taking the state pension for a year, their pension for that year is paid later. The person does not lose the money, but does not gain by deferring. However, they should be able to gain. That would be worth while for our state revenues, let alone the circumstances of the individual involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/13">We need to examine the relationship between the state pension and other benefits. The fatal overlapping benefits rule means that once a person has drawn the state pension, they are not entitled to a variety of other benefits that are regarded as overlapping. I have always recognised that rule to be fair for some cases, but I have never fully understood its logic for many others, particularly when the relevant individual is involved in caring or something similar. The state pension is not a benefit, but an entitlement based on contributions made through national insurance during a person's working life. It should not be treated as another benefit, and a person should not be barred from other benefits because they receive a state pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/14">There should be direct assistance for training courses aimed at older workers. The Learning and Skills Council has rightly focused considerable resources on younger workers who have failed or been failed in their education and who, at the start of their working lives, require additional assistance to get qualifications. We should also aim to provide extra resources for older workers to do exactly the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/15">In future, healthy retirement will normally comprise a portfolio of activities to suit an individual's circumstances, including leisure and family commitments, which many older people have substantially as they enter retirement, as well as voluntary and paid activities. It is to society's benefit, as well as that of the individual, that that should be facilitated, and it should be an individual's free right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.50.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" speakername="Margaret Hodge" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform"  colnum="50"  time="012:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h03.htm#60418h03_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.50.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" name="Mark Todd">the Member for South Derbyshire (Mr. Todd)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his thoughtful contribution on what I consider a subject of key public policy importance on which we shall spend more time in the coming period.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/2">My hon. Friend is right to draw attention to the changing nature of the population. Many of our policies look at employment rates beyond the age of 50; at that age, men and women have life expectancies of more than 33 years and more than 36 years respectively. One can pull out very stark statistics on this issue. The one I have chosen to mention is that by the late 2020s, almost half the adult population in the UK will be over 50.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/3">If we compare the employment rate of those over 50 with that of the general population of working age, we see a gap. Some 70.7 per cent. of people below state pension age but over 50 work, whereas just under 75 per cent. of the population as a whole work, so the gap is about 4 per cent. The other interesting thing is that most of those over 50 who are no longer in work did not volunteer to leave their jobs, yet once out of the labour market very few of them&mdash;only 8 per cent.&mdash;try to get a job again. There is genuinely an issue here, and my hon. Friend is right to draw attention to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/4">Many of the issues that we are dealing with today come from the legacy that we inherited, and the most rapid decline in the employment of older men in particular came after 1979. That was due partly to the structural change and the decline of heavy industries, but also to the fact that company policies, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> drew our attention, were pretty rigorous in using the pretext of age to reduce work forces. The stewardship of the economy meant that there were not as many job opportunities as we enjoy today.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/5">Progress has been made since 1997, when the Labour party came to power. In 1979, the employment rate among those aged 50-plus was 72.4 per cent., but by 1994 it had gone down to 62.6 per cent. We have returned the figure to just over 70 per cent. Not surprisingly, the employment rate for women has also increased. It was at its lowest in 1984&mdash;54.7 per cent.&mdash;but at 68.4 per cent., it is now almost equal to that for men.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/6">Our record of using the instruments of public policy to encourage the employment of older people is good and has been recognised as such by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&mdash;we are about 10th out of the 30 OECD countries&mdash;and by the European Union. In relation to our European partners, we are second in respect of the employment rate for the over-50s. The unemployment rate for older people is now lower than that for other groups. If older people choose to stay active in the labour market, they are more likely to be in work than the rest of the working-age population. That is another interesting fact to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/7">Since we have been in government, we have brought more than 1 million extra people aged 50 or over into work. Of course, we want to go further and tackle many issues to which my hon. Friend the Member for South Derbyshire alluded, but we are proud of our record. We have reduced the gap in employment rates between the over-50s and the under-50s by about 20 per cent. Again, we are proud of that. It is interesting to see where the over-50s work: about a quarter are self-employed&mdash;there is a greater propensity to self-employment among the over-50s&mdash;and 70 per cent. work part-time. My hon. Friend might not know that figure, but there is a lot of part-time working by older people.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/8">There are problems that we need to tackle and there are structural questions. We need to think about whether we have the structure of the tax and benefits system right and whether we have the right rules on pension schemes. We have done a lot, but we need to do more. There are personal issues for people that we need to confront. Older people tend to be the ones who have issues relating to health and disability. Many of our welfare reform Green Paper proposals focus on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/9">My hon. Friend drew attention to the lack of flexible working. The Green Paper also contains proposals on that. We are attempting to tackle lower qualification levels among older people through many of the employment and training programmes that we have introduced. There are also cultural issues, as individuals might have unrealistic aspirations on early retirement and employers might have outdated prejudices on the capabilities of older people and their capability to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/10">I shall go through some of our plans and then briefly tackle the issues to which my hon. Friend alluded. We published our health, work and well-being strategy document about six months ago and it is very important. In it, we consider the links between the work undertaken by the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Health and Safety Executive, so that we ensure that people can get the benefits of work. I am talking about healthy workplaces and ensuring that efforts to secure early rehabilitation to keep people in their jobs or to bring them back into their jobs are co-ordinated across Government and all agencies that respond to individual needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/11">I have talked about the welfare reform agenda, whereby we are trying to ensure that proper support structures are in place so that we can provide opportunities for older workers to stay in or return to work. Once those support structures are in place, there will be a responsibility on individuals to take up the opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/12">I note that my hon. Friend does not think that the changes to the state pension go far enough, but there are now better financial incentives to defer taking the pension. I am referring to the rate of increment and the ability to access a lump sum, which is pretty generously calculated. It is set at 2 per cent. above the Bank of England interest rate and compound interest is built into the calculation.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/13">We have made an important alteration to private pension schemes so that people can take their pension and carry on working. We have introduced improvements to personal allowances for those over 65. The personal allowance for someone over 65 who is working is &pound;7,280 as compared with the general allowance of just over &pound;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/14">The welfare reform Green Paper contains a series of propositions, which we are taking forward. They involve giving older workers access to the new deals, piloting better one-to-one support for older workers and seeing whether we can take the introduction of flexible working further.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/15">We are also considering how we implement the age discrimination legislation. My hon. Friend talked about that for some time. The legislation has just passed through the processes of the House and will come into force in October. He is right to say that, under the legislation, there is a default retirement age of 65, although we have promised that we will review that, as the measure beds in, over five years. I tend to agree with him that if we can get rid of that default age, we will improve the ability of older people to participate in the labour market. However, I hope he accepts that as we try to transform cultural attitudes in our society towards the employment of older people, we should bring all the stakeholders with us. As we set the default retirement age, we were conscious of the concerns of business. There were fears among those in the business community that if there was no retirement age, they would find it difficult to manage their work force and ensure that younger people had the opportunity to develop in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/16">My hon. Friend talked about the lack of knowledge of and information about the changes that the Government are introducing. I have been engaged in a number of changes, particularly involving individual rights in respect of equality, and I know that it takes time for such changes to become known to employers. I am thinking particularly of the work that I have done on disability. Despite pretty extensive publicity, there was still some reluctance among employers to understand and take on board their responsibilities under disability discrimination legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/17">We probably face a similar situation with the issue that we are debating today, but 37 per cent. is not a bad knowledge base, given that we have some months to go before implementing the legislation. I hope that our &quot;Age Positive&quot; campaign and the &quot;Be Ready&quot; campaign, which we are running with our partners, will help to build understanding of the new legislation so that there is compliance when it comes into force in October.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/18">I agree with what my hon. Friend said about the advantages of older people staying in work. That is better for the individual in terms of their prosperity and status in society. There is also a growing body of evidence that work can benefit individuals' health and well-being and can prolong life rather than reduce life chances. He was also right to draw attention to the benefits to society&mdash;not only the gains from additional income, but those from less expenditure on benefits, health services, social services and social infrastructure to support individuals. There is also a loss of productivity to society if we do not take full advantage of the capabilities of older people.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/19">My hon. Friend talked about whether we should waive employer national insurance for those over 65. He will know that that recommendation emerged from the Turner commission. We are considering it and we will report on the way forward that we want to pursue, having considered the Turner review.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/20">My hon. Friend talked about whether we could go further on greater advantages to individuals through the tax and national insurance system. Again, we constantly review our position on that to see whether we can do more. He talked about greater help for those who defer taking the state pension. We have made huge progress in that regard, but I will take his views on board as we consider how we can better benefit from the undoubted huge strength that we have in older workers, whom we want to keep in work and contributing to the well-being of our society. We also want to ensure that they, too, feel that they make an individual contribution.</p>

	First World War Veteran (State Funeral)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.54.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" speakername="Iain Duncan Smith" colnum="54"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h04.htm#60418h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.54.1/1">I rise to open this short debate on the proposal that we grant a state funeral to the last surviving veteran of the first world war resident in the United Kingdom. Unusually for an Opposition politician, I begin by thanking the Minister for his remarkable co-operation, help and support, and also that of his officials, who have been incredibly co-operative and positive. I commend them for that, and I hope that the House will recognise the spirit in which the Government have approached the proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/2">This proposal originated with an approach some time ago from a constituent who was himself a veteran of the second world war. The idea was not unique to him&mdash;I believe that it had been around for a little while. He said that a state funeral would be a good idea and asked me why we could not do such a thing. I asked about the veterans of the second world war and so on. My father was one, and they all fought incredibly bravely. My constituent immediately said that the first world war was different, and that everyone who fought in the second world war recognised that. There was something peculiar about the conditions and nature of that conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/3">My constituent's proposal gave me food for thought, but the issue really came home to me when my wife and I were clearing out boxes of papers that, like other families, we had accumulated over the years. I found her on her knees, pulling papers out of a battered old briefcase. I was struck by the fact that she had been crying. I could not understand why, so I asked her, &quot;What is the problem?&quot; She had in her hands a series of letters from her great uncle, who had fought in the first world war. He was 17 years old when he left school. He was a scholarship student&mdash;a very bright man with a phenomenal future. He left school early and joined up in 1914. He was sent to the western front in 1915, and in the autumn of 1915 was wounded in action and died about a week and a half later of septicaemia, which is something that today we can cure with antibiotics.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/4">My wife said, &quot;This is our son.&quot; Our son was just turning 18, and I immediately imagined what it must have been like for mothers across the land who would have been staring at letters like those at that time. That brought the matter home to me in a way that normal discussions might not have done. For so many families, the tragedy was enormous. It covered income scales, family backgrounds and social positions. Men of different positions and backgrounds died in the same way, and their mothers and fathers wept for them in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/5">Therefore, I was enormously pleased that so many colleagues of all political parties, including those here today, supported my early-day motion, in which I proposed that we give a state funeral to the last surviving veteran of the first world war living in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/6">Why make the proposal? It is, of course, not just about an individual but about the representative of an entire generation. The caveat is that the individual concerned and their family must agree to the proposal beforehand. As the Minister knows from our discussions, the fall-back position is that there should be some form of commemoration if the family do not wish to have a state funeral. Ultimately, we will be guided by their sense of what would be right.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/7">I stress, however, that the priority position for me and many people to whom I have spoken about the matter is that we have a special occasion, and the most powerful way to commemorate it, even if it is not the only way, is through a state funeral. In the past, state funerals invariably have been granted only to members of the royal family or to those of the great and good, even if they were commoners, who rose in political or military terms. This state funeral would be unique: it would be for an ordinary person who had served their country, a representative of the peculiar generation that started a peculiar century&mdash;the 20th century, which was the century of the common man.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/8">The suffering and the casualty lists show why such commemoration is necessary. Perhaps I could remind the House of some of the staggering figures. The number of British and empire soldiers, sailors and airmen who were mobilised and who served was just under 9 million, of which just under 1 million died and 2 million were wounded. I should remind the House that the bodies of 500,000&mdash;half the total who died in service&mdash;were never found.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/9">Other aspects of the first world war that made it so peculiar were the nature and horror of it. Gassing occurred for the first time. Some 8,000 British and empire servicemen died directly and immediately as a result of gas attacks, but it is estimated&mdash;we will never know for sure&mdash;that some 200,000 of our servicemen suffered from wounds and long and lingering illness directly as a result of gassing, which did not happen in the second world war. Our servicemen were not alone: all around the world, the casualty lists were staggering.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/10">The conditions were breathtaking. To give an idea of what that sort of warfare was like, perhaps I could read a small section from John Keegan's excellent book on the first world war. He states:</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/11" class="indent">&quot;A young British officer, Gerald Brenan, crossing subsequently captured ground in the fourth week of July, found the bodies of soldiers wounded on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July</phrase> who had&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/12">as Mr. Brenan wrote&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/13" class="indent">&quot;'crawled into shell holes, wrapped their waterproof sheets round them, taken out their bibles and died like that'. They were among thousands whose bullet-riddled bodies gave up life that day&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/14">that was during the battle of the Somme&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/15" class="indent">&quot;or afterwards, beyond the reach of stretcher bearers or simply lost in the wilderness of no man's land. Even among those found and carried back, many died as they lay waiting for treatment outside the field hospitals, which were overwhelmed by the flood of cases.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/16">The conditions were peculiar, as was the nature of their service: that strange sense of duty and determination that carried them through such appalling conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/17">I have been most struck in the course of our debates and discussions by the attitudes of the young. I have received a flood of letters from people all over the country about this matter. I have been moved by many who have written to or contacted me or my office, but perhaps most moving has been the pile of letters from young people at school who, whether with their teachers or individually, have chosen to take up this subject and write about it. It has been heart warming to realise that they also understand the need to remember. I shall read short quotes from the letters of two young girls in year 9 at a school in Watford. The first one states that</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/18" class="indent">&quot;holding a state funeral for the last soldier . . . will bring back memories of all the soldiers and show all new generations how important those soldiers are to us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/19">Her classmate wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/20" class="indent">&quot;I also believe it would mark the end of a brave generation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/21">That generation included people such as my wife's great uncle, who wrote this about one small episode in the trenches on <phrase class="date" code="1915-06-02">2 June 1915</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/22" class="indent">&quot;You can best imagine the state of things here when I tell you that Capt. Webb and myself are left to man the company alone, while no. 9 and 10's fighting strength is reduced to 25 or 30 apiece.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/23">I remind the House that he was 17 and a half years old, and in charge of a company. He continues:</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/24" class="indent">&quot;Poor Davies, you know was last seen on the parapet of the Redoubt, and never returned: he is either . . . a German prisoner, or was buried by them the next day&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.1/25">I believe the matter to be important because we must mark and commemorate the passing of this generation and remind ourselves that all of our commemorations started with the burial of the unknown solider from the great war. A society that forgets its past and is embarrassed about remembering the sacrifice of those who have gone before is one that loses its past and, with that, loses its future. As those young people I referred to were able to remind me and many of my colleagues, there is something special about pausing to remember. We are not dwelling on or glorifying war, but remembering the sacrifice of those whose sole responsibility was to aid and abet their colleagues and to protect and defend the society in which they lived, and which nurtured them.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for giving way, and for the splendid way in which he presented his case. As one who moved an amendment to his early-day motion, and as one of the parliamentary advisers to the Royal British Legion, I urge that whatever happens should be done with the full co-operation and involvement of the Royal British Legion. Although we are on the edge of history, there is always the possibility that the family of the last known surviving soldier may feel under pressure. The commemoration is well worth pursuing, but a state funeral may be a bridge too far.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.1/1">I say to the hon. Gentleman that we have been in contact with the veterans association and the Royal British Legion throughout. Obviously, we have not tried to contact individual veterans directly because that would be quite wrong. We have left that to the associations. By and large, I understand that there is a compliant sense among many veterans: they think that this would be a good idea. However, that could change and there may be one or two who do not agree. Of course, we should have a commemoration if we cannot get a state funeral and the family's word is final, but I have gone for a state funeral because it is something peculiar and special in which the whole country would take part and in which we would celebrate, commemorate and recognise the peculiar sacrifice of not just this individual, but of the individual on behalf of the whole of their generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/2">I urge the Government to do whatever they can and they have already expressed that wish to me. We have Remembrance Sunday, and to those who say that that is enough, I say that there is a problem with institutionalising commemoration. There is the idea that we have set this Sunday aside, but sometimes we must challenge ourselves a little more so that when we say &quot;we remember&quot;, we really do remember, rather than just go through the motions. Something special, such as a state funeral, would be necessary to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/3">I conclude in the words of someone who is far more eloquent than me, who died a week before Armistice day and is now remembered as one of the greatest of the first world war poets:</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Move him into the sun&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/5">Gently its touch awoke him once, At home, whispering of fields unsown. Always it woke him, even in France, Until this morning and this snow. If anything might rouse him now The kind old sun will know. Think how it wakes the seeds,&mdash; Woke, once, the clays of a cold star. Are limbs, so dear-achieved, are sides, Full-nerved&mdash;still warm&mdash;too hard to stir? Was it for this the clay grew tall? &mdash;O what made fatuous sunbeams toil To break earth's sleep at all?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.56.1/6">I hope those words come through clearly to all who read them. They are the words of Wilfred Owen.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.0/1">I want to thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> for his initiative in suggesting that we commemorate the lives of all the people who participated in the great war by having a state funeral for the last known United Kingdom veteran of that great conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman referred to some of his family and I bear in mind my grandfather, Private Edward Joseph Beanes of the Royal Fusiliers, whose medals I proudly hold today, and his countless colleagues who participated in that conflict. It is important for us to commemorate and learn lessons. As the right hon. Gentleman suggested, schoolchildren in particular can draw a great deal from that and give us older ones an opportunity to reflect on the real meaning of conflict.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned how rarely we have state funerals and I draw your attention, Mr. Caton, to this very room. You can see opposite you the picture of the laying to rest of the unknown warrior by George V. That picture shows a state funeral. That was the beginning of the process and this proposal, if adopted, will be the end. I hope that there will be a comparable, contemporary picture marking the occasion in the House in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/4">I suspect that this state funeral will take place this year or next year, so I hope that many hon. Members will join me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July</phrase> at the Somme in Thiepval. It will be particularly poignant and important to those people who want to commemorate the great war. I shall also reflect on the hon. Members who gave their lives in world war one. Every time we go into the Chamber, we notice the crest commemorating hon. Members who gave their lives during world war one, particularly Willie Redmond. Elsewhere in the Palace, Thomas Kettle is commemorated, among many others.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/5">It seems to me that the first world war is a unique social and political watershed. It was the end of cavalry and the end of people going to war in ceremonial uniforms; the Highland regiments wore their kilts for the last time in conflict. It was the beginning of the tank. It was the first aviation war: in that short space of four years planes went from little more than kites doing a bit of scouting to the first bombers. Regrettably, it was the first time that weapons of mass destruction were used, such as chemical weapons and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/6">Moreover, Governments had to reflect on the conflict. Inadequate as the response was at Versailles and in the subsequent treaties, there was nevertheless a conscious theme that politicians had to reflect to try to avoid conflict. The creation of the League of Nations afterwards was not a failure; it was a start. The war trials that took place in Leipzig were not a failure; they were also a start, and we are still struggling today with the embryonic system of international norms for war crimes.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/7">Most important of all, the war brought about the women's franchise: a universal franchise for the United Kingdom. After women had participated so fully on the home front, and on the western front in the various nursing services, there had to be a recognition of their efforts. There had to be universal adult suffrage. It was given grudgingly after the first world war&mdash;it was not given to women on the same basis as men immediately&mdash;but it was no longer resistible.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.0/8">For those and many other reasons, I hope that the Minister and the Government will respond in the way suggested by the right hon. Gentleman. There would be overwhelming acclamation of such a decision, and we wish it God speed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.58.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="58"  time="013:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h04.htm#60418h04_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.58.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> on securing this debate on the topic of a state funeral for the last surviving veteran of the first world war living in the United Kingdom. I also thank him kindly for his opening remarks. The meeting that I had with him was very helpful; he made some good comments and gave very helpful advice, which I appreciated greatly. He made a powerful argument this afternoon, and everyone who listened to his comments was moved not just by the content, but by the tone in which he addressed this difficult and serious matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/2">As the right hon. Gentleman knows, I share his concern that the passing of this special generation should not go unmarked. Their service and sacrifice deserve our admiration, respect and gratitude, and it is the Government's intention that all those who participated in that &quot;war to end wars&quot;, as it was thought of at the time, should be suitably commemorated. I hope to be able to make a statement to the House shortly, setting out how we intend to do that. In essence, we have focused on two main options: either to provide a high- profile funeral for the individual as the representative of all those who served or, following the death of the last known veteran, to hold a national memorial event for the passing of the generation. The right hon. Gentleman made that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/3">Today, however, I would like to outline the main issues that have exercised us as we have been developing our plans. Recent television programmes such as &quot;The Last Tommy&quot; and &quot;Not Forgotten&quot; tended to focus attention on the role of the soldier on the western front. Perhaps the most poignant and lasting image of the first world war is that of the Tommy in the trenches in Flanders. The roles of the Royal Navy and the Royal Flying Corps can, unfortunately, be overshadowed in the mind of the public and the media. They tend to be forgotten, as do the many other theatres of war and the vital support provided by service personnel at home. The first world war was, in every sense, truly a world war.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/4">In our armed forces, every man or woman served in the capacity to which they were directed, and it would be unacceptable to single out any branch, trade, posting or theatre for greater prominence than any other. Every one of those people made a huge contribution to victory in that awful war. Some might have served for only a few weeks by the date of the armistice, some might not have finished their training or have left the UK, and many might not have seen a shot fired in anger. That should not debar them from receiving due recognition as veterans who served during the first world war. Those who survived were all veterans.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/5">In formulating our plans, we also need to take account of any individuals who might live in the UK but who are not British citizens, although they joined and served with the UK armed forces during the first world war. Any surviving Irish veterans, who would have been British citizens at the time, need to be considered too.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/6">We also have a practical problem, as we are not sure who the last veteran is, or who that person will be. More than 6 million men and women served in the UK armed forces during the first world war, and more than half the service records of that period were destroyed in the blitz in 1940. The situation is worse for the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, as only 12 per cent. of its records were unharmed. Surviving records can tell us who served, but not whether they are still alive. Most of those who survived were demobilised after the war, and for the past 90 years they have had no reason to contact us. They have no obligation to notify the Ministry of Defence of their existence, nor do their next of kin have to inform us of their death.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/7">The first world war veterans we know about are those who have identified themselves voluntarily. To monitor the existing veterans and, whenever possible, to identify others, I and my staff have regular contact with Dennis Goodwin, chairman of the World War One Veterans Association. He acts in an informal capacity as ambassador, spokesman and co-ordinator of the small band of known veterans. We are hugely grateful for his contribution to our discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/8">Inevitably, the number of surviving veterans of the first world war will dwindle, but the number of those known to us goes up as well as down. For example, the announcement of the death of our last known female veteran prompted claims that there are two others still alive. My officials are researching their backgrounds to confirm whether that is the case. The French have also just discovered a further two veterans, which is not a surprise. We estimate that there are in the UK more than 400 citizens of an age to have served at some time during the first world war. It is likely that there are others of whom we are not aware.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/9">Some people signed up under assumed names, while many others falsified their age to join. Some known veterans emigrated after the war, and there is a high possibility that others of whom we are not aware did the same. Many women who served will have married subsequently and changed their names. Tracing them all is an impossible task.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/10">In short, there is no complete list of surviving UK veterans, nor do I think there ever will be. Consequently, identifying the very last veteran with any certainty is impossible. The US and Australian Governments have acknowledged the same problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/11">We must consider another key point. Whoever the last known veteran is, he or she is not just a representative of that generation. They are also somebody's parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, or somebody's husband or wife. We must be sensitive to what the family would want in the circumstances and to how they would want the commemoration or service to mark the death of their loved one.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/12">Veterans of many conflicts seek to forget the traumas of warfare and often desire a simple family funeral without fuss or military overtones. The right hon. Gentleman made that point fairly. A number of the known first world war veterans have indicated that they and their families would not welcome any wider public intrusion. I am sure the right hon. Gentleman agrees that their preferences should be respected. Indeed, he said as much in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/13">Even defining the parameters of the first world war is not as straightforward as it might at first appear. End dates range from Armistice day on <phrase class="date" code="1918-11-11">11 November 1918</phrase> to the official cessation of the war on <phrase class="date" code="1921-08-31">31 August 1921</phrase>. Those are some of the key issues in our deliberations on this sensitive matter. I hope hon. Members appreciate that this decision needs careful thought.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/14">I am encouraged by the high public interest in the subject, and that interest has read across more generally into veterans' issues. I am encouraged, too, by the comments of hon. and right hon. Members in this House. Being sensitive to the fact that veterans are still alive, I hope that the emphasis being put on what we should do after their passing translates into a public celebration of their remaining time with us. That has to be recognised, and it is proper that it should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/15">When the last surviving veteran dies, their memory and the living link to the horrors of the first world war will continue for at least two generations through their children and grandchildren, some of whom are themselves veterans of later conflicts.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/16">The right hon. Gentleman referred to letters that he has received from children in his constituency. Through education and the involvement of children and schools with veterans in &quot;living history&quot; initiatives, an understanding and appreciation of the sacrifices of that early 20th century generation will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/17">Whatever we do, we shall take all steps to ensure that first world war veterans and the sacrifices that they made are remembered, as the magnificent painting in this room helps us to remember the funeral of the unknown soldier. It is a duty of all of us in this place to ensure that we take the right decision. It will not be easy, and there are many sensitivities to explore, but I hope that colleagues understand that I fully take on board their points.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.0/18">I pay tribute to the right hon. Gentleman, who initiated this debate, for his comments and advice. I hope shortly to make a statement to the House, so that colleagues understand how we shall take this matter forward.</p>

	Football Players (Behaviour)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="62"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h05.htm#60418h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.62.1/1">I come to this debate not because footballers any more than MPs are the cause of society's ills, or because footballers reflect society's ills, but because they can help us to do something about them. In my constituency and city, we are attacking antisocial behaviour in one of the country's most deprived and educationally under-attaining areas. At every primary school, alongside literacy and numeracy, we are seeking to teach social behaviour to develop youngsters' emotional intelligence and empathy, and their ability to learn, resolve differences without violence and develop mutual respect. Those same youngsters go home, and those lessons are not always reinforced by their sporting heroes.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/2">Just over 12 months ago, I asked the Minister about the insidious effect of footballers' bad behaviour on the behaviour of young people. He told me in a written reply that he had written to all football club chairmen in the hope that they would lobby their players to behave. It has not worked. However, the Minister does not run football. English football is run not by the state, but by three private companies&mdash;the Football Association, the Football League and the premiership. But even they cannot change the rules of football. That role lies with the global rule-setting body, FIFA, which has already failed to respond to the FA's calls for retrospective penalties and, at the other extreme, has responded to English football's request to attack racism in global football, but in a crude and disproportionate manner. However, football is now of such social significance that we should all reflect on our responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/3">I wish to use the debate to put on the Minister's agenda the issues that people have brought to my attention in the last two weeks of my local consultation. There is a remarkable similarity of views across the spectrum, from the local Crown prosecutor and the chief executive of Nottingham council through to local beat officers, teachers and parents. They see pictures of a referee surrounded by a mob of bawling players, who are showering the referee with foul language and physically intimidating him. That teaches youngsters that if they reject a decision made by someone in authority&mdash;be it a teacher, a policeman or a parent&mdash;it is acceptable to berate or intimidate him or her to get the decision changed.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/4">My consultation shows that there is a public thirst for those footballers who are in the public eye to devote time to showing youngsters that football is not about immature, spoilt behaviour and making money. We need to demonstrate that football is about teamwork, honesty and fairness, as it is for most of the 37,000 football clubs in England, the vast majority of which are tremendous role models for our young people, and for the young athletes who show dedication in their lifestyle to get to the top. A small number of people are the problem, but none the less they are often the most important people in the game.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/5">I want the Minister to address six key problems. The first is behaviour on the field. Cheating must be punished at the time of the offence when possible, and afterwards with the benefit of TV replay if not. The FA, to its great credit, has proposed that but cannot move without FIFA's okay. Penalties should not only be financial but, since many clubs and individuals can afford them, offenders should also be banned. How can we expect youngsters to learn the values of hard work and honesty when they see their idols grinning after their latest con, or disguising petulance and poor sportsmanship as &quot;attitude&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/6">Young men, especially those with absent fathers, crave role models and&mdash;like it or not&mdash;footballers often meet that need. At the most extreme, those with a predisposition to violence find it endorsed or justified in football. Lame excuses about a few bad apples are no longer acceptable. Bad behaviour in football is unacceptable and needs to be tackled fearlessly. After appropriate public debate, will the Minister convene a summit of all the relevant organisations and authorities in football to agree and to thrash out a way forward?</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/7">My second point is about the treatment of referees. Referees' decisions should be final, not the start of infantile behaviour escalating to arguing, abuse and collective intimidation, and such behaviour should lead to immediate dismissal from the field. The FA must look again at referees' powers. Rugby union shows that such player misconduct can be eliminated, not least by an intelligent running commentary on the game from the referee and the convention&mdash;not law&mdash;that only the captain may ask to speak to the referee. Dissent is punished with a repeatable 10 yd penalty. I have asked the FA to propose such measures again to FIFA for football. Managers would soon teach players that such behaviour harmed their team and their wage packet. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity unequivocally to back referees and extra powers for referees, as well as the FA as it proposes change to FIFA.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/8">The third issue is the off-the-field conduct of parents and spectators. A trip to the local park at the weekend to watch a youth game is a chastening experience. The worst offenders are the parents. Often, referees are no more than 14 or 15 years old, yet they have to deal with intimidation from people old enough to be their parents. Most premiership academies, I am told, no longer allow parents to watch their children because of that problem. Although a better example must be set by professionals, parents, too, must play their part. The clubs also have a strong responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/9">More pressure must be put on clubs to enforce better behaviour, either contractually or through a code of conduct that incentivises good behaviour. Players must be taught by clubs the social skills to recognise the impact that they have on others and be supported to become better role models on and off the pitch. As one police officer replied to my consultation,</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/10" class="indent">&quot;they need to become professionals in the moral as well as financial sense&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/11">Although the FA is a not-for-profit organisation, and all funds go back into the game, one idea suggested was that the players' fines should go to the FA, and be more obviously put into a &quot;community chest&quot; to educate players about drinking, smoking, social responsibility and so on. Sponsors, too, can play an important part; they have a clear interest in associating their products with high standards of behaviour from the players who wear their logo each week.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/12">We already enshrine into FA contracts the guidelines for a certain percentage of players' time to be devoted to community activities. I underline again that most professional footballers and most clubs act in a responsible way: 5 per cent. of gross TV royalties go on corporate responsibilities and an additional &pound;12 million goes from the premiership clubs to the Professional Footballers Association for education. Will the Minister consider rewarding more obviously and more publicly those clubs and individuals who serve the community, and introducing incentives and public recognition for those who behave well?</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/13">Already three UEFA cup places are awarded to the three national associations in Europe with the best fair play record&mdash;a great incentive. Accordingly, those three places are given to the clubs with the best fair play record for that season. Football in the community schemes, the &quot;Kick It Out&quot; campaign, and many other campaigns sponsored by those in and around football have already proved what football can do when it sets its mind to the task. Perhaps we can do something similar with the campaign on homophobia, with equal success.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/14">As a focus for the effort and as a way of making a clean start, I suggest that the Minister considers a public declaration that the FA, PFA, premiership, league and the League Managers Association, as well as the media, will confront and eliminate bad behaviour. I ask him to organise that at the beginning of the next football season and publicly to sign up everyone in a ceremony that should be replicated on the first Saturday of the coming season at every ground from Wembley, where they will be playing the charity shield&mdash;perhaps not this season, but one lives in hope&mdash;to the local recreation ground. That ceremony should be replicated throughout the land, from the finest grounds to the local pub 11 playing their knock-about game, to signify a new start to a new season. I hope that the Minister will consider entertaining that idea and taking the lead, even given the limited powers that he has over the game.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/15">My next point is about the basic education of the young athletes, which also has to be addressed. Most youngsters do not make it at football clubs and even for those who do their careers are short. Preparation for later life for both groups is essential, not least some financial education for those who make it. In the United States, colleges that take on young athletes&mdash;many of whom go on to become professionals&mdash;are allowed to take a certain number of young people on athletic scholarships if their grades are perhaps not as strong as they might be but show some academic potential. Those colleges then have a duty to ensure that their players reach a certain academic level. If they fail to do so, the number of scholarships the following year is cut down. In an age when we demand five good GCSEs of all youngsters, can we not insist on stretching personalised learning programmes for all young people in football? That should be the minimum standard for any football club that signs a teenage footballer. That would make every club take the same level of care and responsibility as the best. Education, discipline and standards would also improve young footballers' behaviour on and off the pitch. Again, I ask the Minister to use his good offices to negotiate that basic educational standard with the relevant football authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/16">We must recognise the media's role in helping footballers' behaviour to influence society&mdash;for good or ill. The media must report what happens on the field, but they can also influence our perception of it. The smirk or cynical wink of a commentator&mdash;a Lineker or a Hansen&mdash;in front of a viewing audience of millions, many of whom are youngsters, can undo much of the good work that is done at home or at school. The media must sign up not to glamorising violent, cheating players, but to exposing them for what they are. They have an even bigger responsibility when it comes to reporting off-the-field behaviour, and that is particularly true of the press. They have the power of choice, but if they continually choose to report only on the tiny minority of players who cheat on their wives and children or who are binge drinkers, drug users, excessive gamblers and criminals, they should not be surprised when, on the inside pages, they report on youngsters who follow the same example. It is not an easy issue to tackle, but I ask my right hon. Friend, who is well aware of the difficulties involved, to speak to the game's important non-playing players&mdash;the media&mdash;to see what can be done to achieve a stronger ethic in the coverage of sport, and particularly football, because that coverage has an influence on our young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/17">The nation is reaching the conclusion that the current system is unacceptable, and we want to improve it. There are no easy answers, and we must all work together to find a way forward. Changes are necessary, and I have several clear questions for the Minister. First, what plans does he have to improve behaviour? Will he convene a summit to thrash out a way forward, support referees, reduce cheating and improve parental behaviour? Secondly, will he publicly reward clubs whose players set the best examples? Thirdly, will he use the first day of the season to launch a sportsmanship in football or a similar initiative, which will range from the premiership down to the local recreation ground? Fourthly, will he make representations to FIFA, which writes the rules of football, to ensure that the FA's sensible requests can be met? In that context, can he tell us when the independent European football review will report and what impact it might have on the issue? If FIFA and others refuse to play ball&mdash;if I can use that phrase&mdash;will he look at the domestic independence of English football and at whether we can have rules in the domestic context that we feel are appropriate? Finally, will he challenge the PFA to engage senior players who are clearly not engaged in promoting better behaviour?</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/18">I sought this debate not to score easy points or to talk about current issues in the media, such as diving, gambling abuses or wages, but to focus on an important issue for my constituency, where people are working night and day to improve young people's behaviour. At three consecutive Prime Minister's Question Times, I have raised with the Prime Minister the importance of promoting social behaviour as well as tackling antisocial behaviour. I hope that everything that professional footballers, MPs and everybody else does will be done with an eye to underpinning, rather than undermining, the efforts that all of us, particularly in tough constituencies with poor educational records, are piling in to help youngsters make a better life for themselves. We in this place can do more than anybody on that issue, but professional footballers and the game itself can also make a contribution, and I hope that the Minister will be able to move the professional game towards helping us some time in the next year or so.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> for securing this Adjournment debate. The issue is important and probably timely, given that the World cup, which will take place in Germany, is just a couple of months away. It is probably the greatest showcase for football in any four-year period and it will give the young players my hon. Friend mentioned a great opportunity to show their skills and technical ability to a worldwide audience. As he also said, we hope that those players will display the respect and on-the-field behaviour commensurate with such a great competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.3/2">Let me mention in passing two great events that took place this weekend. After 44 years, the great football team of Accrington Stanley have returned to the Football League, where they rightfully belong, and I pay tribute to Eric Whalley, the club chairman, who stuck with it. He has been a teetotaller for 20 years, but I gather that he had the odd drop of champagne this weekend. Nevertheless, he deserves it, and it is great to see Accrington Stanley back. In addition, Sheffield United will be rejoining the premier league next season. With Sheffield United going up, the premiership will truly be able to call itself the world's premier league.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.3/3">To return to the debate in hand, the World cup is taking place in two months. As my hon. Friend said, football has a huge profile, and huge influence goes with that. It is worth reminding ourselves that every week 800 million to 1 billion people in 195 countries watch the 20 teams in our premier league. As he also said, football affects young people in the UK, but it has massive influence worldwide, too. It is therefore incumbent on the football authorities to ensure that that influence is used as a force for good and it is important that a good example is set on the playing field.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.4/1">I rise as the chairman of the all-party Scottish football group and I certainly identify with the points made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase>. He asked for a summit at the start of the season to discuss these issues. Will the Minister consider inviting representatives of the other home countries, because, as he rightly says, watching football on television has an influence on youngsters?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.66.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="66"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h05.htm#60418h05_spnew5">
	<p pid="b.66.5/1">I will try to answer some of the arguments put by my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, and then we might be able to see whether such a summit would be worth while. I agree with him that the football authorities should continue to take a tough stance on the issues that he outlined to ensure that players who misbehave are adequately dealt with. There must also be support for match officials, and let me say very clearly that referees and other match officials have my full support and that of the FA.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.5/2">My hon. Friend raised five or six main points, and he was courteous enough to let me know in advance the issues that he would be covering, so let me go through them. First, as he indicated, I have written to the chairmen of all professional football clubs asking them to speak to managers and, through them, to players. I have done that on two occasions and I will continue to do so to raise the issue of responsibility, because the responsibility and leadership that we need to stamp out bad behaviour start in the boardroom. It is a matter of setting policy, and those in the boardroom are responsible for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.5/3">Any business or organisation has corporate and social responsibilities. Those responsibilities rest with the people who make the decisions, and footballing decisions are made in the boardroom. It has to start with leadership from there. That is why I took it upon myself, as Minister for Sport, to write to all professional clubs and raise the issue once more, and I will do so again when I believe it to be necessary. I did so for a good reason: when I go round the country&mdash;and, indeed, Scotland&mdash;I hear time and again that, as my hon. Friend said, what happens on the park on Saturday also happens in the playground on Monday. The players have influence on young people, but their behaviour affects not only those referred to by my hon. Friend, but people right across society.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.5/4">I underline again why there is no need for such indiscipline. In other tough team sports such as rugby union or rugby league&mdash;there is no tougher sport than that&mdash;or even in cricket, which may not be as tough but is certainly as well fought and competitive, respect for officials among the peer group far exceeds that in football. I see no reason why the conditions and the discipline that prevail in those tough sports should not prevail in football.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing this debate and endorse everything he said. When the Minister writes to the football clubs, does he also write to the rugby league and rugby union clubs? As he said, those sports involve far more physical contact than football. If not, what is his reasoning as to why football misbehaves as it does?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-18b.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="67"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060418/halltext/60418h05.htm#60418h05_spnew7">
	<p pid="b.67.1/1">I have not written to rugby league or rugby union clubs, nor to cricket clubs or those of other team sports. In that respect, we might even think of ice hockey, which is another contact sport. Yes, I have raised the subject with the football authorities, but I might also raise with them&mdash;indeed, I thank them for it&mdash;the fact that, as my hon. Friend said, the vast majority of players not only conduct themselves fairly on the park, but do a tremendous amount of good in the community. Later, I shall put down a few markers about the role of football and the majority of players.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/2">My hon. Friend asked whether representations should be made to FIFA, requesting it to meet representatives of the FA, particularly on the question of discipline. It is not easy for FIFA to square up to that, but I have some sympathy with my hon. Friend. Indeed, I know that the FA has made strong representations to FIFA, asking it to consider recent issues that have affected football, especially the question of diving.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/3">Although I acknowledge that my hon. Friend does not want to home in on the question, I believe that it is something FIFA could consider. I understand the position of FIFA's president on the question. FIFA has to give governance to the game internationally and its president will argue strongly that although the developed countries of western Europe have the facilities&mdash;for example, a premier division football match in England is filmed by eight television cameras&mdash;that is not the case in parts of Africa or Asia, nor in other parts of the world. FIFA wants to ensure that the rules are universally applied and that governance of the game is universal.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/4">That argument has some merit. However, other arguments are being made by football authorities in England, and I have discussed them with a colleague and friend, Keith Hackett, who is the senior referee. He heads up the referees' organisation. As an aside, Mr. Caton, I can tell the House that he sent me off once&mdash;I got a red card&mdash;which shows what an objective man he is. However, that was some years past. The discussion going on inside football is one that FIFA could consider, and we should consider whether to run some trials, as Keith Hackett tells me that one of the most difficult things a referee has to do is decide whether someone is diving.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/5">We could consider what happens in rugby league. In that sport, players can be put on report and incidents can be considered on video after the match. Other options could be considered by the FA, but an experimental period over a season could also help to inform FIFA decisions. I acknowledge that the president of FIFA has a problem: he is the president of an international organisation and I know he wants to ensure that governance is as fair internationally as it can be. There is some merit in his argument, but it is a finely balanced one. Football has changed dramatically over recent years and perhaps, as in other sports&mdash;even international ones&mdash;we ought to bring in new technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/6">My hon. Friend referred to the independent European football review on the governance of football in the European Union. Without going into too much detail, Heads of Government said in 2000 that sport has a particular role to play in the Community. That was specified in the Nice declaration, and EUFA is interpreting the declaration to see how it fits with football. It will be considering the governance of football in relation to the EU. Many know that EU and Commission regulations and directives have had a considerable impact on football, and the review is being undertaken in that context.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/7">I assure my hon. Friend that social inclusion is not specifically about behaviour on the park; it is also to do with supporting grass-roots football and examining ways to support, encourage, educate and train new players. The health of young players is also very much part of that review, which I hope will be completed by the end of May.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/8">What we have been doing in England, and in the UK, is an exemplar for football&mdash;I am thinking of football in the community and the playing for success initiative. The latter has had one of the biggest impacts on education, numeracy, literacy and information, communications and technology, or ICT, skills of almost anything the Government have undertaken in the past seven or eight years. It was driven largely by football professionals putting at our disposal the grounds, players and know-how of the clubs, and it has made a massive contribution to social cohesion.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/9">My hon. Friend also asked whether we would consider the domestic independence of English football if insufficient progress was made through FIFA. We have FIFA, EUFA and the FA. That is the line of command for the sport, and I would not want the FA to break away from that. I know that dialogue continues between FA and FIFA on a number of issues, which is how it should be. There should be no political interference and the two should work for the good of the game. This is about the good governance of the game. I am sure that much of what we are developing in England will influence Europe and the world. That is how it should be. As with every other game or sport, developments should be within that broad governance.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.1/10">My hon. Friend asked whether I would wish the Professional Footballers Association to engage those players who are not engaged in promoting better behaviour. In my view, the PFA does a first-class job in this area, and I know that Gordon Taylor promotes it strongly through the Prince's Trust, helping many young people to get back into society through football. The commitment of two to three hours a week to community work for each player is part of the charter and the contracts that the professionals sign up to.</p>
