Why is the legal service&mdash;the third pillar of the welfare state&mdash;taking so much of a hit when it starts with a much smaller proportion of public finances in the first place?</p>

	<p pid="a.157.1/1">There certainly is a question about value for money for legal aid. As I am about to set out, that is part of the driving force behind the proposals, which are about using our money more wisely and, if we need more money, being able to demonstrate to the Treasury that we need it on the basis that we are using what we have wisely already. Paying for hours is not the way to demonstrate that.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.5/1">I have said what I have said&mdash;can we now talk about legal aid?</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/2">In our view, there is no prospect of any more cash for the legal aid budget. I wait to see whether any other party will pledge to offer more, but I do not think that they will&mdash;or that they should while we are not getting best value for our cash. Let me make it clear: the changes are not about cost cutting; if there were a sudden windfall into the legal aid budget, we would still make them. It is imperative that we obtain best value for taxpayers' money.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/3">We have a duty to get best value for taxpayers and to pay in a way that ensures the best-quality coverage to people who need legal aid. That requires us to stop paying by the hour, which can favour the inefficient, and instead to pay per case, which will encourage high-quality and efficient practitioners to streamline the processes and develop the capacity to do more cases and get more advice to more vulnerable people. The quality of service will improve. Peer review as the means of quality assuring all practitioners has been welcomed by everyone. If suppliers do not reach the required level under peer review, they will not be allowed to supply legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/4">It has been said over the months that we are not addressing all the cost drivers in the justice system, but that is not correct. The proposals that we are discussing deal with legal aid procurement; other reforms that are taking place across the justice system deal with other cost drivers. Part and parcel of the way ahead is a commitment to new stakeholder representation to help to see the reforms through, to head off any emerging problems at the pass, and to monitor progress. For the first time, legal aid lawyers will have a say on problems caused to them by other agencies in the justice system. The first meeting, to set the framework of the stakeholder body, will be on <phrase class="date" code="">1 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/5">Let me deal with some specifics of the scheme. On crime, it was always clear, but it became much clearer in the consultation, that there are differences in the way that criminal advice works in urban and rural areas, so for magistrates court work we will initially introduce the new standard fees only in 16 urban areas. We will consider spreading the system to rural areas when we have seen how it works in the urban areas, where the market is different.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.5/6">Some practitioners were concerned about the level of police station fees proposed in the Carter reforms. They were based on averages in criminal justice areas. In discussions with me and in the consultation responses, lawyers rightly pointed to differences between particular spots in the criminal justice areas and the consequent differences in the costs of attending at a police station. We have therefore delayed the introduction of fixed fees for police station advice until October to allow the LSC to consult on the detailed police station duty rotas&mdash;again, only in the 16 urban areas. We shall fix the police station duty rotas best for the advice needs of the locality. We will then fix the fees very locally and very specifically, based on those duty rota areas and on where the current claims are clustered. They will therefore be based on true averages for the specific area. We should be as sensitive as possible to local issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.3/1">I believe that the hon. Gentleman is talking about some research by LECG for the Law Society that estimated the number of firms that would either close down or merge; it dealt not with people going out of the profession but with merger or change. However, its work was based on a course that has never been pursued&mdash;that there would be a minimum contract size of &pound;150,000. As I said, there is no minimum contract size, but the only one that was ever countenanced was &pound;50,000. Carter thought that, overall, there would be some fall-out, but he too was countenancing a minimum contract. However, there is no fixed view on that. As I said, we have localised the way that we hope to be able to configure the changes, to try to fit what is already there.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.3/2">During the consultation, solicitors asked for competitive tendering to start as quickly as possible after they had moved over to fixed fees, so that they could adjust their businesses to fixed fees and then quickly seek to set the fees themselves by making a bid. Consequently, we have narrowed the time between introducing fixed fees and introducing bidding by one year&mdash;there is now only one year between the two processes&mdash;to take account of that. It is better that firms make competitive bids for work that take account of their actual running costs and required profit margins, rather than requiring the LSC to second-guess fair fee rates in the absence of hard information on the true costs firms incur in providing services, which is what happens now.</p>

His supplier base will benefit enormously from the changes to the fixed fee and is therefore bound to be able to extend its range and to provide more advice to more people. His local suppliers will be able to spread their influence, and that is entirely right. That is what the bidding process is capable of doing, enormously to the public benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.162.3/1">I was a member of the management committee of Hammersmith and Fulham community law centre for some 15 years, and I should perhaps declare that interest as well as my interest as a practicing barrister. The centre provides a full range of law; it is rare in doing so across many fields. There is one other private practice, White Ryland, which provides a comprehensive service in Shepherd's Bush, but is practically the only provider. It is opening outreach offices to try to serve the community there. We suffer from the exact problem mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>&mdash;high costs, but extraordinarily great and complex needs. This only an intervention, and I think that other hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-11a.163.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="163"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070111/halltext/70111h0002.htm#07011172000421">
	<p pid="a.163.1/1">If my hon. Friend writes to me, I shall try to answer the point that he was trying to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/2">In family and civil law, it is our intention in the longer term to increase the proportion of overall spending from the legal aid budget. There are no cuts to be made to those budgets. This year civil and family legal aid expenditure will be more than 20 per cent. higher than it was two years ago. More than 700,000 people have been given legal help in the past year&mdash;50,000 more than we expected and more than ever since the community legal service began in 2000. Contrary to claims about advice deserts, face-to-face advice increased by 13 per cent. on the previous year and advice by telephone from Community Legal Service Direct nearly trebled&mdash;research showed that that was done to great satisfaction, too, in only its second year of service. This year we intend to increase acts of assistance by a further 5 per cent., or another 50,000. It is to the great credit of suppliers that that can be done, but it also happens because we ensure that the services are initiated and resourced.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/3">Having painted a growing picture of the supply in civil cases, I want to consider family cases. Profit costs in care proceedings have increased from &pound;109 million in 2004-05 to &pound;129 million in 2005-06&mdash;an increase of 10.8 per cent. per certificate issued. If we consider civil and family cases together in that context, we see that the climate is hardly one in which we would expect huge numbers of civil or family practitioners to go out of business. That nostrum has been given much ventilation over the summer, but it comes from the dark ages to suggest that improving efficiency, as we intend to do, will undermine quality or impede the personal touch. Efficiency undermines neither. The taxpayer requires all three.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/4">The fees proposed for family work caused concern back in July. We realised quickly that they were not sufficiently sensitive and we agreed to take them back. They need change before they are right for that field and we have engaged with the professions in negotiating the changes. In the case of civil help, solicitors are already paid a fixed fee per case for the help that they give. Such tailored fixed fees are based on firms' average claims and were introduced in 2003-04 as a stepping stone to a single fixed fee system for all suppliers. However, not-for-profit advice agencies, such as citizens advice bureaux, are paid on a contract to provide hours of work. We cannot justify using a different basis to pay for the same work, according to who supplies it; the right way to pay for both is fixed fees. The tailored fixed fee system, which has helped to give rise to the increased productivity that I mentioned, has shown that fixed fees work for civil help.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/5">The fees proposed in the consultation document in July, which were based on solicitors' pay rates, also caused concern. We listened carefully to the concerns of the not-for-profit sector, whose representatives told me that they see different clients from solicitors. They told me that they see more vulnerable people, who have multiple difficulties, who often have mental health issues and who often do not have English as their first language. However, solicitors who do such work disagree that they do not see equally vulnerable people with equal difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/6">We have therefore based the fixed fees on data from both sides&mdash;the not-for-profit sector and solicitors&mdash;to try to get over the problem. Average not-for-profit costs are significantly higher than solicitors' costs for debt, slightly higher for welfare benefits cases and lower in other categories, such as housing, so the fees to be set for civil advice have changed quite markedly since July. The fixed fee for a debt case is &pound;70 a case higher than it was in July and the fee for a welfare benefits case is &pound;20 a case higher than it was in July. Despite the assertion that not-for-profit agencies see more difficult and more complex cases, their costs were about the same as solicitors' in other categories. Most of the fees have therefore stayed roughly the same, even though we have incorporated data from not-for-profit providers.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.1/1">I shall make progress, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/2">Defendants must of course have justice. Indeed, in a speech on October 24 2006, June Venters said:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Legal aid is there to ensure that vulnerable and disadvantaged people are not denied access to justice because of their inability to pay&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/4">The Lord Chancellor in a speech the other day to the Law Society said:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Free access to justice for those who need legal aid is as integral to the welfare state as the NHS or state education.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/6">I think that we would all agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/7">I shall quickly consider the impact of means-testing on magistrates courts. It is ironic that the drivers behind the increases in the legal aid budget do not come from the magistrates courts, but mainly from the Crown court. However, the means-testing arrangements are having an impact on the magistrates courts as we speak. That is a matter for concern. Most solicitors support the principle of means-testing, but they have always stressed that the new means test must enable legal aid to be granted or refused quickly. That manifestly is not happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/8">I recently received a letter from a large firm of solicitors in Sheffield&mdash;Howells, the Citizens Solicitor. The firm made it clear that the new arrangements for means-testing are extremely bureaucratic and cumbersome. I shall not go into detail, Sir Nicholas, as you have told us to make progress, but it points out that the Department for Constitutional Affairs did not take account of representations made by the solicitors who deal with such cases day in, day out at the sharp end.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/9">The Minister talks about the most vulnerable, and in her press release this morning she made it clear that vulnerable people would not be affected. The New Policy Institute report headed &quot;Means testing in the magistrates' court: is this really what Parliament intended?&quot; was published on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>. It highlighted the case of a lone parent with a child aged 10. The parent was working full-time at the minimum wage of &pound;5.35 an hour but will not be eligible for criminal legal aid because of a boost to her family income from tax credits. If that is not affecting the vulnerable, I really do not know what is. That is exactly the sort of person who we should be trying to protect and help. Is that what the Minister intended? Is it what she meant today in her press release?</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/10">The result, as we have heard, is that many firms will close or amalgamate. Many of the firms in my constituency are not in criminal legal aid to make money; they are doing it through conviction, as a service, because they believe in the ethos of trying to protect those in society who have real problems and crises. That was very much the message that I received from those firms. There will certainly be legal aid deserts, especially in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/11">Furthermore, in my judgment, there is no question but that the bidding process and the best-value procedures will lead to bigger firms, and the consolidation and closure of small firms. We should not be in any doubt that the larger firms will cost more. It is the smaller more focused firms with dedicated partners who historically and traditionally offer the best value for money. For instance, in 2005 and 2006, Otterburn Legal Consulting carried out two large surveys of criminal firms, and it concluded that the smaller firms with lower overheads and dedicated staff who work long hours offer the best value for money. The larger firms cost more, and ultimately they will cost the Government more in criminal aid. That is ironic.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/12">I take on board <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1674" name="Keith Vaz">the points made by the right hon. Member for Leicester, East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Tooting (Mr. Khan) and for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) about the black and minority ethnic firms. Many are small businesses, but they have a great commitment to the communities that they serve. By definition, they probably do not want to consolidate or merge or even expand; they want to remain small and to serve their communities in their inimitable way. I also take on board the points made about legal aid advice centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/13">If you do not mind, Sir Nicholas, I shall quote a colleague. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">My hon. Friend the Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> has recently been very ill. He suffered an unpleasant stroke, but mercifully he is now much better. I spoke to him by telephone last night. He asked me to tell the House that, in his judgment, the supplier base for legal aid on the Isle of Wight is threatened by the current proposals. He said that if the base is eroded too far, there will be no choice, which will create further serious problems, with conflicts of interest. The problem affects all areas, but it will have a particular impact on the island, given the logistical difficulties of getting people over from the mainland&mdash;or the high cost that his poorer constituents will face in getting to the mainland. He pointed out the risk that under the Government's proposals the Isle of Wight will become an advice desert. It is important that his comments are taken on board, particularly at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/14">The public defender service pilot schemes clearly show that the cost of the PDS is between 40 per cent. and 90 per cent. more than the cost of private law firms providing the same criminal defence services to the public. I find that a matter of concern, and it illustrates that big is not necessarily beautiful.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/15">When considering criminal legal aid, I wonder whether the Minister's reintroduction of means-testing with such a bureaucratic system is really how the Government want to help the vulnerable. I am sure that she does not need reminding that, during an Adjournment debate in October 2005, she argued cogently and passionately that the budget for criminal legal aid cannot be capped. I know that she has taken the Queen's shilling and gone native, but, for goodness sake, does she not trust her instincts&mdash;or is she just doing what her boss is telling her? I leave it to others to draw their own conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/16">I turn to civil legal aid. We heard this afternoon that the proposal for a single national fixed fee for advice work in each legal field will lead to many problems. The Government say that it will be cost-neutral, but I put it to the Minister that the picture in civil legal aid is pretty grim. Civil practitioners received a rise of 2.5 per cent. in 2004 in legal aid fees. There was no increase in 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999 or 2000. It is a matter of great concern that the number of offices with civil legal aid contracts fell from 4,301 in March 2004 to 3,632 in March 2006&mdash;and the number is falling fast.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/17">Lord Carter proposed a graduated fee scheme for solicitors doing family and welfare related work. Why did the Government not take Lord Carter's advice? Why did they not listen to what he had to say? Standard fees are obviously are very different. Although I welcome the Government's decision to reconsider and delay the introduction of standardised fixed fees in relation to family, immigration and mental health law, fixed fees will definitely be introduced for others areas of social welfare law, including housing, employment, welfare benefit, debt, community care and education law in October&mdash;in a few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.1/18">I ask the Minister to consider her Department's regulatory impact assessment. It confirms that a standard fixed fee will mean a loss of income for 38.6 per cent. of providers. The Law Society's document on the subject is a pretty comprehensive survey of the various points of view put by different organisations. It makes it clear that 82 per cent. of family practitioners believe that their firm is less likely to undertake publicly funded work in future; that 78 per cent. of mental health practitioners are considering whether to continue to represent publicly funded clients and believe that the quality of service will decline; that72 per cent. of immigration practitioners say that their firms are less likely to undertake legal aid work in future, and 67 per cent. thought that the quality of the service would decline; and that 95 per cent. of civil aid practitioners believe that the proposed fixed fees would make their work non-viable. That is pretty staggering.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.0/1">Yes, it was the Immigration Law Practitioners Association and the briefing was from the president, Ian McDonald QC. The other organisation that I briefly mentioned was the Association of Lawyers for Children.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/2">Is it any wonder that virtually every organisation out there that has lobbied MPs and expressed opinions is telling us of its dismay? People are very concerned and a range of organisations are involved. First, the Access to Justice Alliance&mdash;an organisation that is very well briefed&mdash;has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/3" class="indent">&quot;To survive on the proposed fixed fee we would have to exclude some of those most in need whom we currently help. There is unlikely to be another supplier to take them on, so they would simply not receive the help they need&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/4">The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, an organisation that we all know and love has made it clear that it is gravely concerned about the potential loss of expert legal advice for family law cases resulting from the cuts in legal aid. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/5" class="indent">&quot;There is already a serious risk regarding the future availability of family legal aid lawyers; the situation will only get worse if the government fails to provide proper support&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/6">The NSPCC outlines a very distressing case of a young girl called Tracey. She was a heroin addict suffering from post-natal depression and social services tried to remove her baby from care. It was a complex case and I accept <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">the point made by the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase> that many of those cases are becoming increasingly complex and difficult. In the case I have outlined, many hours were put in by the solicitor concerned at a substantial loss to the law firm. The solicitor was eventually paid about &pound;9,000 in legal aid money, which may sound a great deal, but it certainly was not anywhere enough to cover the time put in. The bottom line is that Tracey is now off drugs and her life is back on track. That is exactly the type of case that her solicitors believe they would not be able to take on today. The cost of social care and of interventions from other agencies to help Tracey would be far more than the legal aid paid out to her solicitor.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/7">Other organisations involved in this issue are Shelter, Mind, Action Against Medical Accidents and the Mental Health Lawyers Association, which has been lobbying very hard indeed. It sent me an e-mail the other day in which it made it clear that it is not at all happy with what is happening. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The problem that the Government faces, is that it has squeezed mental health lawyers so hard...there is no slack in the system...The Government faces a potential 'meltdown' situation in October. This is not industrial action it will simply be members finding they just cannot do the job&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/9">The Minister recently said:</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Matters connected with mental health lawyers are going to be looked at again, in connection with practitioners. They have no concerns at all.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-19">19 December 2006</phrase>; Vol. 454, c. 1280.]</p>
	<p pid="a.172.0/11">However, Richard Charlton, the chair of the Mental Health Lawyers Association, made it clear that that was not the case given his references to 'meltdown' and 'no slack in the system'. If the Minister thinks that that represents 'no concerns at all', she should think again.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.2/1">I did not say there were no concerns at all; I said there were no imminent concerns because we would be going back to look at those fees and we have done so. The hon. Gentleman should know that I am told that roughly one half of mental health cases are carried out by mental health lawyers who have volunteered on a fixed fee basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.173.3/1">The Minister should look at column 1280 of <i>Hansard </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-19">19 December 2006</phrase>. Perhaps she meant that mental health practitioners had no concerns at all about having another meeting. However, if one looks at <i>Hansard</i>,<i></i>it certainly seems that she is implying that practitioners should not have any concerns about what is happening. When she meets Richard Charlton and the association, she should try and clear that point up and listen to them very carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/2">The citizens advice bureaux have been extremely active in briefing us. I have many letters from CABs and I will not got through all of them. However, I want to flag up that my local CAB in west Norfolk and the one up the road from me in Boston have grave concerns. In a letter to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">my hon. Friend the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> the Boston CAB's bureau manager, Maggie Peberdy, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/3" class="indent">&quot;As you will know, Boston CAB holds a contract with the Legal Services Commission to provide debt and benefits advice. We strongly believe that the proposed changes will have a damaging impact on our ability to provide essential legal aid services to people with complex welfare benefits or debt problems, and that this in turn will harm the most vulnerable in our community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/4">She goes on to list many of her concerns. The Minister kindly attended a meeting of the all-party citizens advice group the other day. At that meeting, the CAB passed on a number of very complex case studies that involved a whole range of factors&mdash;for example, those dealing with complex clients suffering from mental illness who require the assistance of outside agencies and third parties including local authorities. Those cases take a long time to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/5">The Minister should look again at what the CAB has said and at the views of the Association of Lawyers for Children, the Family Law Bar Association and a large numbers of individual firms. I met a firm in my constituency the other day, which is a growing and expanding partnership that is doing well. However, there is a real problem with that business as a number of dedicated partners and lawyers, some of whom do criminal and legal aid and family work, are concerned about whether the firm will be able to carry on offering the same level of public service. They were kind enough to bring in a family law barrister who expressed exactly the same concerns and who is acting for different solicitors up and down the region. Day in and day out, he expresses in court his very grave concern about whether many of the smaller firms will be able to carry on with this type of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.1/1">All I can say is that I have received dozens and dozens of letters and e-mails and met a large number of lawyers. I have not yet met one lawyer who supports exactly what she is saying.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/2">I shall conclude now as I know that you, Sir Nicholas, wish to call other Members to speak. However, I am concerned about the black and minority ethnic firms in relation to civil legal aid as the present system is nearly at breaking point. It is already becoming increasingly difficult to find a legal aid solicitor and the Government's plans will only make that worse. The Minister talks about trying to help and make life easier for the vulnerable, but she should listen to what the experts are saying and trust the judgment and instincts that she so eloquently expressed in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-26">26 October 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.1/3">As the shadow Attorney-General said earlier, what is the role of the Lord Chancellor in this? First of all he has downgraded his own job&mdash;we gather that was done on the back of an envelope&mdash;and has then spent ten of millions of pounds on a new supreme court. He has rewarded his Ministers with a sell-out to the Treasury or has the Treasury rewarded him for not managing his Department properly? The conclusion that I draw is that some of the most vulnerable people in our constituencies and communities will suffer. That is what concerns us and it is why I very much hope that the Minister will start listening to the people who really know what is going on.</p>

	<p pid="a.174.4/1">I shall seek to heed your reminder, Sir Nicholas.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.4/2">I am very glad that we are having the debate, which is clearly of enormous significance. The Government had Lord Carter do his work and produce his report; having seen the response to that work, they produced their own proposals at the end of November in the document entitled &quot;Legal Aid Reform: the Way Ahead&quot;, which modified some of Lord Carter's proposals, and announced a further consultation on some areas, such as family law and mental health. I hope that, having done that, the Government will now pay attention both to this debate and to the results of the work by the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs&mdash;which, under <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="A J Beith">the chairmanship of my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>, is about to start examining this matter, having taken evidence&mdash;and only then come to a view on whether to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.4/3">My judgment is like that of colleagues on both sides of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the House. The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase>, in, if I may say so, a very effective debate recently, put a typical London case, with which I absolutely associate myself, as do many other London Members. We do not want&mdash;to misquote Edgar in &quot;King Lear&quot;&mdash;to stand up for lawyers. We want to stand up for the people whom lawyers paid in the public service have been looking after, because we believe that there is a risk that they will be squeezed badly by the reforms that we are discussing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-11a.175.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="175"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070111/halltext/70111h0004.htm#07011172000470">
	<p pid="a.175.7/1">The point that I was trying to make is that the lobby is not composed of fat cats on huge salaries who are trying to defend a privileged position. The lobby is being conducted on behalf of our constituents the length and breadth of the land, who come to legal advisers with an individual crisis or trouble, or with a set of troubles. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> rightly said, those people have been rewarded in one case five years ago with an increase of 2 per cent., and in the other case three years ago with an increase of 4 per cent. They are not people who have been coining it in at the expense of the public service.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.7/2">I want to wrap what I say in the point that the Minister says is not properly addressed to her but that is properly addressed to the Government, because it is about the degree of commitment that the Government have shown to the legal aid service in this country. I checked the figures and they are as follow. Twenty years ago, in 1987-88, the expenditure on legal aid in 2005-06 prices was &pound;836 million. Ten years ago, it was &pound;2.016 billion&mdash;again, that is in 2005-06 prices. In 2005-06&mdash;the last year for which figures are available&mdash;it was &pound;2.1 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.7/3">The introduction to the Minister's own report in November made the point that in the period between Labour coming to office and now, the legal aid budget has increased from &pound;1.5 billion to &pound;2 billion. I accept that. It is an increase, as the Minister can work out, of 27.2 per cent. between the comparable dates. The health service has had a 100 per cent. increase in its budget over that period. Public order and safety has had a 77 per cent. increase. Education and training has had an 80 per cent. increase. Total Government expenditure on public services has increased by nearly 60 per cent. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1394" name="Dominic Grieve">The hon. Member for Beaconsfield (Mr. Grieve)</phrase> was absolutely correct. In the divvying up of the public expenditure cake, the money going to the third pillar of the welfare state&mdash;legal services&mdash;has creased by significantly less than expenditure on education and health.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.7/4">If our aim is to look after people and give them the right to education, to health care and to the legal service, we need to ensure that we put the case for a greater envelope of expenditure on legal aid, because if we do not do that, the money will not be found. I accept that. We are coming up to a comprehensive spending review, so I am putting the case&mdash;I heard it put by Conservative Members and I heard it put in other terms by Labour Members&mdash;that, in the next review, the legal aid budget needs to be increased significantly if it is to keep pace with the pressure on it. We have more people. We have relatively more poorer people. We have more older people. We have more new immigrant people. We have a larger number of people in our black and minority ethnic communities. The reality is that there will be more demand. I sincerely hope that the Minister understands that point. She has to work within the budget given to her but, to put it bluntly, it is not enough, which is one of the principal reasons for the present difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.7/5">The second reason is the simple proposition&mdash;you understand this, Sir Nicholas, as the Minister does&mdash;that most, or many, cases are unique and require uniquely specialist responses. Of course, some are multiple-issue cases, but some are not. The reality, therefore, is that the fixed-fee system, even with the transitional system, is too rigid. Different communities have different issues, just like different people have different needs. The reality is that fixed fees will offer no incentive to specialise in certain areas. The danger is that the people who are approached will do the routine work, which is easy because one can get it done quickly for the fixed fee, and they will not take on the work that is more difficult and more complex. Who suffers? Not the lawyers, but the people who come to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.7/6">I will be interested to hear the Minister's answers to certain questions at the end of the debate. How many firms will do legal aid? <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" name="Henry Bellingham">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham)</phrase> cited the current number. I agree with him about the figure; we have both been given the same briefings. Several thousand do civil legal aid and several thousand do criminal legal aid, but their number is predicted to go down. Of itself, that may not be a bad thing, but how many solicitors will do legal aid work? What percentage of all solicitors will do legally aided work? It looks as though it will be a significantly smaller number. People have come to me and said, &quot;We will not be able to afford to do it. Our firm will not do this work. I'm sorry. We will opt out. We will go private. We will make more money. It just won't be worth it.&quot; For me, that is not the way the legal service should be going.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.7/7">What will the average pay be of the solicitor who opts to do either all or some legal aid work? The answer is that it will be relatively less than that of those who go only into the private sector. What incentive is that to the graduate who wants to do their social service as a lawyer? The answer is that it is not an incentive, because they will feel the pressure, not only in London, where property prices are high, but in other places, to do something else. They will say that they will not be able to choose to continue to do legal aid work, and that is sad and unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.175.7/8">I ask the Minister, when she reflects on these matters, to examine what will have happened to the pay of the local teacher and the local general practitioner relative to the pay of the legal aid solicitor since Labour came to power. The answer is that the legal aid solicitor will have done worst of those three.</p>

	<p pid="a.178.1/1">As the Minister heard, I introduced what I said and I was specific, by saying that she has introduced a revision to the Carter review. Some measures will come in later and there will be pilots in some urban areas first. There is a delay for further consultation on other areas, such as family law, mental health and so on. I said that at the beginning.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/2">I am outlining the consequences of the most recent proposals&mdash;in this case, in the criminal sector. The Minister will agree that nothing has come since then. I am putting the case that we need a system that is more flexible as well as generally better funded. Lawyers specialising in mental health cases&mdash;an area that is to be reconsidered and re-consulted upon&mdash;might need to consult more than once when examining the same client, because, as the Minister knows as well as I do, mental health patients often have recurrent conditions that mean that they have to be visited over and over again.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/3">I am putting to the Minister the case, which was also put by the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman, that since her November proposals the citizens advice bureaux have been concerned, and still were at the meeting the other day, that many of them will have either to close or to merge inappropriately. In Hammersmith and Fulham there is a federation of local providers, and I am not against such things. A local federation in an urban area is a good thing; however, it is not such a good thing in a rural area, where having a legal aid provider five miles from one's house is no good if it deals only with crime and housing and not with the issue that one wants to take to it. The lack of London weighting will be a particular problem for constituencies such as mine, where a third of the community comes from black and minority ethnic communities and where three quarters of people live in rented housing, and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/4">If the Minister is concerned that we are misrepresenting the case, she must re-examine the impact assessment published by her Department in December. Her Department's figures&mdash;not mine&mdash;make the point that the introduction of a standard fixed fee will be most acutely felt in London and by not-for-profit providers. Some 67.79 per cent. of providers in London and 55.5 per cent of not-for-profit providers will experience a decrease in legal aid income. The same thing applies, although the figures involved are smaller, in Reading, Cambridge and Bristol.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.1/5">Other people have done assessments since November&mdash;these are not our figures. I hope that the Minister will tell us that the impact assessment will be taken into account, because if it is true, it must betoken an adverse consequence. When the current consultation is over, I hope that we will be given an answer that says that that adverse effect will not take place.</p>

	<p pid="a.179.1/1">Of course, we should encourage people to cost the Government, and therefore the taxpayer, the least possible amount. However, some people might not do the big and complex cases or cater for a large immigrant community that does not speak English. The reality is that cases vary. This is a horses for courses argument. I am oversimplifying, but that is the case that has been put.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/2">I am not against a review. I have always argued that we must review public services and ensure that we get good value for money and good practice, but there are threats to the quality outcome. Good solicitors in well respected firms have told me that the danger is that quality will suffer because people will do the easy work, they will do work quickly or they will not be able to spend the time required.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/3">I know from my surgeries, as the Minister and every hon. Member representing a London constituency will know from theirs, that there are complex people who are depressive, suicidal and have all sorts of issues, and who, to put it bluntly, take a lot of time to deal with. The pressures are such that that firms will not be able to take on people like that because they will not have the time to deal with them and because they will not be able to average things out. Such people will cost firms too much over the average.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/4">I want to make two further points, because other colleagues want to add to the argument and, I hope, to the pressure. First, let me repeat the network point that was identified by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase>. The Government's rejoinder to arguments about the network is often, &quot;People, on average, live no more than five miles from a legal aid provider.&quot; The question is: what do we want the provision for? That is why I argue that rather than just taking the Carter proposals, as amended, and having the top-down approach, which is the Minister's and her Government's response, she should seek to agree what should happen with providers, county by county or region by region. It has been suggested that the responses will simply be, &quot;I am sorry. We might like to move away from this, but we cannot move from it at all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.1/5">Let me return to the point on which I began. The Minister said that the reforms do not represent a penny being cut from the legal aid budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.180.1/1">I thank the Minister for that. I was going to say the reforms will cut the criminal budget. I have seen no analysis of the economic impact on mixed firms and the consequences for civil provision of making the cuts in the criminal budget. Secondly, although the reforms to the civil and family side are claimed to be cost-neutral, it seems to me that massive budget cuts will be caused by the switch to national averages, particularly in areas with a high incidence of deprivation, foreign-language-speaking communities or the rest.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/2">Thirdly, the Government have said that even if the Department for Constitutional Affairs had a much larger legal aid budget, they would still implement the reforms. There is always a case for reviewing the system and for reform, but if the Minister goes down the road that she is following, we will probably lose a huge amount of talent in the system. Those people will not then return and we will not recruit the people we need to replace them. The danger is that we will have broken the back of a system that has been built up over 20 or 30 years simply because we have a more complex society with more complex legislation and more complex regulation, and because the lawyers are more needed by the poor than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="a.180.1/3">We are making a case for the poor and the disadvantaged. There needs to be a bigger legal aid budget and a rethink of the system. I hope that the Minister listens, if not to us, at least to the Select Committee when it reports. I hope that at the end of the process we will have a second revised response to Carter's proposals. Carter may have started the Government in the direction that they want to travel, but I hope that they will change direction, because we will get a much fairer system if they do.</p>

	<p pid="a.182.5/1">We are not saying that many things cannot be looked at differently and done differently to help to make the processes more efficient, in the Minister's view. I am not interested in efficiency in that sense; I am interested in the quality of the outcome for my vulnerable constituent who is being helped in a difficult legal case.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/2">There is no question but that the cost of running a legal firm of whatever type in London is higher than in other parts of the country. The Minister may have made some changes to the following idea, but a trainee solicitor living in my constituency told me that fixed fees for attendance at a police station is nonsensical. More experienced lawyers will be far less likely to attend the police station. The more complex the case, the longer needed to interview the client, but the lawyer is more likely to be inexperienced. It all adds up.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/3">Patrick Marbles, director of the Lambeth Law Centre, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/4" class="indent">&quot;I have to say that it is entirely possible for a firm of solicitors to make substantial profit under the proposed new contract. However, to do that they will have to provide a poor service, exclude the socially excluded and their outcomes will be atrocious. This is very bad value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/5" class="indent">In the balance between cost and outcomes, this new service errs wildly on the side of cost constraint. Thus it will provide cheap services but poor value for money. Many private practices and advice centres will be driven out of business by these proposals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/6">It does not really matter how the Minister responds to that, because throughout the Chamber people have been saying that the proposals will have an effect on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.5/7">When will there be a ring-fenced budget for civil legal aid? That is crucial. Customer groups, practitioner groups, citizens advice bureaux, law centres and firms throughout the country oppose the proposals, because they see the reality. I ask the Minister to spend half a day or a day in the law centre in my constituency or someone else's; then let her return to the House and make the same speech as she has made today. I hope that she will listen and that we will see the changes that are necessary if we are to provide a service to our constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-11a.183.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="183"  time="016:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070111/halltext/70111h0006.htm#07011172000491">
	<p pid="a.183.3/1">Ah, yes.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/2">I feel rather sorry for the Minister. She must feel that the time she spent in the summer talking to lots of people could have been better spent on Scarborough beach. It is clear from this afternoon's debate and from the excellent meeting of the all-party group on Citizens Advice&mdash;at which she spoke on Monday, which was very good of her&mdash;that there are some fundamental misunderstandings. For example, on Monday, Citizens Advice said that it was concerned that fees would be paid only in arrears, and the Minister explained that that proposal had been scrapped and that a substantial part would be paid in advance. This afternoon, numerous hon. Members have said that they are concerned that the level of fees would drive not-for-profit organisations and solicitors' firms into bankruptcy, and the Minister said that that was an impossible position, because the fees had not been fixed so how on earth could anyone predict them?</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/3">The Minister said today and to the group on Monday that cost is not an issue. Like every Minister in every spending Department, she said that she would like some more money, but she said that cost is not an issue. If it is not an immediate issue, might I suggest that she delay the implementation of the proposals by six months, or at least until the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs has had the opportunity to report? Otherwise, the proposals will be implemented against a background of opposition, some of which may simply be misplaced and misunderstood. It may be in her interests and in those of good order to delay implementation for some time, so that the proposals can be introduced in a better way.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/4">I should welcome the Minister's thoughts on another point that came up on Monday. I do not entirely understand how one ties in not-for-profit organisations, such as citizens advice bureaux, and high street solicitors, so that they provide our constituents with advice that is complementary and supportive rather than competitive. I hope that I speak for middle England, as I represent two large market towns and several villages. Under the proposals, each town should have at least two firms of solicitors&mdash;a matrimonial dispute would be difficult, otherwise&mdash;that provide legal aid, and one citizens advice bureau. How will one ensure that the bureau's work complements and reinforces the work of the solicitors? How will they work together so that, for example, the organisation that is best at litigation&mdash;the high street solicitor, rather than the citizens advice bureau&mdash;undertakes the work?</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/5">The Minister said that she will not discuss community legal service strategy, but it is difficult to explain the totality of the proposals to the House, to the profession and to the country without discussing it. On Monday, I had the impression&mdash;I am sure that others did, too&mdash;that the Minister was talking about community law centres funded by the state. The Minister nods, so I heard her correctly. I hope that the situation does not arise whereby&mdash;for example, in Oxfordshire&mdash;there is only one centre: in Oxford. For my constituents, Oxford is light years away: for a pensioner or a single mum living on a housing estate in Banbury, getting to Oxford is like getting to the moon. Will the centres be outreach centres? If so, in a patch such as mine, cannot they work collaboratively and in the same location as the citizens advice bureaux in Banbury and Bicester? They will be doing pretty much the same thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/6">We have not heard much about the role of local government. Until now, it has funded citizens advice bureaux pro bono, because it thinks that they are a good thing. Will local authorities be asked to stump up more money for the community legal services strategy? They must understand whether it will happen and where it fits in.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/7">The Minister said on Monday, and again repeated today, that sometimes the quality of work in citizens advice bureaux or the not-for-profit sector is not as good as it might be, not least because&mdash;I think she said&mdash;people go in with one problem and it is not always established that they have a multitude. Whether or not one is a lawyer like myself or like the Minister, when people come to us with a problem, we must assume that they will divulge it.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/8">If the Government are concerned about the quality of advice, what more can they do to help with training? After all, everyone who works in a not-for-profit centre is a volunteer, and often they do not have a legal background. In these days of online, television and DVD training, the Department should give more thought to what it can do to train and enhance the training of such workers, and it should do so in a way that enhances, reinforces and complements the work of high street solicitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/9">I have been on my patch for 23 years, and I notice distinctly more immigration cases and asylum seekers&mdash;even in Banbury. I suspect that they are new to citizens advice bureaux and to high street solicitors. Given the experience in Paddington and elsewhere, it would be better if there were departmental training for citizens advice bureaux in Banbury and Bicester.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/10">I fear for what will happen if the proposals are rushed through and they go wrong. I put that point to the Minister on Monday. In criminal law, any problem will be picked up quickly, because magistrates, their clerks, stipendiary magistrates or Crown court judges will tell the Department that the proposals are not working. My concern is much more with civil law, where if services just atrophy, it will take time before anyone picks up the problem. If services disappear for whatever reason and the Minister's best endeavours do not work, how will we know? How will we know that a single mum on an estate in Banbury is not gaining access to the legal advice that she needs? The service will just wither away.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/11">On Monday, the Minister said that she would set up a stakeholders' group, which is very good news and in accord entirely with her general approach of embracing and including people in the process. By definition, however, many stakeholders will be organisations based in London or other big conurbations and will have their own policy objectives. So may I make a very humble suggestion to her? Depending on how one looks at it, the country is organised into either Government offices, such as the Government office for the south-east, or circuits. It might be sensible for her to ask either a recently retired circuit judge or a silk to monitor civil legal aid in each of those areas, so that solicitors, practitioners and others with problems and those who think that things are going wrong will have a focus and someone whom they can telephone and tell, &quot;You might just like to know that this is going wrong&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.3/12">Today's debate and Monday's meeting of the all-party group on Citizens Advice, which was ably chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">the hon. Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase>, demonstrated something of a dialogue to death. People are concerned that the Department is not listening to their concerns. When this system is introduced, we must be confident that, three, six or nine months down the line, we will not have coming to our constituency surgeries people failed by the system. I and, I hope, other Members would have much greater confidence if we felt that an objective and independent person&mdash;not a stakeholder&mdash;was monitoring the situation, reporting back to the Minister and saying, &quot;Look, in the north-east, this seems to be working&quot;, or &quot;In the south-east, this is working, but some bits in the more rural areas are not&quot;. That way we could all be confident that there was transparency in and oversight of the situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.0/1">Before I kick off, I declare an interest: before entering Parliament, I was a solicitor and the firm that I co-founded did a lot of publicly funded work.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> alluded to the all-party group on Citizens Advice, of which I am a chair. The Minister was the first chair of that group, and it would be churlish not to pay tribute to her for the work that she has undertaken in turning up to our meeting this week and having an honest and candid discussion with parliamentarians and for the tour of the country that she has undertaken since becoming a Minister, during which she has spoken to those with an interest and expertise in this subject. She has also made changes to the proposals first set out in the Carter review in November.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">My hon. Friend the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> is right: there is a synergy between this discussion and that in the Chamber, which is where I was before coming here. To answer a question put by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" name="Henry Bellingham">the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham)</phrase>, there are similar numbers of Members in both debates. When this debate kicked off, three Conservative Back Benchers were present, and there are four in the Chamber for the debate on social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/4">I have received, as I am sure other Members have, massive representations about the future of legal aid from the advice sector, consumer representatives, practitioner groups and, of course, constituents. I accept that the legal aid system is in need of reform, particularly in high-cost criminal cases. However, there is a danger that, rather than paying attention to that aspect of legal aid, the proposed changes could lead to experts in law firms and law firms themselves, law centres and the not-for-profit sector ceasing the sort of work to which Members have referred. Such work is necessary, if for no other reason, so that we can provide a place to go for those who turn up with their carrier bags.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/5">A point also needs to be made about access to justice. My hon. and learned Friend the Minister spent her career before entering Parliament committed to and&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;obsessed with access to justice. There is a danger that the proposals could have unintended consequences and lead to a reduction in such access. I accept that the intention is not to save costs overall; she said that reform would be needed, even if no savings would be made as a consequence.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/6">I shall deal with private practice and the not-for-profit sector. On private practice, my hon. and learned Friend knows that the Law Society welcomed the Carter review and said that there has long been a need for an overhaul because the current system falls far short of providing access to justice and tackling social exclusion. So she has allies in the Law Society, as well as in many other groups. I am afraid that, with a finite budget, if expenditure on criminal legal aid increases, the amount of money left for civil and family legal aid will come under increasing pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/7">High-cost criminal cases should have been the target of most of the changes, particularly in relation to the Bar&mdash;the Minister might lose a lot of friends if she agrees with that. We know from the press and questions answered in Parliament the cost of some criminal QCs to legal aid expenditure. Some cases, such as those for fraud, have a disproportionate impact on the legal aid budget&mdash;the cost is humungous. I suspect that, if we reduced the money taken up by that small number of cases, a huge sum would be released to a large number of clients, the not-for-profit sector and private practices, which would help more vulnerable people. Huge savings could also be made in experts' fees, including disbursements, which is a problem and leads to conflicts when practitioners choose experts.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/8">My hon. and learned Friend has alluded to and tried to deal with my concerns about ethnic minority practitioners and clients. I urge her strongly to keep an eye on that because I am concerned about it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> referred to another concern: where tomorrow's legal aid lawyers will come from. That is a real concern for a number of law centres and private practices. My hon. and learned Friend needs to think about that because the motivations that she and I had when beginning such work will not survive if law centres cease to practice in certain areas, and private practices cease publicly funded work, even though there are noble people today willing to do such work. As has been referred to by Members, it is important to disentangle practitioners and lawyers who undertake publicly funded work from the sort of lawyers who, rightly, get flack in the media for the huge, gravy train fees that they charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/9">On the not-for-profit sector, I know that my hon. and learned Friend has taken on board all the concerns that have been expressed by citizens advice bureaux and law centres up and down the country. Today, she received a letter from the chief executive of the CAB, which welcomed some of the reassurances that she gave on Monday at the meeting of the all-party group. The five areas of concern, which remain, relate to fixed fees, payment structures, fee arrangements for multiple-issue cases, outreach services and London waiting, which has been alluded to by colleagues. I shall not repeat those comments because that letter is in front of her.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/10">In conclusion, the intentions of the Government and my hon. and learned Friend are laudable. However, some of the unintended consequences of the changes outlined will be devastating to some constituents, particularly those in deprived areas such as the constituencies represented by myself and by colleagues present. There is a real danger that, by not providing legal aid and advice at an earlier stage, more costs will be incurred in the long run, whether in debt, immigration or social welfare cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/11">The stakeholder monitoring body, to which the hon. Member for Banbury referred, will need to ensure that it is beefed up, that it reports sooner rather than later and that it takes into account any consequences that were not predicted, so that we do not face a situation in which lawyers and practitioners leave that area of law and so that, in six years' time, we do not have to pump more money in to try to recruit more people, because others have left owing to the changes that we have announced.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.2/1">I shall pay due heed to that, Sir Nicholas. I declare an interest, in that I am a practising criminal solicitor. I should also like to add to the list of visits for the Minister. If she would care to join me on a duty period at Enfield magistrates court or at a police station any time and see the reality, she would be very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/2">The Minister said that we need to look at the reality now. I encourage her to do that and to bear with me. She said, boldly, that the proposals are not a cost-cutting exercise and do not affect the vulnerable, but she has heard from Labour Members and other hon. Members how plainly that is not the case for a range of issues. The practitioners and the experts on the ground have also said that she is misdirected and not in touch with reality, which I say with due respect to her experience in publicly funded work.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/3">I should like briefly to consider the reality now, because we are not simply dealing with challenges to publicly funded work over recent months, during the Carter review or following other proposals. We must consider the context of the past few years. This debate is quite properly about the future of legal aid. Small and high street practitioners, particularly those in areas of great need and who deal with vulnerable defendants, have already had to ask what the future of legal aid is. Many had come up with an answer even before the implementation of Carter&mdash;that there is no future and that, as I said in an earlier intervention, the writing is on the wall.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/4">Despite the Minister's quoting various figures about the lower fees that will be increased under the proposals, a number of practitioners in Enfield and Hertfordshire have had to give up publicly funded work in recent years, particularly in family law and immigration. There is also no publicly funded education solicitor in Enfield to deal with such work. That is a direct result of the lack of proper pay increases and the Government's intentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/5">In the past two months, two firms of solicitors have given up publicly funded work in crime. Those firms are well known for providing a good service, which goes beyond the fee structure. They care for clients and are part of the system of criminal justice that provides the integrity that is much admired not only in this country but further afield. Those two firms have seen, to use the Minister's words, the direction of travel, which is certainly not in the interests of the vulnerable or of a proper service.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/6">To stay with crime, if the Minister is so sensitive to publicly funded work and to the consultation results and seeking to modify Carter, why is she not then sensitive to the fact that lower court costs have been under control for some years? Her Department has confirmed that there is that control, which is quite remarkable given the escalating costs of legal aid. There has been a control over lower court costs in crime for some time, which is not surprising in many ways, because quality control has been there for some time. It has been carried out by many solicitors without the need for the Legal Services Commission's eye. No doubt the contracting regime of franchising has brought rigours with it. As I know from being part of that process, as we have ticked the boxes and sought to convince Legal Services Commission of the quality of our service, there has been a control, which has had an impact. Indeed, it can be seen from the Department's figures that there is the necessary control in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/7">Why then does the Minister say that we still need to prove efficiency? Does efficiency still need to be proved in lower court costs and in magistrates courts' work? How many more hoops do criminal solicitors need to jump through? We are now into the area peer review, and there are certainly further hoops to come under Carter.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/8">The cynical might say that the early suggestion that there should be a 100-firm reduction in London&mdash;effectively, a brutal cull&mdash;is, in fact, what is happening. They might say that, under the premise of weeding out those who do not provide the quality service that we all want, the reduction is not so much a weeding out as a driving out of many firms. That is indeed what is happening. A number of firms are giving up on publicly funded work, particularly lower courts work, although we must also consider what is to follow. When the Minister talks about seeking proof of efficiency, many on the ground would say that proof of lower costs is what she really wants. That is the reality that I ask here to reflect upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/9">The Minister has already reflected on one of the major impacts that has been felt over the years. In the debate in Westminster Hall on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-26">26 October 2005</phrase>, she referred to the profound effects of legislation and to the impact that has been referred to by my hon. Friends and by other hon. Members. On that occasion, she referred to the target of 1.25 million offenders being brought to justice by 2008, which represents an increase of 150,000 on 2003 levels. She made no reference to the impact on defence legal aid as a result of that. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.188.2/10" class="indent">&quot;The point is a pretty simple one: no one seems to cost the implications for defence legal aid of new legislative change. That is silly.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-26">26 October 2006</phrase>; Vol. 438, c. 73WH.]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-11a.189.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="189"  time="016:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070111/halltext/70111h0007.htm#07011172000497">
	<p pid="a.189.1/1">I suggest that I am not out of date about the impact of the legislative change on firms and how they operate their business. That is the point that I am making. The change has had a profound affect on the ability to provide a service to defendants properly, as one straddles the different legislation on sentencing at a youth court, for instance. One only has to go down to a youth court to see the burden placed on the work of providing a proper service to defendants and to the criminal justice system at a rate that has not been increased for many years. That point relates to what the Minister said in October 2005, which still has relevance, as we still see a never-ending supply of additional legislation and variations.</p>
	<p pid="a.189.1/2">Another example, which the Minister did not go into in our previous Adjournment debate on the matter, is the means test. The means test has had another profound effect and placed a burden on the criminal justice system, not only on defence solicitors, but on courts and Crown prosecutors trying to meet their targets, with a number of delays occurring. Only last week the prosecutor at Enfield magistrates court told me, &quot;We just can't meet the targets, because of the number of inevitable delays from the processing of these forms&quot;. I have with me examples of such forms&mdash;pages of them. I understand that even Carter expressed great dismay in his business model about the bureaucratic process of dealing with the forms, including the finance statement, which have to be completed by clients who are often vulnerable and have difficulties in doing so. They are left by themselves to deal with such forms and often lack adequate representation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-11a.191.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="191"  time="016:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070111/halltext/70111h0007.htm#07011172000502">
	<p pid="a.191.2/1">Just before Christmas, I was fortunate enough to introduce a debate on legal aid under your chairmanship, Sir Nicholas. I shall try to be brief and not reprise those arguments.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/2">Generous and persuasive though the Minister was in her response to that Adjournment debate, she left me unconvinced on some critical points, many of which have been emphasised again this afternoon. I should like to add to them. From my perspective, particularly as a constituency MP, the gravest concern still relates to the adequacy of the arrangements for London. Both in the December debate and today, my hon. and learned Friend has drawn attention to there being winners as well as losers under the proposed arrangements, in my constituency and London more generally. On the basis of the information that I have received so far, I am unconvinced by that argument, although I could be convinced if I had the information to support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/3">The situation is equivalent to those in many other areas of public service about which we have heard in the past; education is a particularly good example. There are three primary schools within 100 yards of each other in a deprived area of my constituency, and their results vary hugely. Ministers have asked why those three schools, which are all in the same neighbourhood, cannot produce the same results. I said it then and say it now&mdash;the answer is intake, intake, intake, and the same point applies to what we are discussing today.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/4">One school will have three times as many children eligible for school dinners, five times as many children with non-statutory special needs and twice as many children for whom English is not a first language. Unsurprisingly, the school's results are different. The Minister said that in my constituency just over half the providers are likely to gain under the proposed scheme, but again I say &quot;intake&quot;. Is it possible to convince me&mdash;I am willing to be convinced&mdash;that those gainers are truly representative of the clients about whom we have heard? Are we genuinely saying that under the existing arrangements all providers are taking an equivalent proportion of those whom we have described, I hope sympathetically, as the &quot;carrier bag&quot; clients? I do not believe it. Certain providers, such as solicitors, law centres and citizens advice bureaux that I know, deal with a much higher proportion of clients whose first language is not English, who have mental health or alcohol problems, who are drug addicts or ex-prisoners, or others with multiple difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase> would love to have spoken in this debate, but he is speaking in the Committee on the Greater London Authority Bill. He has said that the issue is about not people with multiple cases, but about single cases involving a client with a compounded series of challenges that makes it hard for them to present their case coherently. That might be because of the bundle of papers, lost documents or the time it takes to go through details with the client.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/6">We have all seen such cases at our constituency surgeries; I am sure that the Minister has. Sometimes, a client's case is potentially quite simple but they are completely incapable of making it and are resistant to explanations of how they can present it most effectively. The time and effort involved is profound. I have been convinced that the doors of some providers are more open than others; as it stands, the system will operate against their best interests. I say this kindly: if I have a choice between believing what my law centres, citizens advice bureaux, specialist advice agencies and quality solicitors say about the impact of the changes&mdash;they have said it this week on the basis of the &quot;Legal Aid Reform: The Way Ahead&quot; document, not only Carter&mdash;and believing in a national Government mechanism based on averages, I know which I will choose.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/7">The Minister says that half my providers will win under the new contract, but I am at a loss to know where they are. I am not hearing from any of them. People are not saying to me, &quot;For heaven's sake, be quiet because we are going to gain under the new arrangement&quot;, as happened during discussions of the GPs' and consultants' contracts, but I would have expected someone somewhere to have done so.</p>

	<p pid="a.193.1/1">I declare an interest, having practised 20 years as a solicitor in family and criminal law, and 10 years at the Bar. Both practices were publicly funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/2">In her opening speech, the Minister proved why she was a prominent silk before she came to this place. She gave a brave and expert presentation of a poor case. Something is very wrong when Members coalesce across the political spectrum. We are all worried about one thing: vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/3">In a written answer to me on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>, the Minister said that two thirds of legal aid practices had disappeared since 1997. That is a worrying statistic. Unfortunately, the proposals will only make things worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/4">The Access to Justice Alliance made several important points in a helpful briefing. It referred to people taking only the shorter cases and common-sense stuff because of the fixed fees&mdash;the more complicated cases will be left alone. We have heard about language problems and so on, and there is also the Welsh language dimension in north Wales. According to the Law Society and the alliance, there is also a likelihood that the proposals will impact badly on ethnic minority groups, which is the last thing that any of us want.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/5">The proposals will not help in exceptional cases&mdash;in other words, those to which the uplift applies. Firms will be worried about whether they will in fact reach the exceptional cases threshold and therefore be properly and adequately paid. Action against Medical Accidents referred to advice deserts&mdash;it can envisage that happening&mdash;standard fees being totally unacceptable, downsizing and people leaving criminal negligence work.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/6">The Minister received a letter from the president of the Gwynedd Law Society on <phrase class="date" code="">12 December</phrase>. For the record, I was once the president of the Gwynedd Law Society; it is clear that standards have risen since then. The letter states that although there is no difficulty with a critical mass of clients,</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the critical mass of service providers could be a problem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/8">The astonishing fact is that there are only nine publicly funded criminal practitioners for four constituencies in north Wales, and it is believed that that number will be reduced even further. There is no point in talking about mergers, because the firms that wanted to merge have already done so for economic reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/9">Specialist family law solicitors have come to me desperately worried about what will happen. They will leave that area of practice and, unfortunately, young children in danger of being taken into care may not be properly represented. I am sure that that is the last thing that any of us, including the Minister, wants. In a largely rural area such as north Wales, only a small number do such work now. Unless the proposals are changed substantially, the impact in that area will be ruinous. I have used the word &quot;vulnerable&quot;. There is nothing more vulnerable than a child who may be taken into care. I am worried and, more importantly, senior members of the judiciary told me over the Christmas period that they are desperately worried, and they are not normally bolshie people who oppose for opposition's sake.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/10">I doubt whether the proposals make a great deal of sense for an urban setting, but they will be ruinous in a rural setting. I know that the Minister has considered rurality, and I thank her for that, but further consideration must be given to that point. Unfortunately, outreach in rural areas is unlikely to be any kind of answer. Who are the providers who will travel from Chester, Liverpool and further afield to deal with housing and difficult work in north Wales? I venture to suggest that that will not happen. Even if it were to happen, where are the economies if they are paid travelling expenses?</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/11">I ask the Minister whether the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Shelter, Citizens Advice, Access to Justice Alliance and Mind are wrong? The Minister says, &quot;Yes.&quot; Fine, she is absolutely right and they are all wrong. Those groups do not normally queue up to hit the Government, but they are vehemently against the proposals, and with good cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.1/12">As I said, I doubt very much whether the proposals are at all reasonable in an urban setting, but their effect will be appalling in a rural setting. I remind the Minister again that added to the groups of people who oppose the changes are the senior judiciary in the family courts in north Wales with whom I have spoken. They are desperately worried.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.1/1">Thank you, Sir Nicholas.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/2">Like others who have spoken, I represent an inner-city constituency. I welcome the fact that we are debating legal aid, I welcome the Minister's commitment to legal aid, and I welcome the principle of legal aid. We should be proud of it. It could be considered a continuation of the principles of the welfare state&mdash;a means of ensuring that everyone has equal access to justice. It is important that we emphasise and stick with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/3">As someone who has represented an inner-city constituency for a long time, I am depressed about the increasing difficulty that many of my constituents have in getting any kind of advice about anything. Sadly, there were more advice facilities in my constituency 25 years ago than there are now. The number of law firms that do legal aid work is decreasing, so the pressure on the remaining ones is increasing, as is the pressure on them not to take the complicated and difficult cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/4">A large number of legitimate asylum cases fail simply because the applicant has great difficulty finding anyone to represent them first time round, or because, if they find someone to represent them, it is an immigration adviser who does an incompetent job. The case is effectively lost from the beginning, as I am sure colleagues will be aware, because of the incompetent representation. Those cases end up in our constituency advice bureaux. I did an advice bureau this morning and exactly such a heartbreaking tale came up. We see the strong case of someone who well merits asylum in this country but that case is likely, tragically, to be lost. I look to the Minister to recognise that.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/5">I have been contacted by a number of local legal aid firms and I shall cite a letter that I have received from Burke Niazi, a local firm with 98 per cent. of its work in legal aid. It calculates that in mental health cases the firm will suffer an overall loss of 48 per cent., in child care cases a loss of 50 per cent., in housing cases a loss of 58 per cent. and in welfare benefit cases a loss of 59 per cent. I know that the Minister will say that the firm and I are scaremongering. I am not; I am repeating what a reputable local firm has told me that it estimates will happen. What is wrong with that?</p>

	<p pid="a.196.2/1">What is wrong is that those calculations are not based on reality. There are no fees fixed for any family work, nor for any mental health work. Any concerns that have been expressed in that way are out of date and are based on the Carter fees. I can understand why, because the Carter fees were fixed where they were, people are apprehensive, but such a calculation is utterly impossible because they do not know what will come out next.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">With permission, Sir Nicholas. I am most grateful to hon. Members for all their contributions to our debate. I shall try to deal with them in turn and quickly, though I am not sure that I shall get through them all.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/2">I shall deal first with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1729" name="Jim Cousins">the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Jim Cousins)</phrase>. If a lawyer takes on a case before the means test has been determined, he is entitled to be paid to represent that person. That is called early cover; it entitles the lawyer to be paid for representing someone prior to the decision. If the decision on means is an adverse one, the lawyer will get that money; if the decision is positive, the lawyer will get the full fee. Lawyers have a guaranteed payment for early cover.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/3">I shall not go into detail about the minutiae of the means test. Under the Tories, people had to produce 13 pay slips in court. We now have a hot link to the Department for Work and Pensions, which is in use a good deal of the time. When solicitors co-operate it works quite well, and it has dealt with more than 120,000 applications. I have a meeting every week at which I receive feedback, and take-up is improving all the time. In the major conurbations, where there is proper competition among solicitors, and in not a few backwoods places, it is working well.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1737" name="Henry Bellingham">The hon. Member for North-West Norfolk (Mr. Bellingham)</phrase> says that the fees for lawyers have not gone up&mdash;however, their income has. I cited an example in my opening speech; rather than repeat it, I refer the hon. Gentleman to <i>Hansard</i>. We have new legislation and an increasing number of offences. I support many of them&mdash;including those under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 and the Sexual Offences Act 2003&mdash;and they are all absolutely desirable. Plenty of research shows that such legislation is not the main cost driver. I refer the hon. Gentleman to Cape and Moorhead; I also mentioned them during a previous Adjournment debate at which he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> were present.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/5">I am sorry to hear that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> is indisposed. I do not know much about the situation on the island. I happily invite the hon. Gentleman to write to me about the particular problems there. Niche suppliers, small suppliers and black and minority ethnic suppliers should have absolutely no difficulty. If a major supplier wants to bid for large number of cases, there is no reason why they should not; they have specialists of all kinds at their disposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/6">The public defender service has been cited. Its current accounts show that it is pretty competitive. It has a future. It is as independent as private solicitors, if not more so, in respect of the advice that it gives in police stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/7">There has been talk of the declining number of practitioners in civil cases. There has been some decline in the number; but as I said earlier, the amount of advice given has risen by about 20 per cent., which shows that, although there are fewer practitioners doing the work, those involved are giving much better value for money. We should remember that they are doing it on fixed fees. There is nothing wrong, therefore, with fixed fees. I attended the Immigration Law Practitioners' Association annual general meeting, and the association will have some input when we reconsider the fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/8">I do not rise to the bait of being called unrealistic. I know that I am personally well grounded; I also know how much time I spend going around to talk to not-for-profit practitioners in meetings and privately; and, of course, I am close to all of those in my constituency. Realism is not a characteristic that I lack.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/9">I accept that a number of virtuous organisations have concerns; they have, of course, been driven by the Law Society, which has told them that solicitors are likely to withdraw from the kind of work in which they need their help. They will have taken that on trust. I see no more than that in what they say. I hope that they will read the report of our debate and that they understand that they need not worry like that. I say again what I have said in many different ways throughout the debate: that campaign started before the document that we are debating came out, and it was based on fees that are no longer applicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/10">Mental health law will be reconsidered, but I must tell the hon. Member for North-West Norfolk and other hon. Members who referred mental health that about a half of mental health work is now done by mental health lawyers who chose to do it on a fixed-fee basis. They clearly find it profitable and are able to deal with the most vulnerable and difficult people. They are obviously able to run satisfactory businesses. They were not compelled to do it; they volunteered to do exactly that.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/11">Forgive me for not being able to pin this point down precisely, but there was talk of the number of asylum lawyers falling. The number of asylum seekers has fallen far faster than the supply of lawyers, and there is still a good core of asylum practitioners. We are confident that they are improving. I was sorry to the hear about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the experience of my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>. The general sense is that those who were incompetent have now left the business, and that it is time to start devolving more discretion on payments to those who are left. There is a separate system for that, but it is not directly part of our debate. I hope that I have alleviated some of my hon. Friend's concerns.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.1/1">I hope that my hon. Friend will not mind if I do not give way, but I do not have much time.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/2">Just to take a joke against myself, I note that the Carter report states that RAF Bulmer is in South Shields. Coming from that geographical location, that would mean something to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central, but these things do happen. My hon. Friend was concerned that there was no attack on high costs cases. They are being considered&mdash;indeed, they were considered first&mdash;and the inquiry is ongoing. Two Committees are considering the matter to speed up procedure and to look at the way in which such cases are billed. Make no mistake about it, we will not only streamline the courts but investigate every place where, in the context of the changes, there appears to be an incompatible excess of payment. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1878" name="Sadiq Khan">My hon. Friend the Member for Tooting (Mr. Khan)</phrase> mentioned experts fees, and we are looking at those as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">My hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> asked for evidence. I shall give her what evidence I have, but from what I have seen, I can say that there are often two not-for-profit organisations in an area that the Legal Services Commission regional offices&mdash;they have a close relationship with those organisations&mdash;see as being fairly identical in terms of social deprivation and need, and that one will take significantly longer to do the same kind of work than the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/4">I pay tribute to the sector, but I can tell my hon. Friend that we have been driving up productivity. I have already said that 50 per cent. of suppliers, including in her constituency, will gain from the changes immediately. If we looked at that figure a year ago, probably 19 per cent. fewer would have been gainers, because they would have been much less competent. We have been driving competence and productivity up by requiring not-for-profit people to undertake cases as though they were on a fixed fee. Instead of being paid &pound;55,000 for 1,100 hours, they have to do a fixed number of cases. That is how productivity has risen.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/5">It is all about productivity. As far as one can see, there is nothing, except efficiency, to distinguish two suppliers in the same area whose times for completing particular kinds of case are vastly different. We are keen to roll out good practice. The transition will be important for not-for-profit organisations and everyone else, but it must be done carefully.</p>
