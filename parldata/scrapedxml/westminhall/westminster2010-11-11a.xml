	<p pid="a.149.1/1">I have a whole series of examples of hospitals and services that are threatened with closure or reductions in services from right across the length and breadth of the country, which was highlighted in a recent report in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>. I have the whole list, so I agree with the valid point that my hon. Friend makes forcibly.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.1/2">After only six months in power, the coalition is putting the proud record of the previous Labour Government on the NHS in jeopardy. On top of this, feedback from the front line shows that the Government are removing the safeguards and patient guarantees that drove down waiting times and assured the same quality of care irrespective of where a patient lived. This is not a Government protecting the NHS. It seems as if this is round 2 of what the Tories never managed to accomplish in the 1980s: to break up and privatise the service.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.3/1">I do indeed. My hon. Friend makes an important point. Another is the impact on the NHS budget of the VAT increase that is to be implemented on <phrase class="date" code="2011-01-01">1 January 2011</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/2">Kieran Walshe, professor of health policy and management at Manchester business school, has criticised the coalition Government's approach of making change without evidence. The implementation of the massive reorganisation that is set out in the White Paper will need at least another &#163;3 billion in addition to the sums already identified, such as for wage costs, inflation, and the increase in VAT. That is at least another &#163;3 billion from the NHS coffers, and the plans were still being altered after the coalition agreement was published. The decision to abolish primary care trusts seems more like a last-minute whim of the Secretary of State than a well-thought, evidence-based approach to health service reorganisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/3">Professor Walshe said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/4" class="indent">&quot;the transitional costs of large scale NHS reorganisations are huge...projected savings from abolishing or downsizing organisations are rarely realised.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/5">Those of us who have been involved with local government will appreciate how true that is. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Closing down or merging organisations produces a round of expensive redundancies, early retirements, and redeployment, while new organisations find new premises and appoint lots of new staff.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/7">I echo the concerns of Mencap-I am grateful for its briefing-which states</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/8" class="indent">&quot;As the government have still been unclear about the transitional and ongoing costs for moving to the new commissioning arrangements, this settlement may not be sufficient to deliver against needs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/9">In contrast, the Secretary of State still believes that he can save money by carrying out the biggest reorganisation in the history of the NHS. Indeed, on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-02">2 November</phrase>, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/10" class="indent">&quot;We are cutting management costs in the NHS by 45%. We will cut total administrative costs as well, and in total that will save &#163;1.9 billion a year by 2015.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-11-02.759"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 November 2010; Vol. 517, c. 759</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/11">Will the Minister tell us what account has been taken of the unknown costs of the reorganisation?</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/12">Professor Chris Ham is the chief executive of the King's Fund-the Minister's favourite organisation. He questions why the Government would</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/13" class="indent">&quot;embark upon such a fundamental reorganisation as the NHS faces up to the biggest financial challenge in its history.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/14">Is it not the case that Ministers should be honest with the public? The impact of the spending review will mean deep cuts to vital services in the NHS. When the Health Secretary delivered his White Paper to the House, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/15" class="indent">&quot;The dismantling of this bureaucracy will help the NHS realise up to &#163;20 billion of efficiency savings by 2014, all of which will be reinvested in patient care.--[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-07-12.663"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 July 2010; Vol. 513, c. 663</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/16">Coalition Minsters are trying to give the impression that health provision has somehow been protected by a real-terms increase in the health budget, but that myth is starting to unravel. The coalition Government have admitted that current levels of health care will not be maintained. They are undertaking a massive reorganisation and all the evidence suggests that the projected savings will not be realised.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/17">Edward Macalister-Smith, the chief executive of NHS Buckinghamshire, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/18" class="indent">&quot;the amount of money that is available from administrative savings, management savings and the financial back office, is a very small proportion. Most of the money is spent on clinical care. If you want to reduce your spending, make your spending more efficient, that is, I am afraid, where you have to concentrate.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/19">It is simply not possible to achieve the sort of savings that the Government have outlined. The settlement for the NHS will come no way near maintaining current health care levels. Some &#163;1 billion is being taken to plug the hole in social care. Many more billions are being wasted on a wholesale reorganisation, and the coalition seems to have agreed to take a gamble with the &#163;80 billion NHS commissioning budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/20">According to research carried out by the King's Fund, the VAT rise to 20% from January next year will cost the NHS an additional &#163;250 million a year. Furthermore, additional pressures will be placed on the NHS, thanks to the massive cuts that are being levied on local government budgets. There are also serious concerns that cuts to local government will lead to a shortage of hospital beds as the elderly and vulnerable are left without local care, thus placing even greater pressures on the NHS. The 26% cut in central Government funding for local authorities will pile on the pressure for the NHS. Nigel Edwards, the head of the NHS Confederation, has warned that the pressure on beds could mean that hospitals will be unable to admit patients &quot;who badly need care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.3/21">It is wrong for Ministers to pretend that their reorganisation will improve service delivery or that it is possible to save &#163;20 billion through efficiencies alone. They should be honest about what they are doing to our national health service. The Government are not keeping the promises that they made to patients and staff to protect NHS health care funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.152.2/1">It is good to be here this afternoon under your chairmanship, Mr Gale.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/2">First, let me congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40222" name="Grahame Morris">the Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris)</phrase> on having the foresight to table this subject for debate. The Minister and the rest of those present will be pleased to know that I shall not be quoting from the King's Fund during this debate-yes, I see that he is quite pleased about that. Instead, I have a brief from the Nuffield Trust about the likely effect of the comprehensive spending review on health, on top of what we have just been discussing. My hon. Friend talked about a 0.5% increase over four years, or something like that, but the Nuffield Trust argues at one level that there might be a bit more to it. Let me go into the brief it published last month, although it is not related to this particular debate:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The 2010 Spending Review announced that the NHS will receive 0.4 per cent... growth over the next four years-0.1 per cent a year. This compares to an average real-terms increase of 5.7 per cent per year from 1997/98 to 2009/10. This is the lowest four years' increase for the NHS since 1951-56. The Spending Review also allocates &#163;1 billion a year from NHS funding to social care. The real-terms change in NHS funding, net of the social care support, is therefore a reduction of 0.5 per cent over the next four years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/4"><i>[Interruption.]</i> The Minister says that that is rubbish. Perhaps he can stand up and tell us whether he disagrees with it. I want to continue with this brief and ask him about something that is directly related to this. The next paragraph states:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The Spending Review also announced important changes to the treatment of past underspends.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/6">Many of us will know from talking to the NHS locally over the past few years that, because of the generous funding over the past decade, there are such things as underspends. The brief continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Health has accumulated underspends of &#163;5.5 billion, of which &#163;3.7 billion is classified as 'resource' (ongoing expenditure on staff, medicines, equipment and the like) and &#163;1.8 billion as capital. There is also a planned underspend for 2010/11 of &#163;1 billion. According to the Spending Review, these accumulated stocks-known as end-year flexibility (EYF)-have been abolished. This means that any previous underspend that is honoured by the Department of Health will have to be made within the settlement outlined in the Spending Review.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/8">Will the Minister tell us whether the current underspends that our primary care trusts, or perhaps hospitals, hold at the moment-I hope they will be spent on expanding services, as they have been over the past decade-will be clawed out?</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/9">The other issue that I would like to raise is relates to the changes in commissioning. I am in a peculiar position on this. Some Members will know that I chaired the Health Committee in the previous Parliament. In March, we brought out a report on commissioning. The Government responded some time in July. When the Secretary of State was on the Floor of the House making his statement on the White Paper, he talked about the Health Committee and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Before the election, when it had a majority of Labour Members, the Select Committee on Health said that PCT commissioning was weak and that it was not delivering what was intended. He set up a programme called world class commissioning-it never worked.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/11">He was replying to the then shadow Secretary of State for Health. The Secretary of State went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/12" class="indent">&quot;Central to delivering better commissioning in the health service is ensuring that those people who incur the expenditure-the general practitioners, on behalf of their patients-and who decide about the referral of patients are the same people who&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/13">blah, blah, blah, blah. In reply to a comment from the current Chair of the Health Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40158" name="Stephen Dorrell">the right hon. Member for Charnwood (Mr Dorrell)</phrase>, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/14" class="indent">&quot;In his capacity as Chair of the Select Committee on Health, we will be responding to him very shortly regarding the Select Committee's report from before the election on commissioning... What he has just said is absolutely right; we have been able-this is a central task in commissioning-to bring together the responsibility for management of patient care with the responsibility for the commissioning of services.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-07-12.665"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 July 2010; Vol. 513, c. 665-66</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/15">I have mentioned that because he has used my name on at least two occasions on the Floor of the House, basically to say that the report on commissioning that we published supports GP commissioning. I want to put it on record that, in my view-it was obviously my draft report and it was not challenged at the time-it does not support GP commissioning in the way that the Government are bringing forward the changes in commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/16">We looked at four areas in that report, in relation to commissioning: whether to abolish PCTs and reintroduce health authorities; retain PCTs but introduce more integrated care; retain PCTs but introduce local clinical partnerships, under which GPs would directly control commissioning; and retain PCTs but commission services from hospitals. There was also the option to retain and strengthen PCTs. We did not come to a hard conclusion on any of that. I will not bore this gathering with the conclusions we did come to, but it is a gross misrepresentation to say that we were arguing for GP commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/17">Maybe the nearest scenario that we looked at was the one in relation to local clinical partnerships. The Nuffield Trust informed us:</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/18" class="indent">&quot;There are key changes to the policy environment that are required if commissioning is to stand a chance of becoming effective.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.152.2/19">That was one option, but local clinical partnerships, as we quoted in the report, look very much like the system of GP fund-holding, which had failed to improve commissioning, in our view and that of many other people. We also said that it might be expected to have the advantages and disadvantages of that system.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.0/1">I had nothing to do with the interventions, Mr Gale, apart from giving way. There is no plan or plot. I thought I would seize the opportunity to talk about the commissioning report, because the current Health Committee is looking again at commissioning and the House has not had the opportunity to debate the report and the Government's response, which came in July.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.0/2">In relation to the latest intervention, at the last Health Question Time the Minister attempted to reply what I said about major reorganisations in the health service. It is well known now that they take years to embed, are normally very expensive and usually have a negative effect on performance while they happen. That has happened under every major NHS reorganisation in the last 20 or 30 years. That is the truth of the matter. If the estimate of the increase in costs arising from the reorganisation is right, the CSR will have a significant impact on the NHS in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-11a.163.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40651" speakername="Rosie Cooper" colnum="163"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101111/halltext/101111h0001.htm#10111168000428">
	<p pid="a.163.1/1">I share my right hon. Friend's view. Alder Hey, which is adjacent to my constituency and serves my constituents, will be similarly affected. We are taking a worrying direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/2">On &quot;No decision about me, without me&quot;, the Secretary of State said to the Select Committee that</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the conclusion that we reached was that we could achieve democratic accountability more effectively by creating a stronger strategic relationship between the general practice-led consortia and the local authority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/4">Many people might imagine that that would mean patients being at the heart of decision making and that consortia would operate with councillors, the public and non-executives on the board with a vote. However, that will not be not the case. The scrutiny will come from well-being boards. The fact that they will not be at the table and will not have a vote means-as with the current local authority overview and scrutiny arrangements-they might as well not be there. In the Health Committee, I said that such a situation was like throwing snowballs at a moving truck-in other words, the decisions and views of the well-being boards would make little or no difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/5">In reality, the Government are giving the NHS budget to GPs, many of whom just want to practise medicine, rather than get involved in this giant policy experiment. There will be no testing; it will just be a big bang. The Government will use the consortia as a shield to deflect criticism, rather like the way they are currently using the Liberal Democrats. There are rumours that the Prime Minister is getting worried about all of this. I can only hope that that is true.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/6">The warning signs of what this means for the national health service are already apparent. There was an 80% increase in bed blocking in hospitals between May and September. I expect that that situation will only get worse, especially when the cuts to local government budgets really start to bite. Hospitals are once again increasingly becoming the safety net when the funding for social care has been used up. If a local authority cannot afford to provide the necessary care, people will end up in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/7">Questions were asked at the Health Committee about reserves held by NHS organisations and how they would be treated. Primary care trusts are beginning to refuse to provide certain treatments. We have also had announcements on the future role of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, which will no longer advise on drug treatment and is moving towards value-based pricing. Will the Secretary of State control the drug companies pricing policies or, as most people think, will the drug companies shortly be back in control? We will soon be back to postcode prescribing and, more worryingly, we are making the availability of drugs a political rather than a clinical decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/8">When I hear Government statements about their commitment to the quality of health care and delivering outcomes, my thoughts return to the fight between myth and reality. The idea that front-line services will not be affected seems somewhat delusional. During questions at the meeting of the Health Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2010-10-26">26 October</phrase>, it became apparent from a witness giving evidence that hospital closures would be necessary to release moneys back into the wider health service. We were told that that was part of &quot;managing demand&quot; and &quot;redesigning care pathways.&quot; I have heard those two phrases throughout my health service attachment and they are very much back in vogue at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/9">The failure adequately to address the true budget requirements of the NHS will not deliver and continue the quality of care that patients expect and need. These are short-term measures that have long-term consequences. They are ill thought out and will have major ramifications for the people who rely on access to vital health services. For those people, such services are a lifeline. Nobody is pretending that nothing can be improved in the health service. However, does it have to be subject to untested reorganisation while we are trying to manage increasing demand in the current financial climate?</p>
	<p pid="a.163.1/10">The Labour Government were rightly proud that they reduced waiting lists from 18 months to 18 weeks. It took 13 years of proper investment to turn the NHS around, and it is a service that we should rightly be proud of. My fear is that Conservative policies could destroy all that hard work within a matter of 13 months. I agree with the comments of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase> about the &quot;broken promises&quot; of the coalition. My fear is that those broken promises will lead us headlong into a broken NHS-or is that the intention?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-11a.170.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" speakername="Ian Mearns" colnum="170"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101111/halltext/101111h0001.htm#10111168000438">
	<p pid="a.170.0/1">This is a very recent <i>Sunday Telegraph </i>report. I am glad to hear what the Minister says, but it is not the real issue for the area-that is the replacement North Tees hospital. As the Minister told us in a previous debate in this very Chamber, a brand new hospital worth &#163;450 million, with brand spanking new service facilities, will be sacrificed for the grand sum of &#163;11 million a year over the life of the hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/2"><i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Hexham, North Tyneside and Wansbeck hospitals in Northumberland: Casualty units would no longer take ambulance cases if a new hospital is built near Cramlington.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/4">The Hexham hospital provides A and E services for people in a large constituency. I would not like to be dragged backwards by my hair between that consistency and Cramlington, because it is an awfully long way. There is a great deal more in the article.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/5">The health service in my constituency is unrecognisably better than the one that we inherited in 1997. I would like to place on record my personal thanks to the staff of the neurosurgery unit at Newcastle General hospital, without whose efforts I would not be standing here today, because I had neurosurgery on my spine about 22 months ago. The Queen Elizabeth hospital in my constituency is now a very well regarded resource for the region and has a regional surgical support unit. Our other primary care facilities include the successful Gateshead smoking cessation service, which has reduced the prevalence of smoking-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am not having a go at the Minister; I really mean that. However, the service is important to my constituents. We have reduced smoking rates in my constituency with its help from some 35% just over 10 years ago to about 21%. That is vital to the life expectancy of many thousands of my constituents. There is great concern, worry and uncertainty about what the future holds for such services as a result of the Government's decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.170.0/6">The spending review will force deep cuts in patient care as the Government focus on a wholesale NHS reorganisation that will negate many, if not all, of the efficiency savings. I have real concern about commissioning, in that we will see GP practices coming together and then outsourcing to some fairly significant global players. Those players will take over the services on a local basis-they are out there, ready and waiting. It is not in the interests of patient care for money to go out of the public sector as profit for those companies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-11a.174.10" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40294" speakername="Derek Twigg" colnum="174"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101111/halltext/101111h0001.htm#10111168000461">
	<p pid="a.174.10/1">I will carry on and we will take this up later during the Minister's speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/2">Will the Minister make clear whether the money has been ring-fenced? What what will be the impact on local services of the 28% cut in councils' budgets over the next four years, which was announced as part of the CSR? We must not forget the increase in VAT to 20% from January, which several of my colleagues mentioned, which will do little to enhance the NHS's spending power. It is little wonder that the King's Fund feels it necessary to warn:</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/3" class="indent">&quot;slashing budgets and cutting services should not be the answer to the financial challenge facing the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/4">I cannot allow the Government to get away with another disastrous decision for the NHS and it will be interesting to see what the Minister has to say about this.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/5">The NHS has accumulated &#163;1.8 billion of capital and &#163;3.7 billion of revenue underspend. It would normally be allowed to keep that money to reinvest in patient care or to help deal with future overspends, but the CSR has abolished end-of-year flexibility. Perhaps the Minister would like to deny that or tell me that we have got it wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/6">What estimate has the Minister made of the number of job losses and redundancies in the NHS that will occur as a result of the CSR? What will be the impact on waiting times in the spending review period? What is his estimate of the number of nurses who will be employed in the NHS at the end of the spending period? What measures has he implemented to deal with winter pressures? How many specialist nursing posts will be left vacant at the end of this financial year? I have many other questions. We do not have time to go into them now, but I shall be tabling a lot of written questions for the Minister to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/7">We now move on to another broken promise in the context of the CSR, which has been the subject of a fair bit of comment. An ideologically inspired, top-down reorganisation of the NHS has been proposed. It has been put forward in defiance of the coalition agreement. The approach is untested and threatens the viability of the NHS. I remind hon. and right hon. Members that the coalition agreement says:</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/8" class="indent">&quot;we will stop top-down reorganisations of the NHS&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/9">another broken promise. Here is a straight question for the Minister: why, as many believe, did his party hide their plans for such a massive reorganisation from the public? Why did it make no mention of the scale of the proposed changes in its manifesto or election campaign? This is the biggest reorganisation in NHS history. The King's Fund estimates the actual cost at some &#163;3 billion, and that is at a time when the NHS can ill afford it. The British Medical Association has stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/10" class="indent">&quot;these proposals risk undermining the stability and long-term future of the NHS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/11">What is the Minister's latest estimate of the financial cost of the reorganisation, and will he publish the rationale underpinning the assumption for those costs?</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/12">The coalition talks about reducing waste, but the 45% cuts in strategic health authorities and primary care trust management will save just &#163;850 million of the &#163;15 billion to &#163;20 billion of efficiencies that are required. I could not agree more with the words of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/13" class="indent">&quot;This reorganisation is untested and unnecessary. It is high cost and high risk. At this time when finances are tight, all efforts should be bent to making sound efficiencies and improve patient care. We are in favour of giving clinicians greater responsibility and patients a greater say in their healthcare. NHS experts, professional bodies and patient groups say 'slow down', because this big reorganisation is a big risk for the NHS.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/14">Trade unions such as Unison, the RCN and Unite, who represent many who work in the NHS, have raised genuine concerns, but we do not believe that the Secretary of State is listening to what is being said.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/15">As part of these changes, there is danger of fragmentation, of more of a postcode lottery and of doctors' time being diverted from their main role of looking after their patients. We need to know the extent and nature of future private sector involvement in running the health service. How and to whom will organisations be accountable? How can we deal with current overspends in organisations, which my right hon. Friend the Member for Tottenham mentioned?</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/16">Will the Secretary of State and the Chancellor listen to the appeal of patient groups, Royal Colleges practitioners and other health staff, or is he bent on setting his face against the view from the coal face-from the same professionals whom his party's manifesto says we should trust to deliver services?</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/17">I want to mention another important issue: the proposed stealth cuts to the funding of specialist children's hospitals, which will affect the hospitals that treat some of the most severely ill children in the country. The Prime Minister promised that the health budget would be &quot;protected&quot;. In an interview with Andrew Marr on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-02">2 May 2010</phrase>, he said that he</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/18" class="indent">&quot;would not accept cuts to the NHS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/19">It is unarguable that specialist children's services are the front line, so even that is not being protected. This is another promise broken by the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/20">The Secretary of State is not being straight on this matter. During oral questions on <phrase class="date" code="2010-11-02">2 November</phrase>, he told my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> that the hospital that my right hon. Friend asked about would face a 2% cut under the proposed tariff changes. That is bad enough, but it is contradicted by the trust's own assessment of those changes, which suggests that they will bring about much larger cuts. Will the Minister set out-I ask him this carefully-what the situation is and how much funding the hospitals will lose?</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/21">I will give a couple of examples of the figures that we have received from the hospitals involved. Great Ormond Street hospital, which is in the constituency of my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras, will face a cut of &#163;16.3 million. In Birmingham, the cut will be &#163;12.8 million, and at Alder Hey hospital, on the doorstep of my constituency, it will be &#163;12.9 million. Will the Minister confirm what the funding cuts will be and how much those hospitals will lose? What figures have the hospitals provided to the Department in their assessments of the cuts? Will he make public any assessment that has been sent to his officials about the impact of the tariff changes?</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/22">I do not feel that Liberal Democrat or Conservative Members have realised the true extent of what the coalition Government are doing to the health service and the impact that it will have on their constituencies. Perhaps they are not in the Chamber because they find the measures difficult to support. As the impact of the health cuts becomes clearer, I believe that hon. Members will become more worried and will seek answers to the broken promises of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.174.10/23">There have been broken promises on NHS funding to protect front-line services, and broken promises about structural change. Hon. Members might ask why the Secretary of State is forcing the NHS into a major reorganisation that costs valuable time and resources at a time that the King's Fund and the NHS Confederation have called the biggest financial challenge of its life. I assure the Minister and the Secretary of State that we will hold the coalition Government to account for what they have said and what they will do.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-11-11a.186.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" speakername="Simon Burns" colnum="186"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm101111/halltext/101111h0002.htm#10111168000529">
	<p pid="a.186.0/1">I fully understand the issue that the hon. Lady raised about whether we merge the NHS part of social care in local government into the NHS, or vice versa. That has been an ongoing debate for many years. The hon. Lady may find it difficult to believe, but 13 years ago I was the Minister with responsibility for Social Care. The argument was raging then. I have no doubt that it will continue to rage for some time to come. I, too, have heard the worries that the money that comes through the RSG will not be spent on social care. From the discussions that the NHS has had with local authorities, I have been led to believe that that will not be such a problem. Given that there is a problem with social care and a need to provide support, there will be a determination and a positive attitude to ensure that the money is appropriately spent on what it is designed for and that it will, with the money from the NHS, make a significant difference to a very serious and sensitive problem that we, as a society, have to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/2">In conclusion, the spending review is the necessary consequence of this Government's facing up to the financial responsibilities and problems that we inherited when we came to power. If we are to secure a future of growth, prosperity and jobs and if we are to fulfil our commitment to increase funding for the NHS in real terms for every year of this Parliament, then we must place our public finances on a stable, sustainable footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.0/3">We will not ask the sick, the disabled or the elderly to pay the price of the previous Government's economic mismanagement. We are increasing the health budget in real terms and reforming the service, not only to make the most of every penny but to put power in the hands of those who know best how to improve services. I am talking not about the Ministers and civil servants in Whitehall but about the NHS staff and patients on the ground.</p>
