<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.231.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" speakername="Linda Gilroy" colnum="231"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0001.htm#09020462000458">
	<p pid="a.231.3/1">Again, my hon. Friend makes a good point. Community land trusts have been seen as part of the answer to rural housing. Representing an urban constituency as I do, I believe that they are also a part of that, and I am sure that the tensions that he discussed will show themselves as we go forward. However, community land trusts have the capacity to involve their members. I hope that through the learning process of managing, the Homes and Communities Agency, to which I referred earlier, will develop national vocational qualifications that will help the people involved. It is the old co-operative ideal of education. I hope that it will help them to foresee things and relate to their communities appropriately.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/2">My interest in the potential of community land trusts was given fresh impetus by a housing inquiry that I carried out in Plymouth last year and the report that came out of it, &quot;Homes for the Future: 21st-Century Solutions for Plymouth&mdash;Putting rungs back on the bottom of the housing ladder&quot;. That inquiry started as a result of my meeting a constituent with a young family who had been asked to move five times in five years by a number of different private landlords. She was not a bad tenant, just the victim of insecure short-term housing. Some of her neighbours had other housing challenges that I wanted to understand, as I realised how much the housing market in my city was changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/3">I had two specific aims in the housing inquiry. The first was to ensure that we in Plymouth go as far and as fast as we can to provide housing that meets demand, especially in respect of affordability. The second was to inform continuing development of national policy legislation and regulation. My inquiry resulted in several specific recommendations, all of which are directed at maximising the availability of housing across all tenures in Plymouth. The advent of the Homes and Communities Agency, set up under the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, has created an environment in which many of those recommendations can be pursued. Many of the provisions in the Local Democracy, Economic Development and Construction Bill announced in the Queen's Speech will also help to carry forward improvements, particularly in the rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/4">One of the key findings of my housing inquiry was that there was a significant gap in housing supply and affordability between those housed by the city council, by housing associations or by registered social landlords because of priority housing needs, and those who find their own housing through renting from private landlords or buying on the open housing market. Of course it is important that private landlords are encouraged to provide good-quality, well-managed homes for rent in the private sector, and my inquiry report outlined how that sector might be encouraged and improved further, but for many in housing need, neither the private rented sector nor buying on the open market is an affordable option. My report concluded that we need to put rungs back on the bottom of the housing ladder.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/5">Since last summer, when my report was published, there have been significant falls in the housing market. Even so, the ratio between house prices and average earnings in Plymouth, which was one of the worst in the country, remains high. In 2008, the average house price in the city of Plymouth was eight times average earnings. Notwithstanding the downturn in the housing market, the national housing and planning advice unit predicts that affordability in Plymouth and the south-west will continue to worsen until 2026 unless there is an increase of affordable housing supply to meet the demand arising, as we know, from demographic changes affecting the UK and the rest of the developed world. Supply is out of kilter with demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/6">To many, of course, the fall in house prices is welcome, as it brings the possibility of buying or part-buying a home within reach. However, I am advised that house prices in Plymouth would have to drop by more than 50 per cent. before many hard-working households aspiring to home ownership could fulfil their dreams. Heaven forbid that that should happen, as it would bring all sorts of other mayhem in train, but the pressure on social housing and the private rented sector will remain great and must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/7">That reality led to two of the report's key recommendations. There is a pressing need to restore some rungs at the bottom of the housing ladder by creating a supply of permanently affordable housing in the intermediate housing market. A permanently available supply of homes at a price between the cost of social rented housing and open market purchased housing is desperately needed to create a greater range of affordable housing choices for those in need of a decent home.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/8">It is desirable in Plymouth to develop, in addition to current homebuy products, a range of affordable intermediate housing market products that will remain permanently affordable. That will help to create communities that are sustainable in the longer term, as it will enable many households currently excluded from the open market to finance part of the value of their homes and to own a property asset. That will allow them to do that in a way that will remain affordable from one generation of occupants to the next.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/9">Community land trusts could play a large part in responding to those conclusions. They can take land out of the market, capture the uplift in value for a local community and harness that community's talents through an openly governed and accountable democratic organisation. That contributes to increasing housing supply in a way designed to be permanently affordable and sustainable. CLTs can do so on their own or, as I recommended in my report, in partnership with a local housing company.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/10">A partnership being developed in Plymouth between the local housing company and the local community through a community land trust could help to ensure that the additional homes produced by the local housing company are not sub-market with the potential to become unaffordable and destined to move quickly into the open market, but are genuinely affordable, in compliance with the definition of affordable housing set out in the Government's supplementary guidance to planning authorities in planning policy statement 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/11">Developing new forms of permanently affordable intermediate market housing is not easy. It is never easy to float new ideas, particularly at a time when the global economy is facing major challenges due to the volatility in the financial markets, but it is precisely because we face major challenges that new ways of increasing the supply of affordable housing and maintaining activity in the construction sector of the economy are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/12">Last week, the Co-operative party, of which I am proud to be a member, launched a pamphlet in its &quot;Politics for People&quot; series that made the case for a new form of co-operative intermediate market tenure. The pamphlet is entitled &quot;New Foundations: unlocking the potential for affordable homes&quot;. It proposes the development of mutual home ownership on land owned by community land trusts. As in a unit mutual property trust, members of the mutual own equity shares in the property in which they live. The more they earn, the more rent they pay and the more equity shares they own.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/13">The Co-operative party's case is based on three central propositions. The first is that the global financial crisis has fundamentally changed the world in which we must work to meet the affordable housing needs of our nation. Gone are the days when mortgage finance from high street lenders was readily available. The loss of &pound;1,800 billion&mdash;there would be nine noughts after the 1,800 if the figure were put out in full&mdash;in the global financial crisis means that, for the foreseeable future, mortgage finance will be in shorter supply. Commercial lenders will, of necessity, return to the old canons, lending to low-risk borrowers buying on the open market, who can afford a deposit of at least 15 per cent. of the property's value. I was talking to someone who works in that sector at a Federation of Small Businesses dinner last night and he suggested that buyers could be more commonly asked to provide a deposit of 25 to 27 per cent. of the property's value.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/14">Secondly, because of the financial crisis, if we are to meet the demand for affordable homes and to maintain activity in the house building sector of the economy, including the associated manufacturing industries and their skills bases, we need to find new sources of finance for affordable housing development. The Co-operative party's pamphlet explains how co-operative mutual home ownership has the unique potential to be an attractive investment for pension funds. That is because it can be structured to guarantee long-term investors a fixed annual yield on their investment to match their liabilities and it is also designed to remain permanently affordable, from one generation of occupants to the next.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/15">Thirdly, mutual home ownership treats a home not as a speculative investment but as a consumer durable. Like a car or a washing machine, a home has a value that is consumed over its useful life. In the case of a house, I am told that that useful life is about 65 to 70 years. The view expressed in the Co-operative party's pamphlet is that one of the consequences of the global financial crisis is that the days of speculative house inflation, driven by unwise and badly regulated lending practices along with easily available cheap loans, have passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/16">Adopting the Co-operative party's proposals in &quot;New Foundations: unlocking the potential for affordable homes&quot;, which provide the basis for co-operative mutual home ownership on land owned by community land trusts would be a win for the Government, because it would increase the supply of affordable housing and maintain activity in the construction sector of the economy. It would be a win for pension funds and other long-term investors, because it would offer them a fixed annual yield on their investments, irrespective of inflation and secured on the value of the housing that they invest in. It would also be a win for communities in need of affordable housing, giving them an opportunity to contribute their energies and efforts to secure its provision. Finally, it would be a win for the environment, because environmentally sustainable elements of design and construction can be financed over the full 60-year term of the investment in the mutual homes, rather than needing to generate a short-term return for each individual owner.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/17">There is a growing body of evidence showing the success of co-operatives and of other forms of mutual ownership. It is a common form of ownership in other countries, such as Sweden, Norway, Germany, Austria, Canada and elsewhere around the globe. In addition, research commissioned by the recently established Commission on Co-operative and Mutual Housing, which is independently chaired by Adrian Coles, the director general of the Building Societies Association, has shown how co-operatives and mutual forms of tenure promote social, environmental and sustainable communities, which is just what my hon. Friend the Minister, who is responsible for the Homes and Communities Agency, is looking for.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/18">I urge the Minister to look at the evidence from the Commission on Co-operative and Mutual Housing and to consider the case made by the Co-operative party in its new pamphlet. I ask that he responds positively to the representations made to his consultation paper on community land trusts by the experts working with local communities, to remove the barriers to the development of community land trusts. In particular, there is a need to reform the leasehold enfranchisement provisions in the Leasehold Reform Act 1967, so that homes built on land owned by community land trusts can remain affordable in perpetuity, putting those vital rungs back at the bottom of the housing ladder.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/19">I also ask the Minister to proceed as a matter of urgency with the exemplar community land trust and mutual home ownership pilot projects, to demonstrate their potential. Finding ways of assessing the value for money of permanently affordable housing in the intermediate housing market would be helpful, if it were done on the basis of cost per affordable housing year rather than the crude capital subsidy cost per unit. That would reflect the value to Her Majesty's Government of having such a stock of permanently affordable housing. I also ask him to ensure that Government policies for community land trusts empower local communities to use them as a means of meeting their needs for affordable housing and other needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/20">Finally, I ask the Minister to work with the co-operative movement to put in place arrangements that will encourage long-term institutional investors to invest in mutual home ownership and, in particular, to consider underwriting a national insurance fund to guarantee such long-term investment in affordable homes, which would be controlled and owned by the communities that they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/21">In the time that we are privileged to serve our constituents in this place, many ideas come to our attention and demand our advocacy. Of all the things that have come to my attention in the 12 years that I have been the MP for Plymouth, Sutton that might change my constituents' lives for the better, community land trusts must be one of the most significant. We desperately need something that will halt the slow-down in house building that was set in train by the credit crunch, which was inspired by the American sub-prime crisis. We need the homes and also the work that is associated with building homes, selling them, moving into them and furnishing them. We need the money that was speculative and created a bubble&mdash;a bubble that was bound to burst and has now gone forever&mdash;to be replaced, at least in part, by new, different and more trustworthy sources of money that can flow into the housing market, particularly into the affordable housing sector, which will be competing for loans in a more crowded space and from more risk-adverse lenders. Similarly, pension funds and insurance funds are looking for safe and sustainable places to invest their funds, which will guarantee steady yields.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/22">Community land trusts have a unique role to play in putting those two pieces of the jigsaw together, in a way that would begin to build the picture that people are crying out to see. It would be a picture that shows that there are new ways out of this nosedive, led by trustworthy sources, and that shows there is a bit of ethically-based competition to the banks in some of their traditional stamping grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/23">Just as we are looking to innovation to create the jobs of the future, I urge the Minister and the other Ministers in the Department for Communities and Local Government not to be risk-adverse but to be innovative, and to make those two needs match up to address one of the greatest challenges that we face in constituencies the length and breadth of the United Kingdom and, indeed, further afield too.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.236.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" speakername="Oliver Letwin" colnum="236"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0002.htm#09020462000459">
	<p pid="a.236.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> on securing this debate. I agreed with much of what she had to say. I want to add a number of points. The first is that in my constituency, in the village of Buckland Newton, where we have had experience for some years now of trying to develop a community land trust, some features of the scene have emerged. Some of those features have been alluded to in the debate so far, and we all need to attend to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/2">The first of those features of community land trusts is the difficulty of ensuring that there is sufficient professional help to take these projects from conception to realisation. The great virtue of the community land trust is that it is a community idea; it springs from the bottom up. However, the great difficulty when things spring from the bottom up is that a cadre of professionals are not necessarily available to help turn the very good ideas into reality. The experience of Buckland Newton clearly shows that we need to work on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/3">The second feature that has emerged is the contrast between that small village in my constituency and the towns in my constituency; no doubt that contrast also exists between that village and cities in other constituencies, although I do not have any cities in my constituency. Buckland Newton benefits from having a development boundary and therefore from having the potential for exception sites that lie outside the development boundary, which can be exploited by a community land trust to provide cheap land and to make the housing built on that land intrinsically more affordable. Not very far from that village in my constituency is the town of Lyme Regis. Because Lyme Regis happens to exceed a certain size, it does not have the potential for an exception site and therefore the same economic dynamics do not work there. So, as I say, the second feature that has emerged for me is that we need to attend to the question of how we enable community land trusts from lower land values than are charged to private developers.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/4">A third feature has become evident, to which I referred in my intervention, and on which I think the hon. Lady and I agree. My attention was engaged by a remarkable phenomenon some years back, and since then I have been besieged by people asking me to represent them in their efforts to prevent housing from being built in their areas. I am sure that a poll of all Members who represent rural and suburban constituencies, and perhaps even urban ones, would show that they have had a similar experience, so my situation is not unique.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/5">I suspect that local councillors all over the country have been elected on the presumption that they will help to prevent new housing in their areas. However, those local councillors, as well as we Members of Parliament and successive Ministers and Administrations, have all accepted that there is a huge need for housing in the UK on a trend basis. I accept that there is not a huge demand for housing at the moment, other than social rented housing, for obvious reasons, but we will get through this situation eventually, and then we will be back to the trend of having an excess of demand over supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/6">We all recognise the bizarre tension between what we know in the aggregate and what we experience in the microcosm. What was remarkable about Buckland Newton was that, because it sprang from the bottom up, the village came together and the very same people who I am pretty sure would otherwise have been at a large meeting objecting to the houses in prospect, were demanding that they be built. That offers the potential to unlock something that the present and previous Governments have desperately sought to unlock&mdash;as, no doubt, will future Governments: the ability actually to build houses, rather than merely have targets but find that no more houses are built. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>, who produced the recent report, has focused on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/7">I really believe that a bottom-up approach can liberate us from the ghastly tension of local feeling versus national need, because people in villages, towns and city neighbourhoods, who feel that a community land trust will be useful to their relatives, children and grandchildren, will have a different feeling about the houses that are then built. They will see the social utility of those homes directly, and will therefore vote for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/8">The last point I want to make about the Buckland Newton experience is one that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made in an intervention on the hon. Lady about the connection between community land trusts and parish councils in villages, or the new urban parish councils in urban settings. It is absolutely vital that there should not be the tension that he described, but a coalescence of the two sides. Unless the democratically elected representatives of a location are in tune with the efforts of the CLT, we will not unlock the potential of this movement. This approach should bring people together, not force them apart.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/9">Those of us who represent rural constituencies will have come across cases in which the village hall committee is locked in mortal combat with the parish council, which is unproductive. It is when the two come together that the village hall is renewed. The same is bound to be true of CLTs. We have to bring them into some kind of symbiosis with locally elected representatives. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1917" name="Grant Shapps">the Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, who speaks for the Conservative party on this issue, has had discussions with me and others about this issue for some time, and I suspect that it will be one of the main subjects that his admirable taskforce will cover. We need to find a way of putting those things together, and I am sure that this can also become a matter of political consensus.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/10">I should also like to approach this issue from the national point of view, rather than in relation to my Buckland Newton experience. It is absolutely clear that as a result of the amendment that was accepted in what became the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008&mdash;as a small dose of partisanship, I must say that my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield and the Conservative party in the House of Commons probably had quite a lot to do with that, although the hon. Lady very skilfully put it in a different way&mdash;the Homes and Communities Agency is starting to take on board the idea of community land trusts. I welcome that enormously.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/11">It is also clear that this issue is to some degree counter-cultural, by which I do not mean that Ministers are anything other than enthusiastic about it. I suspect that down there, through the spreading bureaucracies over which Ministers preside from an Olympian height, there is still quite a lot of doubt and hesitation about this newfangled idea. They are sort of used to registered social landlords, and it is inevitably the case under any Administration that large bureaucracies will like to deal with large bureaucracies because they are used to large things. These small, bottom-up enterprises pose certain difficulties for bureaucracy, and it will require a certain amount of political will&mdash;in the sense not of party politics but of elected politicians&mdash;to get the bureaucracy as a whole to recognise that CLTs are not a marginal, interesting and rather terrifying development, but part of the wave of the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/12">My last point is that we are not just being nice when we talk about community land trusts, which are of the essence and are not a point of dispute between the three major parties. CLTs will not survive, prosper and multiply, or become an enormous feature on the scene, if they are like the nationalisation and privatisation of steelworks, coming and going with Administrations as they favour or disfavour them; the approach has to be persistent across time. We have a wonderful opportunity to put together something that will last, although it will no doubt vary over time, and that can be sustained because it has combined political will on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/13">However, a danger of which we all need to be aware lurks in that magnificent consensus. The two worst pieces of legislation for which a previous Conservative Administration were responsible are the Child Support Act 1991 and the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, which were passed without opposition, and there is an uncanny connection here. If everyone is enthusiastic about the idea, as we all are, no one adopts the position of sceptic, and there is then a danger that we will move in directions that have not been sufficiently inquired into. I hope that while we exhibit all the enthusiasm that we need to exhibit, we will also retain our sense of proportion and accept that there will be all sorts of difficulties on the way. We need to maintain our critical faculties and ensure that we develop this idea in a way that is robust and that allows for the possibility of objections and changes rather than simply assuming that it will be plain sailing because we all agree on the essence of the idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.236.0/14">It is perfectly possible to combine consensus and appropriate, constructive scepticism, but it requires an effort of will. That is one reason why I welcome so strongly the taskforce that my hon. Friend the Member for Welwyn Hatfield has set up, and the pilots in which the Government are engaging. Pilots, taskforces and inquiries&mdash;and, indeed, the reports of the hon. Lady and the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell&mdash;are very useful devices. We need to open this subject up and get people to comment on it. This must not become a private event inside the House of Commons that gets steamrollered through because we all agree on it. We need to do things in a way that is open, debated and discussed. There will then be a real prospect that in 20 years' time we shall regard this as the moment when we began a process that transformed the housing landscape of Britain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.239.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="239"  time="010:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0002.htm#09020462000460">
	<p pid="a.239.0/1">It is a delight to take part in this debate. I am aware that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> wants to speak, so I shall keep my remarks as brief as possible, particularly as he was very helpful to me when he listened to my plaintive pleas on behalf of community land trusts in rural Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/2">Let me pay my respects to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>, a fellow &quot;Co-operator&quot; who is a doughty campaigner in this area. It is important to give credit for the work that she does locally and nationally. We could argue about who tried to get CLTs into law, but they are now in the law, and we welcome the fact that that definition of them now exists. I pay due regard to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1917" name="Grant Shapps">the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, who has visited Cashes Green, which, without making any understatement, I intend to speak largely about. My hon. Friend the Minister has also been, and remains, very helpful. He keeps a weather eye on that site, which I shall not describe as bedevilled, although there are some problems with it. I hope that my comments will help to take the debate forward. I do not demur from what my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton has said about the wider context of CLTs, and I pay particular respect to David Rodgers, who has been so helpful to me in trying to get the Cashes Green community land trust under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/3">Why do I spend so much time on the Cashes Green site? Not only is it in my constituency, but it is an important model that we have to deliver because of all the ramifications that there will be if we do not. I am pleased that the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield has visited the site and has spoken to Gloucestershire Land for People. I pay due regard to those who have driven GLP forward: the two Martins&mdash;Martin Large and Martin Alder&mdash;Max Comfort and Jan Bayley. However, others have also played a part.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/4">Why is it so important that we are able to deliver the Cashes Green community land trust? As the Minister knows better than me, there are 14 community land trusts, including at least one in his constituency. He therefore has a practical handle on what is going on. I believe that Cashes Green is still the largest initiative being introduced, and I have seen it from its infancy. When the then Minister for Housing, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1848" name="Keith Hill">the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill)</phrase>, was looking for sites to move from the NHS to English Partnerships, which was the ownership body, I persuaded him to include Cashes Green&mdash;I, among others, claim ownership of that idea.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/5">Cashes Green was a classic site. It was disused and difficult to develop and it therefore seemed sensible to consider its being used in this new form. From the outset, I stress that Cashes Green is in the more urban part of my constituency, so it is not a truly village concept. However, if the initiative can work in Cashes Green, it can work in many of the villages across the country, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase> rightly alluded to.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/6">I shall quickly go through some of the issues that the Cashes Green initiative has unearthed, and hopefully the Minister will consider them&mdash;even if he does not do so today. There are ongoing problems that have to be resolved. As I said, it was pleasing that Cashes Green was considered to become one of the community land trust pilots. In 2006, we completed the project feasibility study on behalf of GLP and submitted it to English Partnerships, which is, of course, now part of the Homes and Communities Agency. After initial support for Cashes Green being a pilot CLT on the mutual home ownership model&mdash;to which my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton has alluded&mdash;sadly, in mid-2007 English Partnerships advised GLP that it could not proceed with the project as planned because it did not offer value for money. The way in which that has been measured is debatable and, as land prices have crashed, has become even more so.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/7">The problem has been that although there are those of us who see the scheme as an excellent form of intermediate housing market provision, English Partnerships compared it with other forms of low-cost home ownership, principally New Build HomeBuy. It measured value for money according to the full site value. That was about &pound;3 million, as opposed to what English Partnerships paid to the NHS, which was &pound;1 million. Site values have of course fallen and that might be helpful, but the value for money calculation currently being used is very simplistic, if not crude.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/8">In comparison with the open market value of the site, which would deliver 30 per cent. of the units as affordable under a section 106 planning agreement, the GLP proposals would produce an additional 27 affordable homes. English Partnerships calculated the cost for the additional affordable homes provided by dividing the site value&mdash;some &pound;3 million&mdash;by the 27 units. Surprisingly, it came up with the figure of &pound;111,111 as being the cost of this form of model. Both David Rodgers and I feel that that is highly simplistic and has been a pall over this site. It has made it difficult to deliver the mutual home ownership model for our community land trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/9">We believe that a real cost assessment has not been made and that the real cost should be nearer to &pound;60,000, which was in the original proposal. No one was pretending that this site was going to be given for free; that would be illogical and would not help future community land trusts. We know that there has to be a land subsidy, because that is the way in which we bring community land trusts forward, and that is what we are asking of the private sector. We are asking private landowners to accept that these sites would not necessarily come forward otherwise. They should therefore bring them forward on the basis that they would take something of a hit on the site value that they are helping to deliver. That is the nature of our criticism and so far we have not been able to resolve the matter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.245.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" speakername="Sarah Teather" colnum="245"  time="010:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0003.htm#09020462000468">
	<p pid="a.245.0/1">This interesting debate has been different from the kind of debate that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1917" name="Grant Shapps">the hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, the Minister and I usually engage in on Wednesday mornings, which is when we regularly debate housing. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> on securing this debate. I want to acknowledge from the outset her report and the report of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>, which are helpful additions to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">Liberal Democrats have been championing community land trusts for a long time&mdash;long before others became so keen on them&mdash;and I am absolutely delighted that there is now cross-party support for them. I was relieved when the Government agreed to cross-party representations to have them added to the Housing and Regeneration Act 2008, and I acknowledge the contribution of the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton in ensuring that that happened.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/3">The hon. Lady clearly laid out the issue around need. She spoke about the case in her constituency that provoked her to begin work on her report. Both she and my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell spoke about house prices. The fact is that falling house prices have not actually increased affordability for many of my constituents and many people around the country, because the issue is affordability of credit. The hon. Lady made the point very well that we would require a substantial drop in house prices in many areas for affordability to become a reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/4">The real danger is that if we do not keep pace with house building during this period when credit is drying up, we may experience hyperinflation later. Need does not go away just because mortgages dry up. People still want to be able to buy or rent houses, and the fact that they are finding it difficult to access credit does not mean that need disappears. The danger is that when lending comes back on stream, we will get back into another housing bubble and then, of course, another bust later.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/5">Another point that the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton made very well was about the need for intermediate housing, which is often overlooked when we debate these issues. We talk a great deal about the need for social housing and home ownership, but the particular thing that CLTs offer is intermediate housing for people who fall between two nets: they cannot afford to buy but have too much income, are too wealthy or are not deemed to be in priority need and so are unable to access social housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/6">The Co-operative party pamphlet, &quot;New Foundations&mdash;Unlocking the potential for affordable homes&quot; is particularly helpful in laying out how CLTs may deliver an innovative model during economic downturn. It is a helpful addition to the debate, and I hope the Minister recognises that and will respond to it in his summation. Housing associations' ability to deliver housing has been based on a model of cross-subsidy through private sales which of course is now failing, whereas this innovative model of mutual home ownership offers an opportunity to deliver housing in a different way.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/7">The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton spoke about mutual home ownership being an attractive investment for life and pension fund investors. It would be far less risky than investing funds in shares, asset-based securities, derivatives or hedge funds on global markets. It is an attractive model for investors but also an attractive model for people who are looking for some form of home ownership because there is far less risk that they will fall into negative equity. If mutual home owners do fall on hard times, they could sell some of their equity shares to others or freeze their equity and convert to a rental tenancy, which would not be possible in other situations.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.247.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1917" speakername="Grant Shapps" colnum="247"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0003.htm#09020462000471">
	<p pid="a.247.0/1">I will try to be brief. First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> not only on securing the debate, but on her excellent paper, &quot;Homes for the Future,&quot; which sets out many of the principles behind today's debate and the future of housing. I also thank the Minister for his phone call to me, during which he said that, having voted twice against our new clause on community land trusts, he had decided, under some persistent and welcome pressure from hon. Members in this Chamber and others beyond, to accept in the House of Lords an amendment that looked remarkably similar and which, for the first time, defined community land trusts in law.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/2">There is a huge amount of agreement and perhaps even co-operation on CLTs, as is fitting for such an idea. The hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton has already mentioned the community land trust taskforce, which met for the first time last week. I set up that taskforce to produce a report that will, I hope, provide the recommendations that need to be put in place to encourage CLTs into action&mdash;to make them happen, as it were. Many of the eminent names that have already been mentioned this morning&mdash;such as David Rogers and Martin Large&mdash;sit on that panel, so we know that we are getting expertise from the best sources. The taskforce is chaired by Dr. Karl Dayson of the university of Salford, who has spent a large amount of time, academically, studying this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/3">Some of the problems that CLTs face are questions of culture and misunderstanding. I enjoyed my visit to the CLT project in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>. I was struck by the story of a community coming together and doing all the background work, including studying and consulting the local community and working up the plan that the hon. Gentleman mentioned in great detail, only to meet English Partnerships, which insists on redoing all the work at a cost of &pound;160,000, as I recall. That is nonsense and is contrary to the principles that we are all trying to establish for CLTs. I have taken that specific example up with the chief executive of the Homes and Communities Agency, Sir Bob Kerslake, who promises to investigate.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/4">Last week I sat on a panel with Sir Bob Kerslake at the <i>Guardian</i> &quot;Future of Housing&quot; conference and one of the questions that came in was about what could be done to speed up CLTs. His response was, &quot;Look, I'd just like to see any of these actually go ahead.&quot; There are many trials now&mdash;I have been round the country and have seen many or most of them&mdash;but they all suffer from problems of understanding or misunderstanding. People do not quite understand what they are about.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/5">We are now in a position to do something with cross-party support and I hope that the Minister, in his last year or so, can get this scheme moving. There is a really pressing need, which has been brilliantly outlined by many, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> in his report and the hon. Member for Plymouth, Sutton in hers, and in the Co-operative report of last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/6">I was struck at the first meeting of our community land taskforce last week, here in Westminster, when, in response to the question, &quot;This is a great new idea, but how are we going to get it going?&quot; one panel member said, &quot;I saw this idea in <i>Estates Gazette</i> 20 years ago and ever since then I have spent my life trying to get the thing going.&quot; The time has come. Minister, we look to you to provide the guidance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.248.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="248"  time="010:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0004.htm#09020462000472">
	<p pid="a.248.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mr. Illsley. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> on securing this debate. As has been said throughout the debate, my hon. Friend is a huge champion of the whole idea of housing and her report is excellent. I like the concept of housing for the benefit of the whole community and she has been a strong champion of community land trusts for some time now. She has rightly and successfully held the Government to account on the matter of community land trusts, particularly on the definition of them. Let me spoil the consensual cross-party thing that we have had throughout this debate by saying that it is thanks to her efforts and those of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> that we were able to accept an amendment to the Housing and Regeneration Bill on the definition of CLTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/2">This has been a professional, high-calibre debate, reflecting the importance of the concept of CLTs. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton mentioned that there is a growing interest in the potential for CLTs. I agree. She beat me to it in saying that the time has come for CLTs&mdash;I had already written that phrase down&mdash;but, again, I believe passionately in them and agree strongly with her about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/3">Let me declare an interest at this point. My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud has already mentioned it, but hon. Members will be aware of the 14 CLT pilot areas&mdash;seven in urban areas and seven in rural areas&mdash;which the university of Salford is helping to run. Hartlepool, my constituency, is the location for one of the seven urban area pilots. Progress has been slow so far, but I take a strong interest in the concept of CLTs, particularly because I have a constituency as well as a ministerial interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/4">We in the Government feel strongly about putting power back in the hands of communities. That theme is repeated across the range of public services, with a stronger voice and more direct involvement for people throughout the health and education sectors and local democracy, so services improve and quality is raised. There is no reason why we cannot do the same thing in respect of housing and planning. At the same time, we know that the lack of affordable housing is a major concern for people throughout the country. One of the strong themes of the report by my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton is the need for affordable housing. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase> has also produced a strong report that we will respond to shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/5">Yesterday in the Department, we had a presentation on the affordability of housing. We saw a map of the country showing the pressures on affordability, and the least affordable places to live were represented in red. As hon. Members would expect, London was bright red. However, I was struck by the fact, which will be of interest to the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell and to my hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Sutton and for Stroud, that the south-west was burning red. In both the urban and the rural areas of the south-west, there is a real affordability issue. We should ensure that we build more houses to a model that helps to provide them in perpetuity. How to provide affordable housing for today's generation and the next generation is a long-term concern for all hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/6">The Government are keen to back the aspirations of people who want the chance to own a home of their own. The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell is strong on that in his report and in his comments in this debate. Future household growth projections, the fact that we have an aging population and the current short-term difficulties with regard to the global economy underline the need for us to go further and faster to help more people to realise their aspiration for affordable housing. That was a strong theme in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.0/7">We are doing our bit. The Government are investing &pound;8 billion in affordable housing&mdash;for both social rent and low-cost home ownership&mdash;through the new Homes and Communities Agency throughout the next comprehensive spending review period. That represents a &pound;3 billion increase compared with the previous three years. We have never seen in this country the investment in housing that we will see in the next three years.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.253.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="253"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0004.htm#09020462000485">
	<p pid="a.253.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Illsley, and I know that as usual you will be firm but fair in chairing the proceedings. It is also a pleasure to see the Under-Secretary of State for International Development, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" name="Ivan Lewis">the Member for Bury, South (Mr. Lewis)</phrase>, in his place to respond to the debate. I have followed his career with great pride and joy and am pleased that he has been so successful. I wish him well in his new job in Government, which is an exciting but difficult one.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/2">The local council in Stafford is today unveiling its proposals for a consultation on its next local development framework. The Conservative-controlled Stafford borough council will be explaining why it has agreed to a Labour Government plan for a growth point at Stafford, because it has agreed to take 20 per cent. more new housing over the next 20 years than it would have had to take under a normal calculation. I am sure that there will be great controversy locally about why we must have all that house building in Stafford in the next 20 years. When people such as myself explain that it is because of the growing population and the need for housing, people ask me where that growing population comes from and why we have to have it.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/3">There are many explanations of our need for more housing, but much of that need relates to demographic change and not necessarily to immigration change. Those questions illustrate on a small scale in one place in this country the population growth going on around the world, which should concern people but does not get the airing and debate that it should receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/4">After I secured the debate, I suddenly started to see the topic attracting comment and attention in the media. Last week, George Monbiot wrote in <i>The Guardian</i> about population growth being a serious concern, and argued that we should blame not the poor for having children, but the rich for hogging more than their fair share of the world's resources. This week Sir Jonathon Porritt was reported in the<i> Telegraph</i> headlines for saying that there should be a two-child limit in future on the size of families. He referred to irresponsible parents who have more than two children and green campaigners who betray their membership by not debating that important issue. I would very much like to dissociate myself from his comments, particularly as I am one of four boys born to my very successful mother and father, who are both sadly dead. My approach is different, and I would like to explain it this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/5">It is important that we focus on the part that population growth will play as a more general issue in sustainable development. The population of this country has now passed 60 million and is forecast to reach 77 million by the middle of the century. The world's population has passed 6 billion and is forecast to reach 9 billion over the same time scale. That would mean an increase in the world's population of 6 million every month, which is a staggering statistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/6">I am drawn to the debate on population because of my initial concerns for the environment and the urgency of our task to combat climate change. The Climate Change Act 2008 was a world first in setting a binding target for cutting carbon emissions by at least 80 per cent. by 2050. I took part in the debates as we crafted that Act. We of course have to mitigate by reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases and adapt by preparing for rising sea levels, warmer summers, wetter winters and more unpredictable weather events, but as I asked on Second Reading, where is the discussion about the effect on all our plans of the level of population we will be working with?</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/7">My approach is very different from that of Sir Jonathon Porritt. I do not think that society should interfere in the free choices people make about having children, and I want the world community to discuss all aspects of sustainable development, including population size. In this debate, I want to focus on two points that arise as a result of a growing population. First, given that there will be a larger population in the future, how can we manage the world's resources to meet their needs? Secondly, can we agree that, on balance, the world will be a safer place if we can stabilise the population at a lower level than currently forecast, and if so, what can we do to achieve that stability?</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/8">I will look first at the resources for a larger world population. Currently, over 1 billion people&mdash;about one sixth of the population&mdash;live on an income lower than $1 a day. The balance between those living rural or urban lives shifted last year: for the first time, more of us are urban dwellers. As the population grows and land use continues to shift towards urban living, we will need smarter ways of providing water for drinking, washing and irrigation and of farming to produce enough food for everyone. As we know from our plans in the UK for cutting carbon emissions, we will have to replace much of our carbon-based energy with renewable sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/9">I shall now discuss the implications for water. One in three people in the world already face water shortages, and there are significant areas of water stress now. The Pentagon produced a risk assessment a while ago that identified competition for limited water supplies as potentially a major cause of future conflicts, and we can anticipate migration away from areas of water shortage. Also, we can see that rising sea levels will create too much water in some areas, which will cause flooding, wash away people's homes and again trigger migration. The forecast rise in global population means that, by 2030, we can expect demand for water to be 30 per cent. higher than today. In some developing countries, as much as 70 per cent. of fresh water is currently used for agriculture, so we simply have to focus agricultural research and development on global public goods such as developments to support sustainable water and land use, and that brings me to food.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/10">We saw last year that prices rise when food is scarce, often beyond the reach of local people, and we witnessed serious riots around the world due to food shortages and unaffordable prices. It was certainly a wake-up call for the international community and our own Government and food producers that food security is even more basic than energy security. The forecast rise in the global population means that demand for food is expected to rise by 50 per cent. by 2030, so we need the agricultural research and development I have mentioned to stimulate agricultural production in all parts of the world. It is a big ask: more food from less land. There will be less land because of the urbanisation I have described. At home and abroad, it is essential that our Government promote long-term investment in research, science and technology to support farmers everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/11">I currently chair the all-party group on science and technology in agriculture, which incidentally is not some entry group for pushing genetic modification. It looks at the research, some of which has already demonstrated what works somewhere in the world. Some science is about efficient land management, plant breeding and the right tools for the job. Some technology is actually quite low-tech and uncontroversial. In some developing countries, for example, there is potential to treble or quadruple existing crop yields by straightforward steps such as investment in infrastructure, quality seeds, education and measures to reduce wastage and post-harvest losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/12">In the UK, climate change will pose questions about which crops will be most suitable for our conditions and whether a changing climate will bring new pest and disease challenges for our crops and livestock. However, we cannot shut our eyes to evidence of additional new ways to help feed the world's growing population. I expect biotechnology will offer some solutions&mdash;for example, crops with enhanced tolerance to drought, heat and stress. The important point is to allow the scientific research to take place so that we can then consider the evidence and decide which farming methods to adopt or reject.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/13">It is important that the Minister acknowledges the need for us to support research and development in the long term, with a joined-up, strategic approach. That means that every Government Department must be involved, not just the Department for International Development. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs clearly has an interest, and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills and the Treasury will have an interest in ensuring that we have a coherent, joined-up approach to that kind of research.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/14">In the UK, we have efforts to achieve that kind of approach. DEFRA has formed its new Food Policy Council and Professor Beddington, the Government's chief scientific adviser, has set up a foresight initiative to consider long-term food security issues. The Royal Society is conducting its own inquiry into biological approaches to boosting production. Through the all-party group on science and technology in agriculture, I am supporting calls for an integrated food research strategy. Internationally, we have opportunities to set the same approach through EU discussions about reform of the common agricultural policy, the Doha round of trade talks and efforts to boost international research and development so that we increase global food production in socially and environmentally sustainable ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/15">I shall turn to the third of those three limbs about meeting people's future energy needs. Similarly, the case for research and development in new renewable energy technologies is essential. The forecast population growth means that demand for energy is expected to rise by 50 per cent. by 2030. We must not meet that demand by burning more carbon, because of the climate change threat. In any event, the finite sources of carbon-based fuels might not stand the strain, as anyone who follows the peak oil debate will testify. Like the food debate, we face challenges of price rises and security of supply. It is urgent, therefore, that we develop a diverse range of renewable energy technologies capable of deployment in all parts of the world and of meeting the predicted increased energy demand. There are, of course, consequential considerations in all the three areas that have to be addressed. For example, we need effective regulation, but not over-regulation. We need translational research to ensure that the basic science is carried through into practical and beneficial outcomes. It is very important that we do not take our eye off the ball in ensuring that we have enough people with the right skills for such ways of working.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/16">I now turn to the population side of the equation. People who rely on large families to combat the fear of childhood deaths and poverty need to be reassured that health care and wealth can be had. We must all agree that education, family planning and health services should be universal rights. I do not necessarily sign up to the objectives of the Optimum Population Trust, but I find its work helpful in informing the debate. When asked about the population solution, it responds:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/17" class="indent">&quot;GLOBALLY: reduce birth rates. NATIONALLY: reduce or keep birth rates low and/or balance migration to prevent population increase. All countries need environmentally sustainable population policies to underpin other green policies. PERSONALLY: have fewer children and work a few more years before retiring.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/18">I throw that policy solution into the mix for consideration without endorsing its particular approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/19">I know that the Minister has read the report on the hearings by the all-party group on population, development and reproductive health called, &quot;Return of the Population Growth Factor: its impact upon the Millennium Developments Goals,&quot; which was published in January 2007. The instigator and chair of the inquiry, and publisher of the report, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase>, is with us today. I look forward to hearing from him in a moment. The report reminds us that in 2000 the United Nations set eight goals for global development, to be achieved by 2015, known as the millennium development goals. Strikingly, the original goals made no reference to population growth and gave no recognition of its impact. The UN has since agreed to add a specific goal calling for universal access to reproductive health care by 2015. Mostly, the countries with the greatest levels of poverty and greatest need to achieve the goals also have high birth rates and rapidly growing populations. The report says:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/20" class="indent">&quot;Improved access to family planning is one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing infant and maternal mortality. Slower population growth offers a demographic dividend, which opens the door to economic progress and permits a country to invest in education and health&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/21">I have been following this debate through other means. The International Planned Parenthood Federation argues that any debate about population should be framed around people's rights. The federation believes that</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/22" class="indent">&quot;women, men and young people everywhere should have control over their own bodies&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/23">that</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/24" class="indent">&quot;they should be free to choose parenthood or not&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/25">that they should</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/26" class="indent">&quot;be free to decide how many children they will have and when&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/27">and that they should</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/28" class="indent">&quot;be free to pursue healthy sexual lives without fear of unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/29">I agree with those conclusions. However, we cannot discuss tackling climate change, environmental degradation, resource efficiency and population levels in isolation. Each issue has a bearing on all the others. Every crisis, whether social, economic or environmental, will be affected by resource consumption patterns, inequities in trade, the distribution of wealth and societal changes. We need policies that place people at the centre of all that we seek to achieve in terms of sustainable development and peaceful coexistence. We must consider much more than just birth rates&mdash;we must also consider mortality, spatial distribution, migration and urbanisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/30">I endorse the following quote by Robert Engelman, of the environmental group Worldwatch:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/31" class="indent">&quot;Differences in future population growth can't by themselves determine whether we stabilise the climate or improve human well-being. But by imagining a global climate framework based on both equity and sustainability, we can see that slowing population growth is crucial to the goal of climate stability. So clear does the relationship become that special vigilance in defence of reproductive rights may be needed in a world of still-growing populations ever more worried about the future of the climate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/32">I agree so much with that quote, and asked for this debate, because as people grow more concerned about what the future holds&mdash;some things look grim, given those statistics on population growth, energy consumption, food, water and so on&mdash;they will start to worry and look for easy solutions. It is important that we place the debate on population growth in the context of sustainable development, so that we can resist the more extremist causes that might come.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/33">Many worrying trends in today's world are causing stresses and strains already. It is urgent that global efforts are made to ensure a sustainable future for our planet and succeeding generations and to ensure that they have popular understanding and support. With consent will come the public backing on all the social, economic and environmental fronts that we need. That will include an easing in the forecast global population growth and an eventual stabilising of the world's population. As we debate local development frameworks in the coming weeks, I will have to explain to my constituents that migration is not the only cause of population growth. It is great that in the developed world people are living longer, and I expect that this demographic trend will extend to more and more countries in the future. However, it means that even with voluntary, popular support for more effective family planning, any gains in reducing population growth will be achingly slow.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/34">I set the Minister a number of challenges: to confirm our intention to keep the UK at the forefront of global efforts to reduce greenhouse gases and to tackle climate change; to ensure that, at home and abroad, we contribute fully to finding the appropriate solutions to ensure that a growing world population will have enough water, food and energy to meet our needs, and to ensure that the world community understands and accepts that a stable population will contribute to future development that is fair and sustainable. It is not much, Minister. How can you do it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for International Development"  colnum="258"  time="011:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0005.htm#09020462000487">
	<p pid="a.258.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing this incredibly important debate. I, too, have followed his career with great interest; he is one of the most thoughtful, intelligent and passionate Members of the House. The people of Stafford are incredibly fortunate to have him advocating on their behalf on a range of issues. I am delighted, therefore, to be able to respond to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/2">As my hon. Friend pointed out, population growth is both a global and a local issue, which must be tackled honestly in every situation. It is all too easy to pander to populism. What we need is a balanced, responsible and grown up debate. I know that my hon. Friend will lead such a debate in his own community in the period ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/3">Let me congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1524" name="Richard Ottaway">the hon. Member for Croydon, South (Richard Ottaway)</phrase> on the pioneering work that he has done in this area. I have to say in all honesty that I have not read his report; it would be totally disingenuous of me not to put that on the record. However, I commit to reading the updated report when the hon. Gentleman produces it later this year, and also to offering to meet him and hon. Friends, should that be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/4">We all agree that tackling global population growth is inextricably linked to our capacity to achieve many of our commitments in the developing world. We cannot divorce it from issues such as economic growth, alleviating poverty and improving health and education. It is a core that runs through all of those aspirations and objectives for the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/5">Global population growth has been referred to as one of the unfinished agendas of our time, yet it has become a subject that many agencies hesitate to discuss in case they are accused of removing free choice or forcing individuals to have fewer children. The UK Government do not support programmes that coerce individuals and couples to have fewer children, but we want population growth issues to be actively debated. As my hon. Friend said, every Government must have a coherent policy, particularly those in countries that have rapid population growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/6">The key statistics have been mentioned already, but they always bear repeating. The UN estimates that the world's population will increase to 9.2 billion by 2050. It says that a staggering 99 per cent. of that growth will occur in the developing countries. Why is that a problem? As my hon. Friend said, it is because rapid growth will place a massive strain on Governments to deliver to their people basic services, such as education, health, water and sanitation. Such services are needed to achieve and sustain the progress envisaged by the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/7">As an example, it is worth considering one country in sub-Saharan Africa and the pressures that it will face in the areas of schools and health. Tanzania has a comparatively low population growth rate of 2.6 per cent., but its population will nearly double&mdash;to around 71 million people&mdash;between now and 2035. The number of students in Tanzania will more than double to 16 million. The country will need to recruit and train 350,000 teachers, up from just 135,000, and will need more than 50,000 nurses, up from under 3,000. The challenge will be immense.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/8">Not only basic services will feel the strain of rapid population growth. As my hon. Friend said, natural resources such as water, fuel, wood and land for growing food will all come under increasing pressure, and the poor, those most reliant on the natural environment for their basic survival, will feel the greatest impact. Climate change, which is driven by the emissions from countries in the developed world, is also reshaping the environment on which poor people depend. Increased rainfall variability and water scarcity, increased drylands but also increased flooding, and changing patterns of pests and disease will all increase the pressures.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/9">We are committed to helping poor countries in a number of ways. First, to develop in a cleaner, &quot;greener&quot; way, secondly, to prepare for the impacts of climate change, and thirdly, to get a fair deal from any global climate change agreements now and in the future. We are spending &pound;800 million through the Environmental Transformation Fund to help fight climate change and poverty. We are also providing &pound;5 million to improve scientific understanding of climate change in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/10">DFID has a long history of supporting research into the best use of natural resources. Current DFID initiatives to improve farmers' access to technologies include supporting the African Agricultural Technology Foundation to enable African farmers to gain access to privately owned and patented agricultural technologies such as striga-resistant maize. Such changes, combined with the effects of rapid population growth, can only increase competition for natural resources and accelerate the pressures brought about by climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/11">The demographers also tell us that rapid population growth can often lead to a &quot;youth bulge&quot;&mdash;a high proportion of young people aged between 15 and 29. If developing country economies are unable to offer meaningful training and employment, there will be increasing numbers of socially excluded people, particularly unemployed males, which may lead to increasing conflict, instability, violence and extremism. Therefore, we must tackle the issue for a variety of reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/12">Can we be optimistic that the world is ready to tackle such major issues? It is important to say that the UK Government have always played a leading role in getting the world to face up to such challenges. That has been as a consequence both of Government policy and of a commitment by parliamentarians in all parts of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/13">Four steps have been shown to have an impact on population growth. First, increasing access to sexual and reproductive health services will have a real and lasting impact and will eventually lead to a stabilising of population growth. Secondly, working with couples and individuals to reduce current high levels of fertility, encouraging choice and increasing confidence that children already born will survive into adulthood, through supporting gender equality and women and girls' empowerment, and improved health, water and sanitation services. Thirdly, addressing the large and growing demand for family planning services&mdash;the hon. Member for Croydon, South made that point, too. There will be temporary methods for those who want to delay or space pregnancy, and safe permanent methods for those who have decided not to have any more children. The United Nations Population Fund has estimated that 137 million couples worldwide do not have access to family planning, and a further 64 million are forced to use unreliable traditional methods. DFID has recently allocated &pound;100 million over five years to UNFPA to address that specific issue. I know that the hon. Gentleman will be interested to hear that.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/14">We also know the potential power of the new American Administration's change of position on such issues within the first 48 hours of President Obama's taking office. That could have a profound impact on our capacity to tackle the problem in a most effective way, based on science and on what we know works. It is incredibly important that the United States provides a leadership role both with regard to its individual role in the developing world and with regard to its capacity to influence multilateral and international institutions. The change in policy is welcome. It was desperately required, and we now look forward to engaging with the new Administration to ensure that it can lead to rapid and meaningful change on the ground in many countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/15">Political leadership in all countries is essential. If I am frank, this issue has been kept in the &quot;too difficult&quot; box for too long, with many senior leaders avoiding it entirely. Rapid population growth must be openly discussed and sensitively tackled, with the provision of support for those Governments who are already concerned and ready to take action. I am delighted that DFID has been at the leading edge of action in four areas. We have embedded and integrated policies on reproductive health and rights within all relevant policies and strategies. My hon. Friend said that we must have a joined-up approach; he is absolutely right. We have a long history of making substantial investments in countries to help them improve their sexual and reproductive health and rights programmes. We have had country programmes in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. We have provided &pound;250 million for India's nationwide reproductive and child health programme, made a &pound;8.5 million annual grant to the international planned parenthood programme and provided &pound;100 million for UNFPA's global programme for reproductive health commodities security.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/16">The UK has been a strong and sometimes lonely voice for reproductive health and rights. We have sought to give political leadership on the issue at key international forums over many decades. We welcome the fact that the international climate&mdash;please excuse the pun&mdash;is changing in every respect in relation to such issues, but we still have a long way to go. If we reflect on the fact that the MDG that is the most off target and that should cause us the most concern is maternal mortality, that should demonstrate the absolute importance of the issue. Maternal mortality leads to the death of many women who have so much to offer their countries, and leaves many children without parents.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.2/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to bring this important issue to the House and look forward to the Minister's response. It has affected the medical histories of many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/2">The system has been a problem for me and my constituents ever since it started. In turn, I have been in touch with the local foundation trust, the primary care trust and NHS Direct, and I have asked parliamentary questions&mdash;in fact, because my December question was too long, Mr. Speaker kindly offered an Adjournment debate. I shall try to do the issue some justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/3">After I was told last week of the time of the debate, entirely serendipitously, the British Medical Association produced a report entitled, &quot;Choose and Book: learning lessons from local experience&quot;. I am not so arrogant as to think that my probing put the BMA up to it, but the report is interesting, and I hope the Minister addresses it when he responds to the debate. It talks about learning lessons from local experience, and I want the Minister to learn from my constituents' local experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/4">I will start with a disclaimer: MPs hear of the worst cases. Nobody writes to me and says, &quot;I had a brilliant experience of choose and book&quot; or indeed of public transport or any other public service. The scheme provides a comparatively easy route to medical care and treatment, but there is a significant minority for whom it is a major problem. I want to bring the cases of a number of my constituents to the Minister's attention, and to draw one or two national lessons from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/5">My worst case illustrates many of the features of choose and book that drive patients to distraction. Mr. I was first sent to choose and book on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July 2007</phrase>, and first contacted me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-09">9 August 2007</phrase>. Nine and a half months later, after much correspondence in many directions, he wrote to me again on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-12">12 May 2008</phrase> and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Me, I'm giving up but if you wish to carry on the saga be my guest!!!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/7">I suppose that the debate is me being Mr. I's guest. I spoke to him yesterday, and I can report that he received his treatment last month. For him, the saga that started with a doctor's diagnosis in July 2007 has now been completed with treatment in January 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/8">As I said, Mr. I is my worst case. What happened? On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July 2007</phrase>, his general practitioner referred him to choose and book, gave him the telephone number, the address of the website and the password, and told him what to do. When he phoned the number, he was told that he should phone again because of a high volume of calls. He repeated that experience many times. He was referred to the website, but it did not respond to him. He did what many patients do, much to the irritation of their doctors: in frustration, he went back to his GP, because he thought that he might have got the number or password wrong. Having established that they were correct&mdash;he had a letter of confirmation from the system in due course&mdash;he tried again. Once again he was told that he should try the website because of a high volume of calls.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/9">He eventually got on to the website, but it told him that no bookings were available for the period he had chosen, and that he should try again and seek another date. He did not want to make it hard for choose and book, so he did not try to make an appointment for the week after; instead, he tried to make an appointment for three months after his first choice. Anyone who knows choose and book knows what that means. The system would not give him an appointment because the date he selected was beyond the 18-week period in which it will accept an appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/10">Mr. I is articulate and persistent. After that trouble, he went to his GP for a third time. His GP said, &quot;I'll tell you what. Why don't you phone up NHS HealthSpace?&quot; That sounded like something to do, so Mr. I did it. What did it tell him? It told him that no appointments were available.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/11">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-08-01">1 August</phrase>, he got the first of his letters from Appointments Line criticising him for failing to book a choose and book appointment&mdash;that was when he first wrote to me. He told me that he wanted to tell Appointments Line that he had been trying to book, but he could not do so because the standard letter from Appointments Line has no address on it&mdash;he showed me a copy of the letter to prove it. The only way in which a patient can contact Appointments Line was by phoning the number that tells them that they cannot get through. It is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/12">Patients might not be able to write to Appointments Line, but MPs can. I now know that it is run by NHS Direct. The chief executive of NHS Direct, Mr. Matt Tee&mdash;that is not an abbreviation&mdash;sent me a letter. He invited me to comment on the application of NHS Direct for trust status. I told him in no uncertain terms that until he sorted out Appointments Line, it would not be sensible to give it such status. The letter he wrote back to me is interesting in many ways, but I like this bit:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/13" class="indent">&quot;The Appointments Line takes over 280,000 calls a month and at present receives 0.56 complaints for every 10,000 calls.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/14">I thought that that was an interesting way of expressing things, but I marvel at how half a complaint managed to sneak through. How would Appointments Line know that people wanted to complain if they cannot write or phone? There is no address to write to. People have to know that it is run by NHS Direct before they can get anywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/15">I also marvelled at another part of the letter that delightfully passes the buck for the problem:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/16" class="indent">&quot;I agree that services should be user friendly and less bureaucratic and will do all I can both to ensure that this is the case for the services I control (such as The Appointments Line) and to encourage others to do so with the services that I do not control (such as the national Choose and Book system).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/17">I thought that that was a pretty neat sidestep from my constituent's concerns. Who runs the national choose and book system? Mr. Tee said:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/18" class="indent">&quot;We are working closely with colleagues both in the Department of Health and (specifically) in Connecting for Health, to promote improvements to the systems and software associated with Choose and Book&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/19">So it is not his problem; in his view, it seems to be the problem of the Department of Health, NHS Connecting for Health and the software manufacturers. Evidently, choose and book has nothing to do with the Appointments Line and everything to do with everybody else.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/20">I would not want the Minister to think that, because I started with a case from 2007, he can respond by saying, &quot;Yes, there were some initial teething difficulties, but everything is fine nowadays.&quot; It is no better now. Calls still go unanswered, appointments are still unavailable and infuriating reminder letters are still sent. Unanswered calls are a problem for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/21">Last November, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> asked a parliamentary question and received a briefing in the Minister's reply saying that last October, 338,000 callers tried to access the Appointments Line. According to the figures in the reply, 27,000 were not answered. One must read the small print carefully to find out that 17,000 callers found the line engaged and 10,000 found it playing Vivaldi. One in 16 calls made to the Appointments Line is unsuccessful. That is from the Minister's own figures for last October, which show 27,000 calls not answered last October. That works out at 324,000 missed calls a year. A third of a million calls, according to his own figures, fail to get through to the Appointments Line.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/22">The astonishing thing is that the Appointments Line met all its key performance indicators. I do not know whether any other call centre in the country, commercial or public, would meet all its key performance indicators if it left out a third of a million callers a year. If so, I hope that the Minister will brief us on which one it is. I suggest to him that the key performance indicators for the Appointments Line are not sufficiently rigorous. He is not getting his money's worth.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.2/23">The second big problem is that appointments are not available when people do get through. There are two causes for that. Well, there may be more than two causes&mdash;the BMA report suggests quite a range of them&mdash;but I will focus on just two. The first, and perhaps the one that the Minister could most easily do something about, is the 18-week waiting period, which creates a black hole beyond 18 weeks when appointments are not taken. If appointments cannot be booked more than 18 weeks ahead, when a particular clinic or consultant is fully booked, they are taken off the list of appointments available. They do not even appear. Of course, at the call centre, they cannot say, &quot;Well, that's because they're booked up for the first 18 weeks&quot;; what they say is, &quot;They're not on the system.&quot; They disappear into a black hole.</p>

	<p pid="a.265.0/1">My hon. Friend is articulating the frustration of many constituents who come up against the system. Does he agree that one of the fundamental problems, particularly in certain sections of society, is that people do not understand why the Government are so keen to force that system upon us? An elderly couple recently came to visit me, bringing with them all the literature sent out as a matter of course. It included an expensively produced colour booklet, letters and an information pack. There was a lot of detail for them to go through. They said, &quot;Mark, all we did was ask for a referral from the GP to go to Stepping Hill. Why are we being offered an appointment in Bolton,&quot; or Wigan, or wherever it was? Those places are part of the Greater Manchester conurbation, but they are too far away for many of our constituents to travel to.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.265.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="265"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0006.htm#09020462000494">
	<p pid="a.265.3/1">That is true, of course. It is also interesting to see the decisions taken about which medical procedures should be included in the 18-week limit and which should not. We could have another interesting debate about that. As somebody who recently acquired a pair of hearing aids, I happen to know that hearing is not included in the 18 weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/2">However, I do not want to go there; I return to the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase>. People who go to their GP and are referred for a medical procedure will not necessarily be rocket scientists. What they get with choose and book is a complicated way of getting in touch that involves passwords and so on. I have a letter, which I will not quote, saying, &quot;I'm going to go and have my hip replaced. They've given me a password. Surely nobody else wants my hip?&quot; There is a lack of comprehension about what the system is designed to do and why it is being done in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/3">Apart from the 18-week event horizon, there is a second factor that leads to a shortage of appointments on the system: some appointments are never put on the central database in the first place. At least one of the reasons for that is the failure of choose and book to engage the medical profession fully and the profession's lack of confidence in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/4">I would like to take the example of Stockport. When my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> asked a parliamentary question in November, she established that only 60 per cent. of bookings for secondary care in Stockport are made through the choose and book system; 40 per cent. are made on pre-existing manual systems of one sort or another. Because hospitals, clinics, GPs and consultants are so fed up with choose and book, they are using the old &quot;steam&quot; system in many parts of the country. The same parliamentary question established that take-up ranged widely in different primary care trust areas; 60 per cent. was somewhere near the norm. As a result, appointment times never get on to the system and are held back for the manual appointments to be made. The BMA has some interesting comments on that situation. Perhaps the Minister would like to come back on that point when he responds.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/5">Therefore, not only can someone not book after the 18-week period, but many appointment times are never there to be booked in the first place. Why is that? Why do GPs not think that choose and book is the best thing since sliced bread? One of the reasons is illustrated by the case of Mr. I, who had his consultation with the GP but had to go back twice to try to establish how he could make his appointment through the system. I do not know how many people in Westminster Hall have had a referral through the choose and book system. My GP, who had no particular knowledge of my interest in the system or concern about it, did not even ask me to book through it. What he said to me was, &quot;They'll be sending you a letter, but in the meantime I'll get you booked in anyway&quot;. That was an example of a GP bypassing choose and book, because he did not want me to come back moaning that I could never get through on the phone to make the booking.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/6">Of course, there are also the infuriating reminder letters; it is not necessarily the case that just one is sent. I actually received an apology from my PCT. If I quote from the letter that I received in September 2008 from the chief executive of my PCT, everyone will get the drift, because it is a contemporary example of the problem:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/7" class="indent">&quot;As you will be aware, the Choose &amp; Book is an automated system and part of the process is for reminder letters to be sent out to any patient where a referral had been made, but the appointment not yet booked. In the case...I understand that she&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/8">that is, my constituent&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/9" class="indent">&quot;received at least three letters, and that on each occasion she then telephoned in an attempt to book the appointment, but was then told that there were no available slots to book her into. I can appreciate the frustration this would cause and I would ask that you pass on my most sincere apologies, on behalf of the Trust.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/10">The question that I suppose the Minister might be asking himself is, &quot;Well, has he just got a couple of nutters writing in green ink, or is this something which is widespread?&quot; I can say that it is widespread. There is the case of Mrs. M, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/11" class="indent">&quot;I was somewhat dismayed when my recent appointment came through under a different consultant and involved a very basic procedure. I realised that I was being treated as an entirely new patient, despite the very clear letter of referral that my G.P. had sent. I queried matters with the 'choose and book' administration and was told that my usual consultant would not be able to see me within the target time, so I would have to start all over again with a new consultant, even if it were inappropriate to do so.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/12">There is also the case of Mrs. H, who required a consultation with a neurosurgeon but was told that no appointment could be made within the next three months as all the appointments were taken. However, as no appointments could be made beyond the next three months, no progress could be made with the appointment at that stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/13">I have a letter from Mr. B, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/14" class="indent">&quot;If patients have to chase their follow-up appointments, it suggests that either too much money has been wasted on inadequate computers or someone isn't doing their job properly - or both? There seems to be an over-emphasis on computer technology at the expense of employing personnel needed to deliver a front line service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/15">I thought of offering Mr. B a job in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/16">Then there is the case of Mr. P, who has spinal problems that require regular injections. He needs to see a neurosurgeon too. A specific consultant was recommended but the new choose and book system would not allow direct referral.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/17">Sometimes we get lucky and I have had a follow-up letter from Mr. P, which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/18" class="indent">&quot;I would like to thank you for the enquiries you made on my behalf, it's amazing what an MP's letter can do!!&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/19">Given that there are about 338,000 failed inquiries a year, I do not think that MPs can plug all the gaps in this particular system.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/20">I want to round off with a quote from a patient who is a constituent of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, who contacted me when she saw that I was having this debate. She is Miss G and she wrote to me to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/21" class="indent">&quot;My experience is that this is a totally pointless exercise. I recently had to book two hospital appointments in Somerset. For both of them, I received letters with a list of the hospitals where I could book my consultation and promised I could do this through the Choose and Book line but when I phoned, in both instances I was given the telephone numbers for phoning the hospitals direct to make a booking. Why did they not put those telephone numbers in the letter, saving me time and the NHS money in employing someone to give out the phone numbers?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/22">I have described choose and book as the NHS's version of air traffic control. If all the landing slots are full, then the aircraft are just kept circling and kept waiting until there is clearance. That is exactly what is happening with patients, time after time after time.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/23">Everybody knows that there is a serious problem with choose and book, but nobody wants to take responsibility. Appointments line says that it is not responsible, the Minister said very clearly in answer to my question in December that he was not responsible, and the PCT says that it is not responsible either.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/24">I want the Minister to answer a few straight questions. What will he do to tackle the 330,000 or so missed calls each year to appointments line? What will he do about the 18-week waiting period &quot;black hole&quot;? What will he do about the fact that only 60 per cent. of appointments in Stockport are made through choose and book? Whether he goes forwards or backwards, can he at least ensure that all the appointments are on the computer screen? What will he do about the duplication and expense involved? There is the expense of appointments line itself; the duplication of a manual system and of a choose and book system; the wastage of multiple automated letters, complete with postage, even when the fault is on the side of appointments line itself; and of course the retention of parallel paperwork systems, when all the information is supposed to be on the computer.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/25">There is a lot of frustration and annoyance among patients. They face a system that is designed for robots, not people. It denies local choice and blocks opportunities. I do not want my constituents' concerns to be brushed over with a load of sloppy departmental whitewash. I want some clear, hard answers.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.3/26">We have now got well past the &quot;teething problems&quot; excuse. We have got past the &quot;waiting for it to get better&quot; stage. We are right up to the &quot;putting it right&quot; stage, and I want to hear from the Minister today exactly how he proposes to put the choose and book system right.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.0/1">It is a pleasure to contribute to the debate under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I thank my constituency neighbour, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase>, for securing a debate on what all hon. Members will agree is a very important subject, certainly if our postbags are anything to judge by.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/2">This is not the first time that I have spoken in such a debate or the first time that I have raised this issue. It is a matter of record that in Health questions last November I asked the Minister if he might agree that there is a need to review the choose and book system in the light of the many complaints that we have been receiving and the significant difficulties that it has caused, the likes of which have been so well chronicled today by my hon. Friend. The Minister replied that choose and book is</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/3" class="indent">&quot;one of the great success stories of the national programme for IT.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-11-04.102"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 November 2008; Vol. 482, c. 102</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/4">I hope that my colleagues, whatever party they are in, will agree that the Minister's response to that question showed a failure to understand the real frustration that so many of our constituents feel.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/5">My constituents have contacted me to complain about the system and about what they perceive to be complacency in dealing with the problems that it is helping to create rather than to resolve. If the Minister would term the system a great success&mdash;that term is lifted directly from his answer to my question&mdash;I sincerely hope, for all our sakes, that we never find out what he would consider to be a failure. It is evident that the choose and book system is an unnecessary, expensive and inefficient IT and administrative system that serves only to divert money away from much-needed improvements to local health services. When one asks local people what they would prefer that money to be spent on&mdash;I am sure that many hon. Members on both sides of the House have done that&mdash;they say that they want their local surgery or hospital to be improved. They do not want money to be spent on another ridiculous and badly performing Government IT system.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/6">My constituents want to be offered appointments at their local hospital. My hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove and I share a local hospital at Stepping Hill in Stockport. People want to be offered appointments in a local hospital that is within easy travelling distance from their homes, with the best consultant to deal with their problem. They want to get their appointments quickly and to be treated well when they attend. The choose and book system is making that harder, because people are unable to get through to make appointments, as we have heard in so much detail from my hon. Friend. In some cases, when people do get through, they are told that no appointments are available at their local hospital, sometimes because those places are being booked up by people from outside the area. That is a form of madness.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/7">With the best will in the world, and given the regard that I hold the Minister in, I think that he is being put in the position of having to defend the indefensible. I hope that he is able to respond positively to this debate. All we are asking for at this stage is a review of the system's operational efficiency. Surely, anyone would accept, on the weight of the evidence, that there are good reasons for asking for such a review, and surely the Minister does not want to defend good money going after bad into a system that is patently failing patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/8">It is not only politicians who criticise the system. The British Medical Association and local doctors do not think that it works. Indeed, many have gone on record as saying that it is getting in the way of choice. GPs want to refer patients to the specialists whom they feel are best suited to deal with their patients' specific problems, but in many areas they cannot do that because the system allows them to make appointments only with departments, not with particular specialists.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/9">This is not a party political issue. All of us in this place, regardless of party affiliation, want to have the best possible health service for our constituents, whom we have the privilege of representing in Parliament. Will the Minister rethink the system, which is failing the very people whom it was set up to serve? It is undoubtedly an expensive system, and the bureaucracy attached to it, with pamphlets and reminder letters being sent out, is relentless and expensive. The system confuses many people and has already proved inefficient and ineffective. Perhaps it is time for a review, so that we can consider using the money that we spend on choose and book, which has patently failed to operate properly, on improving local services instead. I am sure that we would all agree to that. I hope that the Minister will take that message firmly on board today.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.0/1">Let me start by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I congratulate also my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase> on his contribution, which was also important to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/2">Choose and book is part of the national programme for IT. It seems to me, and to most people who have looked into this issue, that the Government are in complete denial regarding the scale of the problems with that programme. The Minister is a reasonable man, and I suggest that he should take this opportunity to accept the problems that the programme has experienced. He is not responsible for instituting the system, as he has inherited this nightmare, and everyone would welcome his acceptance of the massive challenges that the national programme faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove has described the experiences of his individual constituents. I am sure that the Minister will agree that the situation in the first case that my hon. Friend described, that of Mr. I, is intolerable. We cannot accept a situation in which someone who experiences anxiety about hospital referrals has to go through such an experience. It should be incumbent on us all to realise that that is not acceptable and to find ways of changing things for the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/4">The national programme was centrally flawed from the start. I went to a fascinating seminar at which someone who has been heavily involved in the national programme spoke candidly about its whole design. He said that there had been no systems review at the start, which means that there had been no process by which the different people who were building and buying the system reached agreement with those who would be using it about what they were trying to achieve. He explained that although such a review is of fundamental importance to any IT project, it had been missed from that project because of the political imperative to drive it forward. He also said that we do not have sufficient skills in the UK to deliver the programme as it was originally designed.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/5">Many other people have made the absolutely valid point that it is stupid and wrong centrally to impose a system on a highly diverse health system without getting buy-in from the clinicians who are to use it. A small number of providers are involved: at first there were four, and now there are only two because the other two have deserted the project. Smaller IT providers, which have historically provided all the innovation, have been excluded from the project, and we now have the highly vulnerable situation in which the whole system depends on just two providers because the other two have left. We are told in a report in <i>The Times </i>this week that one of those that has left&mdash;Fujitsu&mdash;is pursuing a claim for some &pound;600 million against the Government. I would be grateful if the Minister responded to that report and confirmed whether it is true.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/6">The national programme for IT is years behind schedule. We were told by the National Audit Office that completion was expected around 2014, but that now appears to be in doubt; it looks as if the time scale will be even longer. We also know that the whole programme is billions of pounds over budget. In a response to a parliamentary question that I recently tabled, it has been revealed that the number of severe faults in NHS computer systems has almost doubled in the past three years. That potentially puts patients and their care at risk. We have to take that matter very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/7">There are two particular problem areas in the national programme for IT. The first is the national care records system, which is the national database of all of our patient records. In this day and age, I do not know who on earth would trust the Government to look after sensitive patient records&mdash;I certainly do not. In its report this week, the Public Accounts Committee has highlighted its serious concerns about the scale of the crisis that the national care records system now faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/8">This debate is on the other matter that has caused real concern: choose and book. I want to start the analysis of where we are going wrong with choose and book by establishing some principles. First, I fully accept that the concept of electronic booking and someone being able to sit with their GP or someone else in the practice and make a booking&mdash;for example, for the Stepping Hill hospital in Stockport&mdash;is an attractive proposition. For the patient to know that an appointment has been booked when they leave the GP practice is a good concept and we should not lose sight of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/9">The second principle, which I absolutely support, is the concept of enabling patients to choose the clinician whom they want to see. Critically, that should be done on the advice of a person's GP, because they will often be guiding us in the decisions that we make. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove pointed out, in the vast majority of cases the individual patient will want to choose their local hospital. However, there might sometimes be a good reason why someone does not want to choose their local hospital&mdash;for example, it could be that an elderly person wants to stay with a son or daughter somewhere else in the country, or that someone's local hospital has a poor record on hospital-acquired infections. There could be all sorts of reasons why an individual might choose to go elsewhere, and people should have the right to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.2/1">May I reinforce the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle made about the choice being the patient's? If the patient wants to go to the local hospital and its appointment system is booked for the next 18 weeks, he or she is not offered that choice by the system. That is the flaw when it comes to choice. The fundamental choice for most patients is to be able to go somewhere near, and if choose and book cuts out that choice it is a failure.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/2">I believe hon. Members on both sides of the House appreciate that modern health care is a complex service. There are in the NHS more than 170 acute care hospitals and some 150 independent providers. Each one offers a wide and increasingly specialised set of clinical services. On any given day, every one of England's 36,000 GPs will refer, on average, one patient to a hospital for some form of elective treatment. It is clearly not possible for a GP to know of every consultant in every specialism in every hospital in the country. I believe that there is consensus in Westminster Hall today that the old paper-based system would be completely unable to cope with the complexity and speed of modern health care, or to fulfil the right of the patient to choose, which I believe most of us accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/3">The paper-based system was far more cumbersome and much more expensive. For decades, the NHS creaked and groaned under the weight of millions of letters booking, confirming and rearranging appointments. Letters were lost, misdirected or misfiled. If a GP referred a patient to a hospital consultant&mdash;one of their choice, not the patient's&mdash;the patient would leave the practice and enter a state of limbo. They would not have a clue when their appointment would be. They would find out just before it was due, when the hospital would send a letter. The appointment, which would be at a time convenient to the hospital, was made without any consideration of the patient's needs. In summary, the old system assumed that the patient was the passive recipient of care, not an engaged participant.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/4">Just last week, the British social attitudes survey reported that 95 per cent. of people say that they want some degree of choice over which hospital they attend and the kind of treatment that they receive. Of course, from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year a patient's choice of elective care will become a legal right through the NHS constitution. Since choose and book was initiated, more than 10 million people have been referred through it. As of November last year, more than half of all out-patient referrals used choose and book and the latest figures that we have, those for January, show that that figure is up, at 57 per cent. In January, more than 600,000 patients used the system, with more than 30,000 referrals made in a single day last week. Usage has doubled over the last year. Last week, 90 per cent. of GP practices used choose and book.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/5">I acknowledge that sometimes the system has been slow and that occasionally there have been problems with system availability, but virtually all the problems that hon. Members have raised today are problems not with the national choose and book system, but with how individual primary care trusts, hospitals and GPs have implemented it or engaged with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/6">I have been advised by the PCT in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that he raised three specific cases with it relating to choose and book between February and December 2007. I think that the case of Mr. I&mdash;the hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;was the second of those cases, which the PCT tells me it heard about from him in November 2007. Clearly, the case as outlined by the hon. Gentleman is unacceptable. It is difficult to know where the fault lies without hearing more details about individual cases, although it seems, from what he says, to lay mainly with the telephone booking service.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/7">I am informed by the PCT that it tried to contact the patient that the hon. Gentleman mentioned to investigate his case, but did not receive any response, and that it further tried to contact the patient but was unsuccessful. However, in the last letter that the patient sent to the PCT, he stated that he did not wish to pursue the case further. Obviously, if there is still a problem relating to Mr. I's case&mdash;or with any of the other individual cases that the hon. Gentleman raises&mdash;I should be happy to look into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.0/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the case of another patient, whom he did not identify, saying that they were referred to hospital during 2008 but told that it was unable to take referrals because it needed to meet its 18-week target. We picked that matter up last year, when it was raised by another hon. Member whose patients use Stockport hospital and, with the intervention of the chief executive of the strategic health authority, the foundation trust in Stockport was told in no uncertain terms that that was not acceptable behaviour. The hospital responded by reopening its referrals and those referrals remain open now.</p>

	<p pid="a.279.3/1">For the Minister's benefit, can I just confirm that Cheadle comes under the PCT for Stockport, Greater Manchester, not the one in Staffordshire?</p>
	<p pid="a.279.3/2">I want to clarify one of the Minister's responses that he made a moment or two ago. He seemed to suggest&mdash;I want to be careful not to put words into his mouth&mdash;that the responsibility or the problems might lie with the PCT, rather than with the system itself. In the cases mentioned by hon. Members, it is of course systematic failure that is endemic in the structure that has been built up. Will he clarify that response and say just how much of the responsibility for this lies with the individual PCTs, since, as he has already said, Stockport PCT is generally a high-performing one.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">I shall come on to that in a second, but yes, it is unacceptable. I want to take up a point made by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove about the 5 per cent. tolerance level for the 18-week waiting target. He was not right to say that that includes people who do not turn up. The 5 per cent. tolerance is for people who choose, for whatever reason, to delay their treatment, or for cases in which there is a clinical reason to delay the treatment. They may need to get their blood pressure down, for example. It would not be right to penalise a provider in respect of the 18-week performance target just because people did not turn up. I wanted to disabuse the hon. Gentleman of that impression.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">Sometimes the hospital that a patient wants will have no appointment slots available on choose and book at the time they want to book. That should not mean that they have to go elsewhere. If a patient cannot book an appointment, their details should be sent to the hospital of their choice, so that that choice is honoured. There are many places where that problem has been resolved and appointments on the choose and book system are almost always available. Where that is not happening, it is important that we hear about it and that strategic health authorities hear about it and work closely with the primary care trusts and the trusts to resolve the problem everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">The hon. Gentleman asked three specific questions. First, he asked about missed calls. The information that I have is that the performance of the national appointments line is carefully monitored and is generally considered good. Where it falls below accepted standards, it incurs financial penalties. Since April 2007, 95 per cent. of calls have been answered within 30 seconds, and the key performance indicator relating to busy tone has been met 86 per cent. of the time. I think that the hon. Gentleman was referring to patients who chose not to complete their call. That would be registered as a call that was not connected. It is perfectly possible&mdash;indeed, it is quite likely&mdash;that they called back and their calls were answered. However, we are reviewing the call standards and I would be happy to write to him in more detail about that if he would like me to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/4">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman referred to the 18-week black hole, which I have just dealt with. Patients should be able to choose to wait longer than 18 weeks if they want to do so, but we must not let hospitals off the hook about bringing down waiting times, which all patients appreciate. Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman wanted me to ensure that all appointments are on the screen. We are targeting the trusts that have a high rate of unavailable slots appearing on the screen. Many hospitals have tackled the problem effectively. We want to ensure that they all do.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.0/1">I want to come back to the appointments line question&mdash;it seems to be an orphan. The figures that I cited were drawn directly from a parliamentary reply that the Minister gave my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> in January. That showed clearly that a large number of people could not get through, a large number of people were &quot;Vivaldi-ed&quot; and simply gave up after 30 seconds or more of the call. I advise the Minister to read the small print of his answer. That gives us a total of 330,000 calls in a year that are not being responded to. Whether people give up because they cannot stand the music any more or because the line is engaged, they still give up.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.1/1">Yes, but the hon. Gentleman is ignoring the fact that those people may have rung back on another occasion and got their appointments. If it will be helpful, I will write to him to give him the clarification that he seeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">To begin with, choose and book provided a choice of only four or five providers. As I am sure hon. Members will be aware, however, last April, after a major upgrade, we gave patients the ability to choose at referral whichever service would meet their needs. The new system also made it easier for GPs and their patients to navigate through the options available. It is interesting to note that following a peak between April and July last year, the Department has been receiving significantly fewer letters from the public making complaints about choose and book.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/3">A decade ago, people could wait up to two years for a hospital appointment, but thanks to the investment and reform and the introduction of systems such as choose and book, that is no longer the case. Now, the average wait from GP referral to treatment is just eight weeks and no one need wait more than 18 weeks unless they choose to do so. In June this year, further enhancements will be made to the choose and book system that will help hospitals to give their services standardised and accurate names. That will give GPs an experience much more like using Google and information that is far more accurate, enabling them to help their patients in the best way possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/4">Hon. Members referred to the recent BMA report. Although that report makes constructive suggestions on how the system can be improved, it clearly shows that the system can work when local engagement, particularly with clinicians, is effective. Its conclusion&mdash;section 4&mdash;states that the problems encountered were</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/5" class="indent">&quot;not due to the functionality of the system but due to broader issues such as...processes in place and capacity issues...The clinicians interviewed felt that Choose and Book could potentially bring benefits and that a paper chase of referrals letters between GPs and around the hospital is not best practice.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> referred to the recent Lewisham report, which was published, I think, today. Although we are still looking into that, because it landed on my desk only yesterday, we were rather surprised by the findings at Lewisham that seemed to suggest that choose and book increased the rate of did-not-attends. All the other evidence suggests that choose and book significantly reduces did-not-attends. It is logical that if a patient is actively involved in decisions about their care, their attendance is likely to improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/7">We understand that further research is being undertaken in Lewisham on those findings to find an explanation for them. Three previous pieces of research&mdash;at Ashford and St. Peter's Hospitals NHS Trust in Kent, at Kettering general hospital and at Doncaster and Bassetlaw hospitals&mdash;found a reduction in do-not-attend rates of 32, 33 and 60 per cent. respectively, so there seems to be a conflict with the findings in Lewisham. I point out that Lewisham is an even poorer performer than Norfolk on choose and book. It may be that there is a more general problem, in that Lewisham has not embraced the system, rather than a particular problem with the system itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/8">I have spoken about the importance of choice&mdash;a concept that most of us believe in and support. The issue that we are debating today is about GPs, primary care trusts and NHS and independent sector hospitals making a choice&mdash;making a choice to work with, understand and use choose and book properly, or to ignore it and wonder why it does not work. For their patients' sake, and with the help of hon. Members, I hope that they choose the former.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.284.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" speakername="David Burrowes" colnum="284"  time="015:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0009.htm#09020462000519">
	<p pid="a.284.1/1">It is a pleasure to have secured the debate and to speak under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I understand that this is the first time that a debate has taken place in the House on the important issue of the care of thalassaemia patients. Thalassaemia is the name of a group of serious genetic blood disorders that inhibit the normal production of haemoglobin&mdash;the part of red blood cells that supplies oxygen to the body.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/2">In one sense, my interest in this issue is local, as the UK Thalassaemia Society is based in my constituency, in Southgate, but my interest goes wider than that, given that there are about 1,000 patients with thalassaemia in the UK requiring regular transfusion treatment for their condition and that more than 200,000 people in the UK carry the beta thalassaemia gene. The overwhelming majority of thalassaemia patients come from ethnic minority communities, particular those of Mediterranean and south Asian origin, and many of them already suffer significant health disadvantages. There are several patients in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/3">Thalassaemia remains a little-known condition, which is why I particularly welcome the opportunity to raise the issue in the House today. There are wide variations in treatment and care across primary care and hospital trusts, particularly in areas with low numbers of patients. I have secured the debate in order to highlight the variations in care and the health inequalities to which they contribute and to ask the Minister to consider what can be done to improve the lives of those with thalassaemia in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/4">People with severe forms of thalassaemia, of which there are about 1,000, do not produce enough healthy, mature red blood cells, and if left untreated, the patient would be expected to die in the first 10 years of life. Thankfully, all pregnant women are now screened for the carrier state through the national screening programme. That is welcome because it makes the identification of patients and earlier medical intervention possible. Happily, the past few decades have seen welcome medical advances that mean that patients with thalassaemia can live long and productive lives if they receive the treatment and care they require.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/5">Medical treatment takes the form of blood transfusions, which the patient typically receives every three to four weeks. One of the problems that thalassaemia patients face is a lack of flexibility from the NHS on receiving those life-saving blood transfusions. Patient choice is lauded loudly by the Government in their vision of the NHS, but the reality for patients with thalassaemia is that they have little or no choice of where or when they receive blood transfusions. That unnecessarily affects their education and employment prospects as they are forced to take frequent and often unpredictable leaves of absence from work or school to receive treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/6">Another issue in the treatment of thalassaemia patients, in which we see a wide postcode lottery of provision, is iron chelation therapy. As blood contains large amounts of iron that cannot be excreted from the body naturally, treatment is required to remove the excess iron that builds up as a result of regular blood transfusions. The process of removing excess iron is called iron chelation, and without it, iron deposits would eventually compromise the vital organs and lead to death, usually from cardiac complications.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/7">The standard chelation therapy is for desferoxamine&mdash;Desferal&mdash;to be given as a subcutaneous infusion via a needle placed, often painfully, under the skin, usually on the abdomen. The treatment lasts for approximately 12 hours and is administered five to seven times a week. As is obvious from that description, the treatment can cause significant distress and impacts on aspects of daily life such as sleeping and the ability to socialise. I have spoken to several patients with thalassaemia within my constituency about the practical impact of that infusion. The drug is also a strong irritant and often causes pain and swelling at the injection sites. The parents of small children with thalassaemia have to administer those injections to their children, which as one can understand is very distressing to both parent and child. Although the treatment is life-saving, because of its painful and time-consuming nature, the rate of non-adherence to treatment is high. In fact, non-adherence to the treatment is the main cause of death among thalassaemic patients in the UK today.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/8">Fortunately, there is hope of improvement in the administering of the treatment. Recent years have seen the introduction of oral chelating drugs that can transform a patient's quality of life&mdash;the difference between taking the drug as a drink or tablets and having a needle under the skin for 12 hours out of every 24 need hardly be emphasised. The UK Thalassaemia Society wants those oral iron chelating drugs, when clinically indicated, to be available to all patients. Sadly, that is not the case due to the wider discrepancy of provision across the NHS. Therefore, many children and adults with thalassaemia must undergo hours of needless suffering every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/9">The process of applying for oral iron chelating drugs in England is often through exceptional case procedures within individual primary care trusts. Those procedures are often time consuming and lead to unnecessary suffering for patients, many of whom are small children. The stress and trauma to parents and carers is immense, and the process requires additional time from doctors who often have other taxing requirements to make those detailed funding applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/10">I appreciate that the Minister will say that she cannot direct that application process and that it is for individual PCTs to deal with them, but I hope that she will join me in encouraging PCTs in areas where the prevalence of thalassaemia is high, as in my own PCT in Enfield, to consider putting in place a standardised policy with regard to the provision of oral iron chelators to prevent such delays in funding and, crucially, to avoid the distress and frustration for patients and clinicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/11">I have talked about treatment and would like to move on to the matter of curing thalassaemia, which I hope the Minster will agree should be a long-term aim of the health system. The most common method for curing thalassaemia is by bone marrow transplants. The success rate of that method varies considerably, depending on various factors. The alterative to bone marrow transplants is umbilical cord blood transfusion. The Minister will remember that the last time I secured a health-related debate I spoke about the merits of umbilical cord blood. I have insufficient time today to describe the details of umbilical cord blood and the hopes for it as a future treatment. Nevertheless, it is important to make the point that cord blood is a rich source of stem cells, which could be tapped into without the complications that accompany bone marrow transplants.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/12">To date, the number of cord blood transfusions for thalassaemia has been sadly limited, but one small study placed the success rate at 79 per cent. Does the Minister agree that cord blood holds out the prospect of promising future treatments for not only thalassaemia, but other blood-related disorders? Will she ensure that the necessary cord blood banking is available to reach the ethnic communities who need it most? I look forward to her colleague, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, meeting with the all-party group on umbilical cord blood and adult stem cells, which was recently launched to discuss the outcome of the cord blood review.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/13">So much for the future, but with regard to the care for thalassaemia patients now, access to psychological support and community and social care is also needed. There is a real need, and indeed call, for the Department of Health to work with local government, social services and education services to provide thalassaemia patents with a care package that addresses those holistically&mdash;I know that that term is often bandied about, but in this case it is truly needed&mdash;and deals with the social, psychological and educational needs of the patient alongside their medical treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/14">The issues that I have raised reflect a wider problem, as thalassaemia is in many respects a forgotten condition, and that is perhaps shown by the fact that this is the first time we have had a debate on thalassaemia. It is now forgotten within the health service, but hopefully not in the House. Although there are several committed specialists, to whom I pay tribute, dedicated to the treatment of thalassaemia and similar conditions that should be given a proper mention, such as sickle cell disease, there is a general lack of training and funding for posts in the haemoglobinopathies for both doctors and nurse specialists. Most haematologists deal mainly with white cell haematology, such as leukaemia and other malignancies, and red cell medicine is very much the poor relation when it comes to the research grants and training available.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/15">Also reflecting the low profile of thalassaemia in the medical world is the fact that many GPs are not properly aware of the condition. More needs to be done to educate GPs on the causes and symptoms of thalassaemia to ensure that patients are passed on to appropriate specialists as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/16">Perhaps one of the reasons why the condition has not received as much attention as other rare diseases is, sadly, the population it affects. As I have mentioned, thalassaemia overwhelmingly affects people of south Asian and Mediterranean origin.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/17">Those communities often face social and economic disadvantages, and in the past many have struggled to find a voice within the health service. English is not the first language of many parents of children born with thalassaemia, which makes access difficult. Often families have to navigate the complications in the health and education systems. The lack of access to appropriate treatment and care for thalassaemia patients can contribute to the health and social inequalities that many patients and communities already face. This ethnic profile makes the spread of thalassaemia patients across the country uneven, which means that primary care trusts in certain areas, such as London, Birmingham and Manchester, face a disproportionate number of thalassaemia patients. That creates a number of problems with the burden on resources among PCTs with a high prevalence of thalassaemia. For low-prevalence PCTs, the cost is lessened, but patient access to specialist services is often patchy. They are required to travel long distances to access services.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/18">To overcome problems of disparity in care in other conditions, particularly where patient numbers are relatively low and patients require a package of specialist care, the NHS has responded by developing managed clinical networks with the aim of improving cross-boundary working between health professionals and organisations in order to achieve the desired equitable provision of high-quality, clinically effective services. The UK Thalassaemia Society has produced guidelines on the standards of care for the treatment of thalassaemia patients, with the assistance of leading clinicians. Central to achieving those standards and improving outcomes is the establishment of clinical networks. Clinicians hope that if those clinical networks are established, the service for patients will improve. I understand that for the past two years the Government have been developing clinical networks for thalassaemia and sickle cell, but sadly there is no evidence that they are functioning and delivering the desired service. I would appreciate it, therefore, if the Minister outlined a time scale for the implementation of her Government's plans for clinical networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/19">Variations in treatment and care between PCTs and hospital trusts come particularly to the fore in the provision of certain drugs. This is a familiar theme that no doubt has been the subject of other Adjournment debates secured by other hon. Members. The case of thalassaemia is different and particularly pertinent because it affects the whole package of specialised services, the provision of which varies widely between different PCTs. There is not just a disparity in drug treatment; the whole service is often lacking. Patient numbers are low, but unlike many other conditions the ethnic profile of the people affected means that prevalence is not evenly spread through the population, and often patients must contend with the other inequalities that I have mentioned already.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/20">Furthermore, mechanisms such as clinical networks and specialised commissioning, which exist in the NHS to deal with other conditions, as I have pointed out, requiring similar levels of specialised services for smaller numbers of patients, are undeveloped for thalassaemia and other haemoglobinopathies. Will the Minister explain why thalassaemia remains a poor relation to other genetic conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, in terms of funding for specialist drugs, the provision of services and general recognition? Will she explain when the Government will implement the clinical networks for thalassaemia to improve care and reduce variation in provision? What will the Government do to ensure that oral iron chelation treatment is made available to all patients?</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/21">The Minister will be aware of the forthcoming prescription charges review for patients with long-term conditions being undertaken by Professor Ian Gilmore, the president of the Royal College of Physicians. Thalassaemia patients commonly have as many as eight prescriptions per month. Patients with other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, are exempt from paying prescription charges. However, thalassaemia patients bear the financial burden of repeat prescriptions. Given the manifold challenges faced by thalassaemia patients, which I have only just touched on, does the Minister agree that it is unfair and inequitable that they have to pay these charges when patients with other chronic conditions are exempt?</p>
	<p pid="a.284.1/22">I look forward to hearing the Minister's response, either today or in correspondence, if further details arise. I pay tribute to the UK Thalassaemia Society not only for its assistance in the debate, but for the work that it does to assist patients who often fall beneath the radar of proper clinical provision and support across the realms of health, education and social services. I hope that I receive her support today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-02-04a.295.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" speakername="Ian Pearson" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="295"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090204/halltext/90204h0011.htm#09020462000524">
	<p pid="a.295.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship in this short debate, Mrs. Dean. I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2036" name="Andrew Pelling">the hon. Member for Croydon, Central (Mr. Pelling)</phrase> on securing this important debate and giving us the opportunity to consider these issues further. I thank him for his typically generous tribute to the officials and Ministers at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform and the Treasury who have always sought to provide him with answers to his queries on behalf of businesses in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/2">When people look back at recent events, many factors will undoubtedly be adduced as having created the global credit crisis that we now face. They will certainly include the employment of increasingly complex assets that were not well understood and were often linked to the mortgage market, and the bonus-driven pursuit of short-term profit in global financial institutions, which was compounded by shortcomings in regulation, most starkly in the US sub-prime mortgage market. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the haemorrhaging of confidence in the financial system froze inter-bank lending, creating huge problems right across industry in the UK, Europe, the United States and more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/3">In past months, many people have been surprised by the sheer scale and speed of what has gone on, and by the impact of the recession on companies that have been unable to access the credit that they need, because of the unprecedented shock to the financial system. We are in the middle of the biggest shock to the financial system of the modern global era. In response, the UK Government have been extremely clear about our objectives right from the start. Our primary responsibilities are to support the stability of and restore confidence in the financial system, to protect depositors' money and to protect taxpayers' interests. Banks sit at the heart of our economy and provide lending that is vital to growth and job creation. People and businesses across Britain are feeling the consequences of the global credit crunch, which is why the Government have been doing everything possible to stabilise the financial system and restore confidence to the economy, and we will continue to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/4">As the hon. Gentleman has noted, last October, following the unprecedented turmoil in financial markets in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, we announced a comprehensive package of support for the financial system to support the stability of the banking system and to protect savers and depositors. That action has been successful in preventing the collapse of other UK banks and in ensuring that no depositors in UK banks have lost money. In our pre-Budget report we went further, as the Chancellor set out a major fiscal stimulus package to boost the economy and to deliver real help to support businesses, home owners and consumers through these difficult times.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/5">The hon. Gentleman said that a stimulus of &pound;20 billion is quite small, and in terms of global capital flows he is absolutely right. However, as he recognises, it is important that the Government take action. He is right to say that the Conservatives have put themselves on the wrong side of the argument when it comes to this matter. I think they will regret that and have to recant in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/6">It should not just be the UK Government who want to use fiscal measures to stimulate the economy; we need to see global action. That is why we have been particularly welcoming of actions taking place in other European Union countries, China, and most recently the United States, with the fiscal stimulus package that has been discussed under President Obama.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/7">On top of the pre-Budget report, last month the Chancellor announced a further package of measures to support the banking system and safeguard the millions of jobs put at risk by the continuing difficulties in the financial system. Those measures are aimed at beginning to replace the lending capacity lost by the withdrawal of foreign banks and other institutions, which the hon. Gentleman discussed. The measures are also aimed at addressing the barriers that are making it difficult for UK banks to expand their lending and restore certainty to the banking sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/8">The hon. Gentleman referred specifically to the bad bank and wanted to know why the Government have not implemented that option. He is aware that we have considered a number of different options and will be aware of the asset protection scheme that we announced. Troubled, or toxic, assets need to be dealt with and a major element of the package announced in January was the asset protection scheme, which is designed to protect financial institutions against exposure to exceptional future credit losses on certain portfolios of assets. In conjunction with the steps already taken by the UK authorities, the scheme is designed to restore confidence in the financial markets, promote transparency, support financial stability and improve the availability of credit to creditworthy borrowers in the economy. Under the scheme, as I think the hon. Gentleman appreciates, we are specifying that any assets protected are ring-fenced and managed separately within these banks in a way that maximizes their value. However, that is not inconsistent with a bad bank approach. The Treasury will have the ability to take over management or ownership of the assets in defined circumstances. That would enable the creation of a bad bank in due course if it proves necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/9">The Chancellor has made it clear that the bad bank approach may be appropriate in the future for certain institutions and that the Treasury will continue to examine options for any further Government action that may be necessary. With the guarantees that are provided, we believe that the asset protection scheme will work and will be important in protecting financial institutions against exposure to toxic assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/10">As a further step to increase the availability of corporate credit and reduce the illiquidity of underlying instruments, we announced on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-19">19 January</phrase> that the Bank of England will set up an asset purchase scheme. The Bank will be authorised by the Treasury to purchase high quality private-sector assets, including paper issued under the credit guarantee scheme, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and a limited range of asset-backed securities. The significance of the action that we are taking in this regard should not be underestimated. This is the first time that the Bank of England will, in effect, be lending directly to the private sector. The Treasury will authorise initial purchases of up to &pound;50 billion, and the Chancellor has this week written to the Governor of the Bank setting out how we expect to see the scheme used.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/11">The Bank will be guided in its purchases by an assessment of the transactions that are most likely to restore the flow of finance to corporate borrowers, but also by where a viable private market will exist for the assets when markets begin to return to normal. It is important to appreciate that, during the course of this year, the corporate sector in the UK will need to refinance in the region of &pound;90 billion to &pound;100 billion of loans. That is why a scheme such as the asset purchase facility will be an important mechanism for the future. I note that it has been warmly welcomed by the CBI.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/12">Complementing measures to encourage lending by financial institutions, we announced at the same time that the draw-down window for the credit guarantee scheme has been extended from April until the end of 2009. The final maturity date for the scheme remains April 2014, but again, the extension will support orderly issuance and rolling over of guaranteed paper by banks. In addition to the steps that the Government have taken, the Financial Services Authority has issued helpful guidance to address any potential uncertainty surrounding its expectations of banks' capital reserves. The hon. Member for Croydon, Central, who is knowledgeable about these matters, will understand the importance of the FSA's statement. The FSA has made it clear that there are no new statutory requirements for institutions to hold increased capital and it reiterated its view that capital buffers built in as part of the recent recapitalisation exercise play a role both in absorbing losses and facilitating continued lending.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/13">The FSA's statement on capital is consistent with the remarks made on <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-16">16 January</phrase> by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. This goes some way to highlighting the fact that we are confronted by a global problem, which requires a global solution. We are continuing to collaborate closely with our international partners. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have held extensive conversations with international partners to ensure a co-ordinated global response to the economic crisis. I was at a meeting today with one of the governors of the Russian central bank and the Russian Finance Minister has been having talks with the Chancellor. Premier Wen met the Prime Minister only last weekend. The UK will continue to take a leading role in discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/14">The G7 autumn discussions in Washington gave an opportunity for both the Prime Minister and the Chancellor to discuss these issues with world leaders. I want to highlight the importance of the next meeting of the G20, which will be held in London in April. It will come at a very difficult time for the world economy and it is right that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor should take that opportunity to discuss with our international partners how we can further co-ordinate international action. We want to drive forward an ambitious work plan, both to tackle the problems in the global economy and to strengthen the stability and resilience of the global financial system for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/15">In conclusion, we will continue with our dual approach to tackling the global downturn and its far-reaching impacts by working internationally to tackle its causes&mdash;the global banking crisis and the lack of adequate funding in the global financial economy&mdash;and dealing fairly with its consequences here in the UK, providing the right support for people and businesses. The industrial activism approach that we are adopting as a Government, through introducing the working capital scheme, the enterprise financial guarantee and a range of other measures, not least of which is the recent support for the automotive industry in particular, which we announced last Tuesday, are all indications that this Government is looking to provide real help for businesses now to help them get through difficult times and, at the same time, supporting the banking system.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/16">These are difficult challenges and new challenges are emerging every day, but we are determined to do everything necessary to support people and businesses through the downturn and to get our economy growing again just as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/17" class="italic">Question put and agree<i>d</i> to</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/18" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
