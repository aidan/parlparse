<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.249.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" speakername="Richard Benyon" colnum="249"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0001.htm#07101747000464">
	<p pid="a.249.3/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your watchful eye this morning, Sir Nicholas. I also welcome the Minister to his place. I suspect that the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform had a battle to decide which would reply to the debate. It is a matter of huge regret that the Minister's Department lost but, nevertheless, in a personal sense, it is good to see him here.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/2">The Prime Minister, in his leadership acceptance speech, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/3" class="indent">&quot;One of my first acts as prime minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/4">We all welcomed that statement. Today, we have an opportunity to hold the Government to account for what I believe is the classically bad decision to close the Defence Export Services Organisation and move its residual role to another Department. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July</phrase>&mdash;the day before parliament rose for the recess&mdash;the Prime Minister went very much against what he said in his speech by sneaking out a written statement of just 19 lines that brought to an end 40 years of successful Government support for our defence export sector. Some people will call me naive, but I hope for some answers from the Minister this morning about the closure of DESO.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/5">I chose the subject of this debate carefully, as I want to point out how damaging the decision is, and what impact it will have on the future of defence exports. I want to know what was going on in the Prime Minister's head&mdash;I think that we all do from time to time&mdash;that led him to do such damage to such a successful brand. And let us be assured: the brand is dead. Whatever arises from DESO's ashes, the perception in the marketplace is that Britain is out of the game. The best people are leaving to work in the private sector and there is a general belief in the marketplace that the British Government want nothing to do with defence exports. I noticed how happy some organisations opposed to the arms trade were with the decision, and there was talk of parties being held after the announcement. However, I submit that their joy should be short-lived.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.250.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" speakername="Richard Benyon" colnum="250"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0001.htm#07101747000468">
	<p pid="a.250.3/1">That is one of the most dangerous and complacent views that I have heard on the whole issue. I have constituents working for small companies of 25 people that depend on DESO when they go abroad. Those companies do not have a large marketing department. They do not know how the economy and marketplace work in some countries. They go straight to the post. If the hon. Gentleman thinks that &pound;5 billion a year of arms sales and defence exports is insignificant to the economy, I urge him to consider the tax take from those companies, and what the effect will be on hospitals, police and public services in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/2">The debate is intended to draw out from the Minister important answers to important questions: why the Prime Minister took the decision, and why it was dealt with in such an underhand and incompetent way. The decision came only a few days after the Prime Minister called for government to be more open and accountable. I cannot think of a decision that was more closed or more designed to avoid being held to account. It came less than 10 days after an advertisement appeared in <i>The Sunday Times</i> advertising the post of director of DESO. Why was the decision made without any provision for what would fill the vacuum created by DESO's demise? At the very least, one would expect the most basic measures to be in place for what was to come post-DESO.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/3">Internal briefing documents for staff about that extraordinary decision are flying around Whitehall and Westminster. They are in question and answer form, and some of them have fallen into my hands and my colleagues' hands. The answer to one question is:</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/4" class="indent">&quot;How UKTI will manage their responsibility for defence trade promotion remains to be decided.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/5">Another question asks:</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Where will the transferred staff be located&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/7">The answers states that that is &quot;to be decided.&quot; The answer to the question of whether staff will</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/8" class="indent">&quot;transfer to UKTI on the same terms and conditions as they have now&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/9">is that that will be</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/10" class="indent">&quot;worked out during the implementation and planning phase.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/11">Another question asks:</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/12" class="indent">&quot;What will happen to the (Army) Export Support Team?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/13">Importantly&mdash;and this relates to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>&mdash;the answer, again, is that that is &quot;to be decided.&quot; The question of what will happen to the DESO first secretaries overseas, too, is &quot;to be decided.&quot; What an extraordinary decision from a Government who claim to be competent, open and accountable. How extraordinary to make a major change to a Department and to have nothing in place&mdash;nothing; a vacuum.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/14">Why was there no consultation with industry? In a debate last week, several Members quoted letters from large companies&mdash;one was from the managing director of BAE Systems&mdash;and companies such as Thales. Many other letters in circulation have come to my attention. Why was there no consultation with the unions, as required under civil service codes? For the past few days, I have been talking to the unions, and I can find no evidence of any formal briefings, discussions or consultations about what transfers will take place or under what conditions DESO employees will be employed in any new organisation. More importantly, why was there no consultation with Ministers? I think that the House deserves to know when the Secretaries of State for Defence and for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform were informed of the decision. I would that that happened on or around <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July</phrase>, and that it was as much a surprise for them as it was for the rest of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/15">Why was the decision taken in a manner designed to prevent proper parliamentary scrutiny? The House, the industry and its hundreds of thousands of employees, as well as the dedicated staff at DESO, deserve answers. I do not wish to prejudge the Minister, but I must warn him that it would be contemptible if in his reply he simply dished out the usual blandishments and non-answers about how DESO has done excellent work in the past. We know about that, and accept that it is a remarkable organisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting more eloquently that I could have done the argument I was about to make in response to the point made by the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/2">I hope that the Minister will not claim that defence exports would be better served by operating within UK Trade and Investment. The Minister knows that nobody outside the Prime Minister's narrow circle and one or two Labour Back Benchers believes that that is the case. To take up the point made by my hon. Friend, as of this weekend, the DESO website&mdash;I suspect that the announcement will not be there in a few hours' time&mdash;says with a pride which, I am sure is matched by that of the dedicated DESO staff, that it gives</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/3" class="indent">&quot;assistance to company-led marketing campaigns&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/4">It says that it supports the &quot;MOD's defence diplomacy efforts&quot; and its &quot;partnerships and alliances&quot;. It says that it offers &quot;security building measures&quot; and promotes</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/5" class="indent">&quot;British interest and influence abroad&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/6">Those are four good reasons&mdash;key strategic reasons&mdash;for keeping DESO, or that Government discipline, in the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/7">The Government support all exporters through their agencies, but defence exporters need support from the MOD, mainly because they sell to overseas defence ministries. DESO's website states that it is</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/8" class="indent">&quot;an integral part of the Ministry of Defence&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/9">and</p>
	<p pid="a.252.3/10" class="indent">&quot;is well placed to give defence industry the kinds of support it needs&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.0/1">My hon. Friend has huge experience in this field and I hope that he will contribute more to the debate, but he is absolutely right. We are talking about a highly technical economic activity and it is vital both that it is linked to service personnel, who understand the equipment that DESO helps to sell, and that there is hands-on use of the equipment in the field.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/2">The DESO website states that its activities</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/3" class="indent">&quot;differ from those in the civil sector in many respects because of the specialised requirements of...military customers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/4">My hon. Friend is right that DESO is a lean organisation. It does not operate under the leaden hand of departmental organisations that seek to help business but which sometimes have the opposite effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/5">DESO has 460 staff worldwide and about 200 in the UK&mdash;that number is falling rapidly&mdash;and has an annual net budget of &pound;16 million, which is paltry in terms MOD spending. However, it assisted with &pound;500 million-worth of sales last year and contributed massively to the value of defence exports, which averaged &pound;5 billion. The DESO brand is trusted around the world, which has helped to place Britain second only to the United States in defence exports.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.6/4">We need an answer from the Minister. Was the decision made to appease to some faction within the Labour party? In answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1906" name="John Spellar">the point made by the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar)</phrase>, I wonder whether it was a classic piece of new Labour spin. Did the Government perceive a problem with the BAE Systems al-Yamamah deal, and did they wish to park it? Getting rid of DESO means that they can say to the Liberal Democrats, or any organisation with which they may wish to make deals, that they have dealt with the issue. It does not matter that DESO was not part of the deal or that the issue was not about DESO. The decision is hugely damaging and wrong, but the Government have taken it.</p>

	<p pid="a.254.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has made the point that I wished to make a few moments ago. Surely this is a classic piece of horse trading and gesture politics? The Government are on the back foot, as their own left wing and the Liberal Democrats are baying about the dropping of the BAE Systems case. The decision is a sop&mdash;a piece of red meat thrown to the lions, irrespective of the merits of the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.257.3/1">The figure that the hon. Gentleman quotes may or may not be correct. I do not think that what amount the former Chancellor took from pension funds is a subject for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/2">When asked that question, Alan Garwood said:</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/3" class="indent">&quot;The broad test for assessing DESO support to a UK-based defence exporter is not company ownership but the added value that the export would bring to the UK defence industrial base. When assessing competing bids, including situations where one of the suppliers may be foreign-owned, employment, the quality of the work, and the transfer of technology to the UK will be key influences.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/4">Swedish fighter aircraft have received DESO support, as they</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/5" class="indent">&quot;use some UK-manufactured components&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/6">and exports by the UK subsidiary of the US-based Lockheed Martin might also qualify under that definition.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/7">Military exports are not unique in raising questions about the appropriateness of UK government support for a multinational commercial enterprise. As the hon. Member for Newbury mentioned, the Export Credits Guarantee Department is holding a</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/8">consultation on foreign content in which it proposes to address the problem with a formula based on percentage terms. In contrast to the ECGD's approach, DESO's UK test seems noticeably vague. It is unclear how it was developed, and the test is open to subjective decisions by DESO, which&mdash;particularly if there are competing bids&mdash;is left susceptible to lobbying.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/9">I turn to second-hand sales. A major part of DSO's work was to sell surplus UK armed forces equipment, thus making a return to the Ministry of Defence. However, two and a half years ago, the Disposal Services Agency, which is responsible for that work, moved from DESO to become part of the Defence Logistics Organisation, so the need to recoup MOD costs is no longer a reason for continuing Government support for DESO.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/10">Should a private industry receive public subsidy? DESO co-ordinates most of the direct Government support for arms exports, provides marketing assistance and advice on negotiation and financing arrangements and organises exhibitions and promotional tours. The hon. Gentleman is quite right&mdash;the budget for operating costs is a relatively limited one, at &pound;15 million or so during the last financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.3/11">As well as DESO's assistance, the arms companies value the position DESO gives them at the heart of government. The head of DESO is always seconded from an arms company. DESO can argue a company's case against other Departments and, through its explicit role of lobbying Ministers, is likely to distort policy making.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.1/1">I am quite happy for defence equipment to be exported by the UK defence industry. It has an appropriate part to play in countries around the world. There are some examples of exports going to regimes that should not be receiving UK arms by that or other means, but in general I am happy. With parts of it, I am not. I hope that that answers my hon. Friend's question.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.1/2">Military exports undoubtedly bring commercial benefit to UK-based companies&mdash;I acknowledge that&mdash;but it is not the same as benefiting the UK economy as a whole. Taxpayers should not be in the business of subsidising private companies to help them boost their profits and share prices.</p>

	<p pid="a.258.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for reading out his brief from the Campaign Against the Arms Trade. Perhaps he has not been briefed on this, but does he not accept that defence exports enable British industry to achieve economies of scale that reduce the unit cost of British defence equipment to the United Kingdom Government? In other words, defence exports result in direct benefit and cost reduction to the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.259.4/1">When I described it as unfortunate, I was referring to the circumstances&mdash;the financial arrangements and the covert organisation that existed to push substantial sums into hidden pockets in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere. That is what is unfortunate&mdash;not the deal, the arms or the country receiving them but the arrangements surrounding the deal. I am sure that my hon. Friend will want to contribute to the debate later, having worked as a Minister with some distinction in the relevant Department earlier in our Government's time in office.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.4/2">I wish to make two further brief points. Military exports are often justified as a way of ensuring continuity of production, so that the UK's armed forces can be supplied whenever necessary. However, exports can take precedence. For example, the first 24 Eurofighters for Saudi Arabia will be taken from those that were originally destined for the RAF. That is hardly continuity in supply for the UK's armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.4/3">Finally, one reason given for wanting the continuation of DESO&mdash;we shall see what happens after its demise&mdash;is that public support for military exports is based on defence diplomacy. However, the Saudi Arabia saga exposed the lunacy and fallacy of that argument. For all the Government's desire to expand our influence around the world, the dropping of the SFO inquiry&mdash;perhaps the Minister will incorporate an answer to this point in his reply&mdash;shows clearly that the real power lies with the customer Governments and the supply companies. The interests of the Government and the taxpayer come a very poor third and fourth in that equation.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.4/4">Although I respect the motives of the hon. Member for Newbury in wanting to debate the subject&mdash;I congratulate him on its timeliness and on his speech&mdash;the activities of DESO, its style and its involvement in numerous dodgy deals over many years mean that it is at last being consigned to the wastepaper basket of the defence industry. That is where it deserves to be. The UK defence industry will continue to thrive and expand, it will continue to provide jobs and advance technology, and it will continue to be a British influence around the world. It does not need DESO. DESO is a barrier to that; it is a brake, not an accelerator or a catalyst. DESO is going, and good riddance to it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.265.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1668" speakername="Ben Wallace" colnum="265"  time="010:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0003.htm#07101747000510">
	<p pid="a.265.4/1">I totally agree. I opposed the sell-off of QinetiQ, and I do not have any shares now&mdash;nor did I have any then&mdash;in the company. I do not believe that those massive pay-offs were worth it&mdash;no one warrants that. I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/2">We all call it &quot;arms&quot; today, because it suits the Campaign Against Arms Trade to do so, but the British defence and aerospace industry goes much wider than arms. We do not make Kalashnikovs and all those things that we mainly see on the television. As a north-west MP, I am incredibly conscious of the weight and contribution that the defence industry gives to the UK economy. We make a whole range of things that, in today's environment, mainly have dual uses. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> correctly pointed out that one of the reasons that we have an arms industry in this country is to spread the cost and to allow our armed forces to afford the best kit available. If we did not share the cost of those procurement cycles, we might not be able to afford them. That means sharing and selling to our allies. No one here says that we should sell weapons systems, or even defence systems, to our enemies or to people with whom we disagree.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> pointed out that BAE Systems sells more to America than to Britain. Well, that is not a surprise, as America is our biggest ally and also the biggest defence market in the world&mdash;shock, horror! People may have views about the Bush regime, but let us remember that it is not a regime&mdash;he is an elected President, and one with whom the hon. Gentleman's Government went to war in Iraq. America is a perfectly acceptable ally for us today, in the past and in the future. I am very happy if British companies share their technology with American companies and American armed forces benefit from the protection that our defence industry can give them and vice versa. The Government have just placed an order for Mastiff vehicles to protect British armed forces in Iraq and Afghanistan from mines. That is an American company selling to Britain. I hope that no one objects to that, and nor should they.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/5">The industry also allows us to keep a skills base. When I worked at QinetiQ, it employed 10,000 people across the United Kingdom. It was the biggest grouping of PhDs in Europe, and the biggest research technology organisation in Europe. In this day and age, when we are threatened by Chinese and Indian competition in the realm of technology development, to have an organisation such as QinetiQ, founded in the defence and aerospace industry, is a real asset to the UK. Before we push away what it does because it is founded on defence, we should think what such companies have contributed for our daily use. As I stand in this Chamber, I can see plasma screens, a QinetiQ invention that people daily queue up to buy from Currys or wherever else. The timing clock is a military LED invention. When I get e-mails from all those people in the Campaign Against Arms Trade, I like to remind them that the internet was invented by the Department of Defence in the United States&mdash;how nice that they can send e-mails, based on a military system. Perhaps that is why the Minister responsible for postal services is here&mdash;so that he can offer an ethical alternative for sending communications.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/6">We should remember that the arms industry, the defence industry, gave us the jet engine and facilitates everything that we do today. People cannot merely say, &quot;If we get rid of our arms trade, that will be fine.&quot; Spin-off from the aerospace industry benefits United Kingdom citizens, the taxpayer and the Treasury. I find it totally ironic that the new Prime Minister is at the heart of the decision to abolish the Defence Export Services Organisation&mdash;the man who has always played to the chorus of Rosyth. I am an ex-MSP who represents a north-western English constituency, and my father is from Fife&mdash;in fact, he grew up in the Prime Minister's town when the Prime Minister was the son of the manse, which anyone from Scotland knows is a far higher class than most people in Scottish society. This is the man who makes capital out of backing Rosyth and lives next to Raytheon in Glenrothes. In he comes, and to give some sop or make some easy decision, he abolishes DESO. I hope that the voters in Fife remember that that is what their Prime Minister has done. They did in the other seat in Dunfermline, which became, rather ironically, a Liberal Democrat gain. The Scots know a good thing when they see it, and I hope that they remember what the Prime Minister has done with DESO.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/7">We should also remember about dual use technology. Yes, we have invented things, but today's threat is not the Soviet Union&mdash;it could well be Russia or China in a few decades, but it is not now&mdash;but the terrorists on our street. When I was in QinetiQ, I personally worked on projects that are right now keeping us safe from suicide bombers. Most of what we do in defence today is about scanners, sensors and communications. It is not about firing the gun but about trying to anticipate the actions of our threats. As we speak, in this building, some&mdash;probably 99.9 per cent.&mdash;of the sensors that are being used were developed by the arms industry. Let us call it the arms industry, because we can take these people head on. Those sensors, developed in that industry, keep us safe in aeroplanes and on the streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/8">Smiths Group is an excellent company that is now equipping every single New York tube station with chemical and biological detectors to ensure that the population of New York is protected from weapons of mass destruction used by terrorists. If only our Mayor of London were clever enough to invest in such a system. That is a British invention, and I am proud that we supported it. We did so through DESO, which got those sales for us&mdash;something it is extremely good at. In my experience, I would go to an embassy, and DESO would know what it wanted. It would know the market and the customer. Let us remember that DESO was on the side of small business. It was not BAE Systems. Yes, it helped BAE Systems and everything else, but it also helped small companies in my constituency and in that of my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury by giving them the marketing infrastructure and international presence that they would not otherwise have had. Frankly, without that they would have been crushed by the likes of the American, German and French giants. If people are on the side of British defence, they should be on the side of DESO.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> is absolutely right when he talks about the Department of Trade and Industry being a dud&mdash;we call it &quot;deter trade international&quot;. We used to go to the embassy, but we were lucky if the staff knew anything from their elbows, and when they did sort of know what was going on, their only response was, &quot;Ring up your Business Link in your regional development agency.&quot; That is the real game&mdash;keeping each other going: the RDAs keep the DTI going, and the DTI keeps the RDAs going. I spoke to a woman on the desk at Southampton&mdash;I wonder if she was the same communist who now has got a job in the Treasury&mdash;who did not even know where the Czech Republic was when I asked if she could help with a tender in that country.</p>
	<p pid="a.265.4/10">We should be reversing this decision. It is an horrendous decision for a small, &pound;16 million project. Not much in the Government works extremely well for &pound;16 million, but DESO does. We should all recognise that not a single MOD Minister, nor probably a single DTI Minister&mdash;for its short remaining life span&mdash;supports this decision. However, the Prime Minister is at the heart of this. He can reverse the decision, and he must.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.0/1">I am delighted to respond in this debate on behalf of the Opposition. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on securing this very important debate, which will be widely read across the land and where the defence industry is represented. I am proud to be the Member of Parliament representing the headquarters of BAE Systems and QinetiQ&mdash;two of Britain's greatest defence companies. I make no apologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/2">I am replying to this debate because I am a shadow Defence Minister, and I think that it is a mark of the contempt with which the Prime Minister and the Government hold the defence industry in our country that they have put up today a Minister representing postal services. I have never met him&mdash;it is not his fault, and I dare say it is mine&mdash;but I have read through his experience, and he seems to have none of the defence industry. It is contemptible that he has been put forward to respond to this debate. The truth is that Defence Ministers are consumed with embarrassment about a decision on which the Secretary of State for Defence was not consulted, let alone his junior Ministers. They have managed to shuffle off the responsibility on to the poor, hapless Minister here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">As my hon. Friends have explained so graphically, the truth is that this was not planned. In July of this year, an advertisement in <i>The Sunday Times </i>invited people to apply for the job of head of the Defence Export Services Organisation. This is how the Government described the appointment:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/4" class="indent">&quot;This is a vital role supporting defence objectives and contributing to wider national interests. It is a highly significant appointment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/5">It was so significant that 10 days later the Prime Minister scrapped the whole organisation, so obviously no one new was appointed to run it.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/6">When I asked whether anyone in the industry had been consulted, eventually I received a reply from the Secretary of State for Defence, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/7" class="indent">&quot;This was a Machinery of Government change and in such circumstances, it is not unusual for announcements to be made quickly and without prior discussion with those outside Government. However, the current and future Chairs&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/8">which I assume means chairmen&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/9" class="indent">&quot;of the National Defence Industries Council, Sir John Rose and Mr Mike Turner, were informed by telephone that morning.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-17">17 September 2007</phrase>; Vol. 463, c. 2173W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/10">What contempt! Those captains of British industry, who are working their guts out for their employees and their country and for the defence of the realm, were informed by telephone that morning. Indeed, they were informed only after Alan Garwood had been, at half-past 9 in the morning. And he is only the bloke running the system! It is perfectly clear that there was no consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/11">My hon. Friends have asked for some answers from the Minister, and I have some questions of my own. It is his duty to answer those questions, although I doubt that he will be able to do so. The good news that I can tell my hon. Friends is that, according to the Campaign Against Arms Trade, whose brief was most ably read out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/12" class="indent">&quot;There will be more about how the campaign was won in the next CAATnews.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/13">We will look forward to receiving information on how that decision came about, probably not from the Minister, but from the Campaign Against Arms Trade. That is highly appropriate, because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1724" name="Julian Lewis">my hon. Friend the Member for New Forest, East (Dr. Lewis)</phrase> made it clear that this was a sop to the old left of the Labour party and those who were upset by the calling off of the Serious Fraud Office investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/14">It is clear that some Labour Members have it in for the defence industry, and the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire demonstrated his complete, abject lack of understanding of Britain's defence industry and its importance to constituencies across the land. He ought to understand the anger of his party colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1906" name="John Spellar">the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar)</phrase> at his display of such ignorance in front of a man who, of course, was a Defence Minister, was probably instrumental in shaping the strategic defence review in 1998, and continues to make an important contribution to defence matters in our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/15">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire was inveighing against the cost of DESO. In one year, it costs about &pound;15 million net, but produces returns of &pound;5 billion in sales for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1778" name="Crispin Blunt">our country. My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate (Mr. Blunt)</phrase> pointed out that in DESO&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.269.1/1">I am sorry, but I do not want to hear any more from the Campaign Against Arms Trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Reigate pointed out that DESO contains specialist services and expert knowledge, and of course people in uniform, because overseas Administrations are not organised in the same way as the United Kingdom. Many of them want to come to the United Kingdom and speak to military personnel, in a military environment, and talk to military ministers in the Ministry of Defence. By this break-up, the Government are proposing to remove that special experience. As my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury said, all the able people will be making tracks to the front door, if they have not done so already.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/3">As the right hon. Member for Warley pointed out, Government-to-Government deals will remain the responsibility of the MOD. My hon. Friend the Member for Newbury said that information had been circulated to some of us from people who are desperately concerned. The Minister does not understand. I assure him that this is no synthetic anger. We are deeply angry about what the Government have done, and so is British industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/4">In case the Minister does not know, the answer to the frequently asked question:</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/5" class="indent">&quot;What will happen in future with overseas customers who want to deal with the MOD, not a trade promotion organisation?&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/6">was:</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/7" class="indent">&quot;That is again something that will need to be worked through with the other Government departments concerned. As the Prime Minister's statement makes clear, current and planned arrangements, mainly with the Saudi Government, will continue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/8">Everybody else will be subject to arrangements yet to be decided.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/9">Interestingly enough, the Campaign Against Arms Trade is also saying that by shifting this into the Department of the Minister here today, the defence industry will be removed from the Ministry of Defence, which will leave it much more subject to policy decisions from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. This decision will have a huge adverse impact. It is already having an adverse impact on the way in which defence business is done between the United Kingdom and potential overseas customers. Has the Minister attended the Defence Systems and Equipment International exhibition at docklands? He should do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/10">Clearly this is an act of political spite. It is a pay-off to Baroness Vadera, who got a peerage as well. We need to know which officials in the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury are either involved themselves in the Campaign Against Arms Trade or have family members who are involved. We also need to know what resources are going to be put into the new arrangement with UK Trade and Investment. What is the MOD's commitment going to be? I understand that the Minister's Department intends to set up an organisation within the DTI with military officers seconded to it. Is that the case? Have those military officers agreed? Where will they be located? Will they have access back into the MOD? And what about small and medium-sized enterprises, which some of my hon. Friends have mentioned? I received an e-mail from a company that I know called Christy Military Flying Training Ltd, which is a DESO charter member. It had to qualify to become a charter member, which gives it instant credibility in the overseas market. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The removal of that Charter Member status will, at the very least, have an impact on our ability to break into overseas markets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/12">It also said that</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/13" class="indent">&quot;being a DESO Charter member has been of significant benefit, giving us direct access to sales support overseas and overseas contacts via FCO.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/14">SMEs will be wiped out of the picture. We know from a written answer published today that DESO branches&mdash;project offices&mdash;throughout the world number about 15. What will happen to them? We need an answer from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/15">This is a contemptible, personal decision by the Prime Minister, whose interest in defence does not venture beyond his own constituency, where Rosyth is located.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.1/16">Hon. Members: Or a photo shoot in Iraq.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on securing the debate. I appreciate his strong interest in defence issues and his background as a member of the armed forces. We also heard from a former shadow Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase>, and from others with a background in the issue. I assure them that I have full respect, as they would expect, for that experience. If that respect is not returned, that is a judgment not for me, but for Opposition Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/2">The question was asked why a Minister from the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform is speaking in this debate. The answer is that the Prime Minister's decision, which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July</phrase>, was to transfer some of the Defence Export Service Organisation's responsibilities to UK Trade and Investment, which has two parent Departments, one of which is DBERR, so in the future my Department will have a strong interest in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/3">I shall begin by endorsing the sentiments that have been expressed about the strength of DESO's record, the quality of the people who work there and its success in securing many orders for the defence industry throughout the UK. Hon. Members asked several questions about the transfer, but at root there is one more fundamental question about whether in the transfer we will lose the record, expertise and quality that DESO has stood for over the years, or whether there will be an opportunity to add to it. The Government are of the view that the change does not mean losing that quality or that record but gives us an opportunity to add to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.1/4">One point was made in the debate that I cannot endorse: that somehow UKTI is not a successful body for the UK, that it is not respected throughout the world and that it does not have expertise and value to add to the promotion of exports in general and of defence exports in the future. The question was asked about the announcement itself, and I am afraid that I must agree with the answer that the Opposition spokesperson, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase>, read out a moment ago. As the machinery of government changes, it is not unusual for such changes to be announced in that way, or for the implementation details to be worked out afterwards. It has happened in the past, and it may happen in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.274.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="274"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0004.htm#07101747000526">
	<p pid="a.274.1/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the second time in two days, Sir Nicholas. It is becoming a welcome habit.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/2">I am delighted to have the opportunity to spend some time throwing a spotlight on an important institution that has a long track record of supporting British exports and facilitating British trade, but which has been dogged by controversy for most of its history, not least because of its involvement in projects such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline and, most recently, Sakhalin. That institution is the Export Credits Guarantee Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/3">The organisation needs to be modernised, and I speak as a member of the Environmental Audit Committee, although I was not a member in 2003, when it published its groundbreaking report calling for changes to the ECGD's remit of. I am also a board member of the Conservatives' quality of life policy commission&mdash;recently, it, too, called for changes to that remit. My thesis is simple: Britain is a recognised thought leader on climate change. Indeed, the Government take pride in their reputation for leadership on the agenda, and some of that pride is well placed. They have taken a lead in setting targets, pushing climate change up the agenda of international politics and, most recently, submitting to the House a draft Climate Change Bill. However, at this critical time we should seek to demonstrate best practice in our institutions. The ECGD is a particularly important institution, because export credit agencies are an important source of capital and therefore an important driver of change in the business community. Those agencies and the ECGD engage with other countries, so they should therefore reflect the British Government's priorities and values.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/4">The ECGD's importance is made apparent by its own sustainable development action plan, in which it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/5" class="indent">&quot;The annual total value of capital goods exported with medium to long term finance supported by all the ECAs of the OECD countries usually ranges between &pound;30 billion and &pound;40 billion, with ECGD's share being around &pound;2 billion. Although this level of ECGD support represents only around 2% of UK exports annually, the exports that are supported often form part of larger projects&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/6">It admits:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/7" class="indent">&quot;ECGD's involvement provides an opportunity for it to influence the attitudes of project sponsors, host Governments and the other financial institutions in regard to Sustainable Development issues at the project level.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/8">We therefore expect the ECGD to represent best practice on environmental standards, but the truth is that it pays lip service to them and runs with an unambitious pack. We expect it to support the industries of the low-carbon future, but instead it subsidises a relatively small number of powerful industries that are among the most polluting in the world. Surely, if the Government are serious about matching rhetoric with action, now is the time for them to show more ambition by changing the remit and culture of the ECGD to align it more explicitly with their sustainable development strategy, position it to support the clean industries of the future and bring it out of the shadows. That would transform it into a transparent and accountable public institution of which we can be genuinely proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/9">I am delighted to make my argument to a Minister with excellent credentials. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" name="Malcolm Wicks">The hon. Member for Croydon, North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> is a well respected Energy Minister whose commitment to the environment is not in question. Anyone who doubts it should visit the planning department of Croydon council, where they can see the files that bear testimony to his persistence in trying to install a wind turbine on the roof of his house. In fact, his passion for such technology extends to his having recently presented me with my own mini-wind turbine as a wholly undeserved reward. I have no doubt that he is a Minister who has fully aligned himself personally with the Government's rhetoric on climate change and the importance of the environmental agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/10">I should like to break my argument into three parts. First, what should we expect of the ECDG? Some voices say, &quot;Don't muck around with it. It is working&mdash;don't muck around with the core focus.&quot; I suggest to the Minister that that is not good enough in 2007 in the face of climate change and the growing recognition of the wider damage that we are doing to the natural resources on which our prosperity and well-being ultimately depend. Leading politicians attach huge priority to climate change as the greatest threat to our long-term well-being, and we know that the response will require huge change and a transformation of our energy and transport infrastructure. In the short term, we face a major challenge in stabilising our emissions, let alone reducing them. You will be aware, Sir Nicholas, we have an unfortunate track record over the past 10 years, as our domestic emissions have risen, not fallen. The past 10 years have taught us that tackling the problem is hard, but there is growing consensus about the role of Government. They should correct the market's failure to put a value on carbon, set the clearest possible framework for the market and lead by example.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/11">There is also growing consensus about the need to reinforce the principle that the polluter should pay. A key audience for that message is business, which is a key agent of change, not least because of its ability to drive change through the supply chain. Sometimes business responds to Government through regulation, and sometimes it responds to employees. It certainly responds to customers and to sources of capital. Export credit agencies are a major source of capital. The Environmental Audit Committee pointed out that they are</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/12" class="indent">&quot;collectively the largest source of public finance for private sector projects&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/13">and</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/14" class="indent">&quot;powerful, influential players in the field of international business. They underwrite ten per cent. of exports from large industrialised countries&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/15">They are funded by the taxpayer and are accountable to Government. Given the priority attached to climate change, and the Government's pride in their leadership, an external observer would expect such an important organisation as the ECGD to be a shining example of best practice, standing shoulder to shoulder with the Government's policy priorities. It is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/16">In theory, the ECGD reports to a Government Department but in fact it stands apart and does its own thing. It derives its powers from the Export and Investment Guarantees Act 1991, which has not been materially adjusted for 16 years. It is an institution in decline, given the volume of business that it underwrites. Its core business is the subsidisation of a relatively small number of powerful industries&mdash;defence infrastructure, aerospace, oil and gas&mdash;that are characterised by their negative impact on the environment. Meanwhile, its participation in the financing of new industries is negligible, at 2 per cent. of the current fund, despite the commitments made by the British Government at Johannesburg in 2002 and, more recently, at Gleneagles. Instead of being at the forefront of promoting corporate responsibility, it pays lip service to what is explicitly described in its sustainable development report as a secondary duty to operate in accordance with other Government objectives,</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/17" class="indent">&quot;including those on sustainable development...human rights, good governance and trade.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/18">Since 2000, the ECGD has been required to produce a statement of business principles, and I acknowledge the Government's role in that important initiative. The ECGD's business principles state:</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/19" class="indent">&quot;We will promote a responsible approach to business and will ensure our activities take into account the Government's international policies, including those on sustainable development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/20">No reference to climate change is made in any of the ECGD's strategies, risk assessments or investment decisions. The business principles are assessed by case impact analyses, which are designed to provide an assurance that the ECGD's activities are consistent, but such analyses are not required for its aerospace or defence business, which is subject to other codes with environmental standards of questionable stringency. Even in cases in which the analyses are applicable, impacts are assessed by comparing them with the relevant international standards, for which the benchmark is World Bank standards which, historically, are not very demanding. A process is under way to find a common, more demanding standard, but I do not get the impression that there is much political momentum behind it. I should be interested to hear the Minister's view and to receive an update.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/21">It would not matter if the standards were the most exacting in the world, because it is quite clear to anyone who does business with the ECGD that it considers environmental and social assessment procedures to be discretionary. Standards apply, but only when it sees fit. It is therefore not surprising that it is extremely reluctant to disclose its analyses, obstructing attempts to obtain them through freedom of information requests. It is not surprising, either, that it has never rejected a project on environmental or social grounds, or that it is embroiled in legal cases with non-governmental organisations such as WWF that find its attitudes utterly frustrating in the new political environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/22">Does all that matter? Of course it does, for at least three reasons. First, because at a time when British taxpayers are being told about the changes that they have to make to reduce their carbon footprint, their money is being spent on subsidising the development of projects with high carbon impacts for which the sponsors are not accountable. Secondly, our poverty of ambition has resulted in a missed opportunity to show a lead to other export credit agencies, and, thirdly, the impact of emissions can be linked both directly and indirectly to ECGD activity. In aviation, for example, in the past five years, the ECGD has provided &pound;3.3 billion of finance for the supply of 294 aircraft, which is equivalent to British Airways' entire fleet being added to the global airline industry every five years with Government support. The ECGD should act as a gadfly to the industry, encouraging it to move further and faster to improve the energy efficiency of those aircraft, but it is not at all clear that it has done so. The Sakhalin project is another example: WWF estimates that the 1.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the lifetime oil and gas production of that one development are equivalent to just three years of UK national emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/23">That is not good enough. At an absolutely critical time, a key British institution that the Government ought to be able to control is sending the wrong signals to the market. The Government should point the ECGD in a different direction. First, they should change its remit. The 1991 Act should be amended to make it clearer that the Secretary of State and the ECGD must have more explicit regard to climate change and other key policy requirements. Secondly, the Government should change the culture of the organisation to make it more transparent. We should know about direct and indirect emissions resulting from investments facilitated by public money; the ECGD should be required to disclose them and bring its aerospace activities under the scope of the environmental and social assessment, including climate change. Thirdly, they should bring the ECGD into the collective Government effort to control greenhouse gas emissions in this country. They should have targets to reduce contributions to those emissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/24">Lastly, and more controversially, the ECGD should lead a shift towards low-carbon finance as part of a Government-led initiative to phase out subsidies to fossil fuel industries. By taking a lead on that issue, the British Government would reinforce leadership on climate change and go with the grain of developments elsewhere. The Minister may be aware that the &quot;End Oil Aid&quot; Bill was introduced in the United States in April 2007 to end subsidies for oil companies' international operations. Calculations by the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development show that global subsidy removal could reduce CO2 emissions by about 10 per cent. worldwide. The EU sustainable development strategy requires a 2008 road map to phase out subsidies that are harmful to the environment. The message is that the polluter should pay, not be paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/25">There are concerns about competitiveness, and the Minister might make that argument. I urge him, however, to consider the example set by the Canadian equivalent of the ECGD, which follows best practice by disclosing the environmental standard used to assess projects, and allows appeals against decisions, unlike the ECGD. Unlike its British equivalent, its business is not in decline. Indeed, last year it reported record numbers and business grew by 15 per cent. The message is that the world is changing and it is time for the ECGD to change with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/26">I shall close with some questions for the Minister. Does he believe that the ECGD is playing its full part in the Government's battle to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? Is he satisfied that it is operating with satisfactory levels of transparency and accountability to the public? Does he believe that it offers the taxpayer value for money? Would he support an investigation by the National Audit Office into whether it offers best value? Does he believe that a publicly funded body should continue to subsidise the fossil fuel industry, particularly in emerging markets where the priority should be to help develop clean energy? Does he think that the ECGD should retain its current focus and prioritisation or does he accept the need for change?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.283.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" speakername="Russell Brown" colnum="283"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0006.htm#07101747000531">
	<p pid="a.283.1/1">Last week, a national newspaper carried an article entitled &quot;Why are our young people killing each other?&quot; The story referred to the violent murder of a young boy who was simply minding his own business. His murder brought the number of young people's deaths from gun or knife crime in the UK to 51. Only the families and friends of those young victims know the pain and hurt of losing a loved one in such violent circumstances. I hope that we all recognise how precious life is but, regrettably, it is of little significance to some others. I do not wish in any way to demean the memory of those 51 individuals, because they are as precious to their loved ones as all those who daily lose their lives on our roads are to their loved ones .</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">The startling statistics for road deaths show that while individual drivers do not go out with the intention of having a road traffic accident that could result in a fatality, the way in which some people drive on our roads, especially some young drivers, means that young people are killing one another on our roads. Let me make it clear that the vast majority of drivers of all ages on our roads are good drivers. However, among the 3,200 lives lost and 30,000 injuries resulting from road traffic accidents there is a disproportionate number of deaths and serious injuries in the 17 to 25 age group. Male drivers in that group are over-represented in the crash statistics. Under-25s account for one in eight licence holders, yet one in three drivers who die on our roads are in that age group.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3">Some people argue that the word &quot;accident&quot; should not be used, as it implies that there is something inevitable about such collisions. They believe that they are almost entirely avoidable with appropriate training and testing, the correct attitude, a licensing regime that supports an extended learning period for new drivers, and appropriate sanctions on those who transgress. Single vehicle crashes involving novice drivers occur most often at night between 10 pm and 6 am, and mainly involve speeding with other teenagers present in the vehicle. There is substantial evidence that when teenage passengers are present with young drivers the risk of a crash increases significantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">I imagine that almost everyone in the Chamber possesses a driving licence. Even with many of the smaller engine vehicles constructed today, it is easy to exceed the maximum speed limit on our roads. How many of us can honestly say that we have never found ourselves inadvertently exceeding the speed limit on an open road when the weather and road conditions were good? It is easy for the speed to creep up without the driver realising, and that is even more so on a long journey. Passing the driving test in 2007 provides nothing more than a certificate allowing the holder to drive safely on their own, and it is worrying that the majority of those who pass are deemed not to be the finished product or a finished driver. Learning to drive is really about preparing for that one day when the test is taken in the hope of passing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">Only yesterday evening, I spoke to a constituent who hopes to become a qualified driving instructor. He informed me that it is possible for someone to sit the theory driving test on their 17th birthday, and within two months take and pass their driving test. Thereafter, that person can go out and drive any car with any size of engine. Drivers who have just passed their driving test are informed about the opportunity to develop their skills through the Pass Plus scheme, but only about one in eight takes that opportunity. I have explained how easy it is in today's modem vehicles to drive at excessive speeds, and while it has been shown that speed is all too often a contributory factor in many crashes, accidents often happen because the driver cannot handle or control the vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/6">I want to thank my local police force, Dumfries and Galloway constabulary, particularly Inspector Gordon McKnight, for providing me with some local statistics for this debate. During the three-year period from January 2004 to December 2006, 61.5 per cent. of all casualties were male, and further analysis reveals that in the under-45 age group, the average number of male casualties remained at 65 per cent. The under-16 category accounts for 11 per cent. of all casualties; the 16 to 20 age group accounts for just over 18 per cent.; and the 21 to 25 age bracket for 11.1 per cent. Overall, the 30 and under age group accounts for 47.5 per cent. of all casualties, and as one in three casualties fall into the 16 to 25 age bracket, Dumfries and Galloway constabulary decided to target that age group through education and, when necessary, enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/7">How do we attempt to get the message about the dangers on our roads across to young drivers? In Dumfries and Galloway&mdash;and these statistics are linked to those for Cumbria&mdash;we have witnessed the death of 44 young people between the ages of 16 and 25 over the past three years. Today's method of communicating with the younger generation is changing rapidly, and I congratulate the Highways Agency on its attempt to get that safety message across by backing the innovative cross-border campaign to try to cut death and injuries among young road users in Cumbria and Scotland. Financial resources from the agency will fund a project that uses YouTube videos and texts to get key road safety messages across to young drivers. Between now and Christmas, there will be three 20-second ads on YouTube. They may be beyond you and me, Sir Nicholas, and other hon. Members&mdash;they certainly are for me&mdash;but the younger generation often uses YouTube.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/8">The inquiry by the Select Committee on Transport into novice drivers was published in July. I tried to hold this debate in the run-up to the recess, and it is ironic that I should have secured it on the day on which the Government's response to the Committee's report was released. However, I regret that I have not had time to study the response in fine detail. I have explained how easy it is for some people to pass their driving test within a few months of turning 17, and we must ask whether it is wise for people to take the test at that age. I am sure that we have all said that we do not start to learn to drive until we are out on the road on our own, after we have passed our driving test. That may be true, but if we cast aside everything that we learned when we received professional tuition, we will develop bad habits and, more worryingly, drive dangerously and all too often be oblivious to other road users and pedestrians. I fully agree that we need to foster a culture that values continuing driver education. Rushing to take a driving test and having too few lessons may be a false economy, especially if people end up failing the test and retaking it.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/9">I should like to highlight some of the issues arising from the Transport Committee report that are worthy of further mention. Again, I emphasise that the vast majority of young or newly qualified drivers are responsible, but if we look at the problems that we face and at the number of road fatalities we see, as with so many other issues, that we must concentrate our efforts and focus on the few who cause problems. Young drivers are vulnerable on our roads and, regrettably, a small number are a danger to themselves, their passengers and other road users. Such unsafe driving arises from an almost total disregard for road traffic laws&mdash;speed limits are sometimes ignored even in built-up areas, where there are many more dangers and thus higher casualties if there were a crash.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/10">The casualties that we see year on year must be reduced, and a starting point is a structured approach to driving instruction. I welcome any attempts to ensure that ongoing professional development for driving instructors is more fully considered. Further professional enhancement can only be good for those under instruction. The low uptake of Pass Plus&mdash;a scheme for people who have been successful in their practical tests&mdash;is disappointing. I pay tribute to the group of advanced motorists and motorcyclists in Dumfries and Galloway who do an excellent job of encouraging young motorcyclists and motorists to learn the skills that they need on the road, and deserve great credit for the work they do with new drivers. The Pass Plus uptake is disappointing, because the scheme benefits those who take up the additional challenge it offers. We cannot force individuals to take it up, but its success and what it offers to new drivers ought to be included in the instruction that people receive before they take a practical test. I hope that that proposal will be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/11">May I return to the issue of how quickly young drivers can find themselves on the road on their own in a powerful vehicle, having passed both the theory and practical tests? Some people advocate increasing the age at which it is possible to hold a provisional driving licence above 17, but it would make more sense to ensure that people have a minimum learning period of about a year. I have been contacted in recent days by the insurance company, esure, which believes that the number of road traffic accidents caused by, and involving, young drivers would be reduced if pre-driver education were rolled out nationally with Government endorsement and support. In 2005, esure ran the safe drive, stay alive road safety campaign in Surrey, which was co-ordinated by the Surrey Fire and Rescue Service and involved a number of local organisations. Although I am not in a position to judge the campaign's success, the sooner we can get young people involved in the safety aspects of driving, and make them understand the dangers of driving, the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/12">Finally, graduated licences have proved relatively successful in other countries and in some parts of the United States. Some people argue that introducing graduated licences would be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. As I have said several times, the vast majority of young drivers are responsible and considerate to other road users, and are safe drivers. However, consideration ought to be given to the question of limiting the engine size in cars driven by new drivers; reducing the speed limit to 50 mph; and introducing driving restrictions such as limiting the number of passengers during certain hours of the evening and night&mdash;some of the worst tragedies on our roads have involved four or five youngsters in a car driven by someone who has recently passed their test.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/13">I hope that the Minister will give careful consideration to my arguments and those that we are about to hear from other hon. Members. We have a duty to reduce the carnage on our roads. Over the years, I have spoken with a number of people who have been faced with that fateful knock on the door and police officers standing before them to break the bad news. It has been a haunting experience for those individuals and their families. Let us move forward in the coming years and ensure that there is a rapid reduction in such visits to people's homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.0/1">May I first congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> on the timeliness of the debate? The issue is serious and affects many people around the country in all constituencies. For too long, modern-day young people have found the use of a motor car to be far more accessible than perhaps we did when we were younger. Consideration must be given to car use and the dangers it might cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/2">The rural roads in south-west Norfolk in my constituency are long and winding and they are far too often the scene of tragic road accidents in which, on occasion, innocent passers-by are involved and killed.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/3">I shall speak briefly as I wish to make a few specific points to the Minister that I hope he will take on board&mdash;I know him well and he has dealt with me courteously in the past. Does he agree that the current legislation might encourage young drivers, particularly those under the influence of drink or drugs, to flee the scene of road traffic accidents? Motorists who kill on the road while driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs face a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. Failing to stop at the scene carries a maximum sentence of only six months, which effectively encourages those over the legal limit to leave the scene and to leave their victims injured or dying on the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.0/4">I believe that such drivers hope that by the time the police catch up with them, they will have sobered up sufficiently to pass any tests. Does the Minister agree that due consideration ought to be given to reforming the current guidelines and to remove what is an unnecessary incentive to young driver? That would send a message to every young person who passes their test that they have full responsibility and that the rule of law will come down on them extremely heavily at every opportunity, because we must not fail to remember the victims of accidents and those who must live with the death of a family member for the rest of their lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">my congratulations to the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase>. The debate is long overdue, and to bring it to the table on the day of the Government's response to the Transport Committee is very apt. I also add my thanks to Brake. We have had tragedy in our constituency over the past couple of months, and it has been a source of comfort in some respects to know that there is a group out there fighting for the health and safety of young drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/2">We have had two significant incidents in my constituency in the past six months. The first killed four young girls under 16, who were passengers. The driver, who was 17, had passed his test only three days before. If that does not bring home how serious the driving test and driving ability are, nothing will. Within months of that, a 15-year-old passenger was killed. The driver, again, was only 17. Age is a significant factor, although I understand that driving is a necessity in this day and age.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/3">The important thing is education, which has been mentioned a number of times&mdash;education in accident statistics, how to drive and what can happen. At the end of the day, a car is a deadly weapon; it can cause huge damage to those inside and out. That should be part of the citizenship agenda in schools. At 14 or 15, young people look forward to driving lessons and learning to drive, and it should be part of the curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/4">My other worry concerns intensive driving courses&mdash;in which someone can supposedly learn to drive in a fortnight, three weeks or even days in some cases&mdash;especially at an age when the individual's maturity must be questioned. Intensive courses can be very dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/5">Although I have not read it completely, it is interesting to note from the Government's response that although the number of accidents and serious injuries has fallen, the number of deaths has risen since 2000. That must be of concern to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/6">I do not wish to throw a hospital pass at parents, because we as a society are quick enough to blame them, but there is a parental responsibility involved in driving. When people under 18&mdash;or 20, or 21&mdash;apply for a driving licence, perhaps we should consider showing the parents themselves what can happen to young people in road accidents. It was wondered earlier whether we would have had the kind of cars that are on the road today, and I often wonder how young people of 17 and 18 can afford to drive some of those cars&mdash;we heard about engine sizes&mdash;with such significant power under their foot. I wonder also whether parents should think twice about what type of car they buy for their children. An educational programme on that would be worthwhile.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/7">The tragedy that hits a constituency after such an accident&mdash;I know that it has happened in probably every constituency in the country at one time or another&mdash;cannot be underestimated. The effect of losing four lives, as we did in my constituency, is unbelievable, but still we see young people speeding in the streets. Having seen the press coverage at the time, we still see speeding vehicles driven by young people. It worries me, and that is why I think that education before young people learn to drive is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/8">The other thing with which we are struggling in my area is the implementation of speeding fines. We do not have enough hand-held speed cameras to catch young people and others who speed or drive erratically in our streets. I am sure that we have all seen it in main streets, not just bystreets or side streets. It is very dangerous, not just for drivers but for passers-by and passengers.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/9">I thank you, Sir Nicholas, for the opportunity to express the feelings of Blaenau Gwent today. It is a subject that we need to discuss thoroughly. Some issues have come out of the Select Committee that we might discuss seriously, one of which is an age limit of 18. Initially, I supported it fully, but then I had phone calls from young people saying, &quot;How will I get to work?&quot; or &quot;How will I get to college?&quot; It is not as easy as saying, &quot;Put the age up to 18;&quot; there are lots of other issues to be discussed, but I urge the Government, as have other hon. Members here today, to take preventive and not remedial action.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you presiding this afternoon, Sir Nicholas.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> on securing the debate on a very important issue, which is of concern in all our constituencies. I especially commend his setting of the tone for this serious debate about how to cut deaths and injuries among young drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/3">We are making encouraging progress, with a 33 per cent. reduction in reported incidents of people being killed or suffering serious injuries, against the 1994-98 baseline that we set ourselves, but we must do much more. There were 3,173 road fatalities in 2006 and more than 28,000 serious injuries, including 8,500 to 17 to 25-year-olds. The debate is about young driver accidents. There were 1,065 fatalities in crashes involving a driver aged 17 to 25, including 393 of those drivers themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/4">Against that bleak background, let me say something first in defence of the majority of young drivers. I am pleased that my hon. Friend made similar points. Those drivers want to be safe and responsible. They deserve good training. Unlike a minority of young men, they do not speed and drive dangerously, or drink and drive. They and their passengers wear seat belts. A minority disregard the basic road traffic laws that would, if they were observed, make our roads much safer. They would probably treat any new laws in the same way. It must remain a priority to enforce existing laws against those irresponsible people.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/5">We must consider whether driver training and testing meets the needs of the responsible majority. In February, the Department for Transport promised fundamental reform. The debate allows me to explain why. We aim to start consultation on our proposals before the end of the year. The driving test was introduced in 1935. Roads and traffic have changed out of all recognition in 70 years. The test has also changed over time and it is still recognised as one of the best, but we cannot go on with incremental fixes. The time has come for a new system for the years ahead. In 1935, only a minority had the opportunity to drive. The test was conceived to ensure that those who had access to a vehicle knew how to operate it. Driving has become very important to most of us, especially young people, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1804" name="Robert Goodwill">the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill)</phrase> described. It gives access to the social and economic opportunities of independent adulthood. A modern driver training and testing system is thus more vital. It must deliver safe life-long drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/6">We must ask how the present system measures up. Let us start by asking whether learners value it. Our conclusion is that they do not. Young people in particular say that they learn to pass the test and then teach themselves what they see as proper driving. The pass rate is low. It could be much better if learners generally waited perhaps only a few weeks. Too many learners waste money on tests when they are unready, because they think that the result is a matter of luck. Learning to drive is not cheap. Many spend more than &pound;1,000 on lessons, and some spend &pound;150 on tests. Training still focuses on vehicle handling, but we know that attitude and motivation are also very important, if not key factors in good driving, and that learners are insufficiently prepared to make safe use of road space shared with others, many of whom are vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/7">I do not blame driving instructors. My father was one for many years. Their customers are driven by perceptions of the test. They want to know only how to get through quickly. Learners are ill-informed about the test standard, and learning is poorly structured. Some have little or no exposure to typical conditions such as night driving. Most of those who fail have thought themselves ready, and they put their failure down to bad luck and nerves. Eco-driving is not integrated into the learning process. That cannot be tackled with a quick fix: it calls for a wholesale change of driving and training style. Extra lessons do not seem to make things better. Research suggests that learners overall are taking more lessons, but the pass rate and accident record are not improving. Some candidates are nowhere near the standard. Driving examiners often have to grab the handbrake or steering wheel, or use the dual controls.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/8">Many trainees pass without achieving a consistent standard. We asked a group to take the test twice in the same week and of those who passed only 64 per cent. passed on both occasions. Hon. Members may ask themselves if they would still pass the test if they took it today. The truth is that too many learners who passed last week would not pass either. Women find the test more difficult but have fewer accidents as novices&mdash;more evidence of female superiority, if any were needed. Training and testing should achieve a consistent result across all groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/9">I do not overlook the main point made today&mdash;that those most recently trained and tested have the worst accident record. Young drivers are over-represented in the casualty figures. They make more expensive claims, so they face very high motor insurance costs. There have been calls for restrictions on novice drivers. Many believe that those who pass the practical test are not ready to drive solo. That surely reflects on their training. How can we expect young people to understand the risks that come with bad driving if it is not a formal part of what they have to learn to be a driver?</p>
	<p pid="a.296.1/10">Finally, coming back to whether people value the present training and testing process, too many people opt out of the licensing system altogether. They are the most dangerous drivers. It would be a mistake to try to fix one or two of all those problems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.298.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="298"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0008.htm#07101747000548">
	<p pid="a.298.3/1">I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. The last thing that we want to do is to create any kind of climate where disregard of public safety of the sort that he described is encouraged in any way, shape or form. We need to ensure that such behaviour is tackled as effectively as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/2">The tools are already available to create a new approach. At the heart of our reform is a new framework setting out the skills, knowledge, understanding and attitudes required for safe driving. That will be the foundation for all our work on education, training, testing and lifelong learning, including developing skills, remedial training, and work-related driving. It is a modern template, consistent with vocational frameworks in the education system and in industry. Systematic assessment criteria will be used to establish that candidates have the required level of competence. A similar framework will be developed for instructors and examiners, linked to schemes for continuous professional development&mdash;a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/3">Our overall aim is simple. Anybody who prepares properly should expect to pass the test; and those who skimp or treat the test as a matter of luck will fail. Too many young people opt out of driver training and testing. We will aim to persuade them, but we will not tolerate the dangerously bad driving of the minority. We do not propose new restrictions on learners and newly qualified drivers, but we intend to have a wide-ranging and open consultation. I undertake that it will be fully addressed, even though it may not form part of our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/4">I turn to some of the points raised during <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1739" name="Christopher Fraser">the debate. The hon. Member for South-West Norfolk (Mr. Fraser)</phrase> raised an interesting and challenging point about penalties. I regret to report that I am unaware of any work being done on the matter. However, he made the point effectively; I am certainly happy to raise the matter with the Ministry of Justice, and I shall keep him posted.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> asked about enforcement and mentioned the DVLA. As I said earlier, those who avoid paying tax and/or insurance are among the most dangerous drivers. The DVLA now has more new technology and a partnership with National Car Parks, and something like 1,500 vehicles a week are being impounded. New electronic equipment is being rolled out: all Welsh and Scottish police forces have it, and 12 English forces have it, and the aim is to complete the process by the end of 2008. In 2009, we will be introducing continuous insurance. That will ensure that vehicles can be tracked. Much as with TV licences, when the authorities know where people live and whether they have a licence, it will soon be known whether they have a car and whether they have insured it. In due course, that will help considerably.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/6">I echo your comment, Sir Nicholas, that it is good to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">the hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> in his place today. He, too, contributed to this important debate, but I have not been briefed on the details of the main issue that he raised. However, I will contact his office and look into the matter in detail. The hon. Gentleman spoke about motorcycles and particularly about motorcycle safety. When I had responsibility for the fire service two years ago I visited Cheshire, where I saw a special initiative called Fire Bike. As many as 70 motorcyclists each year were being killed on Cheshire's roads. It is a wonderful county, with lovely lanes and so on. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, but I have not visited the lovely Isle of Wight. However, I know that it has the reputation of offering similar enjoyment to those motorcyclists who enjoy riding on rural roads. However, some motorcyclists may not be used to such roads. The police in Cheshire were trying to tackle the inordinate number of people being killed on motorcycles in that county, but I will look into the matter. I assure him that I have had several meetings in the past fortnight with motorcycle organisations and I have discussed motorcycle safety and other issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1804" name="Robert Goodwill">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr. Goodwill)</phrase> made a challenging point about what price we were prepared to pay when trading freedom against additional restrictions. Our consultation, which will be published shortly, will provide the opportunity for organisations and individuals to comment, and the balance of that argument will obviously colour our judgment as to what we should do.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/8">The hon. Gentleman also asked about enforcement and police numbers. I entirely agree with him that the prospect of being caught is one of the most effective deterrents. We are working closely with the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers to ensure that traffic policing and enforcement is maintained. We are looking at how the issue is reflected in police targets in order to ensure that it receives the appropriate attention. Recent drink-drive campaigns have increased the number of drivers being tested. Again, that demonstrates that we are moving in the right direction. I am also informed that more speed awareness courses are being rolled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/9">I was asked about the MOT consultation. That is still being discussed between Departments, and I shall alert Members as to when that is likely come about. However, I hear exactly the point that was made; it was made also by a number of organisations when I was at the Department of Trade and Industry, and as Minister with responsibility for better regulation I chaired a challenge panel every quarter to deal with exactly the same concerns, particularly about a move to less frequent MOTs such as on the continent. However, the issue is still very live.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/10">Driving is a skill that people use for most of their lives. It is vital that we prepare new drivers properly. It is a huge challenge. There is no quick fix. Change will take time to complete, and there must be full consultation. The debate has been a valuable opportunity and I look forward to further discussions&mdash;especially with drivers and with the public at large&mdash;as we thrash out our proposals in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.3/11">I conclude by again congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway on securing the debate and by thanking those hon. Members who have participated in it. The subject matter of the debate is very important, and we all agree that too many people still die or are seriously injured on our roads, so I hope that the debate will help in the efforts to reduce those numbers. I assure hon. Members that I shall use my own very best efforts to work with them for further progress in the months ahead. Government, Opposition parties, road safety campaigners and other external bodies such as the emergency services and enforcement organisations all want to achieve the same objective. I hope that, together, we shall continue to drive casualty figures down.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.301.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1921" speakername="Lyn Brown" colnum="301"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0008.htm#07101747000550">
	<p pid="a.301.1/1">I shall take this opportunity to talk about the unfairness in the benefits system, which ensures that many of my constituents are unable to work or keep a roof over their heads. Until the system is changed, key Government aims and objectives&mdash;in particular, our determination to eradicate child poverty by 2020&mdash;cannot and will not be realised in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/2">I bring to this Chamber the problem as expressed to me by local people and charitable agencies. I know that I may be criticised at the end of the debate for not offering many solutions, but my purpose is to try to persuade the Department for Work and Pensions and, indeed, the House, that the situation urgently needs a solution. I shall highlight the problems faced by my constituents in particular and more widely by those on low incomes across London who wish to work and to advance in life, but who are frustrated by the combination of high housing and child care costs, and by the way in which the benefits system plays with their incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/3">We must seek a solution to the disincentive that confronts 1.7 million low-paid families, who lose 60 per cent. or more of any increase in their wage packet because of the benefit configuration. If we as a Government are to hit our target to end child poverty by 2020, we must tackle poverty in London&mdash;not the London of the champagne Charlies, but the London of real economic hardship and deprivation, in which many people, such as the unemployed and those on low incomes, struggle to survive. Some 41 per cent. of London's children grow up in poverty. Excluding pensioner households, half of income-deprived households have someone in employment servicing and enabling London's economic success and thus the country's economic success. However, that work does not lift them out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/4">Housing benefits impact on the Exchequer&mdash;I have no doubt about that. Combined with council tax benefit, housing benefit is almost equal to all the other means-tested benefits added together. It is clear that we must get housing benefit right, and not spend it in a way that is counter-productive to the Government's wider objectives. Almost 30,000 families in the London borough of Newham are on the housing waiting list. The wait for a three-bedroom property is nearly 12 years, and for a four-bedroom property it is almost 13 years. While those families languish&mdash;there is no other word for it&mdash;in temporary accommodation, housing benefit spending in my council is &pound;245 million. That is just a single London borough. Nearly one third of that &pound;245 million&mdash;&pound;67 million&mdash;is spent paying private landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/5">The rents average &pound;300 per week, or &pound;1,200 per month. That rent does not secure a pleasant house, such as those on some of the television makeover shows that create properties for the buy-to-let market, but a flat situated over a shop or takeaway outlet. The average amount of housing benefit paid to council tenants in Newham is &pound;70 a week. The average payment for housing benefit in temporary accommodation is &pound;350 a week&mdash;five times the housing benefit paid to council tenants. That figure illustrates a disparity in rent and employment levels. The cost of housing has created a divide between those able to work and those for whom there is little incentive to do so, or even a negative incentive. The failure to provide enough affordable housing has created a boom in the buy-to-let sector. Temporary tenancies are often on short-term leases and tenants face the prospect of regularly having to move. The Minister will agree that that is very distressing and unsettling for families, particularly for young children who either have to change school or face long journey times to school every time that they move house during the 12 year wait for local authority housing. That is extraordinarily disruptive.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/6">That would all be bad enough, but the problems caused by a lack of public sector housing are compounded by the impact of the benefits system. I am bombarded with evidence from constituents about housing benefit and the way in which it combines with other sources of income, benefits and tax to create a poverty trap for those in low-paid work. I have constituents who asked their employers to retract their wage increases because they were worse off after the increase. Others work part-time, but want to increase their hours to full-time, make progress at work, have a career and access housing associations' joint-housing purchase schemes, but they simply cannot afford the additional rent that they would have to find for private, rented accommodation because, by dint of the additional wages that they would receive for additional hours worked, their housing benefit would be reduced. They are simply unable to take that first step, so they cannot find their way out of the poverty trap.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/7">At the centre of the problem is the 65p in the pound withdrawal rate of housing benefit as income increases. John Hills, who is a professor of social policy at the London School of Economics and director of the Centre for Analysis of Social Exclusion, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Housing Benefit is a major contributor to the &quot;poverty trap&quot;, where people's net incomes rise by only a very small proportion of any rise in gross earnings. The higher the rent paid, the wider this zone. As a result, although the level of someone's rent has no effect on their net gain from working at all, it can make a large difference to their net gain from extra earnings. For example, a couple with two children paying a typical private rent of &pound;120 per week would gain only &pound;23 if their earnings rose from &pound;100 to &pound;400 per week (as a result of reduced benefits and tax credits and higher tax and national insurance).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/9">I shall come to my own example in a minute, but my community would kill for such a rent level. Let us take Professor Hills' example, which represents an effective marginal tax rate of 94 per cent. on the poorest in society. The Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills has expressed concern about the lower level of job retention for those returning to work. Despite recent falls in the likelihood of their leaving work, lone parents are still almost twice as likely to leave their job as non-lone parents. Fewer than one in five lone parents who leave income support return within six months; over one quarter return within a year, one third, within two years and almost two fifths, within three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/10">Lisa Marker's report on child poverty, published at the end of last year, projected figures that showed that if the rate of job exits among lone parents was reduced to the level of those among non-lone parents, the Government's 70 per cent. employment target could be met without any increase in the number of lone parents entering work. That is a remarkable finding, but before we put think about putting further pressure on lone parents, it is important that we recognise that that evidence implicates the state in what has happened, as it has created an imbalance in work incentives, and we must do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/11">I asked the excellent social regeneration unit at Newham council to analyse an example for me, so that I could present the Minister with the impact of the problem on my community. The unit used the example of a lone parent paying an average private rent&mdash;not the top figure&mdash;with two small children. If that parent had a job paying the minimum wage, she would earn &pound;10,075 a year, which in London, with our high costs of living, is nothing short of a pittance. After the loss of benefits she would be just &pound;50 a week better off than she was on income support. I suppose we can call that an incentive to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/12">Let us take the analogy a little further. Let us assume that she is a bright and motivated young woman&mdash;why not?&mdash;and applies for another job, which she gets, along with a pay increase of &pound;5,800 a year before tax and benefits, so that she is on &pound;15,000 a year in London. Again, it is not a high wage, but what does she get at the end of the day? She is &pound;7.78 a week better off than she was with her &pound;10,000-a-year job. Can we honestly imagine how disheartening that would be? A new job, promotion and an additional &pound;5,800 a year, but no new clothes to help with the new job, no additional socialising with colleagues, no holiday with the children and no impact at all upon their lives. If we are to incentivise lone parents to return to work, we must analyse the benefits system. The 65p in the pound housing benefit tax rate is at the core of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/13">To develop the story, I shall discuss tax credits so that we can begin to understand why almost two fifths of lone parents who leave income support return within three years. I realise that responsibility for tax credits rests ultimately with the Treasury, but in these days of joined-up government I am justified in briefly mentioning the way in which the system disincentivises the work force. My hon. Friend the Minister will know that any increase in earnings one year will have a knock-on effect on tax credits the following year. In some ways, the system is excellent: it cuts overpayment and gives the person returning to work a buffer, as they receive additional money for the remainder of the financial year. The lone parent receives a promotion and additional income, she comes off income support and climbs beyond housing benefit and council tax benefit, so she loses fewer benefits. She is out of the poverty trap, and she feels great. However, the increases are due to the frozen tax credit. Next year, a new calculation will be made, her tax credits go down by what can be very significant amounts, the family struggles and work is no longer incentivised.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/14">To give an example of the system's impact, before I entered the House, as part of my job I organised focus groups with residents in a London borough to discuss local service provision. I was staggered to discover that at least four fifths of the women whom I interviewed had recently returned to work only to leave because they could not afford to stay on. The realities of work&mdash;how little additional income the returnee would receive, given the additional expenditure that work requires and the journey times between work and school&mdash;had not been properly costed or considered by their back-to-work adviser. As a result, those women left employment with significant debt in some cases, because they were struggling to carry on. They were totally demoralised and fearful of trying to work again. They were not bad, feckless or lazy women, nor had they taken unaffordable foreign holidays or bought wardrobes of new clothes for their new jobs. They were women who wanted to be parents in hard-working families. They knew that there would be a positive impact on their children if they returned to work, they wanted to have pride in themselves and they were aspirational, but they were let down by the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/15">Surely to goodness we can see that that situation will not provide us with what we desire&mdash;a fair and equal society in which we offer</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/16" class="indent">&quot;the best of chances for all families&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/17">in which all children have the best of chances when growing up; and in which</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/18" class="indent">&quot;all families who work hard can build a better life for themselves&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/19">We must look at the tax system again. We must consider making regional variations in tax relief for those on low income; raise the taxable allowance at the bottom end of the income scale; and raise child benefit radically, and make it taxable at the top end. I accept that those measures go far beyond the scope of the debate, but I seek an undertaking from the Minister that we will investigate the impact of tapering housing benefit at a slower rate, even if only in certain regions and until house building in London and the south-east has begun in earnest.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/20">I am not alone in making that call. The Harker report recommends a proposal to reduce the 65 per cent. withdrawal rate, as does the London Child Poverty Commission. Housing benefit is at the bottom of the food chain, and it is calculated on net income, so making it more generous does not have knock-on effects elsewhere, unlike tax credits. Overhanging all those arguments is the desperate need for affordable housing on a huge scale in London. It is the only solution that begins to depress housing costs generally, and I heartily welcome the Government's renewed commitment to the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/21">The Government have been considering the problems that I have outlined for some time. Pilots in communities, including my own, are testing different models of intervention, but they are all short-term and time-limited, and families may be significantly worse off once they have concluded or the grace period has expired. A young woman with three children came to my surgery last week. She went back to work on one such pilot, which finished, but the organisers did not tell her. She is in debt by &pound;17,000, which she owes in backdated rent. She believed that her rent was being paid by the pilot which, however, was time-limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/22">In truth, the pilots tell us what we already know. If we make it easier for families to afford a roof over their head, and if they can access affordable rents, they work. If families can afford to work, they want to do so. If they are allowed to aspire to a better standard of living, they tend to grab the opportunity. When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">my right hon. Friend the Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase> was Secretary of State for Work and Pensions he admirably expressed aspiration that</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/23" class="indent">&quot;every generation deserves the opportunity and support to raise and fulfil their aspirations; every individual the support to lift themselves and their families free from poverty and dependency.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/24">I agree. What then are we going to do about housing benefit?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-17a.310.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="310"  time="016:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071017/halltext/71017h0010.htm#07101747000554">
	<p pid="a.310.1/1">To continue seamlessly, I made the point that many young people contacted me about their bus service. I shall give another quote. It links with what I was saying about the right way to do such things. One young person from a village in my patch stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/2" class="indent">&quot;I rely almost entirely on public transport as the cost of owning and driving a car is collosul&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/3">a misspelling, but one cannot have everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/4" class="indent">&quot;But First Buses Bristol seem to do nothing but raise prices and rip people off, it currently costs me...over &pound;5 return to the centre of Bristol&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/5">The interesting phrase in the message is</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/6" class="indent">&quot;considering they have the monopoly on the local bus services, shouldn't there be some regulation on their prices?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/7">Later on, there was a reference to extortion.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/8">That is the point that I was trying to develop when the bells rang. There are several different models for running a public service. One is complete competition, which operated for a period after deregulation in the mid-1980s. I remember that in Oxford, where I was a student at the time, the bus companies were fighting each other. A bus would pull up literally a minute before the time the bus from the rival company was expected, take all the passengers and bomb off down the road. One could barely move for buses. That all ended. The fittest survived, and eventually the situation degenerated into a monopoly.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/9">A competitive model does not work for bus services, especially in market towns and villages. The situation may be different for urban services, but when we are talking about rural routes, infrequent routes and, often, not huge passenger numbers, the idea that two companies will run side by side&mdash;that there is the volume for that&mdash;and that there is always an entrant waiting to chip away at and threaten the incumbent is just nonsense. FirstGroup has huge resources&mdash;it could see anybody off. To all intents and purposes, it is a monopoly provider. Yes, the council occasionally lets out a franchise for evening and weekend services, and FirstGroup gets some of them as well. There are other small operators in the area, but FirstGroup overwhelmingly dominates.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/10">So we have a private monopoly. When I ask the managing director why he does not lower the fares, his response is that at peak hours the buses are full, so if he lowered fares, he would lose money. The rest of the time, the additional passengers that he would get from lowering the fares would not make up the money that he would lose from lowering them, so it is not worth his while. The answer is always, &quot;We are not a charity, we are a business. We run to maximise our profits.&quot; He tells me that the rate of return for the bus business is not as great as it is for some of the other bits of FirstGroup's business, so he is not interested in lowering fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/11">The managing director's tone has mellowed a little since I first spoke to him, but, in essence, his attitude is, &quot;You want a public service, you pay for it.&quot; Britain is unusual, in that 90 per cent. of the revenue for bus services comes from bus passengers. Some 10 per cent. is from subsidies of various sorts from central and local government, but the vast bulk of the cost is met by passengers. Belgium, where the figure is 30 per cent., has taken the view that public transport is a public service&mdash;I agree with that&mdash;and that therefore more Exchequer input is probably the only way to deliver it.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/12">Of course, things can be done. Quality bus partnerships, bus lanes and real time information are all good things and can help, and I do not wish to decry the efforts that have gone in to making improvements. But, when it comes down to it, when my constituents contact me about the cost and reliability of buses and the routes run by the companies, I tell them that the bus company will not make changes because it will not make any money, and the council will not subsidise services because it does not have any money. Tough, get lost, go away&mdash;there is nothing that can be done because we are at the hands of a monopolist.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/13">Bizarrely, the Select Committee on Transport looked into the Government's draft Local Transport Bill, and said that when there is more than one operator and they want to co-operate&mdash;for example, one might want to cover one area and the other might want to cover another area, with through ticketing&mdash;competition law may crack down on that and deem that they would be acting collusively, which would undermine competition. Competition is the wrong model, and we must make it clear that local transport providers should be able to co-operate and work together in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/14">I could go on at length and give a large number of quotes from young people&mdash;for example, &quot;The fares have gradually gone up and up, but the service has not improved&quot;; &quot;I would use the buses as it saves me attempting to park the car, but I can't afford to&quot;; The bus goes once an hour and costs &pound;4 return.&quot; People talk about the proportion of their income spent on fares&mdash;for example, &quot;I am spending a quarter of my wages on buses.&quot; I am talking about young people, perhaps with Saturday jobs, and recent graduates with relatively low incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.1/15">The subject deserves much more time than we can give it this afternoon. I want to convey young people's frustration, and the fact that because of the way in which the system is structured it is a private monopoly about which we can do very little. The Government are considering some sort of re-regulation, but my worry is that it will not go far enough. A bit more regulation will not make FirstGroup provide a quality public service. It is a private business, and if we want a quality public service, we, the public, will probably have to pay for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> on securing this debate about a matter that is obviously vital to his constituents and the public everywhere. I wonder whether this is the first stage of his leadership bid. If it is, I am honoured to be in at the start of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/2">It is right to say that buses play a key role in our transport system. Two thirds of all journeys on public transport are made by bus, well over 4 billion journeys are made in England every year, and not far off 5 billion are made throughout Great Britain. During the past 50 years, bus usage has steadily declined, but in recent years patronage has stabilised and is now steadily increasing. The problem is that that does not apply in all areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to young people's reaction in his area. He is right in saying that too many of them give up using buses the moment they pass their driving test. I was talking to some young people in my constituency who said exactly the same, and our big challenge is to change that culture. We want young people to recognise the advantages of bus travel. Despite all the temptations for getting behind the wheel, we must try to change that behaviour and ensure that their peers do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/4">In Newcastle, I met the Bus Buddies, who are a campaigning group of young people, and the hon. Gentleman might like to inform his constituents of their work. They have tried to give a voice to the region's young people on bus issues. They have developed links with local bus operators, the Government office for the north-east, and local authorities in their area. I notice from today's cuttings that the bus company Stagecoach is launching a VIP ticket for young people to encourage them on to the buses in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/5">Some authorities offer discount or free travel to young people, and we have tried to find out through local transport plans what can be done to encourage more young people to use buses. By 2010, the travelling to school project will have spent around &pound;140 million on finding out what we can do to get more young people to walk or cycle to school, and to use public transport.</p>
