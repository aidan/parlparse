<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.71.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0001.htm#07121273000499">
	<p pid="b.71.2/1">I am pleased that this important debate is taking place today. It is about the manufacture of cars, vans, trucks and components in the United Kingdom. There is great interest in the number of jobs in that sector. I am glad to see the Minister in his place. I hope that he will give detailed responses to some of the questions posed this morning, and if he cannot answer today I hope that he will write. It is important to record how important that sector is.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/2">Britain is the sixth-largest manufacturing economy in the world. We now make almost twice as many cars in Britain as we did 25 years ago. Seven of the top vehicle makers are based in the UK, and 19 of the top 20 auto-part makers have a manufacturing presence in the UK. In my constituency of Chorley, we have a huge parts centre and the Leyland Trucks factory. In the north-west&mdash;just down the road from your constituency, Mr. Benton&mdash;we have Jaguar and Vauxhall. The motor industry has a major presence in the north-west, as it has in my colleagues' constituencies in the east and west midlands.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/3">Many people are bothered about the car industry and the components sector. Many companies have a presence in the area, and they are taking a lot of interest in it, and it is from that angle that we have to consider the matter. More than 75 per cent. of cars made in the UK are exported. Independent surveys show that the UK car plants are among the most productive in Europe. I stress that they are the most productive.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/4">Having painted such a picture&mdash;a good picture and a good story to be told, at least to begin with&mdash;why is there so much uncertainty and concern within our car manufacturing sector? What can we do about it? There is no doubt that globalisation presents massive challenges for the manufacturing industry. India and China have wages at about 15 per cent. of European levels, and they are expected to account for nearly half of global growth over the next 15 years, so it is a serious problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/5">In a speech on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-23">23 October</phrase>, the Minister stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/6" class="indent">&quot;We cannot hold back global development, and protectionism certainly is not the answer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/7">I accept that that is what the Minister said. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The companies best placed to prosper in the knowledge economy are those that invest the most in R and D, that are most alive to the commercial opportunities of the ideas they generate; that most successfully bring their ideas to market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/9">Absolutely. Great R and D is fantastic, but we should not forget that we need a manufacturing base to go with it. It is no use having the best ideas if we export the jobs. Yes, we must invest heavily in R and D. I fully agree with that statement, but the question has to be asked: what is being done to promote R and D and support, through financial incentives? I understand that R and D in the UK car manufacturing sector is so important. The Minister also said that</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/10" class="indent">&quot;protectionism is not the answer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.71.2/11">I do not believe that old fashioned protectionism is the answer, but greater protection for UK employees is. We still lag behind our European counterparts in employment rights. That is the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.0/1">Although protectionism may not be the answer, is it not extraordinary that the Government, unlike those of the other major car producing countries, seem to prefer foreign vehicles to British vehicles? Would it not be a good start if Ministers were to be driven in British cars?</p>

	<p pid="b.72.1/1">I cannot disagree with my right hon. Friend. He is spot on. In fact, I shall come to that very point later in a little more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/2">The UK has some of the most profitable car plants in Europe, none more so than Vauxhall. However, when costs had to be cut, the company turned to UK plants and UK workers, because it was the easiest and cheapest place to sack people. That is always a problem. There are many more examples of shifts in production, such as at Ford and Peugeot. People are talking about new cars with great British brand names, such as the small Rolls-Royce and the SUV Mini, being built abroad. Aston Martin's new four-seater saloon car, is to be built abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.1/3">Ford made many promises when it closed its last own-badge car plant at Dagenham. I was a member of the Trade and Industry Committee that took evidence from Ford. It said that we should not worry and that although they might not have Ford badges, the company still owned Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin. Those are great brand names and Ford said that it would continue to manufacture them in the UK. Aston Martin is already under foreign ownership and Jaguar and Land Rover are up for sale. That is the difference; they are in foreign hands. Ford will not have a car assembly plant in the UK if it sells to Tata, yet Ford sells more cars in the UK than anywhere else in Europe. The company does very well out of the UK.</p>

Friend is painting a depressing picture. In the north-east, Nissan has been a great success, having produced the Micra, Almera and Primera, and is making about a third of a million cars a year. It has been a success, despite the supposed climate that he paints. There have been success stories, so I do not think that the situation is as depressing as he has articulated so far.</p>

	<p pid="b.76.3/1">I am coming on to that very point. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1906" name="John Spellar">My right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar)</phrase> has already made it, and I am building up to it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> is absolutely right, and we must mention it.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.3/2">When Lord Jones of Birmingham took office, he appeared before our Select Committee, which in those days dealt with a Department that was called quite rightly, the Department for Trade and Industry, rather than the nonsensical name that it now has. I asked him why his Government car was not built in the UK, because he was meant to represent British business. He waffled, gulped and tried to believe that it was built in the UK, but he had to admit that it was not. Well, I am pleased to inform Members that Lord Jones now has a Jaguar and leads by example. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear!&quot;] The Toyota Prius has been dumped and he is now in a diesel Jaguar, which is flying the flag for UK car production. There is nothing wrong in that, and he has set the example. It is so important that we persuade other Ministers to back British industry. Lord Jones did not take the Labour party card, but at least we have the Jaguar, so I suppose we have made some progress. We will work on the other aspect later.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.3/3">Why cannot all Government cars be built in the UK? The Government are the standard bearer for UK industry&mdash;the standard bearer for our car manufacturing sector. If UK car manufacturing cannot rely on its Government, who can it rely on for support? That is the key question. On the Prius, what is so special about a car that is built in Japan and transported all the way around the world on a cargo ship&mdash;the most pollutive vehicle in the world&mdash;to deliver it to this country? It does not have any British car components, and at the end of its life, it costs more to scrap the Prius than it does to scrap a car built in the UK. Why are the Government playing at gestures? It is purely a gesture to say, &quot;I am going round in a hybrid car.&quot; It is not good enough, because if the Government had something about themselves and they really wanted to ride around in hybrid cars, they would ask, &quot;Why are they not built in Derby? Why are they not built in the midlands?&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.78.2/1">Thank you for calling me, Mr. Benton. I shall try to be as brief as I can.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on a typically spirited defence of the motor industry and exposition of the key issues. He is right to draw attention to the major challenges that face the industry in the UK, and his point was well made about the importance of getting our employment laws in line so that workers in the motor industry can be effectively protected. He is right also to point out the key issue of procurement not only by the Government directly, but by all sorts of agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.2/3">Coming from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1518" name="Jim Cunningham">the midlands, I am, like my hon. Friends the Members for Coventry, South (Mr. Cunningham)</phrase> and for Birmingham, Erdington (Mr. Simon), very concerned about the future of Jaguar and Land Rover, as no doubt <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> is too. None of us pretends that there are no hard decisions to make&mdash;of course there are. We all want to ensure that the company is successful. So far, Ford has stressed that it envisages its roles including not only ensuring a good and profitable presence in the UK, but accepting its responsibilities as a corporate citizen in the midlands and in the north-west. I hope that that is true. We certainly wish to hold them to it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" speakername="Richard Burden" colnum="79"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0002.htm#07121273000532">
	<p pid="b.79.1/1">That is certainly one option, that is true. If the hon. Lady will forgive me, I do not want to go into the specifics of that. The important thing is to establish the principle that Jaguar and Land Rover are strategically vital to large parts of our economy and manufacturing industry. If Ford accepts that it has responsibility as a good corporate citizen, the precise form of what happens in the future can be discussed. That principle needs to be established, and I hope that it will be.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/2">No doubt other hon. Members, as they did in interventions on my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley, will talk about many successes as well as the challenges that we face, whether in the north-east with Nissan or General Motors up in Ellesmere Port. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> will rightly say something about Mini and the success of the Oxford plant, and, coming from the west midlands, it pleases me to know that engines for the Mini are built there, not in Brazil. It is important to recognise that some 25 per cent. of Ford's global engine requirements are still sourced from the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/3">I wish to say a couple of things about the challenge of climate change and how the Government and the industry can respond to it. The Prime Minister is absolutely right that the UK must be at the forefront of driving that agenda forward. It is also right to acknowledge that the industry has achieved rapid progress in the carbon dioxide performance of new cars for some time. That is not an excuse to let up; we need to go further on that and the industry must be pushed to go further, but we need to acknowledge the progress that has been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/4">When regulations are brought in and we consider standards, targets and so on, we must recognise that the impact of that will not be even across the sector. They will have different impacts on different parts of the UK car industry. If the environmental performance of a company is considered across a range of models, as it appears to be the intention under European regulations, a company with a balanced model range from the supermini to the performance or luxury end of the market will be able to meet its CO2 targets while still producing, to put it bluntly, quite polluting cars. However, a company producing a specialist model range might produce fewer polluting cars but not hit its targets, purely because it does not have a balanced model range. There is no easy solution to that, but I ask the Minister to bear it in mind. Yes, it will be a problem for Porsche in Germany, but in the UK it will be a problem for Jaguar, Land Rover and Aston Martin&mdash;the range of companies that specialise in high-performance cars. If the European regulations go through, we must ensure that their needs are addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/5">On the same issue, we need to consider the industry's overall performance as well as that of individual models when we consider how to improve environmental performance. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' recent sustainability report carried a sobering message: that progress has been substantial in the performance of individual models, but that in the vehicle industry as a whole aggregate CO2 emissions have not changed much, because there are a lot more cars in the road, often being driven in inappropriate circumstances. We need to examine the performance of individual vehicles, but we also need to examine the impact on the industry and performance across the sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/6">Despite all the challenges, we excel in this country in niche vehicles, performance engineering and motor sport. Those industries employ a substantial number of people, but the real contribution that they can make is to securing and locking in motor manufacturing and the motor industry in a way that meets the needs of the 21st century, not those of the previous century. There is a huge potential crossover between our skills in motor sport technology and performance engineering and the environmental technologies that we need to develop. I welcome the investment that the Government have made so far; such things as the low-carbon vehicles innovation platform are welcome, but they provide fairly short-term funding. It is important that the industry is encouraged to go further and invest long-term, and Government programmes must do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/7">In looking to develop and promote those technologies, I ask the Government to please examine the future of Longbridge. This is the one time that I shall mention Longbridge in the debate. There we have a Chinese firm, which will possibly be a partnership of Chinese firms in future, producing cars. However, the production of cars there will not ultimately be the most important thing. What is important is whether they bring R and D there. China has a huge environmental challenge in its motor industry, and we could use our technologies in partnership with it here, not only to build up our industry but to promote sustainability in the automotive sector over in China. Where better to do that than the place that has been synonymous with the car industry in the 20th century and can, if we do it right, be synonymous with automotive environmental technologies in the 21st?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.80.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" speakername="Andrew Smith" colnum="80"  time="010:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0002.htm#07121273000533">
	<p pid="b.80.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on securing the debate. He is making a debate here in Westminster Hall on the motor industry a regular feature, and quite right too, given the industry's enormous importance to jobs, innovation, skills, GDP and exports.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/2">Some colleagues may have seen a huge and excellent poster as they drive past Cowley, which has a picture of the Mini, saying &quot;Made in Oxford&quot;, and then the words &quot;Sold in&quot; with the flags of more than 80 countries. That is a real tribute to the skill and commitment of all the work force at Cowley and at the Swindon and Hams Hall plants, which make up the Mini production triangle, and to all the suppliers and those who are out there selling the cars. Let us remember the big contribution made to the UK car industry by the dealership network, which is another important part of the industry and has certainly raised its game in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/3">I am pleased that my good and right hon. Friend the Minister will respond to the debate. We were pleased that he was able to join us for the formal launch of production of the Mini Clubman in Oxford in September. We were particularly glad that the Government sent a tall Minister, because it provided a practical demonstration of the excellent legroom in the new Mini Clubman. Since we last debated the automotive industry here, the Mini has continued to go from strength to strength, with not only the successful launch of the Clubman but the millionth Mini coming off the production line in April and, this year alone, 202,000 Minis sold worldwide&mdash;an increase of more than 16 per cent. on the same period last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/4">I wish to make a few points about the environmental challenges and opportunities facing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the industry, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> referred. What the public interest in the industry needs, and what we must work with the EU to ensure, is a stable and transparent framework of expectations and requirements on fuel consumption, emissions and recyclable materials, which is demanding of the industry and incentivises the right performance but also allows for the lead times and investment needed for new technologies and processes. It is important that the Government work with the industry and the trade unions so that there is a joint approach on those crucial issues. I look to the Minister to assure us that they are doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/5">In the industry, there is both recognition of the need to improve environmental performance and cut its carbon footprint and the will to do so, building on the considerable progress on emissions and fuel efficiency that has already been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/6">Certainly at Cowley, there have been significant advances. The plant has cut the energy consumption for each Mini made by 20 per cent. in the past five years. Water consumption is down by more than 30 per cent. per unit, and waste recycling is up by 134 per cent. The company is committed to further reducing carbon dioxide emissions, energy and water consumption by 5 per cent. per vehicle per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/7">The Mini Cooper D has one of the lowest carbon emission levels of any car worldwide at 104 g of CO2 per km, thus matching the latest hybrid vehicles. I have no doubt that with a well thought out regulatory framework and continuing investment in research and development, technology and skills, further progress is not only possible but will be achieved right across the industry, so that environmental delivery comes together with the continual increases in productivity for which the industry in already renowned.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/8">I want to flag up with the Minister a separate matter that will have a bearing on other car plants, given the global nature of the industry and its ownership. It is important that current proposals about linking work permits to English language ability do not override other considerations, and particularly that they do not result in other countries feeling encouraged to put language barriers in the way of British workers being employed abroad. Within BMW&mdash;and, I am sure, other companies&mdash;there are regular transfers of personnel between not only the UK and Germany, but operations in other countries. We all know that public policy is full of the unintended consequences of well intended initiatives, and I am sure that we do not want restrictions on movement within transnational companies to be one of them. I ask my right hon. Friend the Minister to keep an eye on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/9">This debate is an opportunity for us to talk up British manufacturing and the enormous amount being achieved both by workers and companies in the car industry here. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield talked about the repatriation of engine production from Brazil to Hams Hall. That is clear evidence that there is nothing inexorable about automotive production and sourcing shifting to low wage economies. On the contrary, the more sophisticated the product, the more advanced our innovation and design, and the better the skills of our work force and supply industries, the more chance we have of retaining relative competitive strategic advantage in this country. I believe that with the right commitment to investment, R and D and skills, and with the right partnership between Government and trade unions, rising environmental expectations are not just a challenge but an opportunity that we can and must make the most of.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.82.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" speakername="Jon Cruddas" colnum="82"  time="010:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0002.htm#07121273000534">
	<p pid="b.82.0/1">I do not want to prevent <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> from getting in before the 10.30 shutdown, so I shall simply make a few comments echoing points that have already been made. I agree with every word of the previous speech, but I find it quite strange to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase>, because many years ago, before I was an MP, I was involved with him in the fight to protect Longbridge and subsequently in the battle over the Dagenham plant. It brings back to me some of the tiring discussions and fights that we had to maintain car assembly in both those plants.&mdash;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/2">I also appreciated <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the speech of my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>, who is chuntering away at the moment. He is a good friend of mine, and over the years he has consistently been at the forefront of maintaining the case for British manufacturing and the car industry. At times, the climate has been quite cold. A few years ago, before the collapse of WorldCom and Enron, our Government tended to be preoccupied with what we thought of as the new economy, at the expense of the manufacturing industry, which tended to fall off the edge in terms of debates, but the then Department of Trade and Industry later changed its thinking on that dramatically. Throughout all that, my hon. Friend has been at the forefront in maintaining the case for British manufacturing, and I applaud his work.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/3">I also applaud my hon. Friend's speech, especially some of his comments about agency workers and factors such as the downward pressures in the labour market. We in Dagenham have been at the hard end of that, because despite the protestations that people made throughout the protracted struggle to maintain car assembly in the Ford plant, which we lost, the outstanding factor was the ease with which jobs could be cut in this country because of labour market conditions. I still abide by that view, because I saw it happen at close hand.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/4">One thing that my hon. Friend missed out of his tour de force, which focused on manufacturing and the car industry across the whole country, was the role of manufacturing in London. It also seems to be omitted from debates about the capital, in which we become preoccupied with financial services, arguably at the expense of the role of manufacturing. I know that the Minister, as the MP for East Ham, has a working knowledge of the Ford Dagenham plant&mdash;indeed, some of his constituents work there&mdash;so he will not be one of those who overlook the role of manufacturing in the London economy, or the east London economy, but there is a tendency to do so in debates on future economic strategy. Today's debate gives us an opportunity to overcome that.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/5">As I have said, before I was elected I was involved in attempts to save car assembly at the Ford Dagenham plant. Unfortunately, we did not manage to do that, but, contrary to the belief that the car plant at Dagenham has closed, we did manage to diversify into engine production. Compared with the somewhat darker days between 1997 and 2000, the plant is now thriving as a result of that diversification into diesel engine manufacturing and technology. Since 2003, Ford has invested &pound;800 million in the Ford Dagenham plant, thus confirming its strategic importance as Ford's European diesel engine manufacturing centre. Today, it manufactures engines for Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo, and the latest investment will mean that output increases to more than 1 million units by 2009, and that the plant will supply more than 50 per cent. of Ford's global diesel demand. Between them, the Dagenham plant and the Ford Bridgend plant, which manufactures petrol engines for Ford, Jaguar, Land Rover and Volvo, supply about 25 per cent. of Ford's global engine requirement. In any debate on the car industry in this country, we should acknowledge that role in relation to diesel and engine technology and production.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/6">Since 1999 and 2000, when the plant ended car assembly, there has been a massive economic transformation. It has been very bumpy and difficult at times and it has taken a lot of hard work by all parties, but we now sit in a very different place from where we sat then. I should put on record the tireless work of the Mayor of London, his advisers, successive DTI Ministers and advisers, and, indeed, a couple of Prime Ministers in maintaining that investment and working strategically with the Ford Motor Company. At times, the whole plant was threatened, but there has been a major transformation in recent years that will, I hope, provide a platform for further investment and production.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/7">In total, the Ford Motor Company employs about 30,000 people in this country&mdash;approximately one third of its employees in Europe&mdash;of whom 15,500 are employees of Jaguar and Land Rover. I have a few points to make against that general backdrop about the sale of Jaguar and Land Rover and about R and D, which my hon. Friends have already discussed. There is also a question about the future of the supply chain, which has direct relevance to the Ford Dagenham plant and the future production of diesel engines. The debate about the future of Jaguar and Land Rover is not an isolated debate: the consequences will be felt throughout the British economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/8">Research and development is an important part of Ford's UK work, and accounts for up to 80 per cent. of automotive industry R and D in Britain. About 9,500 people are employed at its three main technical centres at Dunton, Gaydon and Whitley, responsible for Jaguar and Land Rover engineering development. Spending in the UK on R and D for Ford brands is around &pound;800 million annually. We need to maintain those investments. It is clear from discussions with Ford that it believes that environmental technology development provides an economic opportunity for the UK. However, the UK cost equation presents a significant challenge to investment, given the growth in technical capability in India and China. Funds are available for R and D activity and investment, but they need to be maintained and, arguably, increased to maintain our current competitive position, especially within the context of the global market, and to maintain and boost employment for UK workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/9">Secondly, I want to touch on a couple of points that my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield made about CO2 emissions legislation. Any new EU legislation on CO2 emissions needs to ensure that premium manufacturers such as Jaguar and Land Rover are protected. That point was made earlier. The legislation will impose challenging targets for the entire industry, but it is likely that vehicle manufacturer groups will be able to offset their smaller, higher volume vehicles against the lower volume, higher CO2-emitting vehicles. But if and when Jaguar Land Rover becomes a separate company, it will not be possible to offset emissions in that way, despite the fact that Jaguar Land Rover plans to reduce CO2 emissions by more than the industry's expected average reduction of 18 per cent. I would appreciate the Minister's comments on that. Do we need provision in the legislation for niche producers? It would mean that companies such as Jaguar and Land Rover, which do not produce a full range of vehicles and whose sales volumes in Europe are relatively low, would have a separate target still expected to be in excess of the average overall reduction for the industry.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.1/1">We must guarantee that any takeover or buy-out keeps not only the same power train going, but the rest of the component sector that feeds into Land Rover and Jaguar, because, unfortunately, people have to take the cost out to pay the bill for buying them. Let us hope that there will be guarantees for everybody.</p>

	<p pid="b.85.3/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" name="Jon Cruddas">the hon. Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase>. I strongly agree that our Labour Government neglected manufacturing during their first term. We did not do enough&mdash;we were relying too much on dotcom culture. I remember telling Peter Mandelson that that would blow up, and that is exactly what happened. I agree with my hon. Friend's sentiments that we should have done more in the first term.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/2">However, much more has been done for manufacturing in the second term and this one. I am happy that the Minister is here, because he takes manufacturing seriously. In all the discussions that I have had with him on different occasions and in different Departments, he has been a great champion of manufacturing. He is honest and realistic about globalisation, and I have agreed with nearly everything that he has said at different times about manufacturing and the direction that the Government are taking. I am happy that he is on stream for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/3">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">my very dear hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on initiating this debate. As other Members said, it has become an annual event, and long may it continue. It is vital that we discuss manufacturing and car production, which is an important sector. May my hon. Friend carry on applying for these debates, and may Mr. Speaker always grant them in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/4">I want to tell the House a success story. My hon. Friend focused on the depressing end, but I want to talk about the north-east and the great success of Nissan. The car production sector is important to us in the north-east. It makes up 10 per cent. of the UK's gross value added in this area of the engineering sector. I ask nothing from the Minister, but just want to put on the record a success story in the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/5">The car production sector employs 15,000 people in the north-east. The region is home to Nissan's manufacturing base, and the plant and its supply chain lie at the heart of the region's activity. There are, of course, companies other than Nissan, and in the original equipment manufacturers I would include Caterpillar, which runs a thriving plant in my constituency and enjoys a mutually productive partnership with Corus Special Sections. They share a common site at Carlin How at Skinningrove in east Cleveland. I also want to mention ElringKlinger Gaskets, a major employer in the Teesside area that employs a large number of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/6">The efforts of the car production sector are recognised by development interest in the region. Support from the regional development agency One North East, the Government office and the region's local councils has helped the sector to generate profitable growth, to provide focused business support, to promote the regional car manufacturing capability and to provide a management service that reflects the strategic importance of the sector in the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/7">A key challenge has been to encourage good practice in training for an industry that is still relatively new to the region and to encourage similar good practice in production techniques. The key driver in the sector is, of course, Nissan Motors, which has had its UK manufacturing base in Sunderland since 1986. It has been identified as the most productive car plant in Europe for the past seven years running, and here I want to thank the Government for their financial support. Millions of pounds have been allocated to Nissan, and it was appreciated. I appreciate the Government's support.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/8">With nearly one third of a million Micra, Almera and Primera models produced each year, Nissan now accounts for one in five of all cars produced in the UK. Sunderland was selected for the production of a new sports utility vehicle range, with &pound;500 million of investment creating a further 400 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/9">Nissan's plant is highly technically advanced. A total of 435 functioning robots provide for nearly 80 per cent. automation of the assembly process at the plant. About 75 per cent. of production is exported to markets in 45 countries, including the Nissan home nation of Japan. Nissan contributes some &pound;500 million to the local economy each year and has 240 suppliers in the region. Its total investment exceeds &pound;2 billion, and some 5,000 people are employed at the plant.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/10">Nissan has also been the agency for creating a large supply base in the region. Significant suppliers include Hashimoto, Magna Kansei, Calsonic Kansei, TRW Automotive and Johnson Controls. Much of the work is concentrated around Sunderland, and the city continues to build on its worldwide reputation as a centre of car manufacturing. The sector employs 12,000 people in the city alone. There is potential for further growth of the sector throughout the region through the development of local supply chains and the adoption of advanced manufacturing practices. That will help to maintain global competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/11">Hon. Members have mentioned training, support, and research and development. In commenting on one aspect of training, I commend an institution: the Institute for Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice, which is based at the university of Sunderland and which provides consultancy, training and industry-led research, including design and process solutions delivered through the computer-aided engineering centre. Its expertise covers a broad range of industrial applications with particular strengths in the car manufacturing sector. It can provide a range of valuable services to manufacturers with the added weight of its existing expertise as a leading group in niche international research. Its services can be applied equally to smaller companies of 100 or fewer employees through to major corporations. They can also be applied to individuals who are looking to upskill their engineering expertise through education and professional development.</p>
	<p pid="b.85.3/12">My time has run out, but I again congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley on securing this debate. I wanted to put on record the great success story in my constituency because it is important. I hope that the Minister will take that success forward, and I thank the Government for their support in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">my congratulations to the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>. I requested this debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June</phrase> following the announcement of the proposed sell-off of Jaguar and Land Rover. To misquote Mark Twain, the report of the car industry's death in Britain is somewhat premature, and I am fed up with the nay-sayers who say that the industry is on its knees. However, there is a bad side with 6,000 jobs lost at Land Rover at Longbridge, and 2,300 lost at Peugeot Citroen just round the corner from Solihull at Ryton. Vauxhall has had job losses at Ellesmere Port; Ford has had &pound;6 billion of losses worldwide, and is selling the classic marques of Jaguar and Land Rover to try to balance its books.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/2">The hon. Members for Chorley and for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas) bemoan the fact that it is cheaper to close a factory in the United Kingdom than in other parts of Europe, but the UK is also a more attractive place in which to set up a car factory, because of our flexible working practices.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning Honda. I totally concur with his point.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/2">Jaguar and Land Rover are being sold not because they are so-called basket cases, but because they will fetch a good price. The hon. Member for Chorley said that Ford is selling off the family silver, and that is regrettable, but I recall the earlier point that that will involve large investment in the company. That investment is necessary, although Ford has invested &pound;1 billion in new technology and fighting carbon emissions to make their vehicles more environmentally friendly and competitive.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/3">Land Rover is a success story, and well known to me as it is in my constituency. It is a unique, iconic brand, and is revered around the world for its ability to keep going on any terrain. When I was in Dallas in the autumn I visited a Land Rover dealer. In America, the Land Rover is dwarfed by some 4x4 vehicles, but there is great love and respect for the brand, which is borne out of a history that the Americans have grown up with. Global sales rose by 27 per cent. last year up to November. Land Rover, which is coming up to its 60th birthday, is enjoying its third record sales year, and 70 per cent. of those sales contribute to our export balance of payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/4">I mentioned Ford's investment in low-carbon technology, which includes the e-terrain technology concept vehicle that will have CO2 emissions of 150 g/km. Ford is making great strides in reducing carbon emissions and developing new technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/5">Interest in buying the Land Rover and Jaguar marques has been very keen. The announcement of the preferred bidder is expected soon. I acknowledge the points made by the hon. Member for Chorley about the uncertainty and worry for families, particularly in the west midlands. We can only accept the assurances that Ford have given that it is a good, corporately responsible employer and that it is looking for long-term continuity for both marques. That has been a major consideration in its evaluation of the bids. We do not know who the preferred bidder will be, but we hope that it will give similar commitments.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/6">The elephant in the room, which I have not mentioned, is ownership. Apart from classic, niche marques, such as Morgan and Bristol, the UK car manufacturing industry has no ownership worth speaking of, but that is a fact of life. We have had to come to terms with the death by a 1,000 cuts of an industry's ownership, but we are where we are, and there is more to be hopeful about in the industry's future.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/7">Another cause for optimism in car manufacturing is global warming, which seems to be posing a great threat. Foreign manufacturers flock to the UK because of our skills base and expertise, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> said. Our innovative design and technology is cutting edge. Why else would all the formula one teams have engineering resources here? We are simply the best at automotive engineering and we are putting our energies into meeting the climate change challenge. As the hon. Gentleman said, we can export that technology, as well as the vehicles that we manufacture.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/8">I want to leave hon. Members with just a couple of examples. The British-owned electric Smart car is produced by Zytek in Lichfield, and hon. Members will see the G-Wiz on the streets of London any day. For those who want the ultimate sports car, there is the Tesla Roadster. The company is American-owned, but has a British subsidiary. The car does nought to 60 in under four seconds. It also does 135 mpg and 245 miles per charge&mdash;yes, it is electric. It costs less than 1p per mile to run and it is beautiful&mdash;it is a car to drool over.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.3/9">So the future is bright&mdash;the future is electric. We have the ability to meet market and global warming challenges. Not all change is welcome, but change does give British engineers and workers the opportunity to take full advantage of their skills and to lead the world.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.0/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, but I will not give way, because time is short.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/2">Engineering should be given much higher status in this country. We should also be concerned about the loss of specialist departments. We have lost 31 physics departments and five maths departments. If we want to attract high-technology investors to this country, we will have to do more to encourage young people to study science and engineering so that companies know that they can come here and find people with the skills that they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/3">We clearly face global competition, and global companies must take difficult decisions, but I say to the hon. Member for Chorley that employment protection is not the way forward. It might force some people to stay who might have chosen to do other things, but it will also drive away the new investment that we need.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/4">Finally, as to green issues, the motor industry is leading change. It is not the laggard that it is often portrayed as. New materials are being used, such as carbon to reduce vehicle weight; brilliant design improves motor cars' aerodynamics and fuel efficiency; and we have some of the world's best engineering minds examining how to develop clean diesel, biofuels and hydrogen-powered cars. The industry sees the environmental challenges clearly, and comes up with unbelievably brilliant and sophisticated solutions. The hon. Members for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden) and for Dagenham rightly referred to the issue that faces some of our niche manufacturers in relation to carbon targets. I hope that the Minister will reassure us that he is fighting Britain's corner on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.0/5">This debate was well worth having, because it has given us all the opportunity to pay tribute to a great British success story.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.92.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" speakername="Stephen Timms" speakeroffice="The Minister for Competitiveness"  colnum="92"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0004.htm#07121273000550">
	<p pid="b.92.1/1">This has been an excellent debate, and I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on securing it. He and all the other hon. Members who have taken part have shown that passionate support for UK car manufacturing continues in the House. I welcome that; such support is one of the industry's strengths. I assure hon. Members that the Government are determined to sustain success in UK car making.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/2">My hon. Friend was right to draw attention, as other hon. Members did, to successes, which include that of Vauxhall Ellesmere Port in beating off fierce competition from elsewhere in Europe for the new Astra. That example shows what can be achieved when management, Government, regional agencies and, crucially, the work force and the trade union, work together to win new investment. I thought that my hon. Friend was a little churlish in his comments about new plant, because that was an important win for the UK against fierce international competition.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/3">The Mini is a second example of success. I very much enjoyed attending, with my right hon.&mdash;and also tall&mdash;Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> the launch of the Mini Clubman on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-11">11 September</phrase>. That is a fantastic success. We have raised with the Home Office my right hon. Friend's important point about language requirements on employees from elsewhere, and we shall continue to keep in touch with the Home Office about that. In addition to developments in relation to the Mini, there are record production levels at three other volume car makers: Honda&mdash;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> mentioned; Land Rover, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> drew attention; and Nissan, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase> effectively drew the House's attention. I thank my hon. Friend for his kind words; it is a remarkable and impressive story. All those car makers are producing excellent new products that are in high demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/4">All that I have described means that despite the terrible loss of Peugeot Ryton it looks likely that UK car output for this year will be higher than last year's. We exported more UK-made vehicles and engines last year than ever before. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1526" name="Jon Cruddas">My hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> were right to emphasise the importance, and success, of engine making in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/5">Of course there are big challenges. The global industry is intensely competitive and is undergoing enormous change. Jaguar Land Rover is very important to the UK economy, sustaining, as we have heard, more than 15,000 direct jobs, not to mention many more in the dealer network and the UK supply chain, with which Jaguar and Rover are particularly closely integrated. The business is also a significant research and development investor. It is not a business in crisis.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/6">The hon. Member for Solihull was right to talk about the record production levels at Land Rover. The combined business is profitable. I agree with the optimism of my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley about the prospects for the new Jaguar model, as well. We have therefore attached high priority to close engagement with Ford and with the sale process. There have been regular ministerial contacts with senior Ford management. Our objective is a long-term future for Jaguar Land Rover businesses in the UK. We shall do whatever we can to help to secure that, and will certainly work as closely with any new owner as we always have done with Ford, to that end.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/7">We shall also work more widely to ensure that the automotive sector in the UK can sustain its competitiveness in the face of the twin challenges of low-cost competition and the transition to low-carbon technologies, about which hon. Members have spoken. We shall continue to support investment, where we can, and to work on skills. The automotive sector in particular will benefit greatly from being an early focus of the National Skills Academy for Manufacturing, which was launched last year. We shall continue to focus on the challenges faced by the automotive supply chain, with our supply chain groups programme, which was launched in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/8">I particularly want to comment, in the few minutes I have left, on the issues raised in the debate about the environmental challenge that car making in the UK needs to address. Some important points were made. I agree with much of what my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Northfield and for Dagenham said. Professor Julia King set out the scale of the challenge in her report for the pre-Budget report. Her assessment was that delivery of our overall carbon reduction target will require a 50 per cent. reduction in new car emissions by 2030 and complete decarbonisation by 2050. The final report, for the coming Budget, will make more specific recommendations to inform our development of policy on how to respond to that large challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/9">I think that the challenge is one that the UK automotive sector can be confident about. As my hon. Friend the Member for Dagenham said, the UK is Ford's European centre for powertrain development. The company announced last year a &pound;1 billion commitment to the development of lower-carbon vehicles in the UK. In addition to that, as the hon. Member for Wealden also mentioned, we have world-leading independent design engineering, including Mira, Prodrive and Ricardo. We have a range of strengths in emerging low-carbon vehicle technologies, including world-beating work in some of our universities on, for example, battery chemistry and hydrogen storage, and the progress made by such companies as Johnson Matthey and Intelligent Energy with proton exchange membrane fuel cells, and FiFe Batteries with lithium-ion battery development. That is technology at the world's leading edge, in areas that we know will be crucial.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/10">We are determined to provide support to help with the leverage of competitive advantage from those technology strengths. In September, the Technology Strategy Board announced the launch of its innovation platform for low-carbon vehicles, with an initial commitment of &pound;30 million. I want to make a point to set against the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield about the short-term character of the platform. The board expects innovation platforms to last a minimum of five years&mdash;perhaps longer. The focus is on the business challenge in the area. We cannot guarantee future funding, but I hope that it will continue at similar levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/11">With support from Cenex, the centre of excellence for low carbon and fuel cells, Zytek is, as we have heard, converting up to 200 Smart cars for Daimler from conventional to electric power, to be trialled in the coming months. In the west midlands, the regional development agency has provided well over &pound;30 million to enhance the manufacturing and design capabilities of automotive supplier companies under the premium automotive research and development programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/12">Regulation, too, can be a strong driver of innovation, and we shall support EU-wide mandatory targets for new car CO2 emissions. We await the European Commission's forthcoming proposal about that with interest. I agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield said about that issue, and we shall work to secure a mechanism that combines ambitious but realistic targets with enough flexibility to allow for the diversity of the European automotive sector&mdash;which is reflected in the diversity of production in the UK&mdash;from volume producers across Europe, such as Volkswagen and Toyota, to more niche businesses such as Aston Martin or a potentially independent Jaguar Land Rover. I listened with interest to the experiences that the hon. Member for Wealden had with Aston Martin yesterday. It is crucial to get the judgments right, and we shall work hard to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/13">My speaking time is almost up, but I want to comment briefly on the important points about labour market regulation raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley. Our flexible labour markets in the UK, including the availability of agency workers, have been a significant factor in the successes that we have celebrated in the debate and in attracting inward investment to the UK. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley does not want to&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.96.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" speakername="Bill Olner" colnum="96"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0004.htm#07121273000552">
	<p pid="b.96.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on rail services at Nuneaton or, as I should perhaps say, on the proposed lack of such services. That is why I have asked for the debate, and why I am delighted to have secured it.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/2">The Minister will know of my anger and that of the wider community at the proposals. He will recall that I have met him twice, and his predecessor once, to protest against the plans. Following that first meeting, there was some movement: instead of nothing stopping at Nuneaton, peak services to London in the morning, and return services in the evening, would at least be planned. However, that is not good enough because there are no services in the morning peak to connect London to Nuneaton, and it denies the people of Nuneaton the ability to travel quickly to the north and back again. By &quot;the north&quot;, I mean Manchester and a place close to your heart, Mr. Benton, Liverpool. Under the plans, the good people of Nuneaton will not be able to travel to your great city on a fast inter-city train.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/3">The Minister should reflect on what Nuneaton is. It is in the centre of the country and a huge operations and logistics hub. In modern times, following the electrification of the railways, we saw the demise of the loco sheds in the town, but it remained a central railway hub between north and south, and east and west, on the west coast main line. That was recognised by the Minister for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the West Midlands, my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, in a speech to the Advantage West Midlands annual conference. He said that transport is a key&mdash;perhaps the key&mdash;enabler when it comes to sustainable growth and that it is important that the west midlands give close consideration to what investments would make the biggest impact on the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/4">Nuneaton is very much part of the west midlands. The previous debate in this Chamber was on the auto industry, which still plays a big part in the area. The Minister for the West Midlands recognised that in his speech to the Advantage West Midlands conference when he said that Government announcement of the enhancement of the freight lines that link Nuneaton to Peterborough and Southampton shows the importance of the link. However, if the link is good enough for freight travel, it is good enough for the people of Nuneaton who demand a good rail service.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/5">The Minister and the operator, Virgin Trains, have received representations from many individuals and organisations on retaining the current fast, hourly services in Nuneaton, including from the Labour-controlled Nuneaton and Bedworth council, Conservative-controlled Warwickshire county council and organisations such as the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which submitted a document to the Minister. I should like to express gratitude to a local member of the association, Diana Gidlow, who was active in raising a petition against the proposed reduction of services.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/6">The Nuneaton Train Rail Users Group&mdash;I should probably call it &quot;TRUG&quot; to make it easier to say&mdash;has also supported the campaign against the reduction in services. I express my gratitude and respect for the group's analysis of current operations, which the Minister has received. I entirely agree with the group that the loading figures that the Minister and the Department have been given are incorrect. I do not know what the local authorities will do about that but, frankly, if the new timetable goes ahead on those incorrect figures, it might well be challenged in the courts. The figures for the proposals are inaccurate.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/7">I must declare an interest. As you know, Mr. Benton, we sometimes share a train when you go back to Liverpool. I sometimes wave you goodbye when the train moves on from Nuneaton, and I would like the opportunity to continue to make such journeys. Since 1992, when I was elected, I have used the train 98 per cent. of the time to come to and go from London to do my duties as a Member of Parliament. We all know of times when we have had to go to our constituencies at a moment's notice&mdash;something urgent such as a murder, or a serious fire or flood could happen, and we must travel back. I will not be able to do that in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/8">The alternative to the current services would be to use a very inferior slow train from London, which might take me first to Crewe and so on. Such a journey would take one hour and 45 minutes, as opposed to the hour it takes at the moment. I do not decry the new services&mdash;I welcome them because they will give us a better link to Northampton and other areas such as Crewe and Stafford&mdash;but Nuneaton also requires fast trains. I could travel by train from Euston up to Coventry, which takes an hour, but the journey would have to be finished by motor car, which would not be good for our green credentials. The changes will make the Government Whips very unhappy: I will need to spend longer outside the House, off-duty, than I would spend in it, because of the long journey times.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/9">I should underline Nuneaton's uniqueness. It is on the Trent valley route for the west coast main line and, as I said, serves and fast north-south route, not only for my constituents, but for those of the Minister for Pensions Reform, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1910" name="Mike O'Brien">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, whose constituency neighbours mine. The station serves members of the wider community and locality as a quick north-south route. I must say that I did not realise how many people from around the area use Nuneaton as a hub to make journeys to London and elsewhere until this matter came up. In fact, some have moved from London and the south to come to my part of the midlands and commute quickly and safely to London.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/10">To underline that point, I shall give some figures. Nuneaton is a community of 120,700 people, and we could add 30,000 people around the area who use Nuneaton's good rail links. The latter are a major group of people who reside along and use the Trent valley section of the west coast main line. I would suggest that there are more in that group than passengers from Stafford. The neighbouring town of Rugby, which I love dearly&mdash;part of Rugby borough is in my constituency&mdash;has a population of only 90,000, yet it will have a fast hourly service to London from the Birmingham-Coventry loop.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/11">Looking at the proposed timetables, I see that Rugby will also have an hourly service from the Trent valley route&mdash;amazing. We are talking about a catchment area whose population is considerably less than that of Nuneaton and the surrounding area, which does not get any trains going south to north at all until after the peak and gets only four trains a day coming back down, which is in the morning peak. However, the town of Rugby gets a service of two trains an hour down to London. There is something out of kilter there.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/12">That said, I hope that I bring the Minister good news; it is certainly breaking news. The all-party west coast main line group had a presentation given to it yesterday called &quot;Delivering West Coast Growth&quot;. The presentation was by Chris Gibb, managing director of Virgin West Coast, and Tony Collins, chief executive of Virgin Trains. I do not quarrel with the principle of what they are trying to achieve in producing faster links from Manchester and Liverpool back down to London. I do not disagree with the view that it will be better for the environment if people travel that way sooner, rather than catch a plane. It has been proven how attractive those trains are already&mdash;they are pretty full and well used. I imagine that some flights from Manchester or Liverpool to London, if they still exist, have lost business to the train. That is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/13">I am quite happy about the proposed three-trains-an-hour service to Manchester and the two-trains-an-hour service to Liverpool. However, I have vented my anger to the Minister on many occasions about the proposed reductions and I have to say that Mr. Collins was not free of that anger either when I started questioning him closely. He said&mdash;do not take my word for it; I have asked the secretary of the group to send a letter to the Minister to verify what he said&mdash;that Virgin Trains would be quite happy to stop one of the two hourly trains to Liverpool at Nuneaton. I think that that is the breakthrough that we need, and I hope it is the breakthrough that the Minister and his officials need.</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/14">Virgin has said that it is quite prepared to do that. If it fits in with the timetable and the rest of the timetabling, I think that yesterday's meeting&mdash;and, I hope, today's debate&mdash;ensure that my constituents and all the user groups that I represent get nothing less than what they deserve, which is a fast hourly service north and south.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.99.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1990" speakername="Tom Harris" colnum="99"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0005.htm#07121273000555">
	<p pid="b.99.1/1">I understand my hon. Friend's point; let me make two points in response. First, Rugby provides two and a half times the traffic that Nuneaton does. It is a vastly busier station, which has two and a half times the footfall of Nuneaton. Secondly, I simply do not accept my hon. Friend's contention that the rail service that the people of Nuneaton will receive following the December 2008 timetable changeover will no longer be good. It will continue to be very good, with extra connectivity to other parts of the United Kingdom that is certainly not there at the moment. I will return to the situation in Nuneaton in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/2">It should be noted that, despite the drafting in of 17 additional tilting 125-mph diesel Voyager trains and the delivery of 30 additional 100-mph electric trains, much of the new timetable being planned for December 2008 focuses on the optimal use of the resources. Passenger traffic on the west coast line has continued to grow since the introduction of the revised timetables in September 2004. Overall, there has been an increase of well over 50 per cent., and in some cases the growth has been 80 per cent. By 2012, revenue is expected to have trebled to &pound;1 billion a year, compared with &pound;330 million in 2003-04.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/3">Additional business has been generated at many stations along the west coast route, including Nuneaton. However, Nuneaton is simply not a high-earning station or one where business is likely to grow significantly when compared to other locations on that line. Quite simply, the opportunities for growth are much greater elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/4">Currently, an hourly train service between Nuneaton and London is provided by Virgin Trains. Those journeys take one hour and 15 minutes. In December 2008, the London peak and business traffic, which is by far the key flow to London from Nuneaton, will be largely unaffected with a good train service being retained and accelerated to a standard journey time of 56 to 62 minutes for the 97 miles. That is a faster journey time, giving an average speed of more than 100 mph, and will be one of the fastest commuter services in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/5">The services operated are therefore expected to provide for the vast proportion of the customers between Nuneaton and London. Those fast links will apply at approximately hourly intervals in the morning peak southbound and in the evening northbound. As return travel habits tend to be more diffuse, the fast trains to Nuneaton will continue at approximately hourly intervals throughout the evening from London.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/6">New 100 mph Desiro electric trains will be serving Nuneaton hourly throughout the day as part of a new west coast semi-fast service&mdash;not a slow service&mdash;providing regular links from London via Nuneaton to a wide range of locations that have previously been inaccessible or severely restricted. Overall, there will be 16 southbound and 18 northbound through-trains to and from London. For example, Northampton, Rugby, Tamworth, Lichfield and Stoke-on-Trent will have new links from Nuneaton at regular hourly intervals. Those trains will operate hourly between Nuneaton and London, but there will also be fast connection opportunities to and from London, changing at Rugby, with a journey time of 73 minutes northbound and 70 minutes southbound.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/7">During the modernisation work, Saturday and Sunday services have indeed been disrupted throughout the west coast main line, not just at Nuneaton. That will be rectified with the new timetables and the provision of weekend services similar to those on the Monday to Friday timetables and will not be interrupted with prolonged engineering activity. I am sure that my hon. Friend will welcome that, as do I as a regular user of the Glasgow to Euston service.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/8">There has been extensive consultation over the timetables. The plans were originally contained in the west coast main line progress report, published in May 2006, and more recently in a timetable consultation exercise co-ordinated by the Department for Transport. Although it is normally the task of operators to undertake any consultation exercise, the Department led with this work to present the complete picture of key services over the whole route. The information has been shared widely with numerous stakeholders, including Members of the House of Lords, Members of Parliament, passenger transport executives, regional bodies, local authorities, Passenger Focus, rail user groups and, most importantly, passengers.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/9">The new timetables have been designed deliberately to maximise earnings and achieve the most from all available rolling stock. That is about serving stations that have the potential for passenger growth. The improvement in frequency and the range of stations, such as at Wilmslow, which will have fast trains between the north-west and London, is, among other objectives, aimed at finally reversing this trend.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/10">Those representing the Merseyside region have expressed strong support for the accelerated and more frequent links with London. They gain an average of 25 minutes on their hourly London link as a result of the changes to stopping patterns, including the transfer of Nuneaton to the new Desiro service.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.0/1">One of my claims is that the loaded figures that the Minister and his Department have on Nuneaton are wrong. If he looks at the train user group's figures, he will see that there is a vast difference. I contend that Nuneaton is still a growing area and still very much part of the enlargement of the west midlands. However, if the fast hourly trains are removed, that will slow down any growth that Nuneaton might want to get. He talks about Desiro services, but those will serve Rugby and go to London.</p>

	<p pid="b.102.1/1">I understand my hon. Friend's point. Perhaps there is a Catch-22 situation here. If more services are provided to an area that has not grown so far, will that be a spur to growth and increase patronage, or do we provide services in areas where growth has already been proven to happen? We are adopting the second approach. Perhaps I should clarify what I said earlier about the business generated by Rugby. In terms of revenue, from Virgin's own figures, Rugby produces two and a half times more income or revenue than Nuneaton.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/2">The recently published Eddington study highlighted the importance of addressing inter-urban travel and the key role that rail would play. However, this is also a matter of allocating rail resources to areas where the best contribution can be achieved. It is worth reminding ourselves of the situation at Nuneaton. The London peak traffic is largely unaffected: there are different departure times, but with such a substantial change to all services along the route, that is unavoidable. However, I am not aware of any situation where such a long lead time has been provided so that passengers can plan accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/3">In the off-peak periods, there is still a good train service. Some have dismissed it as unsuitable, but I strongly disagree. The service will be operated by quality trains with a high standard of reliability. Although it is slower than the Pendolino service, as my hon. Friend said correctly, many off-peak passengers are not so time-critical with their journeys and a direct service to and from London, and many more destinations, will still be available. I accept that in some cases a change of train will be necessary, but such flows are small in number.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/4">With the 690,000 passengers a year who use Nuneaton station, it is likely that there will still be an increase in the London traffic. Some 157,000 passengers used Virgin west coast services to or from London in 2006-07 and the overwhelming majority are expected to use the remaining Virgin Pendolino services, given their attractive timing for commuters and business users. About one third are expected to transfer to the new London Midland Desiro services. Weekend travel from Nuneaton to London is expected to grow substantially as the periods of prolonged engineering work terminate. Although Nuneaton would see a reduction in fast trains, it is far from isolated. A change in train service is not likely to impact adversely on the economy of the town or the catchment area of the station.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.1/5">I thank my hon. Friend again for the constructive, though very resilient, way that he has lobbied on this issue. If he has achieved some concession from Virgin Trains, I shall certainly welcome that and try to confirm it in writing to him in the next few days.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.2/1">May I say how grateful I am to Mr. Speaker for granting me this Adjournment debate? The fact that so many Members are here on a Wednesday afternoon indicates how much it is needed. The reason for wanting to debate the subject today is that we have yet to hold a proper debate on the Floor of the House. The Secretary of State decided to issue only a written statement about the consultation, although much was said and done outside the House, which I thought was very insulting to Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.2/2">At Transport questions recently, I asked a topical question, but to be honest I was appalled by the complacency and the lack of interest with which the subject&mdash;not only is it a major decision but it affects hundreds of thousands of people&mdash;was dismissed. I am therefore incredibly grateful to have secured this debate. Although it will be one of the first parliamentary debates on the subject in coming months, it will be a useful start. Because many other Members want to speak, I shall try to keep my comments relatively short, Mr. Benton, so that others can join if they catch your eye.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.2/3">I have lived within a short distance of Heathrow all my life. By and large, those who live in the area have always been quite proud of Heathrow. It is certainly something that we have lived with. I am always a little concerned when people say, &quot;Why do people live there? Surely they knew there was an airport there.&quot; It reminds me of the story&mdash;is it apocryphal?&mdash;of the American wondering why they built Windsor castle so close to Heathrow. Some informed comment is less than informed if it suggests that people do not have to live there if they do not like the problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.2/4">Having an airport nearby can have a positive impact. It has economic advantages, although they are not 100 per cent. positive. If one were to ask the people of the London borough of Hillingdon whether they would still want Heathrow within its boundaries, I think we might get quite a mixed answer. It has brought many other problems to the borough. However, that is as it is.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.2/5">Those who have lived in the area have seen expansion over the years, but the appetite for expansion seems to grow year by year. I was not sufficiently active in politics when some of the previous developments were proposed to have been in the forefront of campaigns for or against. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> has an honourable tradition in opposing much of the expansion at Heathrow, particularly the fifth terminal. With hindsight, I wish I had been alongside him earlier because I think he was right. I hope, Mr. Benton, that he will catch your eye. He may be on the other side of the fence politically, but he is certainly on the same side on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.2/6">We have seen an insatiable appetite for expansion, but we have also discovered what happens when we are promised is to be the last piece of expansion. It never is. Having Heathrow on our back doorstep is almost like having a bully there. No sooner is a fifth terminal agreed than we are told that that is it&mdash;that that is all that is needed. There is no question of there being any more&mdash;no more runways, no more terminals, that is it. But almost as the ink was drying&mdash;perhaps, cynically, I might say before the ink was drying&mdash;plans for future expansion were well ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.2/7">We were told that a third runway was needed. We had been consulted and were told that a third short runway would be necessary; but there was no mention of a sixth terminal. Now there is a third runway, with a sixth terminal. I would be very surprised if the new runway was short&mdash;I cannot quite see the point in that; if we are going that far, we might as well go the whole hog. If we are now being been told that that it is all that is needed, then other plans are already afoot for more.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.2/8">We have been told&mdash;I am sure that this applies to Members on all sides of the House, because the subject crosses the party divide&mdash;that if there is no further expansion at Heathrow, somehow the airport will die. There will be no third runway; there will be tumbleweed blowing down the Great West road; somehow, we will be living in an industrial desert. The fact is that very few businesses say that they would leave if Heathrow was not expanded. I have a certain amount of experience and knowledge as a local businessman, and I do not think it would make that much difference. I do not think that Heathrow will die.</p>

	<p pid="b.107.3/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">my neighbour the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> for securing this debate, as well as the other Members who also applied for it. It is the luck of a petty bourgeois shopkeeper to be called, but there you are. This is a scene-setting debate. We shall apply regularly for debates on different aspects of the matter, so I warn the Minister not to plan any lengthy holidays next year, and certainly not to plan any via Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/2">The issue is fundamental to many of us. The Minister is held in affection in all parts of the House&mdash;I remember him as a youthful member of the Socialist Workers party&mdash;but the issue comes with a blight warning. He could be the Minister who not only wipes out a third of my constituency but contributes, by his decision on this matter, to the impact on climate change in a way that no other Government decision could.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/3">On Second Reading of the Planning Bill on Monday, I explained my background and involvement in relation to the development of Heathrow. I was at the terminal 4 inquiry, gave evidence to the terminal 5 inquiry and have been involved in virtually every planning issue involving Heathrow for the past 30 years, because I live near there. In 1983, when I was a Greater London councillor for the area, I held the first meeting to protest the proposals for a third runway. At that meeting, local historian Philip Sherwood showed a slide of a planning map from the 1940s for Heathrow airport. On that map was a third runway in almost exactly the position now intended. That confirmed in my constituents' minds and in my own that over the years, an incremental plan has been systematically rolled out for Heathrow airport that is swamping the Heathrow villages, and the Government have schemed with BAA and other bodies in the aviation industry to enable it to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/4">The third runway and terminal 6 are the latest development in that incremental roll-out, but to return to what the hon. Member for Uxbridge said, I was at the terminal 5 inquiry when BAA's barrister got up and promised the inspector, &quot;If we get the fifth terminal, there will be no third runway and no further terminal expansion at Heathrow.&quot; BAA wrote to me, stood on platforms with me and wrote to my constituents. The inspector, Mr. Vandermeer, then made his decision&mdash;terminal 5, but no further. He did so on several grounds, including an assessment of the environmental impact of any further expansion in terms of both air pollution and noise.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/5">Debates at the inquiry also involved reference to the social impacts&mdash;the devastation of our local communities. In the 1990s, the Government undertook a study on runways in the south-east that identified that the expansion of Heathrow airport by a third runway could impact 10,000 people and up to 3,500 homes. Now that further development has taken place, 4,000 homes could be affected either by demolition or by being rendered unliveable. Since then, a further argument has arisen in the form of climate change. Science has moved on and we know more about the impact of emissions, particularly aviation emissions, on climate change. The report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change, published two weeks ago, warned us that we have six to eight years to reduce emissions or face climate chaos.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/6">What has changed since the terminal 5 inquiry? We are told that a sixth terminal and a third runway have the potential, with mixed-mode use and runway alternation, to expand the cap on air traffic movements from 480,000 a year to 720,000, and then upwards to 800,000. At the same time, we are told despite the warnings of the terminal 5 inspector about the potential for increased pollution and noise that the expansion will result in no increase in noise or air pollution. It is laughable, is it not?</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/7">Project Heathrow, the process set up by the Government for examining the scientific consequences of what would happen as a result of a third runway and a sixth terminal&mdash;basically, an impact study&mdash;was elicited only by our campaign to get some truth and, to be frank, was rigged. There was no access to all the information or all the partners available. In fact, environmental and local community groups were excluded from that process. On the science, we agreed the assessment techniques, but had no access to the modelling upon which the results would be churned out. We then discovered that BAA supplied most of the information and doctored it as part of the overall inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.3/8">I pay tribute to hon. Members who had to use the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to get information out of that supposedly-independent assessment process. It was a public relations exercise more than an independent study. I expected some form of independent commission with experts, including international experts, acting as observers to ensure veracity in the process. It was no such thing. No social impact assessment was undertaken by the study. All we have in the consultation document is a reference to the number of homes that will be affected, which has gone up from a few hundred to 700 homes. In reality, we know from the South East and East of England Regional Air Service study that 3,000 to 4,000 could be affected.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.0/1">Interestingly enough, the hon. Members for Uxbridge and for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd), and I, met with our primary care trust last Friday to ask it to undertake such work. They had not even been invited to submit evidence on that basis, which I find fascinating, because that was one of the key issues addressed by terminal 5 when we presented surveys of the respiratory conditions of my constituents that resulted from the impact of the airport. We also presented the Chicago research on the cancer impact on those living and working at airports in America. There has been no contingency planning or social impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/2">I want to put it on the record what the proposals would mean to my community. I believe that they would result in the forced clearance of 10,000 people and whole families. Furthermore, three primary schools will be either demolished or rendered unusable: Harmondsworth, Heathrow and William Byrd. There will also be an impact on the secondary schools in the surrounding area owing to the massive extension of the road network. Whole communities will be wiped out. And what about community centres? I have looked at the flight paths in relation to our two churches&mdash;St. Mary's in Harmondsworth and the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Harlington. When the planes take off from the expanded runway&mdash;we were told that it would be a short take-off&mdash;they will virtually scrape the roofs. We know what will happen&mdash;those churches will be rendered unusable. I predict that we will return to the scenario three years ago when we had to dig up our dead. And there are war graves in those churches' grounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/3">We know from a freedom of information inquiry made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1771" name="Justine Greening">the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening)</phrase> that the supposedly most-credible road system&mdash;this does not apply to all the options for road systems&mdash;will literally run through the gardens and within yards and feet of people's homes.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his support, which has been principled and honest throughout the debates on different levels of expansion.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/2">Let us consider the economic argument. We will return for a further debate specifically on the economic argument, which is incredibly one-sided. In my community, the airport has created jobs, but it has forced some out as well. Land prices have gone up and I have lost skilled manufacturing work. Skilled and trained people have lost their jobs and are now working at Heathrow on unskilled jobs and not necessarily with the same recompense. As the hon. Member for Uxbridge said, my community has become increasingly dependent on the airport, so when the aviation industry catches a cold, there are lay-offs and redundancies and we become almost like a mining town in some areas. I have been at each inquiry at which BAA has promised my constituents that if it gets the new terminal and the development, more jobs will follow. However, I have seen job cuts and losses time and time again, largely as a result of the way in which processes have been changed and of mechanisation. It does not necessarily follow that further expansion and the depletion of our local environment will bring increased employment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/3">This process has angered me, my constituents and anyone involved with it all the way through. The consultation was derisory. The consultation document has not been distributed as widely as we were promised. It is difficult to obtain the full documentation. In fact, at one point, when people were phoning up and trying to get hold of it, we were told that copies had run out. There will be no exhibition on the expansion and terminal 6 in Sipson village&mdash;the very village that will be obliterated off the face of the earth. I received a note on this matter today. Here are some more examples: the Cranford village exhibition venue is not in Cranford, but close to Cranford cross on the Bath road; the Colnbrook venue is not in Colnbrook, but in Harmondsworth beside the detention centre, which is inaccessible; the west Drayton venue is unsuitable with inadequate parking, and there is no planned consultation or exhibition in Hayes itself, which is in the centre of my constituency, and therefore affected. I believe that the consultation is just a front and public relations propaganda exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/4">There have been no opportunities for Ministers to visit the area and respond to questions from local constituents. There has been no resourcing of community organisations or environmental groups so that they can participate in the consultation. I think that this makes a mockery of demographic government. It might well be that the decision will be taken under the new planning legislation. We have been told that the Government want to convert the aviation White Paper into a planning policy statement. That is unacceptable, because it will not follow a full consultation process, which we are promised planning policy statements do. If the infrastructure planning commission is established it will mean unaccountable bureaucratic decision makers for this major project.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/5">The process has been prejudiced already: statements made by the Prime Minister when he was Chancellor, documents on last year's Budget, his speech to the City of London, and speeches made by the Secretary of State for Transport on this matter and to the media generally have all announced that the Government plan to drive this process through. That has prejudiced any public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/6">In conclusion, the assessment process has been doctored, the consultation process has been fixed and the planning and decision-making processes have been rigged. People will not put up with that. It is a wholesale sell-out of the demographic process. In the summer, the climate camp came to my constituency. Some 200,000 people turned up, constructed a village and brought the issue to the head of media attention. If people do not have confidence in the decision-making process, the climate camp will be back and there will be further demonstrations and protests, because they believe that the demographic process has failed them. And I will join them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.117.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1771" speakername="Justine Greening" colnum="117"  time="015:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0007.htm#07121273000592">
	<p pid="b.117.0/1">I am pleased to contribute to the debate. Many hon. Members will have heard me speak at length outside the Chamber about my concerns regarding the impact of the expansion of Heathrow on my constituency, but is useful to be able to put some of those concerns on record.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/2">Underpinning all the comments that we have heard today are a few key issues, of which the most important for me is trust, or rather people's lack of trust, in the consultation document on which they can currently give their views. There is lack of trust because, although people expected BAA to provide data for the modelling process, they never expected Heathrow's operator, which stood to gain so much financially from a yes decision, to do so much modelling of the environmental results. Conveniently, those results now say that it is okay to go ahead and expand Heathrow and that there will be less noise and pollution, even though the airport will be nearly twice the size.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/3">Bias, therefore, is our other key concern. Some of us had hoped to have, perhaps for the first time, a balanced debate about how to strike a balance between the difficult issues of a growing city's needs for airport capacity and the needs of its residents, including my constituents, who drive London's economy day to day. We needed a reasoned debate, which would feature unbiased facts. The biggest tragedy and disappointment from my perspective is the loss of that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> mentioned my requests for information, and in spite of six months of effort, I have still not managed to obtain any detailed modelling of the environmental impact of an expanded Heathrow. I have now asked for an internal review of the decision not to give me any data. Even that request has not had an answer. That is a month late, having been due on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>. It is now <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-12">12 December</phrase>, and still there is no yes or no. That is the critical answer that I need, because without it I have no potential to complain&mdash;should I receive a no&mdash;to Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/5">The matter is important for my constituents, and it is of great concern to me that public health has not yet been considered. The impact that the development could have on family life in Putney is of great concern to me. In the recent study, &quot;Attitudes to Noise from Aviation Sources in England&quot;, which examined how aircraft noise affects people across England, many of the people who identified themselves as most frustrated and annoyed by aircraft noise were, ironically, professional people&mdash;the very ones who are about to get on to crammed tubes every day, struggle in to the City and do those deals that keep the wheels of our economy turning. It is therefore particularly worrying that the Government and the Minister are so cavalier about the risks.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/6">I want to keep my comments short, but I have a few final key questions for the Minister. What independent review has been undertaken of the environmental work, and is the Minister willing to say which bodies did it and to put their comments in the public domain? What independent review was undertaken of the public consultation exhibition boards that are being shown to people? That is not happening in my constituency&mdash; according to the Government, my patch apparently does not have a problem with aircraft noise, so it does not need a consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/7">Who reviewed the boards? One of the bullet points on them says, for example, that nine out of 10 companies in the area close to Heathrow say that it is very important or vital, but it fails to point out that that figure refers to nine out of 10 companies that responded to the questionnaire, which was sent out as part of the Oxford Economic Forecasting report.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/8">I understand that just 5 per cent. of companies that were asked for a view bothered to respond. So, one in 20, rather than nine out of 10, thinks that Heathrow is critical or very important. What process was used for the questionnaire that people were asked to fill in? Many of us are concerned that it is very technical. I appreciate that this is a technical area, but what review process was there for the document, so as to provide a reasonable check of its intelligibility?</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/9">I make a final plea to the Minister for some assurances. Many different groups and individuals, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1832" name="David Wilshire">my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase>, London First and all the MPs present for the debate, say that environmental issues are important. Will the Minister at least give an assurance that if&mdash;when I eventually get the facts about what has been modelled&mdash;it turns out that the expansion of Heathrow will be as catastrophic for the local environment as some of us suspect, he will go back to the drawing board and take on board the grave concerns that we all have for the environment and London's economy?</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/10">The Government will not be able to persist in sticking their head in the sand. We need a reasoned, balanced approach that confronts environmental issues, rather than pretending they do not exist. Whether by this Government or another, the issues will have to be confronted eventually. The cost to the population of London of getting the decision wrong will be very dear. The Minister should be careful before pressing on in such a cavalier way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="118"  time="015:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0008.htm#07121273000593">
	<p pid="b.118.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> on securing the debate. The brief time that I have available will allow me to register three messages with the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/2">First, Hillingdon speaks with one voice on this issue through its elected representatives in Parliament and in the council. The community that I represent is not losing houses, schools or churches, but it feels tremendous solidarity with the outrage at the putting of business before people, as my hon. Friend put it. My constituents are worried about the impact of new take-off flight paths over Harrow and Northolt. They are worried about what the expansion means for the future of RAF Northolt, because there have been mixed messages about that in the past, and they are worried about what it means in terms of the costs that they will have to pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/3">In the interest of joined-up government, the Department for Transport should be aware that the expansion of Heathrow presents the people of Hillingdon with a real issue, because a bigger airport means more unaccompanied minors seeking asylum. That is not an issue that affects every constituency in the country, but the numbers are big and the economic reality is that Hillingdon supports those unfortunate people and pays for them. The numbers run into hundreds, and the costs into millions of pounds. Hillingdon takes enormous pride in the service and support that it offers, but is deeply disappointed by the Government's reaction to its need for funding support. The reality, of which the Minister should be aware, is that this year Hillingdon council tax will rise 3 per cent. to fund those costs, which the Government do not meet. That problem touches people in their pockets and we in the community are concerned that it will begin to affect what have been, up to now, very good community relations. I give that example to show the many facets and angles of the debate that the Government need to think carefully about.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/4">Secondly, the process may drive another nail into the coffin of public trust in the political process and the Government. Other hon. Members have made that point adequately, but it is a simple one: promises have been broken, so why should anyone believe what the Government say on the issue in future?</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/5">Thirdly, I want to reinforce the point that the process is in danger of driving a coach and horses through the Government's climate change policy. Are we serious about that or not? If we are, why do we continue to adopt a predict-and-provide approach for the fastest-growing source of emissions? We should remind ourselves that aviation is the fastest-growing source of emissions in this country: it has grown 90 per cent. between 1990 and 2004 and is expected to double by 2050. On some models it will represent 100 per cent. of Britain's carbon budget by 2050 if it is left unchecked, yet we continue to give a green light to further expansion, as my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge pointed out.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/6">What on earth are we to say to our constituents when they say, &quot;Hang on, the Government are telling us that climate change is the most important challenge we face, but they are expanding Heathrow.&quot;? The Minister may talk about emissions trading in his reply, but I sat on the Environmental Audit Committee for two years and we examined emissions trading exhaustively. It is a cap and trade scheme, and cap and trade schemes are only as good as the cap. The history of the emissions trading scheme should not, if it is the only tool in the box for controlling aircraft emissions, give the Government any of the comfort that we desperately need in the face of the threat.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/7">My final point is that the Government argue that the expansion is in the interest of national competitiveness and the national economy, but I seriously doubt whether that proposition has been tested adequately. The growth in aviation is due not to business, but to cheap leisure. With the growth of sophisticated video conferencing technology, I do not expect that trend to change. What proportion of the new passengers will be interchange passengers, who contribute nothing to the national economy? What consideration has been given to the tourism deficit&mdash;the difference between what British tourists spend overseas and what overseas tourists spend here&mdash;which is calculated to be about &pound;15 billion annually? How has the London economy suffered during the time when Heathrow has not grown as fast as other international airports? I have not noticed such suffering.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/8">Have the Government really caught the genuine voice of business? The last British Chambers of Commerce survey that I saw said that 70 per cent. were not in favour of Heathrow expansion. The last Institute of Directors survey showed that only 1 per cent. of directors considered the expansion of Heathrow to be a priority. The voice that I hear says that people want a better airport, not a bigger airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/9">We have an opportunity to stop the rot. The Government have an absolutely golden opportunity to take a lead and stop the nonsensical game of, &quot;My airport is bigger than your airport,&quot; as if it were a significant symbol of a nation's status. The Prime Minister has billed the issue as an example of his ability take a tough decision; the truth is that the only brave and visionary decision would be to say no.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.121.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" speakername="Susan Kramer" colnum="121"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0008.htm#07121273000596">
	<p pid="b.121.1/1">I can only agree with the hon. Lady. Mixed mode and half a day of peace certainly make a huge difference in my constituency. People can plan things like weddings in the afternoon, and schools can have a sports day during which their children can be outside and hear each other in the afternoon. The difference is phenomenal. I am conscious of other constituencies that are so close to the airport that children's education and lives are generally disrupted by the constant impact of noise, but the loss of that half day is the final straw for my community. People who have put up with the insistent and intrusive level of noise have been able to do so only because they know that there will be relief from time to time. To take away that relief is so utterly fundamental that the Minister should meet some of my constituents to understand how it changes their views, turning them from people who are generally opposed to Heathrow into active militants.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/2">Noise was inadequately dealt with during the consultation. I spoke to a noise expert who visited Barnes wetlands recently. The hon. Member for Putney also attended, because it was the nearest exhibition to her constituency. The expert and I agreed that decibels are a measure of interest to physicists who are interested in the behaviour of sound waves, but that they do not tell anybody very much about how people hear noise. The value of the &quot;Attitudes to noise from aviation sources in England&quot; study has been to demonstrate that noise is becoming more intrusive, disturbing and annoying. If the Government will not take it into serious consideration and understand that the standards of noise that they used in the past will not do today, just as the standards of pollution, cleanliness and responsiveness that we used in the past will not do today, they do not understand the dynamics of my city.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/3">The issue that exercises me more than any other is the consultation process. Several hon. Members have said that there is a question about trust. Indeed, one promise after another has been broken over the years, so we start from a position of grave distrust of the Government and of BAA and its motivations. It bothers people enormously that BAA was so intensely involved in the development of the consultation documents and of the documents behind them, such that it is impossible to tell where one organisation stops and the other begins. There was obviously no independence in that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/4">I ask once more, will the Minister come, or will he direct his senior officials to come, and answer questions directly, face to face? Some 700 families will lose their homes, thousands of people will lose their half day of peace and thousands more will come under the flight path for the first time, but no Minister is willing to enter into dialogue. We live in a democracy, and such dialogue is essential. The mistrust extends to the planning process, which is quite frightening when one considers the issue in the context of airport expansion.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/5">The possibility is that without consultation, the new proposals for Heathrow will be fast-tracked into the new Planning Bill. Someone said to me&mdash;it struck me as wise&mdash;that we ought to call it the &quot;Planning (More Runways and Nuclear Power Stations) Bill&quot;, because that is what it is&mdash;a mechanism for a fast-track decision, which essentially means that local people will be carved out of any effective consultation. I have said to the Minister before&mdash;I think perhaps he smiled and laughed at the time&mdash;that many of the questions in the consultation document are just about unintelligible. To work one's way through it and give a positive or sensible set of responses is nearly impossible.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.1/6">Those of us who oppose the expansion are backed by the 2M group, which comprises local councils representing more than 2 million residents. As a group, collectively and across parties, we are determined to fight the expansion in every way we can, by every means. I suspect that we will succeed, because we have the populace behind us. We are all determined to ensure that the expansion does not happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.122.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> on obtaining the debate. He has been a most effective campaigner for his constituents on the issue over the years and has made his mark again and again. In March, I visited his near neighbours in Hounslow, and the vexation of local people was evident. Many felt that they had been, and continued to be, ignored. One would have needed a heart of stone not to be affected by some of the sights. Lampton school, which I visited, did not even have an air-conditioned room for students to take their exams in, so the teaching staff were faced with the choice of frying them in a boiling hot room in June or their having to be deafened every 90 seconds by a jumbo taking off.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/2">My hon. Friend represented the views of his constituents colourfully, and when he mentioned the highland clearances and we heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the vigorous speech of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, it struck me that if the Scots had had those two at Culloden, history might have taken a different course.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/3">The debate presents an opportunity to put many people's concerns to the Minister, and there have been some very good speeches. In fact, we all welcome the opportunity to question the Government. We have been told by them, not least by the Prime Minister, that the expansion of Heathrow is an issue of the utmost national importance&mdash;so important, in fact, that the decision to launch the consultation did not even involve the Secretary of State coming to the House. Instead, it was slipped out in a written statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/4">Meanwhile, a report appeared in <i>The Times </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase> under the headline, &quot;Stansted runway plan scrapped in favour of Heathrow growth&quot;, saying that the Government were prepared to drop backing for expansion Stansted to get it at Heathrow. Is that true? The Opposition are firmly against further runway expansion at Stansted and Gatwick. Nobody with a serious commitment to combating climate change&mdash;we heard a brief but remarkable speech from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>&mdash;could consider the three extra runways that were in the Government's original White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/5">We, as a party, are committed to reducing the growth in aviation emissions towards a rate that could be covered by efficiency savings. Nevertheless, we recognise as a party that the economic case for expanding Heathrow is much stronger than those for the other two airports. With characteristic vig<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1832" name="David Wilshire">our, my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> made some points on that. However, before any decision can be made on a matter of such importance, four tests must be met&mdash;those set out clearly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1500" name="Theresa Villiers">my hon. Friend the Member for Chipping Barnet (Mrs. Villiers)</phrase>, who has taken the trouble to join us today. They are on NOx pollution, noise, examining alternative ways to meet demand and free up capacity, and, above all, meeting our climate change targets.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/6">Can expansion go ahead in a way that is consistent with meeting EU requirements on NOx emissions? Can it go ahead in a way that still allows us to meet our targets on climate change and cutting CO2 emissions? Is it possible to meet increased demand with more efficient use of existing capacity or by providing better transport alternatives, such as high-speed rail? Most controversially of all, is expansion consistent with no increase in the overall noise footprint of the airport and a progressive reduction in that footprint in the medium term?</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/7">There is a particular wrinkle on that last point: the current night-time flight regime was rejigged in 2006 and will end in 2012. During the passage of the Civil Aviation Act 2006, as has been said several times, the Government tried to abolish the combined movement and noise quota in favour of just a noise quota to determine night flights. Conservative peers, working with Liberal Democrats, defeated the Government in the Lords. Had they not done so, night disturbance would have increased considerably.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/8">I shall put some detailed questions to the Minister. Can he guarantee that there are no plans to remove the night cap? What are the plans after 2012? During the passage of the 2006 Act, we tabled a number of amendments to improve the measurement of noise, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1771" name="Justine Greening">my hon. Friend the Member for Putney (Justine Greening)</phrase> said, and to introduce independent verification of noise limits and tightening of the system of fines for exceeding noise quotas, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">my hon. Friend the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> is keen on. The Government rejected them all out of hand. Are they willing to reconsider?</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/9">Do the Government stand by their promise, made in the White Paper and reiterated in the statement to the House, that there will be no net increase in the 57 dB noise contour area of 127 sq km? Following on from that, after commissioning and paying for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1629" name="Boris Johnson">the ANASE report, which my hon. Friend the Member for Henley (Mr. Johnson)</phrase> described with his customary vigour and which was six years in the making, have they simply abandoned its findings? In particular, do Ministers still believe that Leq is an appropriate and credible measure of noise?</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/10">How many homes would lose their alternate half-days of comparative peace and quiet if mixed mode on runways were introduced? When I visited Hounslow, I got the feeling that communities thought that their half-day of peace and quiet was a bigger issue than the third runway. I note the unanimity on that subject among all who have spoken today. Has the Minister made any comparative studies of noise insulation schemes administered by non-BAA-owned airports abroad and in the UK? Does he appreciate that if Heathrow had to apply the standards that City airport has voluntarily taken on, it would be insulating homes in Kensington?</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/11">The Government stated in the 2003 White Paper:</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The most difficult issue confronting Heathrow concerns compliance with the mandatory air quality limits for NO2 that will apply from 2010, and in particular the annual mean limit of 40 micrograms per cubic metre. The consultation document...said&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/13">that</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/14" class="indent">&quot;another runway at Heathrow could not be considered unless the Government could be confident that levels of all relevant pollutants could be consistently contained within EU limits.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/15">Do the Government rule out seeking a derogation, temporary or otherwise, from the mandatory air quality limits on NOx that will apply from 2010? Does all or any part of the Heathrow site already exceed those limits? Have the Government studied Ove Arup's innovative Heathrow hub concept and fully considered its advantages in tackling real threats to security and hugely reducing traffic flows, the carbon footprint and NOx?</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/16">At 14 years, the public inquiry on terminal 4 was the longest in UK planning history. Does the Minister accept that, whatever the decision, we owe it to all parties to arrive at a decision in a timely fashion? At what stage does he envisage the Secretary of State calling in the planning application for a third runway?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="126"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0009.htm#07121273000602">
	<p pid="b.126.1/1">I shall try to give way later if possible. I apologise for not giving way now. I am not being discourteous; I simply want to respond to as much of the debate as possible in the nine minutes left.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/2">That strategy set out to balance, as far as possible, the needs of the economy, the environment, local communities and the wider population of the UK. Our latest forecasts endorse the broad trends identified earlier. They also confirm that even when the costs of carbon have been fully taken into account, in line with the Stern review, the economic case for developing Heathrow remains strong. That point is covered in some detail in the impact assessment that forms part of our consultation document, to which I shall turn in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/3">We also want conditions at the airport to improve. Delays, overcrowding, and lost baggage are just some of the frequent complaints, but Heathrow is struggling with ageing infrastructure and volumes of traffic beyond its design capacity. The good news is that the state-of-the-art terminal 5 will open next March and that BAA has plans to invest &pound;6.2 billion in modernising the airport over the next 10 years. By 2012, two out of three air passengers will be using terminals that are not open today.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/4">We need to consider the whole passenger journey, including travel to and from Heathrow. Again, improvements are coming. The Government's &pound;16 billion funding deal for Crossrail is now in place, which will provide a 25-minute link to the centre of London. From 2014, enhanced Piccadilly line services will add further options for people travelling to the airport, including, very importantly, its work force. Also, AirTrack, if approved, promises to make a significant addition to Heathrow's rail links, providing direct services from terminal 5 to the south-west rail network via Staines. That point was raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1832" name="David Wilshire">the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/5">All that will improve the passenger experience, but it is not just the terminal facilities that are struggling to cope&mdash;so are the runways. Demand for departures and arrivals exceeds capacity on the current two runways, so even the smallest problem in the system can have a disproportionate impact elsewhere, leading to delays from which it is difficult to recover.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/6">Current runway constraints also have environmental impacts. More than 100,000 aircraft had to be stacked over London in 2006-07, emitting more than 50,000 tonnes of carbon. If the current proposals are approved, National Air Traffic Services would look to balance safety, which is paramount, airspace capacity, airport resilience and environmental requirements. Depending on any options pursued, there may be some scope to reduce stacking with consequent potential environmental benefit. Ultimately, we have to address the question of runway capacity.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/7">Our support in 2003 for a short, third runway at Heathrow was conditional on strict local conditions, one of which was that there would be a noise limit and no increase in the size of the area significantly affected by aircraft noise, as measured by the 2002 57 dBA Leq noise cont<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">our&mdash;the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> asked about that. Other local conditions concerned air quality limits and our being confident of meeting the European air quality limits around the airport, and improving public transport access to the airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/8">The consultation launched on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-22">22 November</phrase> also presented proposals for introducing mixed mode operations on the existing runways, both within the flight cap, to improve resilience, and beyond the cap to allow an additional 60,000 movements a year. That would be subject to the same conditions. Again, the consultation document presents analysis and invites views. It also considers existing operational procedures such as the Cranford agreement and westerly preference, which the T5 inquiry recommended should be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/9">We want to take full account of the breadth of views and the evidence that all interested parties may have to offer between now and the closing date of <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February</phrase>, and I urge all people who will be affected by the proposals to register their views. We have tried to facilitate that by sending summary documents to more than 217,000 households, alerting them to the consultation process and telling them how they can find out more.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/10">I accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington&mdash;there were a few problems for a couple of days, but they have been resolved. We have set up a helpline number&mdash;0845 600 4170&mdash;and an e-mail address, heathrow consultation@dft.gsi.gov.uk, to enable people to ask questions. The online address is <a href="http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/open/heathrowconsultation/">http://www.dft.gov.uk/consultations/open/heathrowconsultation/</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/11">In addition, we are mounting a series of 11 exhibitions&mdash;six in December and five in January, or it may be the other way around&mdash;which began last Friday, to give people further opportunities to understand the issues and register their views. Following the consultation, we will take the final policy decisions later in 2008 after we have finished assessing all the responses and accompanying evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/12">I shall now address a few of the specific points that have been raised and then give way to answer questions, if I have the chance. The hon. Member for Uxbridge criticised my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport on her approach to the matter, but I assure him that she treats it with the utmost seriousness. She fully explained to the House last week, in Transport questions, why a written statement was entirely appropriate. Consultations are generally launched by a written ministerial statement, and she intends to make an oral statement to the House in due course.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.130.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="130"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0009.htm#07121273000612">
	<p pid="b.130.1/1">I am extremely grateful for this opportunity to have a short debate on what is an extremely serious topic for my constituents. Over the autumn, I prepared 30,000 fairly detailed surveys, which were delivered across Taunton Deane by volunteers who were willing to help me. I asked questions on a range of topics to do with the national health service, and I was extremely encouraged by the high response rate. Several thousand surveys were returned to me, and I compiled a digest of the results, which I have shared with the Minister and health professionals throughout the Taunton Deane and Somerset areas, as much for their interest as for their information. The questions dealt with many aspects of the experience that patients have in my part of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/2">It will be helpful if I begin by setting out a little of the context. First, it is important to give credit where it is due and say that the response was overwhelmingly positive. I was not undertaking the survey in an attempt to criticise or to find problems where none exist. It is fair to acknowledge that the Government have dramatically increased spending on the NHS over the past 10 years; in fact, they have increased public spending, full stop. For every &pound;10 that they spent in 1997, the Government now spend &pound;14&mdash;a 40 per cent. real-terms expenditure increase over the past decade. Of course, the increases in the NHS have been even bigger than that, so some of the problems caused by chronic low funding do not apply in the same way as they did a decade ago. Whether the money is always spent as efficiently as it might be is another matter, but there are not the same structural funding problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/3">It is also reasonable to point out that some of the severe patient problems that existed a decade ago, with people waiting a year and a half and, in some cases, as long as two years for an operation, no longer exist to anything like the same extent. I imagine that it must be frustrating for Ministers who feel that they have gone some way to addressing a problem to find that people in the population at large then turn their attention to another problem and do not necessarily notice the one that has, to a large extent, been resolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/4">It is reasonable and fair to say that recognition of the improvements came through in the responses from my constituents. There was a high level of support for Musgrove Park hospital&mdash;the main hospital in Somerset, serving Taunton and a much wider part of Somerset as well as some people in Devon&mdash;Wellington Community hospital and Dene Barton hospital, which is also within my constituency, and for all of the GP surgeries, all of which I have visited. There was a positive sense that the NHS services in Taunton Deane were part of our community. People supported them and felt an affinity with them. They wished those services and the staff in them&mdash;doctors, nurses and the occasionally maligned administrators&mdash;well, and wanted to ensure that we had an NHS in our part of the country of which we could be proud.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/5">I shall give four examples of the positive feedback that I put in the response sheet, which is the compilation of the surveys that were returned to me. First,</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/6" class="indent">&quot;73 per cent. of respondents believed that local health services have got better or stayed the same in recent times.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/7">Obviously, it would be nice if the figure were even higher; none the less, taking into account that people may be more inclined to respond to surveys if they have a grievance, I was encouraged that three quarters of the people who responded believed that the services were as good or, in many cases, better than they were in recent times. Secondly,</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/8" class="indent">&quot;94 per cent. of people surveyed&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/9">an overwhelmingly large figure&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/10" class="indent">&quot;felt that the waiting time to see a GP locally was reasonable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/11">Only 3 per cent. reported that they waited longer than was reasonable to see a doctor in my area. Thirdly,</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/12" class="indent">&quot;70 per cent. of people said that they were very satisfied with the consultation they received from their GP.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/13">Only 1 per cent. of the remaining 30 per cent. reported that they were not very satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/14">As we can see, there is general satisfaction with the services, and it goes right across the board, even to the hospital food. I spent half a day at Musgrove Park hospital a few months ago to find out about its food and catering operations and to meet all the staff who work in that area, which has traditionally been the subject of jokes. People malign hospital food and those who serve it, and comment on whether it tastes good enough, is hot enough, and so on. However, 76 per cent. of people who had hospital food during their stay in hospital said that they were very or fairly satisfied with it, and only 8 per cent. said that they were not at all satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/15">The overall level of satisfaction with provision and services both at the hospital and at GP levels was encouraging. It is important to make that point. To summarise, when people were asked how satisfied they were with the NHS in Taunton Deane,</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/16" class="indent">&quot;30 per cent. said they were very satisfied, 56 per cent. of people were fairly satisfied&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/17">and only 14 per cent. of people said they were not very satisfied, but, of the several thousand who responded, nobody said that they were not at all satisfied. Fourteen per cent. erred on the side of dissatisfaction, but even they were not totally negative in their observations on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/18">We have many things to look forward to in my area. A cancer centre is to be built at Musgrove Park hospital&mdash;in fact, work has already commenced on it, and it is due to open in 2009. That is an extremely important development for my constituents because, at present, many who have cancer need to go as far as Bristol for treatment. Obviously, that 100-mile round trip from Taunton is distressing for them and their families; it is also expensive and physically tiring at a time when they are least well equipped to deal with such a journey. That issue, which is of huge importance to my constituency, is being addressed, and I believe that I can say with absolute confidence that my constituents very much welcome that change.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/19">Having said all those things, it is only reasonable to point out where there are concerns. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister how we might go about tackling them effectively. I will run through some of them. They are not in any particular order, but it is worth starting with the one that has perhaps received the most attention in my area. The survey indicated that</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/20" class="indent">&quot;40 per cent. of people rated the out of hours care they received from their GP as poor. 43 per cent. thought it was average and only 18 per cent. rated it as being good.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/21">Compared with the figures that I gave earlier on other aspects of the NHS, those figures are very low indeed and should give rise to concern, particularly as the Government have recently altered the arrangements for out-of-hours services at the evenings and weekends. I welcome the new Somerset primary care trust five-year strategic health plan, which includes in its summary a commitment to</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Developing more flexible opening hours for GP surgeries, including extended opening at evenings and weekends for half of the county's GP practices.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/23">I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some encouraging news this afternoon about improvements in this aspect of the service. People in my area are keen to have an efficient out-of-hours service, particularly elderly people who may need to access GP services outside conventional working hours. It is of huge importance to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/24">The second concern that I am keen to raise is the availability of NHS dentists. It is true that, according to the figures that I have been given, 69 per cent. of the population in Taunton Deane are registered with an NHS dentist. That is considerably higher than the national average, but of course it still leaves almost one third not registered with an NHS dentist. There is evidence of problems with dentistry in Somerset. Taunton Deane has a high level of tooth decay in 10 and 11-year-olds, according to Somerset county council's health scrutiny sub-committee, and although availability of and access to NHS dentistry in Taunton Deane is less problematic than in some other parts of the country, it was raised as a concern by a number of people</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/25">Another aspect of concern was the continued existence of mixed-sex hospital wards. In my survey, two thirds of people&mdash;67 per cent.&mdash;of those who responded thought that mixed-sex wards were not acceptable, and only 16 per cent. thought that they were okay. I hear that anecdotally from people who, when they may feel compromised in their health and general appearance, would rather not have the indignity of being on a ward with people of the opposite sex who are strangers to them. I know that the Government have turned their attention to that in the past, but it remains a problem in Taunton Deane and elsewhere in the country. It would be a significant step in the right direction if mixed-sex wards no longer existed in Musgrove Park hospital and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/26">The fourth of the six areas that I shall touch on is nurses' pay, which is topical, given that police officers' pay at the forefront of our minds. Many people felt that the nurses' pay rise this year was less generous than it should have been. I recognise that pay has improved in recent years, but there has been a spending squeeze this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/27">Caution was expressed about excessive centralisation and target setting in the NHS. I am not against targets in all circumstances, and I believe that most people are not against them in all circumstances. People rail against them, but they respond positively if they are given an example such as the target of patients being seen within 14 days if they are suspected of having cancer. However, they are anxious about excessive centralisation and micro-management of services by central Government, with less discretion being given to people in each geographic area, such as Taunton Deane, to run and to shape services appropriately for their community.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/28">The final concern is cleanliness and hospital infections. In the past year or so, I spent half a day with the cleaning staff at Musgrove Park hospital, and I was impressed by how seriously they take their duties and the progress that they are making to improve the overall standard of cleanliness. However, 18 per cent. of those responding to the survey reported that they were aware of a problem with MRSA or other hospital-related infections during their stay. That has been a problem at the hospital in Taunton and at other hospitals. It causes great anxiety to people who fear that they will end up being made more ill rather than cured during their time in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/29">In conclusion, I recognise that there have been improvements in NHS services in Taunton Deane. I want to be reasonable and to pay tribute for those improvements when it is deserved. I particularly recognise the work of doctors, nurses, administrative staff, all the support staff, such as porters and receptionists, whose work is often overlooked, and all those who work within the primary care trust and the strategic health authority. I have had good relations with them while I have been a Member of Parliament, and their work is hugely valued by people in my area.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/30">There is great loyalty to the services. The friends of Musgrove Park hospital and the friends of Wellington community hospital are both well supported organisations, and that recognises the general feeling of well-being directed towards those two hospitals in the community as a whole. However, that does not mean that there is no scope for services to improve, and there is still some way to go with out-of-hours access to GPs and mixed-sex wards. If the Minister can demonstrate progress in such areas, I will ensure that next time I undertake such a survey in Taunton Deane the findings will be even more positive and encouraging than on this occasion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.134.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="134"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0010.htm#07121273000614">
	<p pid="b.134.1/1">As I was saying, I was also pleased to read in the survey conducted by the hon. Member for Taunton that nine in 10 Taunton residents rejected the suggestion that the NHS wastes money. Of course, in 1997 the NHS suffered from massive underinvestment. We have more than doubled spending in Taunton and across the country, and just in the past two years, funding for Somerset primary care trust has increased by 22 per cent. Without that additional investment, accompanied by reform, we would not have seen the significant reductions in waiting times and waiting lists that have been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/2">In Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust in 1997, more than 1,000 people were waiting more than six months for treatment; today, nobody is. I can announce to the House today that by the end of this month, no one at the trust will have to wait more than 18 weeks from referral by their GP for treatment. That is a year ahead of the national target&mdash;a remarkable achievement. I congratulate all the NHS staff in Taunton and the surrounding area who have worked so hard to achieve that goal. I have to tell hon. Members that Taunton is only the second place in the country to achieve that historic milestone, the first being Yeovil&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>There is a traditional rivalry within Somerset. I also congratulate the trust on achieving foundation trust status earlier this month. I hope that the trust will continue to work in partnership with all the other NHS organisations to provide the best possible service to the local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/3">I come now to the concerns raised by the hon. Gentleman. As he will know, the out-of-hours service in Taunton is provided by Somerset primary care trust, with calls from patients handled by the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Trust. I was a little surprised by the conclusions of his survey, as recent official patient surveys have found that 92.2 per cent. of patients describe their satisfaction levels as good or excellent. The Department requires all out-of-hours providers to meet the quality requirements as a contractual obligation. The requirements stipulate that patients will be guaranteed a GP consultation, including a home visit if there is a clinical need; patients are treated by the clinician best equipped to meet their needs in the most appropriate location; and services will be regularly audited to ensure that patients are receiving quality care.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/4">An audit of the service in Somerset conducted by the National Audit Office in 2006 found it to be effective, clinically safe, meeting patient needs and expectations and providing value for money. It has been highlighted as an example of good practice for use across the country. Perhaps one explanation for the findings of the hon. Gentleman's survey is that there is an element of confusion between out-of-hours service and the opening hours of GPs, which is a slightly different matter. Because of the questioning in the survey, some respondents may have thought that they were being asked about extended opening hours for GPs, which we acknowledge is still a problem not just in Taunton Deane but around the country. As the hon. Gentleman will know, we are taking measures both locally and nationally to increase the flexibility of GP surgery hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/5">I have to tell the hon. Gentleman that many hon. Members would be delighted if 69 per cent. of their constituents were registered with an NHS dentist. I think that the national average is about 56 per cent. and it has never been more than 60 per cent. across the country, so Taunton enjoys a higher level than has ever been achieved anywhere in the country. I understand that there are 15 dental practices in Taunton Deane, with four currently taking on new NHS patients&mdash;two in Taunton and two in Wellington&mdash;so the hon. Gentleman's constituents should not have too many problems finding an NHS dentist. Spending on dentistry has increased by 30 per cent. since 2003-04. We have also opened two new dental schools, including one in the south-west, and increased the number of undergraduate training places by 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/6">The South West strategic health authority has told me that Musgrove Park hospital complies with the Department's guidance on single-sex accommodation. I understand that all wards are single sex except where patients are admitted as emergencies. That is a common practice around the country. I understand that when patients are admitted to a mixed-sex ward, the foundation trust always attempts to put them in a single-sex bay and to move them to a single-sex ward as soon as practically possible. Every effort is made to ensure that patients' privacy and dignity are respected.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/7">The hon. Gentleman drew attention to the problem of nurses' pay. We acknowledge that this year's pay round was a very tight one, but we cannot stress enough the importance of avoiding inflationary pressures in the economy, because no-one, least of all public sector workers, benefits from spiralling wage, and therefore price, inflation. In the long term, inflation means less investment in public service, fewer jobs and lower pay. The same sort of pay restraint is having to be endured, as the hon. Gentleman himself said, by all staff in the public sector and, indeed, the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/8">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that in the past 10 years we have had to rely quite a lot on top-down targets. They have been very important in driving some of the improvements that we have seen in mortality rates for some of the major killers in this country, such as cancer and stroke, and to get the appallingly long waiting times that existed a few years ago down to the levels that we are enjoying now. However, as we have achieved that, increased the capacity of the services and invested in more doctors and nurses, we can now move away from the top-down culture; indeed, we are doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/9">When the annual NHS framework document&mdash;an annual document that the Department publishes to give the service its instructions for the next 12 months&mdash;is published tomorrow, the hon. Gentleman will see that we have made a significant shift away from top-down targets, although there are still one or two areas where we think the public are so concerned that they should be national priorities. He touched on one of those&mdash;hospital cleanliness and hygiene. However, we are going to leave it much more up to local health services, in consultation with their local communities, to decide what the most appropriate priorities are for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/10">With regard to hospital-acquired infections in the hon. Gentleman's area, I understand that Somerset is working towards its Clostridium difficile target and it has made good progress in reducing MRSA, but we are not taking the pressure off. As I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware, we have taken a number of decisions in the past few months to help to continue the drive to reduce hospital-acquired infections. That problem, which affects all developed countries, does not have one simple solution. Cleanliness and hand washing are very important, but so is good prescribing&mdash;the right prescribing policy for antibiotics&mdash;as poor prescribing can lead to problems in many areas. It is important that less well performing hospitals and trusts learn from the experience and practice of the best performing ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/11">The hon. Gentleman referred to the local strategic framework, which he rightly said, I think, will be a very exciting document, setting out the vision for health care in his area for the next few years. It includes a &pound;2 million investment programme to reduce health inequalities, and joint working with GP practices on practice-based commissioning&mdash;again, that is bottom-up health care priority setting. There are also local targets to reduce avoidable emergency admissions by 10 per cent. by March 2009; to improve palliative care services; to build four new community hospitals, at Frome, Minehead, South Petherton and Bridgwater, by 2012; and to commission, as the hon. Gentleman said, a new cancer centre at Taunton and Somerset NHS Trust by 2009 and a new surgical centre by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/12">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for showcasing the excellent quality of health care in the Taunton area. Taunton is in the lead in a series of areas, and I congratulate and thank staff and local and regional NHS managers for their fantastic dedication and hard work. It means that when we celebrate the 60th birthday of the NHS next year, the people of Taunton will have particular cause for celebration. Of course there will always be room for improvement, but I know that the local health service is committed to building on its success, and I am sure that it will enjoy the hon. Gentleman's support as it does so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.137.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="137"  time="016:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0010.htm#07121273000615">
	<p pid="b.137.1/1">I hope that you, Mr. Benton, have never suffered from Montezuma's revenge, but you and your constituents have certainly suffered from the revenge of another defeated Mexican general, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, best known to moviegoers for his siege of the Alamo. That general was decisively defeated in the later Mexican-American war and went into exile in New York, where his minder was an inventor called Mr. Adams. The general persuaded Mr. Adams to import a consignment of chicle, the native gum of Mexico. After unsuccessful attempts to turn it into carriage and bicycle wheels, Mr. Adams turned the remainder into chewable candy. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/2">In my city of Nottingham, where we have spent millions of pounds enhancing our beautiful city centre and our square in the middle of town, we are unfortunately already seeing gum being deposited and we are having to have people almost permanently on station to remove it. Gum is a plague on modern cities and it defiles quality of life in places such as Nottingham, Derby, Leicester and Lincoln, representatives of which I have with spoken today. That has to change.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/3">Those who can act with impunity&mdash;the manufacturers that supply gum&mdash;face no costs whatever. The clean-up costs are all down to our local council tax payers and income taxpayers. Either the manufacturers should start picking up the bill or, far more preferably, the Government should help them to see the light and move towards a biodegradable gum.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/4">The first chicle introduced from Mexico was a vegetable substance. I am sure that, with a little prodding and incentive from the Government, we can get the manufacturers to go back to a biodegradable gum and reduce this plague&mdash;this blight&mdash;on our cities, which reduces people to bringing gum into their own houses and on to their carpets from the streets. Children get it in their hair and on their clothes. People with disabilities get it on their wheelchairs. It is about time that we started to do something about it so that cities such as Nottingham can be the joyful and clean places that citizens want them to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/5">This scourge promotes antisocial behaviour, blights the environment and public property, and costs local government and national Government millions to clear up. It is a hidden menace to every walker and to wildlife and pets, and is an additional and unpleasant hazard to disabled people and young children. In this short debate, I shall look at some of those costs in more detail and make a simple proposal to deter and reduce the consumption of chewing gum and to raise additional revenue from those who cannot do without it to deal with its consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/6">I hope that I can save my hon. Friend the Minister much time by congratulating the Government on their recent record in tackling the menace of chewing gum. I hope that he will spend more time on the future than on the past. He will not need to dwell too long on the Government's excellent Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which defined chewing gum as litter. That has allowed for the issuing of fixed penalty notices to people who spit out their gum or otherwise park it antisocially. However, it would be most helpful if he gave us some idea of the use to which local authorities have put this power. How much money has been collected in on-the-spot fines and what contribution has that made to offsetting the cost of cleaning up chewing gum that has been badly disposed of? I would be most grateful if he wrote to me on that subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/7">I also acknowledge that the Government have created the wondrously named the chewing gum action group, which brings together chewing gum manufacturers, the Local Government Association, the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management, ENCAMS, which runs the &quot;Keep Britain Tidy&quot; campaign, the Improvement and Development Agency, and Departments. Perhaps my hon. Friend Minister can reassure the House that this action group is still in being and say whether and how departmental representation has been affected by the recent Government reorganisation. The action group certainly has plenty of issues to chew over. I hope that this issue has not been parked nicely in the long grass so that people feel that, because there is an action group, no serious long-term practical action needs to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/8">The chewing gum action group's main initiatives so far have been concentrated on education, publicity and advertising campaigns in which a number of local authorities have been pilots and partners, including, I am glad to say, my own city of Nottingham. In exchanges in the House and the other place, Ministers have cited some welcome local successes from those campaigns. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November 2006</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, who was then an Under-Secretary, but is now the Minister of State, Department of Health, informed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1925" name="Neil Turner">my hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Mr. Turner)</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/9" class="indent">&quot;in several pilot cities, where we have worked with local authorities on special education and publicity schemes on chewing gum, we have seen a 37 per cent. reduction in chewing gum litter.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November 2006</phrase>; Vol. 451, c. 453.]</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/10">Earlier that year, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-25">25 February</phrase>, he informed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1407" name="Gregory Barker">the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase> of even more dramatic success in Preston&mdash;a 76 per cent. reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/11">Such successes from education and advertising are highly welcome, but they still leave a vast and intractable problem of chewing gum pollution in every local community. My own city centre in Nottingham is so befouled with gum that one imagines that people there are perhaps not so susceptible to Government advertising as the good people of Preston. The same applies to the centre of London. One has only to walk outside the precincts of the House to see a site of world heritage significance despoiled by chewing gum. Even when the chewing gum is removed, it still leaves a stain. Even after an expensive and time and labour-intensive process, it still leaves that tell-tale mark, unlike a recycled product, which would ultimately be washed away from sight. Even the Houses of Parliament, located in the middle of London, have that problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/12">Ministers have suggested that no fewer than 91 per cent. of our country's high streets are affected by chewing gum and that each local authority spends an average of &pound;13,000 a year clearing it up. That average contains massive variations. Some local authorities agree that they are spending at least &pound;200,000 a year and some, astonishingly, were spending nothing at all. I do not believe that the average expenditure is anything like enough to counteract the damage to the public realm from chewing gum litter, let alone to mitigate the cost to private individuals, particularly some of the most vulnerable members of society.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/13">As Baroness Masham of Ilton mentioned in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October 2006</phrase>, chewing gum regularly gets stuck in the grooves of wheelchairs, pushchairs and prams. To that one might add that bullies often stick chewing gum in the hair of their victims and that chewing gum can harm and even kill wildlife and pets. The new west end company representing Bond street, Oxford street and Regent street says that &pound;5 million has been spent in the past five years in those three streets alone on removing 330,00 deposits of chewing gum in the area&mdash;and it says that it is getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/14">Business, commerce and ordinary members of the public&mdash;pedestrians, mothers with children&mdash;are all well aware of that problem and of the high financial and social cost that this habit is levying on people. The clean-up costs are falling on those who fall victim to the problem, rather than the polluter paying. The &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle&mdash;those who bring in the substances that create deficits, whether in environmental or quality of life terms, should do something about it&mdash;is, for some reason, strangely absent from this area. I hope that the chewing gum action group is not in the pocket of those people who are happy with the current situation and are all for the quiet life.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/15">I hope that this debate gives my hon. Friend the Minister inspiration, if it is needed, and courage, which is not needed by him, to tackle this question seriously. I have raised many important issues in Adjournment debates over several years. The subject of this debate might not be regarded as one of the most important, but there has been more public and media interest in it than in some of the heavier issues on foreign affairs, the long-term welfare of children and the development of early intervention policies in our country. It has struck a chord, so I hope the Minister appreciates that there is a great deal of sympathy with the idea of positive action in relation to manufacturers.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/16">The manufacturers can marshal many arguments, particularly in hole-in-the-corner action groups and Whitehall committees, but I ask the Minister to tread warily around the issue&mdash;no pun intended&mdash;so that he does not to fall foul of it in public opinion terms. From my experience in the past 24 hours, during which the media barely let me have any sleep&mdash;either last night or first thing this morning&mdash;I can say that public opinion is strongly attuned to the issue of our public spaces being fouled and of individual quality of life. I hope that those comments help the Minister when he negotiates a more sensible arrangement than the one that the manufacturers are getting away with.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/17">The costs caused by chewing gum will be with us for a long time. They might be relieved, but they will not be eliminated. The industry needs to be gently nudged towards the biodegradable chewing gum option, which is clean and green. If the industry invested more money, it would be seen as a strong good-will gesture from it and an indication that it takes the issue as seriously as do my constituents and other members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/18">I am concerned that chewing gum manufacturers simply do not have enough financial motive to make the sustained investment in research and new technology that is needed to bring biodegradable gum on to the market. On the contrary, they have every motive to keep chewing gum a cheap and cheerful product that competes with other eye-catching, low-cost confectionery at point of sale and in vending machines.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/19">We have been in similar positions before, however. Unleaded petrol? How outrageous! What a terrible imposition it would be on the oil and petroleum-producing industries. Now, it is second nature, and there are more types of unleaded than of leaded petrol. So the solution is achievable and, despite all the outrage that will greet any proposal from the Minister, I suspect that as soon as the solution becomes common practice we will wonder why we did not adopt it before.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/20">Chewing gum creates a by-product that is both extremely obnoxious and extremely easy to dispose of&mdash;as easy as spitting. At any given moment, thousands of people are chewing gum across our country. It is simply impossible to reach them all before they elect to get rid of their gum. We cannot hope for total success from deterrence by fines and penalties or persuasion from advertising and education. Some people never care what happens to their waste gum, and others who might want to dispose of it in a socially acceptable manner may not find any convenient means of doing so. It is very easy to walk for 10 minutes or more in central London and other cities without finding a litter bin.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/21">That is why I hope that the Government will reconsider the possibility of a special tax on the manufacturers of chewing gum. I am taxed for the clean-up, as are you, Mr. Benton, together with every council tax and income tax payer, but the manufacturers are not&mdash;not directly, at least. Ministers in both Houses have so far gone along with industry lobbying and resisted the taxation proposal. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October 2006</phrase>, Lord Rooker told the other place that the case for a tax had been</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/22" class="indent">&quot;dismissed on the basis that people who are anti-social enough to dispose of gum this way will have their conscience eased on the basis that they have paid for it to be cleaned up. We want them to change their behaviour in the first place.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-31">31 October 2006</phrase>; Vol. 686, c. 153.]</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/23">With respect to my noble Friend the Minister, he is attributing far too active and subtle a conscience to antisocial gum chewers. They have no conscience at all when they choose to dispose of their gum. The only way to deal with them is to deter them from chewing gum at all, and the best way to do that is through taxation.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/24">Chewing gum is a pollutant and we should cut its consumption by telling producers that they have a choice: continue to have their product foul our pavements and our lives&mdash;in which case the polluter must pay, and a special tax should be levied on them&mdash;or be relieved of any duty to pay tax, provided they meet stringent criteria decided on by the Minister and the Government for a proper programme of researching, implementing and producing a biodegradable gum. That would satisfy everybody. The producers would not pay any tax, gum chewers could still chew gum, and people like you and me, Mr. Benton, could walk the streets without fear of the consequences. There would be no detrimental effect on our tolerance of how gum is disposed of, nor any of the accompanying dirt and disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/25">I hope that the Government take that proposal seriously. I do not expect the Minister to say, here and now, &quot;Yes, we will introduce a tax next week.&quot; I hope, however, that, in his own subtle, governmental and civil service-speak, he will make it clear that the options have not been closed off, that it is now time for chewing gum manufacturers to come to the table and get serious, and that there could be longer-term consequences if they do not.</p>
	<p pid="b.137.1/26">The Government are fighting and doing well in a serious war against chewing gum and the resultant pollution. I hope, however, that they will abandon their policy of unilateral disarmament on taxation, and I look forward to the Minister's assurance that they will keep this powerful weapon in their armoury. If my experience in discussing the issue far and wide over the past 48 hours is anything to go by, I can guarantee that the Minister will find tremendous public support for any attempt to get the manufacturers to cease their current approach and join the battle against chewing gum and its polluting effects on the city streets of our nation.</p>

	<p pid="b.141.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> on securing the debate and on highlighting the practical issue of litter from chewing gum. He has told us how interested the media are, which reflects people's concerns, and has given many good examples of how chewing gum affects people's lives, such as in its effects on wheelchairs and prams, and on wildlife. He mentioned bullying too.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/2">If I may, I shall start with a statistic. The local environmental quality survey of England for 2005-06 found chewing gum litter in 96 per cent. of primary retail and commercial sites. That is no surprise to us, so my hon. Friend is right to acknowledge chewing gum as a curse and scourge of every town and city centre, including the area outside the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/3">Chewing gum deposits are not only an annoyance for the unsuspecting user of public transport and for pedestrians; they are also unsightly. My hon. Friend is right that they can be time consuming and expensive to clean up, often requiring specialist equipment. Stains remain for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/4">Local authorities are not duty bound to clean up gum, which explains some of the differing responses that my hon. Friend obtained when he spoke to local authorities about budget allocations. Nevertheless, they often feel compelled to do so, and repeated cleansing is needed to keep an area clean.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/5">As my hon. Friend acknowledged, the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 made it clear that improperly discarded chewing gum, which is not placed in a bin, is included in the definition of litter. Furthermore, the legislation gave local authority enforcement officers power to issue fixed penalty notices to people caught littering, including those caught dropping chewing gum litter. The fine can be set locally and ranges from &pound;50 and &pound;80.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/6">The system is bedding in well. The latest figure for fixed penalty notices issued between April 2006 and March 2007 is 43,624. I know what my hon. Friend would ask me next&mdash;how many were paid?&mdash;but I anticipate him and can say that 77 per cent. of those notices were paid, which means a total of just over &pound;1.5 million. Obviously some people did not pay, but that is not a bad success rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/7">Figures are not available for the exact number of gum-related offences, and I fear that to provide them could prove prohibitively expensive for local authority colleagues who want to focus on clearing up the mess. My hon. Friend will welcome the fact that we have reduced the number of indicators for local authorities to below 200, so that they can get on with the job rather than filling forms. However, it is clear that many local authorities are tackling individuals. The figures speak for themselves. More than 40,000 people have been issued with fines this year alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/8">When it is inappropriate to offer a fixed penalty notice, or if one goes unpaid, prosecution can be taken through the courts, and last year more than 2,000 individuals were take to court. Councils are acting tough, and we need to get that message across. When enforcement is combined with increasing public awareness, the message is increasingly being heard that littering, including gum litter, is not acceptable and that it can have serious consequences, including a criminal record. All this activity should provide a strong disincentive to inappropriate behaviour and send out a clear message that local authorities have an effective vehicle for taking action against those who litter.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/9">I turn to the central argument put forward by my hon. Friend&mdash;that of tax. He suggested that a tax or a levy should be introduced on the sale price on each packet of chewing gum. I certainly appreciate the apparent attractiveness of such a fiscal measure&mdash;as he said, it would be an extension of the &quot;polluter pays&quot; principle&mdash;but as my ministerial colleagues in both Houses have said, it would unfairly penalise the vast majority of consumers. I chew gum, but I do not put it on the ground. I put it in the bin. As my hon. Friend seemed to suggest, it would not do anything to change the behaviour of those who litter&mdash;those who indulge in the antisocial behaviour that he so graphically described.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.0/10">Past suggestions have included levies on chewing gum sales to pay for clean-up. Although it is attractive at face value, it is very difficult to quantify, and it is not possible to target the tax on those who cause the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.143.0/1">My hon. Friend the Minister is generous in giving way. I could not have said this two days ago, but given my crash course on chewing gum over the past 48 hours, I can inform him that there is a biodegradable chewing gum manufacturer in Mostyn in Wales, and that Cork university has people who are well into that sort of work. It is technically and scientifically feasible; indeed, the original gum, chicle, was a vegetable substance. There is a lot to play with if the manufactures want to be serious.</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.143.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12c.143.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-12-12b.143.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1491" speakername="Jonathan R Shaw" colnum="143"  time="016:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071212/halltext/71212h0011.htm#07121273000620">
	<p pid="b.143.1/1">I take my hon. Friend's point. It is essential to manufacturers to have a product that sells. They want to be able to produce a gum that people enjoy. That is an essential part of the equation. As I say, I shall be meeting them and I will discuss the points raised by my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/2">I turn to the chewing gum action group. It is easy to take mirth in the group's title, but its work is serious and it has to have a name. The one it has is probably the most appropriate. The group has been working hard, and I am grateful to officials in my Department and people from the industry for the work that they came together to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/3">I shall quickly give some background for those who do not know it. The group is chaired by a senior Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs official, and it brings together key stakeholders, including the manufacturers of gum, which have provided &pound;650,000 in funding, and others with a key interest such as the Local Government Association and ENCAMS, which runs the &quot;Keep Britain Tidy&quot; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/4">The group has set out to change the attitudes of people who drop gum and to promote positive behaviour and correct disposal. This year and last, the group worked with partner local authorities to run awareness campaigns in 16 areas, and my hon. Friend referred to some of those. Last year, the amount of gum accumulated went down by 38 per cent. overall as a result of those campaigns. This year, with a stronger campaign visual and a clear message on correct disposal, with the threat of a fine, as well as the benefits of experience, the participating councils are expected to build on that success. I will be able to release to those results soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/5">Many local authorities run their own awareness campaigns, and the visual used by the chewing gum action group can be made available on request to anyone who wants to run a campaign. To join up, people can go to our website.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/6">In short, when local authorities make good use of marketing, street cleaning and local engagement and enforcement, they can achieve a good result and improvements in gum litter&mdash;and, no doubt, in related matters. All that clearly demonstrates that behaviour can be influenced positively, and it provides an alternative to a tax. As I said, we do not want to tax people who do not drop litter.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/7">I have also responded to my hon. Friend's suggestion on the development of biodegradable products, which we all want to see, although the manufacturers clearly need to make one that we enjoy chewing.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/8">To sum up, we all recognise that gum litter is a problem in many areas. Local authorities have tools to deal with perpetrators, including the use of fixed penalty notices and prosecution for litter offences. Local authorities prepared to take the initiative have seen a reduction in gum litter from a combination of targeted campaigning, street cleansing, support activities and effective enforcement. We expect even better results from the chewing gum action group's awareness campaigns this year, and we will release the figures soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/9">In 2006, campaign areas saw an average decrease in chewing gum litter of 38 per cent. This is an issue for local authorities and for all citizens. It causes mess and inconvenience. We have made some progress, but nowhere near enough. If I was to walk down Victoria street with my hon. Friend, we would see gum covering the pavements. That is unacceptable, and we will continue to do what we can. We have given local authorities some tools, and we need to ensure that the chewing gum action group makes more significant progress so that we can see an end to such litter on our streets.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/10">In the not too distant future, I hope that we can look back and say that today we made some progress&mdash;that we started the public debate here, raised awareness of the matter and achieved some conclusions. I thank my hon. Friend for initiating the debate and for how he made his arguments.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/11" class="italic">Question put and agreed to</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/12" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at ten minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
