<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0001.htm#09063046000469">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">I am glad to have an opportunity to return to a subject on which I have introduced several debates in the last few years, including one six months ago and an Opposition day debate a year ago. The subject is immensely important because, of all the victims of recession and economic crisis, the people who have the greatest difficulty are those who lose not only their job, but their home, with all the consequences that has for family distress, local homelessness and the availability of emergency and social housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">Two things have happened in the last six months that merit a return to the subject. First, the Government have introduced a wide range of measures, many of which we on these Benches, and indeed other hon. Members, called for. Citizens Advice, Shelter and other organisations acknowledged that such measures have had a positive impact. A lot has been done in the form of the pre-action protocol, the income support for mortgage interest scheme, the mortgage protection scheme and the homeowners mortgage support scheme. I propose to review the progress of those schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">From the outset, I acknowledge that many initiatives have been introduced. However, some have been more successful that others. The mortgage protection scheme has not been particularly successful. I understand that the latest monthly figures on that so far rather embarrassing scheme were due to appear this morning; in fact, I think they were to be published at midnight. If I were a conspiracy theorist, which I am not, I would wonder why they did not appear before this debate. We shall no doubt hear how that scheme is progressing. There is a lot to report, and I hope that the Minister will be able to update us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">The other reason for reviewing the matter after a period of months is to take a rain check on what is happening with underlying trends as the schemes affect repossession and its consequences. In the short run, there is some good news in that the Council of Mortgage Lenders has revised downwards its estimate of the number of people who are likely to be repossessed this year from, I think, 75,000 to 65,000. It acknowledges that that is at least partly because of the intervention of Government schemes. There is also a worry that although such schemes are stabilising the position in the very short term, we are storing up even bigger problems for next year and the year after.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5">In periods of recession, many things happen on a time lag; for example, unemployment lags behind the economy in general. Unemployment continues to rise, and the problems of repossession and arrears lag behind unemployment, so we are dealing with something that has a very long fuse. Many people who deal with housing needs are worried that the problem will deteriorate badly next year and the year after. There are several reasons for believing that, one of which is that, even if the economy were to recover in a conventional sense, we would expect interest rates to rise. The fact that we have historically low interest rates&mdash;at least at base rate level&mdash;is one of things that is alleviating the problem at the moment. That is not something on which we can continue to count.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">In addition, what seems to be happening through the pre-action protocol and other interventions is that many of the problems are being damned up. Good practice and forbearance by the courts and mortgage lenders are rightly keeping some of the problems at bay, but eventually they will have to be dealt with. There will be a flood of repossessions when the delays are worked through. The Government's schemes are temporary, and there is a concern about what will happen when that period ends.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7">Some interesting and slightly worrying analysis has been conducted by a man called Mr. Shepherdson, who was the former chief economist at HSBC. He believes that, taking all those factors into account, repossessions may well be at more than 100,000 a year by 2011. There is a worrying level of delayed reaction. It is useful to have this debate at this stage because we can flag up that problem in advance and be clear about whether the Government have thought through their emergency actions and what has to happen next.</p>

	<p pid="a.2.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has raised a crucial matter and he is absolutely right: it is timely that we consider it now because of the importance of a stitch in time. It is right to try to prevent avoidable repossessions&mdash;in the interest not just of individuals and their families, but society as a whole. The Government have introduced some schemes, but pre-repossession protocol is only a discretionary requirement on judges. Does he agree with me and the content of early-day motion 34 in saying that we should encourage the Government to put that protocol on a statutory footing, so that we know it exists and judges will have to obey it? That will mean that we can avoid repossessions where possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">That is certainly true, and many of us are aware that unemployment levels have doubled or more in our constituencies&mdash;albeit from a low level, but the increase has been alarming. The hon. Gentleman is also right that towns and cities in the east midlands are often the most affected. He mentioned his constituency but I believe that Northampton, Peterborough, Derby, Nottingham and Lincoln, for reasons that are not totally clear, appear to be affected worse than other parts of the country. I would guess that there was a temporary over-supply, and that private developers were too aggressive and underestimated the potential extent of a downturn in the market. He is right to draw attention to local variations.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/2">Perhaps I could proceed from that point to review each of the elements in the Government's intervention one by one. As I acknowledged at the outset, they have cumulatively had an impact and have generally been welcomed by people who deal with homelessness and the consequences of repossession.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/3">The pre-action protocol was something that my colleagues and I specifically called for more than a year ago. I recall asking the Prime Minister about it in the Chamber. The Government have delivered a programme that gives the courts guidance to ensure that mortgage lenders take proper account of the circumstances of the borrower. It requires lenders to look at other options, involves financial advice and treats repossession as a last resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/4">So far, there are some positive indications about the operation of the programme. The majority of judges appear to be taking it into account. There is feedback from a survey done by Shelter and Citizens Advice that more than half the mainstream lenders have adjusted their lending behaviour to take account of the improved court procedure, although, regrettably, only 20 per cent. of sub-prime loans invoke such a response. Having said those positive things about what has happened so far, it is fair to acknowledge that there are serious limitations with the scheme. Many of us hope that the Government will build on what they have already done.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/5">First, lenders do not respond at all in a significant number of cases. That is particularly true in the sub-prime area, but not exclusively so. There appears to be no provision to deal with lenders who are wilfully non-compliant. Some lenders take no notice whatever of guidance from judges. They press for repossession and make no effort to help their struggling borrowers. What is probably required is a fresh round of guidance from the Government as to how to deal with non-compliant behaviour by lenders. Perhaps the Minister in his reply could give us some indication as to whether there will be any follow-up action.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/6">Under that general heading, there is an acknowledgment that the pre-action protocol has exposed serious weakness in mortgage law in some key areas. Colleagues and others may wish to develop that point. There are two problems in particular. One is the extent to which a large number of borrowers are now exposed to repossession as a result of second charges, many of them for fairly trivial amounts of consumer borrowing, yet they face the loss of their home. The lack of protection in that area is palpable.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/7">Then there is the kind of case that many of us are encountering in our constituencies in which there is default on a buy-to-let mortgage not by the resident but by the property owner. Large-scale default is taking place in the case of buy-to-let mortgages, and many tenants are being thrown out of their property at short notice. The Government have given some indication that they are preparing to legislate to provide more protection. It would be useful if the Minister were to give some indication about how and when that is due to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1514" name="Colin Breed">the Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed)</phrase> suggested in the context of the Banking Bill a particular formulation for a new legislative framework to help buy-to-let tenants. Have the Government had an opportunity to review it, and how do they react to it as a legislative proposition?</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/9">To summarise, the initiative has been welcome, but there are severe limitations, and, of course, it has built up a pipeline of arrears cases without necessarily solving them.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/10">Secondly, we move on to the mess of the mortgage rescue scheme, which is probably the least successful of the Government initiatives. The concept is an attractive one: enabling people to stay in their home as tenants or in a shared ownership arrangement. That is much preferable to existing rent-back arrangements in which some private landlords behave in a somewhat disreputable way towards people who have entered informal rent-back arrangements that are not properly regulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/11">In theory, the Government's scheme is attractive and we should welcome it. When it was introduced, we were told that it had the potential to help some 6,000 people. At the end of April, only two applications had been approved, which I know is a source of some embarrassment. Is the Minister in a position to tell us what the number is as of this morning? Numbers were supposed to have appeared today.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/12">There are two big problems with the scheme as the Government are currently administering it. One is extreme complexity. All the financial advisers who have guided people with arrears problems into it have reported that whereas a private rent-back arrangement probably takes about a week to set up, which may be because some operators cut corners, the Government's scheme appears to involve a five-month process, which is extraordinary. It is excessively legalistic, and I wonder what the Government are doing to streamline the exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.4.0/13">The other problem area is the one that we have already heard about from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, which is that many families are excluded by a tight definition of homelessness. I have written to the Minister for Housing about a particularly bad case in my constituency of a father who has predominant responsibility for a daughter, but in the messy, complex arrangements that now exist for families that are breaking up, not full responsibility. He is not protected under the council's&mdash;ultimately, the Government's &mdash;definition of homelessness. What are the Government doing to make their definition of accessibility to the scheme more flexible? Clearly, there have to be some limits, but can they be applied more sensitively to make people in real need eligible for the scheme?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.7.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="7"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0001.htm#09063046000479">
	<p pid="a.7.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is quite right. An Office of Fair Trading review of payment protection insurance established that there was substantial overcharging in many cases, and poor consumer protection arrangements. The fact that people did not take out such policies is understandable.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/2">If we in this country continue our preoccupation of ensuring that as many people as possible are owner-occupiers, perhaps we should try to ensure that in future mortgage borrowers are insured through a market mechanism of some kind. I was going to mention that later, but perhaps this is a suitable point at which to do so. Some interesting proposals are flying around. One is based on the Canadian model of pooled insurance&mdash;pooled guarantees&mdash;and another, called the home sale guarantee scheme, is being seriously considered. I hope that the Government are taking that matter seriously. The underlying philosophy of all those proposals is that an element of guarantee and insurance has to be involved in mortgages. The existing payment protection insurance schemes are not working, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire rightly says.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/3">In conclusion, I shall move on from the four schemes that the Government have introduced and look a little bit further forward and discuss how the underlying problems will be addressed. Repossession is only really a problem because of the underlying lack of available housing, particularly social housing. If social housing was freely available, repossession would not be the tragedy and disaster it currently is. Are the Government, working with the charitable bodies, doing any research at the moment on what happens to people who become repossessed? I do not think that any of us know where those people actually go, although anecdotal evidence suggests that most of them go into the private rented sector, which of course presents problems of its own. Many people go into the private rented sector because they can then get housing benefit, which they found more difficult to get as owner-occupiers, but many of them are still in considerable difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/4">There is still an issue about how to ensure greater availability of affordable housing in the long term. Yesterday, the Prime Minister, in his statement, gave an indication that more money will be brought forward, stitched together from various other departmental budgets, to increase the availability of social housing. That is welcome, as far as it goes. I understand that the Housing Minister is due to make a statement this week indicating that councils will have greater flexibility in their housing revenue accounts, to enable them to build more council houses of a traditional kind. Will the Minister confirm that that is correct? Will we have a statement about it and will the Government move on the issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/5">Another development is taking place on which it would be useful to hear the Minister's thoughts. I understand that the biggest leap forward in the housing supply is now likely to happen in the form of institutional private investors&mdash;pension funds and insurance funds&mdash;putting their money into private rented accommodation, some of which could then be managed by local authorities or other registered social landlords, with a share of property being available for social renting, much as we have had through owner-occupier developments in the past. Do the Government welcome that trend? Are they looking at the role that social landlords can play in collaborative arrangements with private developers producing private rented property? Have they thought through some of the legal implications? Is it part of Government long-term planning?</p>
	<p pid="a.7.1/6">My concluding thought is that the Government have introduced some useful initiatives. They have undoubtedly alleviated the threat of repossession for probably thousands of people, but in many cases the problems are being postponed. We are building up a crisis that will probably reach maturity in a year or two. I want to use this debate primarily to persuade the Government to think ahead rather than looking back, and to consider how to deal with the problem when the crisis builds up in magnitude, as it surely will.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.8.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" speakername="Sarah Teather" colnum="8"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0002.htm#09063046000481">
	<p pid="a.8.1/1">I presume that hon. Members will stay and intervene, or the relatively new Minister will have to make an extremely long speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on a thoughtful and helpful contribution. He has been at the forefront of raising the issue over a number of years, and I am sure that the Minister's predecessor recognises that that has been extremely helpful in pressing the Government to make it an important priority. My hon. Friend said that his purpose was to review progress and to encourage the Government to think long term, which is important. I acknowledge that some of their actions have been helpful, but it is vital to look ahead and not merely to think about how to get through the next nine months before the general election. Whatever policies are put in place must help people in 2011 or 2012 when some of the problems will, unfortunately, still be working their way through the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/3">I wholly agree with my hon. Friend's analysis. The Council of Mortgage Lenders has downgraded its prediction of the number of repossessions, largely because of low interest rates, but some of the Government's interventions have helped. However, we are storing up difficulties, particularly because, as he said, we have the long fuse of unemployment. I am certainly seeing that in my constituency where we were not particularly affected by the first round of redundancies in the City, but later redundancies in the retail sector have had an effect. During the next 12 or 18 months, that will work through into other sectors, such as architecture and building. The problems are working their way through the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/4">There has been an impact in areas with high migrant populations. Many Polish workers have gone home, and that has had an impact on the rental market, which has then had an impact on those with buy-to-let mortgages. Some of those problems are also working their way through, and it could be another 12 months before we see the full extent of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">The hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> spoke about his constituency and negative equity. Although many families are in negative equity, it affects certain areas in particular. For many people, it will have no impact because property prices may rise again and they may have no intention of moving, but if they come off a fixed-rate mortgage and interest rates rise, people who have been accustomed to switching their mortgage to get the best deal may not be able to do so. If they are still in negative equity and interest rates continue to rise, a further wave of people may get into arrears and difficulties leading to repossession.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/6">My hon. Friend spoke about other aspects of borrowing, particularly on credit cards. Many people who face difficulties with arrears are juggling their finances by borrowing on credit cards. Credit card companies often shout loudest, and those who get into difficulties with their credit cards often face repossession sooner because they prioritise paying off their credit card instead of dealing with their mortgage, which is more important to their security because it affects their home.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/7">The Government have introduced a plethora of schemes, many of which are welcome, but many are small and target particular groups. Even with the CML's downgrading in the number of repossessions, we are still likely to see 65,000 repossessions this year, and if my hon. Friend's more gloomy predictions are correct, in a year or so that number may rise again to 100,000. An enormous number of people will fall through the net of the Government's different schemes. The mortgage rescue scheme, which I will return to, was intended to help only 6,000 people, which is a drop in the ocean of the number of people who face repossession. It has failed to help almost everyone to whom help was promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/8">I agree with my hon. Friend that ISMI has been the most successful scheme and certainly the most welcome, and its extension to an earlier stage is important for many people who face difficulties, but it does not help those with savings of &pound;16,000 or those who have a partner who is working. If two people are paying the mortgage and one is made redundant, they are not eligible for ISMI. The Minister may say that other schemes can help, but the patchwork of schemes help small groups of people and there are enormous holes in the net through which people are falling. Many banks&mdash;perhaps 50 per cent. of lenders&mdash;are not signed up to the mortgage support scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/9">The fact that the mortgage rescue scheme has helped only two families so far is laughable, and I hope that the Minister agrees that it is ridiculous to have a scheme that is so tightly drawn that we ration through bureaucracy rather than the amount of money that is available to help people. We must make the scheme considerably more flexible. Because of the cap on the overall level of borrowing, councils such as Islington have made use of the Government's scheme, but have supplemented it with their own finance to ensure that people in areas with high property prices are eligible. I hope that the Minister will say more about that, because in the long term it may not be sustainable, particularly for councils in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/10">My hon. Friend spoke about the tight definition of homelessness, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> also mentioned. The scheme is targeted at those who would meet the council criteria of homelessness, which all MPs know leaves an enormous number of people in difficulties. A lone man, for example, would be outside the category, and most people would be classed as being intentionally homeless. The Government must try to make the scheme more flexible so that people do not have their hopes raised only to find, three or four months into the application process, that they are not eligible. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase> told me that a constituent had spent months on the application process, having been told at the beginning that she would be eligible, and stored up arrears during the process, only to find at the last minute that she was not eligible for the scheme. The problem was worse than it would have been had she not applied in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/11">The pre-action protocol contains most of the interventions and criteria for which we have been arguing, but it lacks teeth. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Twickenham and the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> said that although it is welcome and helpful, the courts do not have the legal power to intervene and to enforce the protocol. If a lender defaults on anything in the protocol, the courts can do nothing. I have been pressing the Government for some time to accept that mortgage law reform would be more sensible, and much of the detail could be put into guidance. Shelter has been arguing that we should also reform mortgage law to deal with tenants in buy-to-let properties. If we merely gave courts the power to intervene, many of the other issues could be put into guidance; it is not necessary to put everything into primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/12">Mortgage law is incredibly outdated&mdash;it is mired in its 18th and 19th-century common law origins&mdash;and the Financial Services Authority is not doing enough to regulate poor practice. As my hon. Friend mentioned, many mortgages are not covered by the FSA. Second charge mortgages and any mortgage entered into before October 2004 are not regulated through the FSA. That applies to buy-to-let mortgages as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/13">We also still have foreclosure on the books. That remedy has no place in modern mortgage law and I hope that the Minister agrees. It may be little used, but the mere fact that it is still available, especially at a time when we face many more repossessions, is a reason in itself for the Government to amend mortgage law. By dealing with that issue, they could do a great deal to help the people who will fall through the net in the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/14">I mentioned that changes in employment practice, particularly in areas with many rented properties, affect people who have bought to let. As I said, I have seen that in my constituency. Many Polish workers have gone home in the past two or three months, so many rented properties have been left empty for months at a time and many landlords are getting into arrears. Many of those people have bought the property on a buy-to-let basis. They are not necessarily big developers; they may have bought only one property, perhaps as an investment for their pension fund. They are most likely to have done so through a sub-prime mortgage. It is one thing if the property is empty, but if the property is then let and the landlord is still in difficulty, the first that the tenant knows about that, unfortunately, may be when they come home to find the locks changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.1/15">The Minister's predecessor said that he was keen to act on that issue, but the Government have not acted on it yet. Many tenants are finding themselves in that difficulty and it is an urgent problem. I hope that the Government will not delay further in acting for tenants of buy-to-let properties. As I said, the most sensible way to deal with the problem would be to give the courts the power to intervene. They could then enforce a notice period at the point of repossession so that families had an opportunity to look for other property. It is also important that we ensure that lenders send unaddressed notices to the property as many times as possible to raise awareness of the situation among tenants. Of course, many lenders may not be aware that the property is being let. Unfortunately, people often let a property without the lender's permission and then they get into difficulty later, so what I have described has to be done at the stage of repossession. I hope that the Government will consider reforming mortgage law so that that happens.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.12.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1771" speakername="Justine Greening" colnum="12"  time="010:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0002.htm#09063046000484">
	<p pid="a.12.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing this debate on an incredibly important topic. As I am sure he is aware, the Opposition have recently held two debates on housing to raise similar issues on the Floor of the House, because we too feel that we need to put a stake in the ground to ensure that the Ministers who are taking decisions think about the problems that constituents up and down the country face daily.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/2">Whenever the country is in a recession, people have two fundamental worries. They are worried about losing their job and they are worried about losing their home. That is ultimately what things boil down to. I will talk about some of the underlying issues as to how we can support the economy and support housing, but the main subject of the debate is the Government schemes that have been introduced and whether they are working effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/3">Clearly, there is a massive problem of repossessions. Although, as we have heard, the Council of Mortgage Lenders has just revised its forecast for the number of homes that it expects to be repossessed in 2009 from 75,000 to 65,000, that is still 65,000 families throughout the country whom the CML feels will lose their homes by the end of the year. It is still a massive number.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/4">In addition, Shelter has said that it is seeing a huge rise in the number of families and people coming to talk to Shelter about mortgage arrears. There has been a 250 per cent. increase in the number of queries to its free helpline in the past year and an 85 per cent. rise in the number of calls it receives about repossession specifically. When I met representatives of Shelter last week, they raised concerns, much as the hon. Member for Twickenham did, about the fact that we should be very careful not to regard announcements such as the one by the Council of Mortgage Lenders projecting a lower level of repossessions than previously forecast as a kind of respite or message that the storm is passing.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/5">One has only to read today's papers to see that many commentators are raising the prospect of a &quot;W recession&quot;, which makes sense in terms of repossessions in many respects. Many of the repossessions that we have seen do not involve people who have lost their jobs and fallen behind on their payments&mdash;we may not have reached that stage yet. The repossessions that we have seen often involve people who have taken out highly geared mortgages&mdash;perhaps more than 100 per cent.&mdash;as part of fixed-rate, short-term deals. When the credit crunch happened, those deals came to an end, and people were unable to find similarly good deals to keep their mortgage payments at the same level. They saw massive rises in their mortgage payments at a time when they could least afford it.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/6">Indeed, the retail prices index of inflation was also high last year, and a lot of our debates in this place were about the rapidly rising cost of living. On top of that, the subsection of people I am talking about saw their mortgage payments rise and they struggled, but ultimately failed, to find deals that were as good as those that they had found a few years earlier, when lenders were still happy to build their mortgage books through aggressive lending. As we have seen, such business models led many lenders into huge trouble and ultimately to come to the British taxpayer to be bailed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/7">We should be careful to see the problems of those different groups of people as having fundamentally separate causes. One group got good, highly geared mortgage deals, but could not find the same deal a couple of years later when their short-term rate came to an end. More worryingly perhaps, the other cohort&mdash;many commentators, including Shelter, have flagged this up&mdash;involves the more traditional repossessions that we see in a recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/8">As we have heard, repossessions are often a lag indicator, alongside unemployment. Unemployment has risen dramatically, and all sorts of forecasters, including the OECD, expect it to continue to rise dramatically. We have only to walk down our local high streets and parades of shops to see that small businesses are increasingly under pressure. We hear an awful lot on the news about big companies shutting down with large job losses, but, underneath all that, a plethora of other jobs are being lost every day of the week because small firms are going out of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/9">There is a worrying rise in repossessions, and we should be cautious not to assume that the recent downgrading of the forecast for this year will be the end of the story. If interest rates rise again, a range of fresh pressures&mdash;not least job losses and interest rate rises&mdash;may, unfortunately, put more pressures on families who are finding it hard to keep up their mortgage repayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/10">Of course, my party welcomes any measures that can be introduced to help families navigate their way through what is the most stressful experience for any family&mdash;the prospect of losing their home. We have already heard comments about the schemes that the Government have introduced, but it is only right that I should add my comments as the Opposition spokesman.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/11">Obviously, the mortgage rescue scheme has been disappointing. It was announced with much fanfare in September 2008. It is a substantial &pound;285 million scheme, which aims to help 6,000 families. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> said, help for 6,000 families is obviously welcome, but we are talking about a comparatively small proportion of those affected&mdash;probably less than 10 per cent. of even the reduced figure for repossessions that the CML is forecasting for this year. Furthermore, 6,000 is the number who are to be helped over two years, although the latest figures that we have&mdash;I hope the Minister can update us&mdash;show that just two families have been helped after four months, which is disappointing.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/12">It is clear from the debate that if we are serious about introducing schemes to help people stay in their homes, we have to understand how those schemes work and whether they work effectively. The mortgage rescue scheme seems to involve a huge amount of bureaucracy, which is the message that comes through whether one talks to local authorities or, as I have, to constituents who are looking at whether they are eligible. The message is that the process is lengthy and complicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/13">When we raised these issues in a debate a couple of weeks ago, it was surprising to hear that the Government do not seem to keep that many statistics. Who will be able to take advantage of the mortgage rescue scheme? Who is in the pipeline? Where in the country are they? How many people are close to being able to access the scheme? Unless we are willing to track its performance more meaningfully, it is difficult to find out whether it is working effectively, and we end up finding out that it is not working only four months down the track, when we see that just two families have been helped. We all want these schemes to work, so I hope that the Minister can talk a little more about how the Government will monitor the mortgage rescue scheme's effectiveness and whether they plan to review it. That would be very much appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/14">The mortgage support scheme was announced in December 2008, but it was not launched until April 2009&mdash;four or five months later. We have flagged up our concerns about whether lenders that should have signed up to the scheme have actually done so. We need more transparency on that from Ministers. As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, key lenders, including some building societies, are not signed up. That is deeply worrying. We would like to hear from the Minister which lenders are still not signed up and what efforts the Government are making to encourage them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/15">Hon. Members have commented on the pre-action protocol, but I want to make some slightly different observations about how it is working. The protocol could help, but the way in which different lenders deal with their customers is hugely variable. This has not been discussed today, but I would like to hear from the Minister about the extent to which the Government are looking at the role of the FSA and the &quot;treating customers fairly&quot; regime, which, as he will be aware, has just been subsumed into the FSA's general ARROW&mdash;advanced, risk-responsive operating framework&mdash;assessment of lenders. I would also like to know whether arrears are being effectively dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/16">I have asked parliamentary questions to find out whether the &quot;treating customers fairly&quot; regime was up and running and to find out about the ARROW assessments, which that regime is now part of. Is it the FSA's judgment that banks are behaving fairly? The picture is very opaque. Does the Minister feel that there should be more transparency about what the FSA is looking at and about its views? I understand that two lenders are on the ARROW watch list following assessments by the FSA, but it is impossible to find out which two. The more data there are in the public domain, the better able customers will be to decide whether they want to transact with certain companies in the future. Most people who get a mortgage will want to know that the lender will be there for them not just in the good times, when they want a good deal, but in the bad times, when they need help.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/17">We have also talked about the ISMI scheme. Again, the fact that it is now available earlier is welcome, but there are concerns about eligibility and accessibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/18">To conclude, the real solution to the problem of repossessions is to get the economy back up and running. In particular, I urge Ministers to support small businesses around Britain, because they are most vulnerable to the recession we find ourselves in. We have been urging the Government to consider the steps they can take to help small businesses, such as reducing national insurance for the smallest businesses, enabling them to defer paying VAT, and simplifying their capital allowances structure so that we can reduce the small companies rate of corporation tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/19">Will the Minister take a careful look at how business rate rises affect small companies? If we can keep them going, or help them to keep themselves going, that is the best way to stop repossessions, because it will keep people in jobs. It is when people lose their jobs that they become most susceptible to losing their homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/20">Given the debate that is taking place in the House today, I urge the Minister to tell us more about the housing announcements that we have been hearing about. As the hon. Member for Twickenham said, affordability underpins the entire issue. The reason why many people have had such huge and highly geared mortgages that now, in an economic recession, they find it hard to continue paying is the fact that lack of housing stock pushed up prices. There are fewer housing starts in Britain now than at any time since the 1920s.</p>
	<p pid="a.12.0/21">Every year since the Government have been in office less social housing has been built than in the past 18 years. That is disappointing. A range of Government measures is needed, and the Opposition have made proposals to ensure that starting rates of social housing will go back up. That will make sure that there is more affordable housing. Supporting housing and jobs is the best way, in the longer term, to minimise the underlying risk of repossessions, whatever the economic weather.</p>

	<p pid="a.15.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr. Amess. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> on securing this important debate and thank all the hon. Members who have taken part; I shall try to respond to the points that they made. It was a pleasure to listen to the hon. Gentleman's speech and it is a privilege to be replying to someone who has won the respect of Members in all parts of the House and, much more importantly, of members of the public. In this debate he has displayed the sure-footedness and nimble feet that we would expect from Westminster's best known ballroom dancer, and the depth of knowledge and thoughtfulness of someone who has been contributing to the economic debate in this country for probably more than 30 years, as a special adviser to previous Governments, in local government, as a senior economist in the private sector and now, of course, as one of the leading figures on his party's Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/2">As you can imagine, Mr. Amess, in preparing for the debate, I wanted to see whether among the dozens of publications in the hon. Gentleman's name there was anything written by him on housing. I can report that he has gone from contributing to the &quot;Red Paper on Scotland&quot; in the 1970s to the Green Book more recently, and seems to have covered every other subject on earth in between, from &quot;Regulating Modern Capitalism&quot; to &quot;Globalization: Rules and Standards for the World Economy&quot;. He wrote &quot;The Role of Handicrafts Exports: Problems and Prospects Based on Indian Experience&quot; and even &quot;Evaluation of the Multifibre Arrangement and negotiating options&quot;, which sounds like a riveting read, and which I look forward to reading if he will lend me a copy. Unfortunately, I have to report that I could not find anything on housing, but I think that we would all agree that he has more than made up for that this morning in the second debate on the issue that he has secured this year. I am grateful to him for that because it gives me the chance to report on the progress that has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/3">In these difficult times, as Members of all parties have pointed out, families need extra support and help. They need a Government who are on their side, providing help for them to stay in their homes and to avoid repossession at every stage, from free debt advice at the moment when problems start, to free legal advice at courts throughout England on the day of the repossession hearing. The Government have an excellent track record on preventing homelessness and have acted decisively to help households struggling with their mortgages to ensure that, wherever possible, they are able to remain in their homes. We can all imagine the horror of losing one's home and the devastating impact that that must have, so I reassure the House, and families throughout the country, that we are determined to help as much as possible. I promise that we will do everything in our power to ensure that no household demonstrating to the bank a willingness to pay must face the fear of repossession of the family home.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/4">Households must clearly talk to their lenders as soon as possible if they are facing financial difficulties. Since the autumn, we have put in place a framework of protections and universal help, as well as targeted schemes for households in different circumstances. We have enhanced help through the benefit system, and we have put in place the mortgage rescue scheme, which hon. Members have discussed, and the innovative homeowners mortgage support guarantee scheme. The legal protections for homeowners have been strengthened so that lenders can repossess their home only as a last resort, and options to help them stay in their home must be explored first. Lenders are required to treat borrowers fairly, so people should not be afraid to talk to them as soon as they think they are going to have difficulties making payments. There is free, independent advice on the help available to keep them in their home. That is markedly different from the delayed reaction in the 1990s, when lenders were relied on to respond, without financial support and leadership from Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/5">I want to emphasise the importance of looking at the package of help that we are providing as a whole, to appreciate the positive impact that it is already having. Every repossession is a tragedy for the family, and all the figures and statistics will be no consolation to those who are affected, but it is still worth pointing out that the current figures provided by the Council of Mortgage Lenders show that the number of repossessions in 2008 represents about 0.34 per cent. of all loans. That means that, despite the fact that more than 1 million more households now own their own home, the numbers affected are proportionately smaller than in the 1990s. The CML has already said that its forecast of 75,000 repossessions this year looks pessimistic in light of Government intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/6">In answer to the question from the hon. Member for Twickenham, the Government are working with Shelter, the National Debtline and the CML to research what happens to households post-repossession. That is part of a package of work agreed through the Home Finance Forum. The CML has also reduced its figure for repossessions, and that revision is a direct result of the action we have taken, in combination with low interest rates and other actions to support the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/7">I want to talk a little more about the universal and targeted help that we are providing, and the impact that that is having in helping people to keep their homes. The first step to avoiding repossession will be forbearance by the lender and the opportunity for a household struggling with a mortgage to agree more manageable monthly payments. Most people who are facing difficulties will be able to agree a solution with their lender. We have put in place Financial Services Authority regulation of lenders, which, since 2004, requires lenders to treat customers fairly, and to treat repossession as a last resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/8">FSA regulation is supported by the new mortgage pre-action protocol, introduced in November 2008. That sets out clear guidance to the judiciary on what steps the courts expect lenders to take before bringing a claim in the courts. That ensures that lenders have discussed other alternatives with the borrower. There are early signs that the protocol is having a positive impact. More borrowers are approaching lenders earlier to discuss options, and Ministry of Justice figures show a 42 per cent. drop in mortgage repossession claims issued in the first quarter of 2009, compared with the first quarter of 2008. We have also provided extra funding for debt advice, including a &pound;6 million additional investment in National Debtline telephone advice, to March 2011, which will help up to 70,000 people per year who are suffering from debt problems, and &pound;10 million to Citizens Advice, to March 2010, to expand face-to-face debt advice capacity and so help an additional 500,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.0/9">Even at the latest stage, when a possession case has reached court, repossession is not inevitable, and getting advice and support can help households to remain in their home. We now have universal access to advice desks in courts in England, providing free, on-the-day legal advice and representation to people facing repossession or eviction hearings.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.0/1">May I take the Minister back to his earlier comments? He will be aware that the Treating Customers Fairly initiative, which was supposed to become mandatory in December, has been embedded in the ARROW core supervisory assessment. That is all well and good, but the by-product is that we did not discover in December whether lenders had complied with the initiative. Will he give us an update? Did lenders comply with that regime before it was subsumed into the core supervisory work?</p>

	<p pid="a.18.1/1">I shall provide more details later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/2">Even at the later stage, when cases reach court, repossession is not inevitable, as there is advice and support to help households remain in their homes. People now have universal access to advice desks in courts throughout England, which provide free legal advice and representation to those facing repossession. Last year, more than 34,000 households accessed that free advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/3">Depending on their circumstances, households may benefit from a range of schemes to reduce their monthly mortgage payments to a level that they can afford. We have put support in place through the benefits system; that includes support for mortgage interest, or SMI, payments being made to customers' mortgage interest payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/4">In January, we extended the scheme to provide even greater support for home owners. We doubled the capital limit for loans to &pound;200,000; we reduced the waiting period so that households now receive help 13 weeks after claiming benefits; and we froze the standard interest rate used to calculate the amount of SMI awardable to customers at 6.08 per cent until December 2009. Some 220,000 households benefited from SMI last year, and we expect up to 10,000 extra households to benefit from further changes over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/5">We have put in place a mortgage rescue scheme, under which the local authority can step in, over two years, to support some of the most vulnerable households facing repossession, allowing them to remain in their homes. A housing association will buy an equity stake in the property to reduce mortgage repayments to a manageable level, or buy the property in full and rent it back to the household at a lower than market rent. The scheme has been available from all participating local authorities since <phrase class="date" code="2009-01-01">1 January 2009</phrase>, following the successful fast-tracked delivery of the scheme in nearly 80 authorities last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/6">I reassure the hon. Member for Twickenham that he can do away with his conspiracy theories. However, he might want a quicker researcher. The figures were published at 9.30 am today. They show that more than 5,000 households struggling with their mortgage received free advice from their local authority in the five months from January. By the end of May, more than 200 households had benefited under the mortgage rescue scheme, which stops the immediate threat of repossession and freezes charges, and a further 295 households are at the assessment stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/7">We are now focusing intensively on ramping up take-up and accelerating processing times. We are determined to ensure that help through the mortgage rescue scheme is available to all who need it. We are listening closely to feedback from our delivery partners, money advice agencies, local authorities and registered social landlords, and we are responding flexibly. We have already amended the scheme to include second-charge loans and households in negative equity. We will continue to keep the scheme under review.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.19.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1553" speakername="Ian Austin" colnum="19"  time="010:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0003.htm#09063046000493">
	<p pid="a.19.5/1">I do not have those details with me, but I shall check. If we can make them available, we will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/2">Financial help is available from local authorities, with the &pound;20 million for the preventing repossession fund that was announced at the last Budget. It will enable local authorities to offer households small loans to prevent repossession or eviction. The fund is available to anyone threatened with homelessness through repossession or eviction. For example, it could be used to clear mortgage or second-charge arrears in appropriate cases if it prevented repossession. Financial assistance through small loans will allow money to be recycled, which can help other households in the local authority area.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/3">Homelessness prevention funds have played an integral part since 2003 in the fall of over 60 per cent. in the number of households being accepted as homeless. We also launched the homeowners mortgage support in April, to help homeowners remain in their homes if they fall on difficult times. The scheme enables eligible borrowers to reduce their monthly interest payments to affordable levels for up to two years to help them get back on track with their finances if they suffer a temporary income shock. All lenders offering HMS will have the financial backing of a Government-backed guarantee that will protect the lender if the customer ultimately defaults on the mortgage.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/4">The hon. Member for Twickenham asked for details of the lenders involved in that scheme. Lenders covering about 80 per cent. of the mortgage market are now providing enhanced support for those of their customers who may be facing difficulties. Lenders offering HMS from <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-21">21 April</phrase> include the major high-street lenders Lloyds banking group, which includes HBOS and Northern Rock; the Royal Bank of Scotland, which includes NatWest, the Ulster Bank and Bradford and Bingley; Cumberland building society; and the National Australia Bank Group, which includes Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks and Standard Life.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/5">A number of other major banks, building societies and specialist lenders have confirmed that they will offer their customers HMS as soon as possible. They include the Bank of Ireland, which includes Bristol and West and the Post Office; GMAC Financial Services; GE Money, which was referred to by the hon. Gentleman; and Kensington Mortgage company. All lenders offering HMS will have the backing of a Government guarantee to protect the lender if the customer ultimately defaults. Four other high-street lenders&mdash;Barclays, HSBC, Nationwide and Santander&mdash;are now offering comparable arrangements to their customers. I hope that I have answered the hon. Gentleman's question.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/6">The scheme is still in its early days, but more that 17,000 households have accessed information on HMS since its launch. We want to see lenders offering the scheme to help as many households as possible, in order to avoid repossession, and we are working with lenders to ensure that all households for whom HMS is the most appropriate option are able to gain access to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/7">These difficult times are affecting not only home owners but tenants, as was pointed out by the hon. Members for Twickenham and for Brent, East. The present difficulties also affect tenants renting from borrowers who default on the mortgage. That affects only a small number of households, but that does not make it any less just. We have therefore taken measures to address the problem. Civil procedure rules were changed so that, from April, buy-to-let tenants get up to seven weeks' notice, which is up from the present two weeks, if their landlord's mortgage defaults.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/8">We need to do more, however, to ensure that all tenants are better protected, regardless of whether their tenancy has been authorised by the landlord's lender, as is usually the case in a buy-to-let mortgage agreement. Last May, we announced our intention to legislate at the earliest opportunity to fill a gap in legal protection for private tenants whose landlords are repossessed by ensuring that they receive adequate notice to vacate the property, regardless of whether their tenancy has been authorised by the landlord's lender. We shall consult on our proposals over the summer with a view to legislating at the next opportunity. In the meantime, we are working closely with lenders to improve their current practices when they find an unauthorised tenant in a property of which they are seeking possession. Any tenant who is concerned, or who has received notification of a court possession hearing, should seek advice immediately. They should contact the mortgage lender taking repossession action and attend the hearing so that the judge is aware that there is a tenant in the property.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.5/9">The hon. Member for Brent, East asked about HRA reform. Later today, when the Minister for Housing, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1918" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth (John Healey)</phrase> announces the outcome of the review of council housing finance, he will also outline proposals to allow councils to keep all the proceeds from their own council house sales, as well as their rent.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.3/1">It is a pleasure to see you, Mr. Amess, in the Chair for this very important debate. I am pleased to see that we have before us the same Minister who announced the reorganisation of the Forensic Science Service. His announcement came the day that we had a change in Home Secretary&mdash;a good day, it seems, to get bad news out. Members of Parliament were not given any prior warning of the news. In fact, we had the media on the phone telling us what was happening. That is not a good way for the Government to do business; in fact, it is a very poor way.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/2">Let us set the standard of where we are at and from where we go. Of course the announcement was bad news. We are talking about a review of seven sites. I hope that the Minister will stand up and apologise to hon. Members. The Home Secretary has taken the trouble to say sorry for not giving advance warning, but why should he apologise? He knew nothing about it. The decision was made while one Home Secretary was going and another was arriving. I hope that the Minister stands up now and apologises so that we can see what a decent chap he is. Does he wish to stand up? No. I think that that sums it up. That tells us everything about how this matter has been handled. It has been pretty appalling, has it not?</p>
	<p pid="a.23.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-08">8 June</phrase>, the Forensic Science Service launched a collective consultation in readiness for reorganisation of the business. As I have said, the timing of the announcement was particularly good&mdash;as one Home Secretary departed and another took office. It was a good day to bury bad news. In light of the Minister's timing, I hope that he will be able to provide very comprehensive answers to all our questions, and that he will not simply hide behind the argument, &quot;Nothing to do with me, guv. This is an operational matter for the FSS.&quot; We do not want to hear that. This is about ensuring that crimes are solved in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.27.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="27"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0004.htm#09063046000515">
	<p pid="a.27.1/1">Okay.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">The news is sad. I was also horrified by the news, which was announced through Prospect, that three sites&mdash;Chorley, Chepstow and Priory House&mdash;were proposed for closure. It will come as no surprise to hon. Members that that was a damaging blow to staff morale at Chorley and the other sites. The employees at Chorley have expressed how devastated they are, because they are dedicated to preventing crime and bringing criminals to court. They are not interested in shareholders' profits; they are interested in ethics and putting criminals behind bars.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/3">I was amazed by the subtle shift from the FSS. We started with a consultation about a head count&mdash;that is what we were told&mdash;which then became a consultation about the proposed closure of three sites. Why those three sites? Why does the consultation not cover the seven sites? Why should we shut any site when we need a geographical spread? We need to return to that issue. I certainly do not want people to lose their jobs. We cannot put a price on stopping and solving crime, but the message seems to be that we will save money at the expense of allowing criminals to get away.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/4">We have gone from a consultation on a headcount reduction to a consultation on a reduction by three sites. In a letter to me dated <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-08">8 June</phrase>, Bill Griffiths, the FSS chief executive, referred to a headcount reduction, but he made no specific reference to the closure of Chorley or any other site. Chorley was not up for closure at that time, and I do not know whether Bill Griffiths knew that he was going to be replaced at that point, but it all seems very strange. Dates and people are moving all the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/5">I met Mr. Griffiths on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-22">Monday 22 June</phrase>. Once again, no mention was made of the closure at Chorley as part of the consultation that would start the process, yet two days later, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-24">Wednesday 24 June</phrase>, the proposed closure was announced via Prospect. We have still not heard any confirmation. Did the Minister phone up any Member here? Did anyone have a letter off the Minister to tell them what is going on? No. Yet previously, we were informed. What is the difference between Ministers such as my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch and this Minister? Is it arrogance? Is it that he does not want to talk to Back Benchers? Are we not worthy of being spoken to?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/6">It seems strange that different Ministers have played such different roles: from full contact, full conversation and engagement to zero. That is what we have had: zero contact and zero engagement. That is not good enough, is it? I hope the Minister will explain why he does not think that it is worth speaking to Back Benchers, when previous Ministers did.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/7">How can an organisation operate in such a manner? How can that be right? I believe that the FSS's proposals are misguided and will severely limit the organisation's ability to support the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the coroners in solving crimes and investigating deaths. The Chorley site acts as a central hub for the police forces of Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Lancashire, Cumbria, Cheshire, North Wales and North Staffordshire, and sometimes for parts of Derbyshire. Those areas have the highest crime rates outside London, and Chorley enjoys an excellent working relationship with their police authorities. Chorley also works with the Isle of Man, which I do not believe has been consulted. Neither have the coroners. A population of about 8 million will end up with no forensic science site, yet we know that Manchester and Liverpool are a major crime hub.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/8">The geographical location of the Chorley site plays an important role, as the police can bring vital evidence there to be examined, which helps solve serious crime cases where early detection is required. For example, in drugs cases, the forensic science team at Chorley, which specialises in such cases, is asked to respond within hours of receiving a sample. The police wait for it to be analysed in order to get criminals into court. If they have to travel two hours to the west or three hours to the south, how will they achieve that? It cannot be done. That is why I say the proposal is a criminals' charter. We will not be able to get evidence to court on time. That is why it is so serious. I am not just using rhetoric&mdash;these are the facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/9">The Chorley team's ability to respond quickly plays a major part in bringing serious offenders to justice. The police will be unable to operate in their usual fashion if Chorley is closed down. Members will remember the tragic death of Garry Newlove, who was beaten to death outside his home. We know that not getting evidence is a danger. It was the Chorley Forensic Science Service that detected the evidence, ensuring that the thugs who did it ended up in jail. The team were up against the clock. The judge was almost willing to give way and allow the case to be dismissed because evidence had not been produced. That is the importance of the Forensic Science Service, and that is why we must ensure that evidence is kept close to where the cases are. Can we really allow a decision to be taken that could restrict the police's ability to bring vicious killers to jail? What alternative arrangements are the police expected to make when urgent examinations must be undertaken?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/10">The FSS in Chorley also played a crucial role after the 7/7 London bombings. Do we really believe that the FSS in London alone could deal with major bombings? The work was distributed among the centres in England and Wales. Unfortunately, the UK is likely to suffer major bombings again, or to help other countries where they have taken place. We need a plethora of Forensic Science Service sites to fight terrorism. Capacity within the system is essential. If sites are closed, the service will not be able to deal with incidents like the 7/7 bombings. I am pleased that notes keep coming from the henchmen behind the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/11">It is a sad situation. Forensic scientists at Chorley worked on the case of Rhys Jones&mdash;a young boy who happened to be walking back from football at the wrong time and was tragically shot. Chorley played a role in the forensic science of that murder as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/12">Who played a part in the case of the gangsters in Manchester who have just gone to court? The Forensic Science Service at Chorley. We cannot underestimate that work. We must get on with what we do best. The FSS also deals with drugs and delivers lectures to the police. It works so well, yet we are willing to throw that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/13">FSS staff inform me that they are very busy. They are full up with work. It is not a question of spare capacity; the FSS does not have any. It is a busy organisation. The effects will be serious, if we are not careful. The police place great demand on the drugs team at Chorley in solving crimes and putting a value on drugs. It is not just about analysing whether something is cannabis. How strong is it? What is its street value? Is it for a deal or for home use? That information does not come easily; it takes true analysis. Forensic material must be investigated at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/14">The FSS does fire scene examinations. In a recent attack in Bolton in which, tragically, someone died and a fireman was seriously injured, the FSS came down from Chorley. Where is the nearest site? There are only two centres: Wetherby and Chorley. Fire scenes must be dealt with quickly. We cannot say, &quot;Oh well, we'll do the analysis tomorrow or the day after&quot;; it must be done immediately. We are risking that.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/15">I mentioned the benefits of having an FSS site near the university of Central Lancashire so that the two can work together. Students can come to the Forensic Science Service at Chorley to build skills for the future. The private sector will not do that for us. Links will be torn apart if the Chorley site closes. We must ensure that that severe blow to the north-west is not allowed to fall. It also threatens the future viability of the national Forensic Science Service team as a whole. An organisation cannot compete successfully with private operators by simply withdrawing from a region the size of the north-west and allowing the private sector to cherry-pick the work. Then people will wonder why the necessary results are not being delivered. We must ensure that we are in the best position for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/16">The closure flies directly in the face of the foundations of the criminal justice system. Evidence should be gathered to prove conclusively an individual's innocence or guilt of a crime. That is what comes from the Forensic Science Service, because that is what it specialises in. Having spoken to staff, I am told that they find increasingly that cases are being dropped not because of lack of evidence but purely because of the cost of analysing it. That is a problem. It is not just small cases; it can involve more serious ones. That will happen even more if the Forensic Science Service is not there. At what point does it become acceptable to say to a person seriously traumatised physically and mentally that it is not worth the cost to bring their attacker to justice? We cannot put a price on that. Although I acknowledge the need to achieve value for money and reduce costs if possible, forensic science should never be about making money. It should be about investigation, discovery and confirmation of facts with a view to bringing those who commit crimes to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/17">Turning to the process leading to the decision to close three sites, I would like to ask the Minister what consultation he has had with the police, the coroner's office and the Isle of Man, and what has come back. Will he share that information with us? Let us not hear, &quot;Not me, guv; it's somebody else.&quot; Have the police been alerted to the original proposal for a head count reduction or the new proposal for the closure of three sites? He might be able to help us with that. What have the police been consulted on&mdash;reduction in head count or closure of sites? I have mentioned the importance of the coroner's office and its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/18">I made a point earlier about drugs work and the need for a speedy response. It is crucial. Have the police been told about the closure and what effect it will have on the need to turn around forensic science information quickly? It is imperative that there is a detailed impact study that involves the police and all other partners before this decision is taken forward. If not, we will be simply signing a criminals' charter that will reduce the effectiveness of the FSS in responding to the needs of the police when solving crimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/19">I turn to the implications for the staff if the restructuring takes place. Staff have been told that career development opportunities will be available as a consequence of reorganisation. I am confused by that statement because they are facing a severe reduction in numbers. Staff will be invited to reapply for their jobs if they wish to remain in the service. That leads to growing uncertainty and will mean that even if their applications are successful, their terms and conditions will change&mdash;the decision really is about money. What guarantee can the Minister give that staff will not have to move from one part of the country to another to maintain their jobs? Why would someone based in the north-west move to London to carry out their work? Is there room for them on other sites? The answer is no. Chorley is one of the few sites where the Government owns the land around the facility and could expand it. That should be considered seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/20">This is no way to treat the highly skilled people who have so much to offer and who provide a first-class service in the field of forensic science. The Chorley laboratory has consistently met and exceeded its targets. The management have been informed that staff loyalty will be rewarded. How will it be rewarded? There is no more loyal and dedicated professional work force than those at the Chorley site. Despite that, they are faced with the awful prospect of redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/21">The Forensic Science Service provides a mission statement on its website:</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/22" class="indent">&quot;To retain and reinforce our leading position as the principal provider of forensic science to the UK criminal justice system, and use this platform to become the leading provider worldwide, thereby enhancing long term shareholder value.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/23">I am sure that we all share that vision, but the closure of three sites, including at Chorley, is not the way to go about things. I therefore urge the Minister to look carefully at the forensic science proposals and to realise the damage that will be done to the service and to the north-west if the Chorley site closes. I urge him to instruct the FSS to assess its future plans and to abandon its current proposals. As I said, this decision is a charter for criminals. It is about providing work for the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/24">I hope that the Minister will be honest, answer the points and not hide behind other people. The Government have only one shareholder&mdash;we are the shareholder. If they are serious about putting criminals behind bars, they should not proceed with this decision, and they should answer the questions. Thank you, Mr. Amess, for your patience.</p>

If I were a Minister, I would think that with friends like that, who needs enemies? Luckily, I am not. After today's outing, I intend to attend any debate that the hon. Gentleman opens or plans to contribute to.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/3">On the Forensic Science Service, there are a number of independent practitioners in my constituency: Dr. John and Kathy Manlove run Manlove Forensics in Grove technology park; Mr. Tiernan Coyle, who lives in my constituency, is the managing director of Contact Traces; and Mr. Roger Robson is the managing director of Forensic Access in Wantage. Those three companies met on Monday to discuss the ongoing saga of the difficulties created by the Government's reorganisation of forensic sciences. I have corresponded with the Minister and asked parliamentary questions on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/4">To add to the woes of the hon. Member for Chorley, he should be aware that the Government have also got rid of the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners. It was closed even before the consultation on the matter was concluded. It will not surprise the hon. Gentleman that when the Minister stands up to make his concluding remarks he will say, &quot;Not me, guv&quot; about that, too. He will claim that the police refused to continue to fund the organisation. However, the registration of forensic practitioners is as important to forensic science as the continued success of the FSS.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/5">In effect, there is now no registration system for individual practitioners of forensic science, including those who work at the FSS. The National Police Improvement Agency is in charge of registration and is using the United Kingdom Accreditation Service to accredit forensic science. However, UKAS will accredit only companies, not individuals. Individuals who work in the FSS cannot get individual accreditation.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/6">The impact of that on small companies, including the three companies that I mentioned, has been massive. Mr. Roger Robson, who runs Forensic Access, says that overall it will have cost him about &pound;35,000 to achieve UKAS accreditation. It cost &pound;1,200 just for his company to apply and &pound;24,000 to get the qualification. UKAS charged &pound;900 a day for consultation work. Such an accreditation service will put many small practitioners out of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/7">Another problem is that the National Police Improvement Agency will allow outsourced forensic work to be applied for only in bundles. Therefore, only companies that cover a range of forensic services will be able to tender for such work. To pick up on the remarks of the hon. Member for Chorley, that is a charter for big business. I suspect that his sympathies lie more with small, individual expert practitioners, rather than with huge, multinational private companies that are owned by shareholders. That change is a huge problem for companies such as Contact Traces, which specialises in fibres, and Manlove Forensics, which specialises in entomology.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/8">Those companies have been in contact with Andrew Rennison at the Home Office, and I must put on the record their gratitude to him. The hon. Gentleman is concerned about the lack of response from the Minister, but my constituents have said that they have had good access and constructive discussions. However, I do not wish to create a divide between the Minister and his official. My constituents were told that a &quot;procurement lite&quot; framework was forthcoming on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-04">4 June</phrase>. Has it come forward? Such a framework is incredibly important as it would allow small, independent practitioners to continue to tender for forensic science work.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/9">Thank you for allowing me to make that short contribution, Mr. Amess. I want simply to get one message across to the Minister: the changes in the FSS have turned what was a world-class service on its head. The hon. Member for Chorley talked about the catastrophic effect they have had on the FSS. I want to emphasise the effect on the hundreds of small practitioners, many of which are based in my constituency, who provide a valuable service, important competition and the narrow expertise that is vital to the ecology of forensic science. I ask the Minister to please not lose sight of those practitioners in carrying out the reforms.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.32.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1570" speakername="Colin Burgon" colnum="32"  time="011:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0005.htm#09063046000519">
	<p pid="a.32.0/1">Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase>, I declare a constituency interest. There is a Forensic Science Service laboratory in Wetherby in my constituency. My hon. Friend has covered the ground well. He is right to say that MPs have been treated shabbily. However, the work force have been treated in an even more shabby manner. The trade unions have been frozen out of many of the discussions as this shambolic process has proceeded. I pay homage to the work force in Wetherby. As he said, they are a loyal and dedicated bunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/2">This matter points to the absolute failure of the new Labour political ideology. There is a wonderful symmetry between that market ideology and that of the Conservative party. I argue that the introduction of the market has destroyed the FSS. The starting point of that was the McFarland review of 2002-03, which stated that the FSS being the national supplier of forensic science services created a fundamental market distortion. It recommended that competition be stimulated to increase investment. It stated that, in effect, the police form a monopoly customer, which also distorts the market. New Labour's love affair with the market allowed it to go along with such distorted thinking. I am not a believer in the market. I believe that there are areas of our public life, such as education, health and the criminal justice system, that have no place in the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/3">Obviously, I have had contact with my constituents in Wetherby, and they want me to flag up some particular concerns. They are concerned that redundancies will result in the loss of many experienced staff from forensic science and that those staff will leave the industry altogether, leaving a skills gap in the future. Will the Minister address that? The staff who will be made redundant are mostly career specialists who have committed many years to forensic science and are going to find it very hard to find comparable employment. What I am really arguing is that all this is bound up with our idea of the public and the private, and about consumers and citizens. I am willing to argue that staff in the existing FSS go the extra mile and spend the extra hour because they feel committed to that public service. That will not be replicated with the great desire to introduce the market into forensic science.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/4">There is a tradition that Ministers run Departments, but I fear that it is the other way around in the Home Office. I have experienced Ministers coming along with crackpot ideas about building a super-prison in my constituency. There were no rational arguments behind those ideas, and it seemed as though there was a force, somewhere behind them, driving that process. I can only presume that the unelected civil service, which we are never supposed to criticise, actually determines the agenda on such matters, so we have got to ask whether Departments are running Ministers. <i>[Interruption.]</i> That may be open to debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/5">I am aware that several people want to take part in the debate, so I shall end with a few questions. My hon. Friend the Member for Chorley has mentioned that we seem to have a new chief executive, Mr. Bennett, and that there is a connection or relationship with QinetiQ. We have to be careful about this&mdash;and let us have some honesty, because, since 2003, when we first met the then Home Secretary, there has been a bad smell about this whole process. If we are absolutely honest, this process has, from day one, been about fattening up the FSS to sell it off eventually as a privatised business. Let us be honest about it. No matter how polite Ministers have been in telling us about things and updating us, that was behind the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/6">If we got a bit of honesty, perhaps the Minister would be able to explain a few things. I am looking at something that I got from the Public and Commercial Services Union parliamentary group, which contains some of the information that went to the interview panel for the chief executive position&mdash;this is from our Government. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/7" class="indent">&quot;In order to respond more quickly to the changes in the forensic science market, increase customer focus and improve its commercial competitiveness, the FSS was in 2005 transformed into a Government-owned company. This is intended as a precursor to evolution into a private sector entity, the timing of which depends on FSS' ability to transform itself into a viable, commercial entity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/8">That is what was laid down before the chief executive, so let us have some honesty. Without honesty, we are going to finish up with the service being sold off to the private sector. It is another QinetiQ waiting to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/9">Let me remind hon. Members that on the day of the QinetiQ company's flotation in 2006, the top 10 managers held shares worth &pound;107 million&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.34.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1668" speakername="Ben Wallace" colnum="34"  time="011:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0005.htm#09063046000522">
	<p pid="a.34.2/1">It is delightful to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1570" name="Colin Burgon">the hon. Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon)</phrase>. I was a director of QinetiQ before coming to this House. I am not a millionaire and I was not part of the seniority to whom money was doshed out, but it is important to bring that experience to bear in this debate because I have seen it before.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/2">The previous speakers are absolutely right&mdash;in all my days, including the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s when people talked about Tory privatisation, I have never seen a worse privatisation than that of QinetiQ. I can tell you how it starts, Mr. Amess&mdash;it starts off with the Treasury, which wants the money. Its fingerprints are all over this, just the same as with QinetiQ. Then a bit of part-private assistance is brought in; that is what they call it. There is a bit of public-private partnership, or the status of the body is changed. Once those people have been brought in, the first thing they do is take the axe to the real asset of the organisation. The only real asset of such organisations are the scientists, whether they are in the defence research laboratories, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency or the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/3">But how do people get those departments to become private? They do not incentivise the scientists. They go along to the civil servants, some of whom in QinetiQ had absolutely no qualifications to develop radar or invent some of the amazing things that have kept our country safe, and they give them huge amounts of money. I remember that the marketing director walked away from QinetiQ with more than &pound;1 million, and I think that all she had ever been was a basic civil servant who had never been in the world of advertising or marketing or anything else. They said, &quot;Have a bit of cash and off you go.&quot; That was appalling.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/4">It is the Ministry of Defence's fault&mdash;there was no conspiracy here; it was the Government's fault&mdash;that Ministers allowed the chief executive of QinetiQ not only to negotiate the terms of his and his colleagues' pay package on the winning bid, but to do the negotiations. In the private sector, the shareholders do the negotiations and when they have decided on a preferred bidder, they hand over to senior management to negotiate. With QinetiQ, we had the chief executive recommending to the MOD, &quot;My preferred bidder is the Carlyle Group, and by the way, I have just negotiated a wonderful package that made it important that I choose Carlyle.&quot; Those civil servants got 19,000 per cent. in exchange, and who were the casualties at QinetiQ? The same casualties as there are about to be at FSS&mdash;the scientists. The casualties were the boffins and brain boxes who had invented so many important things that keep our soldiers safe, that keep our criminals off the street and that our police now use.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/5">These matters cannot be rushed. I know that the Government have been criticised for the way they have handled things, and I am not ideologically opposed to the concept of privatisation per se, but I am a Conservative who believes in pragmatism. That is one of the greatest strengths of Conservatism in the world in which I live. Whatever we say, the FSS is not ready to be privatised now or even in the next five or 10 years, and I can tell the House why. The Government have failed to make it a more efficient and better organisation before they have come to privatise it. They have done this the QinetiQ way, thinking, &quot;Let's get somebody in.&quot; That person is Dr. Simon Bennett. I am not aware that he, as an individual, was among the equity snouts in the trough. He is a renowned scientist, unlike some of the people who were previously brought in, and I hope that will go some way towards giving comfort to the employees of the FSS. He understands science, and he is internationally renowned, so I hesitate to criticise him.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/6">However, there are ways in which the FSS could be made better. We could encourage the better funding of our police so that they can use its service. We talk about serious crimes, such as rape and paedophilia, but it upsets my constituents that there is no longer any forensic investigation of boring and mundane crimes. If someone's house gets broken into, or their car is vandalised, the response is either, &quot;Do it yourself,&quot; or, &quot;Have a crime number for your insurance.&quot; That is because the police do not get sufficient funding to allow them to engage in that forensic debate unless it is a murder or a terrorist event. That would help to make the FSS better value for money, and would mean that more of its facilities were used so that it would not be so much under threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/7">Police procurement is another issue. We are looking in the wrong part of the Home Office. The way in which the police procure technologies is completely Victorian. Each police force buy their own batons and bullet-proof vests. That is a total waste of money and I do not know why we carry on doing that. It would not be done in any other police forces and it certainly would not be done in the armed forces. We should look at saving money in that area. That would help the FSS to use all its skills, which I know that it does, and would give it a sound base on which to do business.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/8">The reality is that the service is not ready to be privatised and it will not be ready for a long time. I have a number of constituents in Lancaster and Wyre who work in the lab in Chorley. In terms of the awful phrase, &quot;Well, they'll be offered a job in the new location, but if they can't, they'll be made redundant,&quot; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> and I both know that relocating from Lancaster or Chorley is not an option&mdash;it is not like there will be a job down the road. Let us compare this situation with that of those who work for the BBC. When they were offered the option to relocate to the north&mdash;to Manchester&mdash;a large amount of public money was thrown at them. It is sad that, when it comes to the Forensic Science Service, we will leave these people out to dry.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.2/9">I say to the Government that the service is not ready for privatisation and that the mistakes of QinetiQ are being repeated. In the end, the loser will be our scientific skill base, which cannot be reinvented or imported over night. If we lose that skill base, the winners will be the criminals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.39.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1497" speakername="Paul Holmes" colnum="39"  time="012:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0006.htm#09063046000526">
	<p pid="a.39.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on his coruscating condemnation of the Minister for the lack of consultation and for the way in which the recent announcement was made on a good day for burying bad news. We heard a tour de force exposition of the tremendous track record of the Forensic Science Service in general and of the Chorley laboratory in particular. We heard examples of the damage to crime detection that will result from closing three of seven centres around the country&mdash;Chorley, Chepstow and Birmingham&mdash;and from the loss of scientific expertise and the institutional memory of the organisation, as well as the individual job losses, the loss of geographical coverage and the effect of losing, in total, 40 per cent. of the FSS staff, or up to 800 posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">How have the Government arrived at their position? As we heard, in 2003 they decided to take the competitive route. We heard comments about the ideological drive for privatisation, regardless of the merits in individual cases of going down that road. In 2005, the FSS was turned into a Government company&mdash;a GovCo&mdash;and, in 2009, a new chief executive was appointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/3">The information provided to people applying for the job, part of which was quoted earlier, was not published, but it was acquired by the Public and Commercial Services Union. We have already heard an interesting quote from the notes for candidates, which stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/4" class="indent">&quot;the FSS was in 2005 transformed into a Government-owned company. This is intended as a precursor to evolution into a private sector entity, the timing of which depends on FSS' ability to transform itself into a viable, commercial entity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/5">The document went on to say that among the key responsibilities of the new chief executive was a requirement to prepare the FSS</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/6" class="indent">&quot;for its successful transition to the introduction of private capital at the appropriate point if agreed by Ministers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/7">Clearly, in 2003, 2005 and again in 2009, when the new chief executive was being appointed, Ministers saw privatisation as the end goal. There can be no question about that. The result, as we have already heard, was that in 2009 we got Dr. Simon Bennett of QinetiQ, and, as we heard in great detail from both the official Opposition and from Government Back Benchers, the track record of that privatisation is not one that we should be proud of or seek to emulate. QinetiQ is an example of a taxpayer-funded organisation that was already very successful&mdash;as the FSS is&mdash;being privatised at huge personal financial gain to the managers involved while the taxpayer simply lost out in every direction. Taxpayers lost out financially and they lost out on the quality of the service that the organisation had previously provided as a public sector body.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/8">In the short term, the taxpayer loses. The Government would argue that in the long term, the public will benefit from the effect of the market and the privatisation of the FSS, which is why they set out on that road back in 2003. We have already had some debate about that. Clearly, the market is best at providing all kinds of goods and services. It is best at providing widgets, fashion clothing, designer jeans and mobile phones. I believe that no one would seriously argue that the telecommunications services we enjoy in this country today are worse than they would have been if we had left British Telecom as a monopoly, as it was more than 25 years ago. I do not believe that anyone would disagree that telecommunications services are better now than they were then.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/9">Clearly, however, there are areas where the market has no place. There are areas where arguments about social equity, the social good and the public good are far more important than the profit-driven motive of the market. We have already heard examples, with which I concur, from health and education&mdash;as a former teacher, I have long made that case during the eight years that I have been in Parliament. The FSS is another obvious example where the argument that the market knows best, that it will produce the best results, is clearly a fallacy. It will be interesting to hear the Minister clarify exactly why the Government are so clear in their own mind that bringing market forces into the FSS will be of benefit to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/10">The driving motive of the market is profit. The driving motive of the FSS and the justice system should be catching criminals, as we heard eloquently expounded in examples in the opening speech by the hon. Member for Chorley. I have an example from <i>The Times, </i>a newspaper that is not exactly noted for its defence of the public interest and the public good, or of delivery by public services. As a champion of the free market, it would like to see the market operate in most areas of life. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-21">21 July</phrase>, <i>The Times</i> gave an interesting example in an article about some of the market-orientated moves that the FSS is taking to try to keep business that it is losing to other areas. The article stated that it is now offering the police a service with variable fees so that, for example, if a test on a piece of forensic evidence leads to conviction, there would be a higher charge than if the test were negative. <i>The Times</i> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/11" class="indent">&quot;If a positive DNA or blood or fibre match is found, the agency says, then the fee would be higher than for negative results. For example, if dozens of cigarette-ends were found at a crime scene, the police may not think it worthwhile to test them all&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/12">because of the cost of testing every one of, say, three dozen cigarette ends. But if the police were told that they would have a small fee to pay for a negative result but a larger fee to pay if one or two of the cigarette ends led to the conviction of the criminal involved, the services of the FSS would be more attractive.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/13">Surely we should not be looking at a system whereby when the police and the justice system are investigating a case, they are driven to decide not whether they can catch a criminal by testing the evidence, but whether it is cheaper not to test the evidence or whether the FSS or private competitors would offer cheap rates for doing it this way or that way. The driving force should be catching criminals, not the accountant's bottom line in a profit-and-loss ledger. It would be interesting to hear the Minister explain exactly why the Government appear so confident that taking the accountant's cost or profit-motive approach is better for criminal justice than the current or the previous workings of the police and the FSS.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/14">I have three explicit questions for the Minister. Can he explain why the Government are sure that just four geographical centres, after three of the seven have been closed, can cope without affecting response time, which is crucial when dealing with a crime scene? We have heard many detailed examples of that. What detailed assessment has been undertaken to justify the clear assessment that four geographical centres can cope, when previously there were six or seven?</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/15">Secondly, how will the 40 per cent. job losses&mdash;800 people&mdash;be decided? Will the jobs be those of staff who are involved in marketing, business development, account management, logistics, quality and policy, or will they be those of precisely the expert scientific staff who are what the FSS is supposed to be all about&mdash;catching criminals? Thirdly, has any evaluation been carried out of the deterrent effect on crime investigation of applying cost factors to what should be a decision to investigate based purely on evidence and the chance of catching criminals, rather than on cost?</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/16">The FSS has played an essential role in our criminal justice system. It should be above making profit and outside commercial interference. The job losses will have a large impact on the FSS's ability to do its job. Large swathes of the country will be left without public sector service provision. The FSS has rightly played a valuable role in our criminal justice system. Any attempt to move it from the public to the private domain is likely to have a drastic impact on our criminal justice system and on public confidence in it as a whole.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-30a.41.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="41"  time="012:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090630/halltext/90630h0007.htm#09063046000527">
	<p pid="a.41.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the hon. Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> not just on securing the debate, but on the passionate, powerful way in which he highlighted the concerns of the 200 members of staff at the Forensic Science Service base at Washington Hall in his constituency, and the concerns about the wider issues arising from the changes to the service and the proposed cuts that will, potentially, lead to the loss of 800 jobs over the next two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/2">The debate is important, not only in terms of the jobs at risk, and not only because of the future of the FSS, but because of the questions that it raises about the forensic science capabilities for law enforcement to solve increasingly complex crimes, where the use of forensic data is becoming ever more essential in bringing serious crimes to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/3">As we have heard, the FSS has a proud history, tracing its roots back to the 1930s, when the use of forensics in dealing with certain types of material was in its infancy. I pay tribute to the FSS for its work in bringing crimes to justice and ensuring that serious crimes are solved. However, its position in recent years has become increasingly challenged and challenging, with its turnover slumping by &pound;70 million, based on its last audited accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/4">The catalyst for the debate was the Minister's written ministerial statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-08">8 June 2009</phrase>, and the proposed changes that underlay it, which raised more questions than it answered. Given the scale and seriousness of the proposed changes, it is incumbent on the Minister to answer the questions raised by hon. Members, including my questions about the strategic approach that is being taken. In his statement, the Minister confirmed that the FSS is embarking on a Government-backed transformation programme after six months of wranglings between the Home Office and the Treasury, which he elegantly described as &quot;rigorous consultation&quot;. The upshot is a reduction of 40 per cent. of the skilled work force, the closure of a number of facilities and the adoption of what is described as a new business model. As we have heard, there has been a lack of discussion and certainty surrounding the announcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/5">Will the Minister provide further details of the new business model, because it is at the heart of finding out about the intentions? How will that business model deliver the same integrated service more quickly and efficiently, as was claimed in the announcement? The key issue is to find out how the ability to provide the same services will be advanced by the proposed changes. Will he confirm that there will be no diminution in the speed, quality and capabilities of forensics facilities available to police and other law enforcement agencies?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/6">In its 2007-08 financial statement, published in January, the FSS executive chairman, Bill Griffiths, described the uncertainties faced by FSS employees, saying that</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/7" class="indent">&quot;we have maintained that we must motivate and nurture our staff, since they are in effect 'our business.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/8">The financial statements also highlight one of the key challenges in the company's successful transformation, which is</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/9" class="indent">&quot;retaining key skills and maintaining staff morale&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/10">Will the Minister explain how the reorganisation proposals that he has announced help to deliver those goals and how those key skills will be maintained as a consequence of the changes that are envisaged?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/11">In a statement to the Press Association on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-08">8 June 2009</phrase>, an unnamed Home Office official was quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The forensics market is changing with increased competition, reduced business volumes and a higher cost base.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/13">The key is in the words &quot;reduced business volumes&quot;. Does the Minister agree with that analysis and, if so, is he therefore expecting cuts or other reductions in police budgets on forensics, giving rise to the expected reduced volumes? We need to understand how the market and the demand may change in the years ahead and from where the reduced business volumes will come.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/14">The Minister's statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-08">8 June</phrase> had a number of other important points wrapped up in it. He confirmed that the FSS would remain as a Government-owned company &quot;for the foreseeable future&quot;, but added:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/15" class="indent">&quot;GovCo status has provided a suitable platform on which the FSS can transition to a commercially effective and robustly competitive organisation.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2009-06-08.22"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 June 2009; Vol. 493, c. 22WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/16">We need to understand the Minister's intentions. Will he confirm that it remains the Government's intention that the FSS should eventually transfer to become a private-public partnership or some other more arm's length vehicle, as was previously suggested?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/17">The Minister reaffirmed his commitment to the criteria established by then Under-Secretary of State, now the Secretary of State for Health, in December 2005 on the potential for transition to a public-private partnership. It should be noted that the needs of the Home Office as shareholder were to be considered as part of that requirement. In his written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March 2006</phrase>, the right hon. Gentleman clarified the matter further stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/18" class="indent">&quot;As a Government-owned business, the FSS has to compete with other calls on public funds and consequently the Home Office's investment in it needs to demonstrate an appropriate risk/return profile.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/19" class="indent">In coming to the relative merits of GovCo vs PPP, the Home Office will need to consider: (i) assessment of the financial value of the FSS; (ii) the financial risks to the Home Office associated with ownership of FSS; and (iii) Home Office's funding priorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/20">What assessment has the Minister made against those tests and what agreement has he reached with the Treasury about financial value, financial risk and Home Office funding priorities? Again, the key to all that is where the policy priorities lie and the direction of travel.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/21">The right hon. Gentleman argued that delivery of the vision for the FSS's business would require</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/22" class="indent">&quot;substantial investment, both in physical and human capital, development of new and existing capabilities and exercising strong implementation skills.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2006-03-29.69"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 March 2006; Vol. 444, c. 69-70WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/23">Will the Minister confirm how his proposals for the FSS will advance the vision outlined, which underpins the approach to the future of the FSS, and from where he expects this investment to come?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/24">The future of the Forensic Science Service is also closely linked to the regulatory environment in which it sits. A new forensic science regulator has been appointed in the last year and a Forensic Science Advisory Council has been established. Will the Minister provide an update on the work of the regulator and the council and say how he sees those roles developing? The FSS, in its report and financial statements in January, described the developing role of the Forensic Science Regulator as a contributory factor in providing continued uncertainties surrounding the development of the competitive forensics market place in the UK. Will the Minister explain why those uncertainties persist and what urgent steps he is taking to provide the necessary clarification? Will he confirm that we will not end up in some parallel situation, where in-house capabilities are built up within police services at the cost of the FSS, because we would not be creating the market that the Minister appears to want to create, which obviously underpins the direction of travel?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/25">One of the uncertainties in the market relates to the future regulation of forensic practitioners. The regulator is currently considering proposals for a new regulatory scheme. However, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1905" name="Edward Vaizey">the Member for Wantage (Mr. Vaizey)</phrase> said, it is ironic that the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners, which the Government established as the regulatory body for those giving forensic evidence in court, was allowed to collapse nine days before the end of the consultation period. Why was support withdrawn from the CRFP at such a critical time? Will the Minister confirm reports that the regulator may take up to four years to implement the new regulatory scheme? Will he confirm that the regulation of the conduct of forensic science evidence will include the independent regulation of individuals involved in the provision of such services?</p>
	<p pid="a.41.0/26">For the sake of the future of the FSS and the livelihoods of the constituents of many hon. Members who have spoken, I trust that the Minister will be able to provide answers to the real questions that linger about the Home Office's commitment to, and vision for, the future of forensic sciences in this country now and in the years to come. It is important that those issues are put on the record today, so that all of us involved in the debate can understand better where we are going, because it is clear from the comments made that people simply do not know.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.0/1">I suggested that the hon. Gentleman apply for an Adjournment debate so that we would have more time. That matter is not central to the issue that we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/2">I want to set out the background to the many issues that have been raised and to where we are today. The FSS has for many years provided a first-class service to the police and the wider criminal justice system. It is our ambition that that continues. Until 2005, it was an executive agency of the Home Office, and had been largely the monopoly supplier of forensic services, but the reality was that other suppliers were offering competition and it became clear that that trend would continue. An independent review in 2003 warned of the consequences of that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/3">A commercial market dominated by a Home Office agency was not right for the FSS in the long term, nor was it right for competitors and the police. It was not right for customers, predominantly the police service, which is responsible for obtaining best value for money from the grants provided from public funds. We took the first step towards the creation of a market by changing the FSS's status to a Government-owned limited company or GovCo. That change affects the dynamics of the relationship between the company, whose board now has statutory and fiduciary Companies Act responsibilities, and the Home Office shareholder.</p>

	<p pid="a.51.0/1">As ever, Mr. Jones, it is an absolute pleasure to serve under you. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> on securing the debate on an issue that is important to him and to a number of his constituents and others living in the area. Having listened to his remarks at the end of his speech, I would be extremely concerned if conflicts of interest over political donations had not been managed appropriately. I know that he is not suggesting that that is the case, but that he does not know.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/2">Let me start by providing some background to the proposals for a strategic development area centred around the north and north-east of Hedge End. The Hedge End SDA is a long-standing commitment, which was born out of workshops hosted by PUSH, of which Eastleigh borough council is a member, to discuss the sub-regional aspects of the draft south-east plan. Those discussions led to proposals for the SDAs at Hedge End and Fareham, and the proposals were provided to the South East England regional assembly, under the banner of PUSH, for inclusion in the draft regional spatial strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/3">Let me take this opportunity to address the hon. Gentleman's concerns about the process that was followed to finalise the south-east plan and, in particular, about how the views of local representatives and local residents were sought and considered. The original draft was prepared by the South East England regional assembly. It was then submitted to the Government office for testing and final approval. From the outset, the draft plan included proposals for an SDA at Hedge End.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/4">When work began on the plan in 2003, it was subject to extensive consultation. Between April and May 2004, more than 1,000 stakeholders took part in workshops, which helped to shape the consultation draft of the plan. Following the launch of the public consultation in January 2005, more than 6,000 print and electronic copies of the plan were distributed. More than 14,000 copies of the plan executive summary were requested, and further workshops were held to encourage responses from hard-to-reach groups. Assembly numbers attended almost 100 public and stakeholder meetings on the plan. In addition, a number of public opinion surveys were carried out on behalf of the assembly, gathering views on key plan policies from a representative sample of the region's population.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/5">By the time the consultation closed in April 2005, more than 2,500 written responses had been received from stakeholders and the public. A questionnaire on key plan policies was distributed to 3.2 million households and organisations, including local authorities and town and parish councils. The questionnaire attracted a further 61,746 responses.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/6">All that consultation predated the examination in public. The proposals for an SDA at Hedge End were discussed at that examination, and PUSH submitted a statement for the examination panel to consider, setting out the justification for the SDA. The examination panel supported the principle of the SDA at Hedge End, noting that its selection had been challenged by a number of participants, but concluding that it was, on balance, a sound choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/7">Following the examination, the Secretary of State published her proposed changes to the draft plan in July 2008. At the time, everyone who responded to earlier rounds of consultation was sent notification that the documents were available and was given details on how copies could be obtained.</p>
