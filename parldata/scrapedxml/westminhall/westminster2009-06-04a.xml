<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-04a.142.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1692" speakername="Nia Griffith" colnum="142"  time="014:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090604/halltext/90604h0002.htm#09060435000150">
	<p pid="a.142.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to participate in this debate. It is a pity that more people are not here&mdash;but I think we all know the reasons for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/2">I would like to reiterate some of the Minister's comments. We have made many improvements in road safety in recent years, and our track record compares extremely favourably with other EU countries with similar circumstances to ours. When I entered Parliament, I was very aware of the many pressures facing local governments in prioritising funding, and yet I was extremely surprised by the number constituency groups campaigning for traffic-calming measures in their areas. My county council identified about 200 sites where residents had requested measures to curtail speeding. The problem is that, while walking around our communities, we want cars to go much slower. When we see people who are slow to cross the road being taken by surprise by a speeding car, or children suddenly running out inadvertently into the road, we can all appreciate why we do not want drivers racing through built-up areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/3">Technology has advanced so much that sometimes the very same people who worry about speed in front of their own front doors inadvertently go above 20, 30 and even 40 mph when they get behind the wheel in a built-up area. That is because driving is now so smooth. In my childhood, when we used to bounce up and down in the back of a very uncomfortable car&mdash;it was a bit like being on the Back Benches at Prime Minister's Question Time with one's colleagues jumping up and down on very uncomfortable seats&mdash;a little bit of speed was very noticeable. Now, of course, a person can drive at considerable speed without even noticing.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/4">I welcome the Minister's references to changing behaviour. Essentially, we have three options. We can put in more and more traffic-calming measures, such as islands in the middle of roads, speed cameras and all sorts of markings and bumps; consider using snooper technology that tells off drivers every time they go too fast, which I find offensive; or change our behaviour. Those who talk about changing behaviour are often accused of being idealistic. However, our attitude to drink-driving has changed noticeably over the years. Similarly, the once much-ridiculed smoking ban is very much welcomed and accepted now. The same is true of seat belts. Child seat belts were unheard of when I was a child, but no parent now would think of going out without having the car properly prepared for young children.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/5">There are three categories of road to consider. First, there is the urban road. In Wales, we have Assembly-funded programmes for calming the traffic in the immediate vicinity of schools. I have to congratulate my own county council&mdash;Carmarthenshire&mdash;for having drawn down considerable sums of funding to implement such schemes. However, the urban area is very much wider than just the areas in front of schools and often includes parts of trunk roads, which run through very built-up areas. We must think carefully about how else we can calm down traffic.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/6">The second type of road&mdash;the rural road&mdash;is common in my county. There are a very high number of deaths on rural roads. People think, &quot;Oh, this is a lovely country road, let's put our foot down and enjoy it.&quot; Even people who are familiar with such roads can suddenly be surprised by something coming out of a gateway. It could be an animal, a child or a farm vehicle. It could be an obstacle of some description or something that has happened that they did not expect. Unfortunately, because drivers are going at speed, such accidents can be much more gruesome, with consequences that are considerably more serious than those we see in accidents on other types of road.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/7">The third type of road is the national motorway or dual carriageway. I have long advocated trying to get a culture in which we genuinely reduce speed. In the past, fast food was all the rage, but now we want to go for slow cooking. It is a mentality or an idea. For example, people think that it takes one hour to drive from Llanelli to Cardiff, but they should think that it will take an hour and a half. We should adjust our mentality to accept a more sensible speed. That is not easy. A couple of years ago, I suggested, to much hilarity, that one way of changing our speed limits in this country would be to interpret all our speed signs that are currently interpreted as meaning miles per hour as meaning kilometres per hour. In other words, when a driver sees a sign saying 30, it would mean not 30 mph but 30 kph, which is just under 20 mph. At the time, people thought I was mad. Now we are hearing many more people saying, &quot;20 is plenty&quot; in our urban areas and particularly around our schools. It is certainly a measure that we could consider both in our urban areas and on our country roads. I very much welcome the mapping system that the Minister referred to for country roads. As for motorways, different issues are involved, and I am not the expert to say what a good speed limit would be. None the less, when we travel at high speeds we must be aware of unexpected events such as a tyre blow-out. By travelling at lower speeds, we can considerably reduce the number of accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/8">The psychology of using a human image is very effective. It affects people's mentality when they are shown that a child is far more likely to be injured by a car that is speeding, or when motorway roadworks have a sign saying, &quot;Do not kill our work force&quot;. Such images are much more effective than a sign warning drivers to slow down at 40 mph when they cannot see a roadwork in sight. It is important to get that message across. We should not be waiting for people to break speed limits and offend before we put them on training courses. The psychology must be there. We should start at school level by talking to pupils about road safety and showing graphic images, and continue that through the process of taking a driving test. We need to keep up that knowledge throughout life. All advertisers will say how the effects of any campaign fade and people go back to their old habits. We must look at ways in which we can develop a society that says, &quot;Although we have the technological power to go at the most fantastic speeds, that is not the best thing to do in most circumstances.&quot; We need to persist with this campaign and work hard. We can put in a number of concrete measures, such as islands, stripes, bumps and speed cameras&mdash;if we can afford them, because the budget is sometimes limited&mdash;but we need to change our mentality.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/9">Having said that, some concrete changes can be considered. A short while ago in my constituency, we experienced two deaths on a dual carriageway that comes immediately off the M4. People can drive for three and a half hours down from London with not a single obstacle, and suddenly they go round a roundabout and find themselves on a dual carriageway where cars can come in and out from small side roads. That is an extremely dangerous situation. I am referring to the M4 at the point where it reaches Pont Abraham and becomes the A48. The A48 goes on to Cross Hands through Cwmgwili, which is where the two accidents took place, and on to Carmarthen and St. Clears.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/10">Ever since a very serious accident some 20 years ago, a number of us have been calling for the road to be made into an express road with exits and entries similar to those on a motorway. Then we would not have people crossing the carriageway. I am sure that hon. Members can think of similar roads near to them. We must consider improving road safety on dual carriageways and main trunk roads that form part of a network, because the people on them are likely to be travelling at some speed. We also need to make people aware of the types of junctions they will encounter coming in and out of those roads. That is a particular problem in areas such as the rural parts of Wales and England.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/11">We must also consider how we treat cyclists. We all know the benefits of cycling&mdash;how healthy it can be and how it can reduce pollution. I recently had the tremendous pleasure of cycling with my young nieces along the millennium coastal path in Llanelli, where there are no cars. I quite understand that we cannot have such a cycle path on every route because obviously, there is not the space, and we want to be able to encourage people to cycle on ordinary roads as well; but we need to consider a number of measures if we are to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/12">I welcome the commitment in the draft road safety strategy to trying to reduce the risks for cyclists, possibly halving the risks involved within 10 years. We need to look at how we encourage people to cycle, as well as at ways of improving junctions and space for cyclists, because of the issue of &quot;critical mass&quot;; it is much safer for cyclists when people are used to seeing them and expect them to be there. Again, it is a matter of attitude. France is a great country for cycling, and there is a strict understanding there that drivers leave a metre between their vehicle and a cyclist. We need to work with our drivers on the idea that overtaking a cyclist is like overtaking a motorbike: often, drivers need as much space as they would to overtake a car, and they should not expect to be able to scrape past a cyclist when a car is coming in the opposite direction, unless the road is sufficiently wide. The measures that we take to reduce dangers to cyclists should include ways of encouraging cyclists.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-04a.145.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" speakername="Mark Hunter" colnum="145"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090604/halltext/90604h0002.htm#09060435000153">
	<p pid="a.145.2/1">It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to today's debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Benton. I am also pleased that the Government have chosen to request a debate on road safety. It is always timely to discuss issues of such importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/2">I acknowledge, as other hon. Members have done, that there has been considerable progress, but road accidents are still responsible for hundreds of thousands of injuries each year. It is also pertinent to mention that they are the biggest killer of people in the five to 35 age group, despite that progress. Those injured, and the families of those killed or injured, have to face great emotional and financial suffering. It is also significant, in the current economic climate, that we recognise that road accidents cost our economy 1.5 per cent. of our annual gross domestic product. That is the equivalent of what the Government spent in total on transport in 2006-07, so we are not talking about small sums of money. It therefore follows&mdash;I am sure we all agree on this&mdash;that we should do as much as possible to reduce the number of deaths and accidents on our roads. As we have heard from other hon. Members, roads should be safe for everyone&mdash;pedestrians, cyclists, car drivers, motorcyclists and HGV drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/3">There has been some positive news about road safety, not least of which is the fact that roads deaths fell below 3,000 in 2007 for the first time since 1926. That is certainly good progress. The Government's new consultation on road safety, &quot;A safer Way&quot;, is also to be welcomed. However, as I think we would all agree, there is no room for complacency. There are still nearly 250,000 casualties on our roads each year, including some 3,000 children who were killed or seriously injured in 2007 alone. To make our roads safer we first need to know why accidents occur, as well as where, when and how, and who is involved. We need to know those things to enable us to develop better policies that get to the heart of the problem and help to reduce road accidents, injuries and deaths. We also need urgently to review how we collect information about road accidents. The current system for reporting them relies not only on accidents being reported in the first place&mdash;we all know that that does not always happen&mdash;but on the police accurately assessing the level of injury sustained. A comparison with hospital data suggests that too many accidents go unreported or underestimated. There has been much criticism of the STATS&mdash;road accident statistics&mdash;system, not least by the Select Committee on Transport, and the review of the system mentioned in the Government's consultation document gives us an opportunity to change how we record accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/4">Licensing and seatbelt information, for example, should be recorded as standard so that we can understand all the factors that contribute to road accidents and injuries. Until we know how many road accidents there are, who is involved in them and what caused them, we cannot adequately plan road safety policy. That is why&mdash;this was touched on in an intervention&mdash;we, along with organisations such as the RAC, are calling for the creation of a road accidents investigation branch similar to the rail, maritime and air accidents investigation branches. It would gather accurate data about road accidents, analyse the data and make recommendations to Government on road safety. The Government consultation states that they do not think that that is necessary because the police already investigate accidents, but does the Minister agree that there is a difference between the role and work of the police in deciding who is responsible for accidents and the work that needs to be done to establish in a broader sense why accidents happen? The expert panel that the Government have suggested is in our view simply not enough. A national authority, with the same powers and responsibilities as the rail, maritime and aviation bodies is necessary. Why does the Minister think that it is appropriate to have an investigation branch for rail, maritime and aviation incidents, but not one for road incidents?</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/5">Drink-driving continues to be one of the biggest problems on our roads. As the Minister will be aware, there may be a difference of opinion between the parties on this issue. The number of road deaths involving drink-drivers has remained the same over the past decade, while the total number of deaths has fallen considerably. In 2007 alone&mdash;the last full year for which figures are available&mdash;16 per cent. of road deaths involved a drink-driver. The Liberal Democrats have for some time been calling for the drink-drive limit in the UK to be brought in line with that in most of the rest of Europe, from 80 mg to 50 mg per 100 ml of blood.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/6">As the Minister knows, that has the support of many industry experts, including the British Medical Association, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, and Brake. Reducing the drink-drive limit would save lives by sending a clear message that &quot;just another drink&quot; will put people over the limit. As he may also be aware, University college London has estimated that such a measure could prevent some 65 deaths and 230 injuries a year. In the light of that, will he assure us that he at least retains an open mind on the issue, and that if he is not yet convinced, he will continue to consider the evidence that many of us believe is already compelling?</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/7">I was pleased to hear the Government announcement on roadside drugs testing, but I remain sceptical that the specification for a device will be approved, despite the fact that the technology is available. A reply to a parliamentary question I asked in 2008 assured me that departmental advisers were continuing their work to produce such a specification and that they hoped to reach a conclusion soon. What assurance can the Minister give the House today that the announcement earlier this month will actually end in a device specification being agreed and the device being used on the roadside?</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/8">Thirty per cent. of car accidents involve at least one car driver under 25 years old, so young and novice drivers are much more likely to be involved in accidents than other groups of drivers. To be clear, it is not that all young drivers drive dangerously&mdash;most do not&mdash;but many do not get adequate training or experience of driving in adverse conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.2/9">The current driving test focuses heavily on controlling and manoeuvring the car, not on driving independently and in hazardous situations. I therefore welcome the Government's response to the &quot;Learning to Drive&quot; consultation and the inclusion of a section on independent driving in the practical test. I was disappointed, however, that the response did not include the suggestion made by many of the consultation respondents that certain types of driving should be a compulsory part of the learning and assessment process, including driving on urban roads in busy traffic, on quiet rural and one-track roads and motorways, and in bad weather and at night. Does the Minister agree that those skills should be part of the process and that they should not be learned on the hoof by novice drivers once they have passed their test?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-04a.155.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="155"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090604/halltext/90604h0003.htm#09060435000163">
	<p pid="a.155.0/1">At the risk of making this sound less exciting, I believe that Scotland has some of those signs as well. If the hon. Gentleman suggests that we should make a cross-party trip to New Zealand to have a look at them, someone might suggest that we should just go to Scotland. <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>might want to run a line on that, but perhaps we should not go there.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">We are looking at that experience. Clearly, such signs make sense. However, as more and more community schools are being used during extended hours, a variable speed limit may be appropriate only from midnight until 7 in the morning. Those matters are under review. Clearly, common sense ought to prevail and we should ensure that we do not cause unnecessary congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/3">My hon. Friend asked about car park layouts and out-of-town shopping centres. Forgive me, I do not mean to absolve myself of responsibility, but it occurs to me that that is a matter for the Department for Communities and Local Government. It is a planning issue, and, as a planning matter, it ought to be, and I am sure is, taken into account during the planning process. Out-of-town centres should be required to have appropriate transport infrastructure to ensure that people using all modes of transport, including pedestrians and the vulnerable, can get around safely without resorting to using a car. That is apparently covered in guidance from DCLG about out-of-town centres. The Department for Transport contributes to and collaborates in its preparation.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/4">I recognise the picture that my hon. Friend paints, because I have had the same experience myself. Perhaps she might want to take the issue up with DCLG and copy me into the correspondence. Again, as we have discussions with DCLG, it may be appropriate to look at what the latest information was, how recently it was refreshed, and whether it needs to be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/5">The hon. Member for Cheadle raised an interesting point about data. As he suggested, we are always keen to ensure that our information is as accurate as possible. I hear what he says about an accident investigation branch. However, the number of road casualties is completely different from the number of accidents dealt with by the marine, air and rail accident investigation branches.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/6">We are proposing in our consultation document that a new independent panel should focus on the data that emerge on fatal accidents from expert police accident investigation, and, through that, give us a steer as to where we might want to be. As has been said, the marine accident investigation branch, air accident investigation branch and rail accident investigation branch have so few accidents to investigate that they can deal with them all. They do not have eight every day. We would have to create a whole new constabulary to investigate that many accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/7">We are proposing that an independent panel looks at the data&mdash;I can tell from the hon. Gentleman's body language that he is not entirely convinced. Neither am I. I do not think that we necessarily have this absolutely right, but we are proposing a national body to advise on make-up, what should be done and so on. We will also still have an advisory board. I am not sure that we will need that as well as an independent panel. Combining the two might create something more elaborate.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/8">An annual report will be produced that we can debate, probably in this Chamber. Given the number of our constituents who are involved&mdash;we are talking about 3,000 people killed and 30,000 seriously injured each year&mdash;perhaps we should say that the debate is a more important issue for Parliament, and therefore make a bid for a full debate on the Floor of the main Chamber. I do not wish to detract from the importance of Westminster Hall in any way, Mr. Benton, but perhaps we should collectively lobby our parties for such a debate. It would raise the profile of road safety, and I am sure that more colleagues would be interested in contributing if we got time in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/9">The annual report would at least give us a document. The independent panel would give us advice and recommendations on what we are doing right, what we are not doing right and where we should go, and then we could debate independent advice, Government policies and suggestions from outside and from campaign groups. We are moving into a different era. There will be a different dimension and different analysis in the years after 2010, which will be useful in promoting road safety and helping us to get casualty numbers down even further.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/10">The hon. Members for Scarborough and Whitby and for Cheadle raised the issue of drink-driving. They perfectly and eloquently explained different views as to whether we should maintain or reduce the level. Our position is that we are genuinely open. We are looking at the submissions that we receive. We have alluded to the fact that we do not think that the evidence is there yet, but if we get evidence during the consultation period, obviously we would need to publish it and say whether we support a change.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/11">However, as colleagues will know, we have already taken action. We have spent &pound;4 million equipping all the police forces in England and Wales with the new digital breathalysers, which are evidentially approved. That means that we can cut out a loophole. When somebody is stopped and a blood or urine test is demanded, they are taken back to a police station. At the moment, if things are delayed for as long as possible&mdash;two or three hours&mdash;the person comes in under the radar when the test is finally done. The new digital breathalysers will close that loophole.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/12">Currently, the evidence is that the number of people killed or seriously injured by people who have been drinking and who test between 50 to 80 mg is only 2 per cent. Should we change the law for 2 per cent., with all that that would involve in terms of calibration, legislation, police forces, social and cultural attitudes, the impact on rural communities and the licensed trade and so on, even though we are talking lives, which are absolutely important? Perhaps we should be going after those who kill or seriously injure the other 98 per cent.&mdash;the people who are over 80, 100, 150 mg&mdash;with better enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/13">The new breathalysers will at least give us better data, and will do so in a short period of time. We do not have the data at present, but we will have better scientific evidence soon, and we will keep the matter under review. I am not saying that we will not change the level. Drink-driving and the level of alcohol in the system is never a closed issue. It is constantly under review. We are constantly under pressure from ACPO and from campaign groups, and I know that the issue will not go away in Parliament either. As I said, our minds are open on the matter, and we will look at the evidence that comes in.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/14">The hon. Member for Cheadle mentioned the cost of driving lessons, which was certainly an issue for us when we looked at driving training and testing and how to improve the situation. That it cost so much was a bit of a surprise at the time, but when we looked into the matter further and at the fact that only 44 per cent. of people pass their test each year&mdash;fewer pass their test first time&mdash;we found that it is the additional lessons that people have to take continuously that create the average fee of &pound;1,500. It is our strongly held view that if we improve training to an appropriate level, more people will pass more quickly, which ought to save money in the long term; but again, the matter will continue to be examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/15">The hon. Gentleman will know that measures have been introduced to tackle uninsured driving, including police powers to seize vehicles used on the road by uninsured drivers. Police powers have been improved to access information contained on the Motor Insurers Bureau database. In 2008, police seized about 185,000 vehicles. The seizure programme has contributed to improved compliance. From 2006 to 2008, police forces carried out spot checks on vehicles and found that the level of uninsured drivers fell by half in two years. The proportion of uninsured drivers fell to 1.2 per cent. from 1.9 per cent. The number of vehicles stopped that were without a current MOT fell from 4.2 to 1.5 per cent.; the proportion of drivers stopped who did not have a valid vehicle tax licence fell from 2 to 1 per cent.; and the level of drivers committing a serious offence, such as having no insurance or driving while disqualified, fell to 3.4 per cent. from 7.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/16">That there is a cut of almost 50 per cent. across the board is simply because of technology such as computers and automatic number plate recognition cameras. The police are using the technology far more effectively. When we have continuous insurance enforcement, as we will relatively soon, we will be able to use that information as we use the TV licence-checking system at the moment. We will not need to check people on the road, just as we do not need vans going around detecting whether people have a TV receiver in their home. We will know where they live. They can be written to and, if they cannot explain why the vehicle is not taxed or insured, or has no MOT, they will be open to penalties. We will be bearing down much more strongly on such matters. The hon. Gentleman asked about the level of fines. From memory, I think that I have written to the Ministry of Justice on the matter, but I shall check and let him know. If I have not, I shall do so because it is a fair point. However, I am pretty confident that I have.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/17">The hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby voiced concerns about the drink-driving level. As I said, that is a live issue and will continue to be so. He also raised the question, as did other colleagues, of the attitude of young men. The foundations of a pre-driving qualification course for 14 to 16-year-olds in schools and colleges are proving very popular, because people feel that they will get a credit towards their theory test and that that will make the driving test easier for them. The course also informs them about how to behave in the back of a car&mdash;about belting up and not winding up the driver, which is one of the things that motivates young drivers to go faster. All the evidence shows that if one person belts up in a car, everybody else does so automatically, but getting that one person to belt up is the focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/18">Motorcycle testing is being monitored to ensure that the risk is appropriate, balanced against the need to show competence. The distance that has to be travelled is an issue, but we are getting that down because the number of testing venues is increasing all the time. I have had several meetings with parliamentary colleagues and their constituents, and we have been able to resolve some of these issues. That puts pressure on the DSA to do its best. It is doing its best, and it is still bearing down on the question of ensuring that as many centres are available as possible. It has also been changing how driving tests are booked, because that has been a factor in reducing the availability of some test centres. Professional instructors are block-booking and then cancelling within three days. They do not get a penalty because they are cancelling within the appropriate time, but no one else can take the bookings because their use has not been planned. We are looking at all such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/19">I have seen the suggestion for cyclists from the Mayor. As a cyclist, I am interested, and as a Minister, I and my colleagues look at all the submissions that come in during a consultation. We shall come forward with responses in due course. Transport for London is trialling motorcycles in bus lanes for 18 months, in line with what many other local authorities have done. We shall look at the evidence with interest in due course. I was comfortable with getting TfL into line&mdash;the Mayor made the right decision there&mdash;and that is the advice we have been giving London for some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/20">Finally, I turn to intelligent speed adaptation&mdash;another issue on which we run a big risk of being attacked by the lobby that thinks the Government are anti-motoring. We are not, and the other main parties are not anti-motoring. We are pro-road safety, and if we can improve road safety through different initiatives, we would do that. If a tiny minority of people in the motoring community or fraternity&mdash;whom I would loosely call the &quot;petrolheads&quot;&mdash;accuse us of being anti-motoring, I would accuse them of being anti-road safety. Intelligent speed adaptation could be a powerful tool. I have been in a TfL car and seen ISA working, on a voluntary and on a compulsory basis. The voluntary ISA looks simple and useful as a tool for giving people information. It can use the global positioning system to determine the speed limit in a given area, and a warning device says whether people are going over the speed limit. It will be a tool that those who sell cars can use, just as they are starting to get to grips with other safety devices. They can use them to sell to car buyers, particularly parents buying a first car for a young son or daughter who has just passed their test. The latest technology such as stability control and ABS costs no more than &pound;500. A parent will spend that in order to know that their child, who does not have a lot of experience behind the wheel, has all the technological advances to help keep that car on the road if they have to brake fiercely and need protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/21">The technology is improving and motor manufacturers and traders are learning more and starting to promote safe cars, just as they are learning about environmental issues and promoting green cars. They will use ISA to sell vehicles, particularly to parents. The top end of the market now automatically carries such features, which will move down through the rest of the market. European legislation will force manufacturers and traders to do that by the middle of the next decade in any case, so why should they not jump ahead of the game and introduce them earlier?</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/22">As I said at the outset of the debate and in beginning my closing remarks, in my view the issue is not party political, but there are disagreements and differences of opinion about how we can improve the situation. We have all contributed, along with all the people on the front line out there, who are doing the real, hard work of making sure that people are protected as best as is possible. We shall continue to debate the issues and to come up with the best possible solutions.</p>
