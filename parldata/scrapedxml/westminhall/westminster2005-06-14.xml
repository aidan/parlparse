<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.1.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" speakername="Nick Harvey" colnum="1"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h01.htm#50614h01_spnew0">
	<p pid=".1.3/1">I am delighted to have this opportunity to return yet again to the subject of water bills in the south-west, which has been debated many times in this House, most recently by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1883" name="Matthew Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor)</phrase>, who introduced an Adjournment debate on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-01">1 February</phrase>. Following on from that debate, there is a meeting tomorrow between Water Voice South West and the Minister responsible for water at which the consumer body will yet again put the case for action to alleviate the high water bills in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/2">On a point of record, I feel that I must go over some old ground. In 1989&mdash;the time of privatisation of the water companies&mdash;there was not a huge disparity between water bills in different regions. The industry average was &pound;120 a year, and the south-west, at &pound;147 a year, was about 20 per cent. above the average. That was not the highest figure&mdash;two regions paid more&mdash;but figures for all regions were relatively close together. Rolling forward to this year, the industry average is &pound;264, but the south-west is paying &pound;400, which is much the highest. The gap between the highest and the lowest figures has become enormous and the situation has got progressively worse over those years.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/3">The reasons for that are fairly well known. In the first instance, the costs of cleaning up the coastline and of sewage processes at the coastline placed a huge capital burden on South West Water&mdash;the company and its customers had to pay the costs of that clean-up. Broadly speaking, the clean-up is complete, and certain expectations have been raised that, following that completion, the south-west can anticipate water bills returning to what is the norm for the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/4">South West Water is now telling Ofwat and customers that, although it has completed the clean sweep programme, it has put in place a lot of new infrastructure, which will need to be maintained and supported over the years to come and will therefore cost money. Additionally, there are all the capital burdens placed on South West Water&mdash;as on all water companies&mdash;in terms of drinking water quality, the amount lost through leaking pipes and security of supply. Therefore, the company cannot make good its promise to charge a price nearer the national average.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/5">Indeed, in addition to South West Water customers already paying by far the highest bills in the country, the periodic review in December, which covered the next five years, has placed on top of the highest bills much the highest yearly rises. It is not scaremongering or causing alarm to predict that, unless something is done, at the end of that five-year period South West Water will produce another eminently plausible programme for the following five years, which will be a reason why a further fortune must be spent and why bills must get higher. Everyone is paying higher water bills.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/6">As I went round my constituency, I found that water rates and the council tax were the two biggest issues on the doorstep. It was quite different from other elections: despite all the previous rumpus, I heard much less about hunting and Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/7">The two things on voters' minds were water rates and council tax: that is fair enough, because we hold elections at a time of year when both those bills have only just arrived on people's doorsteps, and they will be at the forefront of their thinking, but in my experience those bills both caused anger bordering on rage. The council tax is undergoing a substantive Government review, and in any event I think that voters in the south-west understand that the whole country finds the council tax burden unacceptable. What is unique about the water rates is the fact that customers in the south-west are carrying so much more of a burden than those in other parts of the country. That, I think, has given rise to such a degree of rage.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/8">In addition to the fact that water bills in the south-west are the highest, it is essential to point out that Devon and Cornwall have the lowest incomes in England. The highest burden therefore falls on those least able to carry it. It is well known that many people in Devon and Cornwall are of retirement age and live on fixed incomes. In particular, pensioners find that an unacceptably high proportion of their disposable income is going on their water bills. Each year they receive a modest state pension increase, but their water bills and the council tax between them more than eat up the entire rise. Indeed, on occasion, either increase might do it alone.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/9">In my view, it is a gross injustice that these enormous bills are being paid by people on small incomes, and the time has come for the Government to intervene. Various options are open, but too much time has passed and it is now incumbent on them to decide how to tackle the problem&mdash;and to get on and do it.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/10">We saw the problem coming when the water privatisation legislation was making its way through the House in 1988. My hon. Friend the Member for Truro and St. Austell said:</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/11" class="indent">&quot;I hope that the Minister can assure the people of Cornwall that they will not be expected to meet all the costs of cleaning up the beaches, which are used by citizens of the UK and Europe, purely because the Government through their ideological approach are cutting off the potential to obtain money in other ways.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="1988-12-08">8 December 1988</phrase>; Vol. 143, c. 536.]</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/12">That problem, which was anticipated from the outset, is probably far worse than even the most anxious commentators suggested at the time.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/13">Water Voice, which is meeting the Minister tomorrow, will, I am sure, invite him to cast his mind back to the Water Charges Equalisation Act 1977. It was enacted by a Labour Government, who recognised the problem caused by disparities in water bills across the country. Those on any benefit receive uniform support to help to pay their bills, but water bills have become hugely different from one region to another. The Act imposed a levy on each regional water company. The money went into a central pot and was then rebated out to water companies to help them with some of their capital costs. The net effect should have been to get water bills as near to equal as could be achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/14">The 1977 Act was repealed in 1983 by the Conservative Government, who thought that it created perverse incentives, rewarded inefficiency and levied charges on efficient companies while handing out money to the inefficient. Several years later came water privatisation. Some would say that privatisation makes it impossible, impractical or undesirable to go back to the principle of water charges equalisation. I believe that the opposite is the case and that the fact of privatisation may make equalisation a better idea than it was when everything was in public hands. If we continued with a system of periodic reviews by Ofwat, and if in addition to considering price issues Ofwat imposed a levy of the kind I am describing, the company would know where it stood for the forthcoming five-year period. Furthermore, it would still have all the incentives to improve its efficiency and to do better than the figures&mdash;in effect, the targets&mdash;that had been set so as to make a return for its shareholders.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/15">It is perfectly feasible to move to the equalisation principle despite privatisation. There are many sectors in which private companies compete, but where they do so on a regulated playing field. In the rail industry, for example, different operators work on the basis of completely different financial relationships with the Government: some involve rail companies paying in while others involve the opposite. The fact that the ownership of companies has transferred to the private sector does not prevent a return to the principle of water charges equalisation. I very much hope that when representatives of Water Voice come to the Department tomorrow to put those points to the Government, they are given a good hearing.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/16">There are alternatives. The Government could, for example, grant aid some capital works, which would impose a new charge on taxpayers. Some might argue that it would be fairer in principle for the taxpayer rather than the water customer to meet such capital costs, because taxation is a fairer system of raising money than water charges. Frankly, I am not pushing one method or another. I am telling the Government that there is a huge issue here; it has been bubbling and simmering for years and it is coming to the boil. They must consider the various options and take action now to ensure that a huge injustice is put right.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/17">At various times, my hon. Friends have argued for the water tariff to shift from the old rating system, which was abolished many years ago because it was discredited, and from using valuations that are years and years out of date. Instead, they argued, it should be based on the council tax. That would have the advantage that the council tax benefits system could be used to help those on very low incomes to meet their water charges. Although that idea had merit at the time, we very much hope that the council tax itself is about to be abolished, and it would be no solution to the water problem to attach the water tariff to another local government finance system that is on its way out. That would simply be to repeat the mistake of attaching the tariff to the old rateable values.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/18">Alternatively, action could be targeted specifically on those on low or fixed incomes. I do not believe that that is a complete solution, because the burdens are unfair on everybody, but it would certainly make a welcome start if the Government targeted aid on those most in need of it. As I said, benefits are calculated on a national basis, but the bills that people have to pay differ significantly from one area to another. By the end of the current period, South West Water households will be paying an average of &pound;444&mdash;2 per cent. of their disposable income, compared with a national average of 1.1 per cent. A single-pensioner household living on the minimum pension credit and paying an average South West Water bill might end up paying 7 per cent. of their disposable income on water and sewerage charges by the end of that period.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/19">In March 2004, the Secretary of State said in her guidance that she would be reviewing how lower-income households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. We have to hope very much that something emerges to address the most desperate cases.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/20">Overall, although average water bills have risen since 1994, they now make up a smaller percentage of household income than they did then. However, the opposite is true in the south-west, where 21.6 per cent. of households spend more than 3 per cent. of their disposable income on water and sewerage&mdash;that is heading towards 30 per cent., compared with a national average of 7.9 per cent.&mdash;so there is a huge disparity between the south-west and other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/21">Representatives of Water Voice will put other issues to the Minister tomorrow. It is particularly keen for those who cause problems that lead to high sewerage bills to pay towards the costs that they create. I will leave that issue for Water Voice, but I think it makes a good point in some cases.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/22">Highway drainage gets into the sewerage infrastructure, which invariably causes problems. It is particularly unpleasant for householders who get on the wrong end of the back-up of an unsavoury cocktail, as I have found when I have had to deal with issues of small, localised flooding in my constituency. Some of my constituents suffer repeatedly. They know that virtually every winter the hatches in their floors will rise and various unmentionables will appear in their houses. Highway drainage getting into sewerage infrastructure is a huge problem, although resolving it will lead to the additional capital costs that I have described.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/23">Metering is also an issue. Hon. Members whose constituents come to their surgeries expressing horror at the size of their water bills are likely to recommend meters if they think their constituents will benefit from them. In England and Wales, 26 per cent. of customers have water meters, with the local variations from 61 per cent. in Essex to 5 per cent. in Portsmouth. Among the larger companies, only Anglian Water has a majority of customers&mdash;54 per cent.&mdash;using meters. Water Voice takes the view that in the long term most customers should pay on the basis of a metered supply, but that lower-income customers should receive help through the benefits and tax credit systems.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/24">The Government need to introduce an explicit link between the tax and benefit systems and water charges if anyone is to be convinced that targeted help really is being produced through the system to provide some comfort. Every time somebody takes on a water meter, that increases the pressure on the price that has to be paid by the rest of the customer base, so it can become a problem.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/25">In the south-west, there are many second homes and holiday homes. Astute owners of such homes waste little time in getting meters because they use little water and therefore pay low bills. However, in parts of my constituency many such homes are in idyllic spots miles from anywhere, with beautiful coastal views, and massive infrastructure expenses are incurred in providing water and sewerage services to them. In some instances, therefore, the houses that are the most cost-intensive to supply pay the lowest bills. That is another anomaly that needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/26">I am delighted that a number of my hon. Friends and other hon. Members from the south-west are here for the debate. That demonstrates the strength of feeling on the issue. We have returned fresh from an election in which water and sewerage services were undoubtedly a major issue. The Government need to be told, and the purpose of the debate is to draw to their attention the strength of feeling in the south-west on that issue and the sincere belief that the situation has gone on for too long.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/27">There are options, each with differing merits, and it is for the Government to decide which solutions have the most appeal. However, they cannot just leave the situation to drift on and on. They are turning into rebels and protestors people whom they would not normally expect to take to the streets and march, but that is where we will be headed if nothing is done. There is an immense need for action soon.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/28">The public are very aware of this unfairness. Thanks to the good offices of the regional media&mdash;the <i>Western Morning News</i> and our regional television and radio companies&mdash;there is a high awareness of the disparity between bills in the south-west and those in the rest of the country. There is a good understanding of the issues involved and of why some expenses have mounted up, but the public are absolutely determined that there should be change.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/29">I look forward to hearing from the Minister that the Government have got the message and that substantial change is on its way.</p>

	<p pid=".5.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Taylor. As is customary, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> on securing this Adjournment debate and on picking this particular subject. As he rightly said, it preoccupied us&mdash;Labour Members as well as his hon. Friends&mdash;a lot during the last Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/2">I welcome my hon. Friend the Minister, as this is the first occasion on which I have had the opportunity to engage in debate with him. I think I am right in saying that he recorded either the only Labour gain, or one of two Labour gains, in the 2001 election. That was quite a feat, but holding his seat with an increased majority at the last election was quite remarkable. I hope he deploys in the Department the undoubted skills that he showed in the general election, particularly on the issue that we are considering today.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/3">I would like to point out at the beginning that only the Labour manifesto mentioned water at all. On page 28, we gave a categorical undertaking that we would</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/4" class="indent">&quot;work to tackle diffuse water pollution through addressing impacts across water catchments without the costs falling on water customers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/5">In the context of the very large charges that we are talking about, that is, in some respects, a small issue, but it is an important signal that the Government are beginning to recognise the pressure that hon. Members have put on them on the matter of water charges in the south-west. I like to think that such recognition has resulted not only from lobbying by hon. Members, but, in particular, from lobbying brought to bear on Ministers&mdash;in particular the Minister for Climate Change and the Environment&mdash;by me and by Candy Atherton, the former Member for Falmouth and Camborne.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/6">I remind the House that there was a proposal to move the office of Water Voice in the south-west from Exeter, and I want to record my thanks for the Minister's intervention, which followed his meeting with me and the former Member for Falmouth and Camborne, and my request to meet the chair of the national Water Voice committee with a delegation from the local Water Voice committee, and to meet Ofwat about the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/7">I pay tribute to the work of Noel Olsen, the current chair, and to his members for the work they have been doing to represent water consumers. I refer in particular to the help that he gave me in our fight to ensure that proper attention was paid to the sewage smells from Cattedown treatment works and those at Camels Head and Keyham, which continue to have problems. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">my new hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> will fight that corner, assisted by the new code of practice and the good practice guide, which emerged from the clarification we sought of the law in that regard. I also thank Mr. Olsen for his help in seeing that the regulator ensured that the cost of rectifying the flaw in the original design of the treatment works&mdash;the figure involved was more than &pound;1 million&mdash;was not passed on to water users.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/8">I am sure that the Minister will remind the House of the Government's success during the previous Parliament in keeping water charges down. Nevertheless, as the hon. Member for North Devon pointed out, and as I pointed out in the Adjournment debates that I initiated in the previous Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-10">10 November 2004</phrase> and in December 2001, the price hikes, added to the higher-than-average burden dating back to the 1989 privatisation, are unsustainable in terms of Government policy on tackling poverty and intolerable for individual constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/9">In my previous Adjournment debate, I said that I thought the review being carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs would be challenged to come up with answers within the current regulatory framework. That comment has turned out to be right. A pilot scheme linked to the warm front programme was announced. It emerged from the cross-Government review of water affordability and will introduce targeted assistance for lower-income households. Also, it will take place in the south-west. I am not sure from the hon. Gentleman's remarks whether he has come across that initiative. It will help lower-income households to access all the assistance available and it will help metered customers to use water more efficiently.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/10">The scheme will also promote the vulnerable groups regulations. I say to the Minister that I continue to be disappointed at the take-up in that regard. The regulations are limited in how they can help our constituents, because to qualify someone has to have a defined medical condition or be on a defined benefit and have three children. Even though considerable lobbying has been done on take-up, in 2001&ndash;02 only 4,716 people were in receipt of benefit through those regulations on the social tariff. According to the answer to a written question that I received on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase>, that figure has gone up to 7,202, but it is still derisory, considering the number of our constituents who are in real hardship and struggling to pay these bills.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/11">I have paid tribute to Noel Olsen and I understood his anger and that of Water Voice&mdash;indeed, I think hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber share their concern&mdash;but it was a bit cheap to deride the water pilot as merely putting hippos into cisterns, because there is a great deal more to it than that. One benefit of the scheme is that it will demonstrate clearly what we see in our surgeries all the time&mdash;the great hardship experienced by our constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".5.2/12">In the debate that I initiated last November, I mentioned a plethora of potential solutions that needed to be examined, some of which the hon. Member for North Devon referred to this morning. In particular, we need to consider how owners of second homes could pay a fairer share. I think Water Voice shares that view. The hon. Gentleman feels&mdash;more as a vain hope than anything else&mdash;that the council tax will be abolished. I do not think that will happen. Following the balance of funding review, I hope there will be major changes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" speakername="Richard Burden" colnum="25"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".25.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce this debate on an issue of huge importance not just to my constituents but to the whole of the midlands and beyond. At the start, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Deputy Minister for Women and Equality on her appointment to the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/2">Last Friday I attended a meeting held by the administrators PricewaterhouseCoopers for MG Rover's creditors. The creditors heard that they were unlikely to get much, perhaps even any, of their money back. I doubt that many will have been surprised by that, but there was a clear message from that meeting that they wanted some answers. My constituents, and the 6,100 former MG Rover workers, also want some answers.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/3">The problem is not so much the fact that MG Rover was unable to survive. Everybody knew that for a long-term future, the company needed a partner. That was clearly and openly stated when Phoenix took over in 2000. It was equally clear at that time that there was never any guarantee that that would happen. The issue is much more the manner in which the collapse took place, and what led up to it. Why did the talks with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which had been presented as far advanced, finally come to nothing? What happened about intellectual property rights, and had people been misled? Was there something fundamentally wrong with how Phoenix Venture Holdings had structured the businesses and run their affairs?</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/4">I am pleased that the Secretary of State has launched a thorough investigation. I know that some had political motives for rubbishing that investigation before it had even started, but I do not think that my constituents will be any more prepared to allow themselves to be used for such party political posturing than they were during the election. They simply want the truth, so I ask the Minister to confirm today that there will be no no-go areas for the investigation, and that the intention is for its results to be made public.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/5">I advise some caution on the part of those who are now attacking the fact that Phoenix ever took over Longbridge following BMW's withdrawal in 2000, but who welcomed it, or even claimed credit for it, at the time. On the other side of the fence, I also urge some humility on the part of the &quot;we told you so&quot; brigade, including people who for a variety of reasons&mdash;some probably linked to self-interest&mdash;lobbied against Phoenix in 2000 and who relentlessly briefed against the company in public and in private thereafter.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/6">Of course there were real questions, which emerged over the past four years, about the actions of the Phoenix directors. I have asked them a number of those questions to their faces in the past four years, but I must say that the endless scattergun stream of anti-Rover stories that have appeared in the press probably ended up getting in the way of proper scrutiny rather than promoting it. It also undoubtedly encouraged a bunker mentality on the part of the company. Whatever the Phoenix four may have been responsible for, I also believe that the endless public belittling of MG Rover by its detractors played a role in depressing both sales and confidence and in hastening the company's demise. Make no mistake, there is still real anger about that among former MG Rover employees.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/7">I would also caution against the selective amnesia of those who claim that Phoenix took over Rover only because the Government somehow forced BMW to choose it in preference to a rival bid from the Alchemy venture capital firm. It is true that the Government, supported by the unions and local politicians including me, encouraged BMW to talk to Phoenix and seriously consider its bid rather than maintain exclusive negotiations with Alchemy.</p>
	<p pid=".25.1/8">However, we must remember that the Phoenix deal was done overnight on 8 and <phrase class="date" code="2000-05-09">9 May 2000</phrase>. Alchemy had pulled out of its negotiations with BMW on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-28">28 April</phrase>, when it still had exclusive negotiating rights, so when Phoenix took over in May, the alternative was closure, with many more thousands of job losses even than there have been this year. Although the Phoenix deal meant that MG Rover workers had five years' pay that they would not have had if the plant had closed in 2000, one of the tragedies and injustices of the collapse has been that those workers have now lost their jobs, having bought the time for others to keep theirs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.27.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" speakername="Richard Burden" colnum="27"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew6">
	<p pid=".27.1/1">The hon. Lady pre-empts something that I was going to say a little later&mdash;but I am not sure whether 200 is the correct number for those affected by the Phoenix pension fund. In fact, several of those people would be secure in the BMW pension fund, but the principle behind the issue that she raises is important.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/2">I am pleased that the Phoenix directors appear to be taking up a suggestion that I put to them last year at the Trade and Industry Committee by putting the remaining assets of Phoenix Venture Holdings into a trust for employees. It would also be useful to know if any funds are left in the company Techtronic. However, if the Phoenix four are concerned about how history will judge them, which I am sure they are, they also need to contribute from what they awarded themselves.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/3">It would be arrogant for anyone with an involvement in or after 2000 not to consider whether the courses of action that we took then were the right ones, or for anyone to take the view that it was all everyone else's fault. I do not believe, however, that the unions, or any of us, were wrong to look for an alternative to the massive downsizing or closure of Longbridge. Nor do I believe that it was wrong to try to buy time for the region to adjust, or to allow time for a partner to be sought to secure the future of Longbridge. The Labour Government were right not to turn their back on Rover in 2000, as the Tories turned their backs on so much manufacturing in the 1980s. Indeed, what has happened in the past five years does not indicate that there was too much Government intervention in 2000. Perhaps there should have been more.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/4">The days of old-style intervention and nationalisation are long gone, and rightly so, but I ask Ministers to consider the possibility that those of us who have argued at different times in the past five years for the Government to consider acquiring a strategic stake in the company, or other forms of leverage, may have had a point. Perhaps that could have played a role in allowing greater transparency and more investment in new products without falling foul of European Union rules, and perhaps even boosted MG Rover's credibility in its search for international partnerships.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/5">Public authorities should reflect on how their own procurement policies hastened MG Rover's demise. Why do we so rarely see a British police car that has been built in Britain, such as a Rover or a Jaguar, when one would never see a French police car built anywhere but France, or a German police car built outside Germany?</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/6">I do, however, pay tribute to the speed with which the Government reacted to the failure of MG Rover&mdash;paying employees' wages while attempts were made to restart negotiations with SAIC, establishing the MG Rover taskforce and building on the lessons of 2000&mdash;and to the preparations made since then. Credit is also due to the members and partner agencies of the task force, led by Advantage West Midlands, for the fact that it moved so quickly to bring Jobcentre Plus, the learning and skills council, the colleges, the Department of Trade and Industry and other agencies to process redundancy payments, to draw up individual training plans and to assist with job search for employees affected, all while working with business to provide support to give companies in the supply chain a breathing space to react to the collapse. I am sure that the Minister will give the figures on that, so I shall not take up time doing so here.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/7">I also pay tribute to all those, including Birmingham city council's neighbourhood office staff and the staff of other statutory agencies and the voluntary sector, who have staffed helplines and provided support at a human level to the employees. Particular mention, however, must be made of the contribution made by the trade unions, especially by stewards who were also employees of MG Rover and of other affected companies, and who have experienced the same uncertainties and pain as those whom they are trying to help and advise.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/8">Let us not forget the families of MG Rover workers, led by Gemma Cartwright, whose efforts remind us all that this is not only about Longbridge the workplace, but about the communities that rely on it. Most of the challenges that they face still lie ahead. I hope that everyone will do what they can to build on the support that they have established.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/9">Before I finish, I shall mention some of the issues that remain to be resolved and some of the lessons for the future, which I ask the Minister to address in her winding-up speech. Conflicting provisions in benefit rules and redundancy regulations have been shown to get in the way of doing the right thing by employees with regard to pay in lieu of notice and in the speedy processing of protective awards claims. Those provisions have also been a disincentive to people obtaining new jobs until they know that the awards have been paid. That cannot be right, and needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/10">We need to reconsider the operation of barriers, such as the 16-hour rule in particular, that prevent people on benefits from accessing training. There has been a creative approach to that with those affected by the MG Rover collapse, but a more fundamental review is required if we are to promote rather than restrict flexibility and security in the labour market, and if we are to breed a culture that actively encourages people on benefits to learn and retrain rather than discouraging them. The taskforce needs to track how successful the training input is in creating opportunities for people to return to work. Incidentally, I also ask the Minister to ensure that the money for the exercise comes through properly, and does not get caught up in bureaucratic boundary disputes between Departments.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/11">Thirdly, what happened to MG Rover has underlined why the Government were right to establish the Pension Protection Fund, but has also highlighted issues regarding the PPF rules. That relates to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">the point that the hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> made. I am pleased that Ministers have made it clear that they are determined to overcome the problems, and like the hon. Lady, I ask them to address the potentially perverse impact on people who have already taken early retirement.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/12">MG Rover is an issue of significance to the entire west midlands and beyond. Many of the challenges for component manufacturers are yet to be felt, as emergency assistance starts to come to an end. The epicentre, however, is south-west Birmingham, whose identity has always been intertwined with Longbridge. It is an area with a massive concentration of MG Rover workers and their families, which means that it faces extraordinary challenges ahead, not just for months but for years. Although a lot has been done to diversify the west midlands and reduce its reliance on MG Rover in the past five years, a lot more remains to be done in the areas immediately surrounding the plant.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/13">It is surprising that despite the instability of MG Rover, south-west Birmingham is one of the few areas of the city that is not designated as a regeneration zone by the regional development agency. That creates ongoing problems for the area in accessing regeneration and other investment. The funding mechanisms available to south-west Birmingham need to reassessed, to upskill the people and to provide real opportunities, including physical opportunities, for redevelopment. Such issues should be at the forefront of Ministers' minds when they make decisions&mdash;for example, about how the Lyons review is implemented. I hope that they will respond positively to the exciting suggestion of creating a national centre for nanotechnology at the Longbridge site, and to the ideas about how the royal centre for defence medicine in Birmingham can develop.</p>
	<p pid=".27.1/14">As for the future of car making at Longbridge, I ask Ministers to bear in mind the fact that the administrators have confirmed that three credible bidders are interested in MG sports car-based production, and that two may be interested in more extensive car production. Nobody should raise false hopes about the scale of what may be possible, and I do not want to do that. However, I would be grateful if my hon. Friend the Minister would confirm that the Government will do everything they can to help retain sustainable car production at Longbridge, particularly as it becomes increasingly clear that the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation's acquisition of certain intellectual property rights for Rover cars and Powertrain engines means that a possible, if different, joint arrangement with a car producer at Longbridge could still make a great deal of sense. If my hon. Friend the Minister could give some comfort on that subject, I am sure that people in Longbridge and throughout the west midlands would be very pleased to hear it.</p>

	<p pid=".31.0/1">Proof is always difficult to get from this Government, because they try to hide from it most of the time. However, it is worth reviewing what was said at the time by the then Secretary of State, the right hon. Member for North Tyneside. He said that he was happy, and continued:</p>
	<p pid=".31.0/2" class="indent">&quot;I would like to add my personal congratulations to John Towers for the way in which he pulled the consortium together and brought what I know have been difficult negotiations to a successful conclusion, he has been determined and dogged in the face of hostility and criticism. His personal strengths will be invaluable to the Phoenix consortium.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".31.0/3">How very prescient that was, certainly when it came to Mr. Towers' own pocket.</p>

	<p pid=".31.0/5" class="indent">&quot;we have taken an active role to facilitate the commercial negotiations over the future of Rover . . .

	<p pid=".32.8/1">I am sorry, but I shall not take any more interventions for the time being, as it is not fair to other hon. Members who wish to take part in the debate. <i>[Interruption.]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">My hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> says that I have been very generous. I agree.</p>
	<p pid=".32.8/2">Just this morning I got an answer from the Minister in charge of the Motability scheme, and it is interesting to note that there is little support for our domestic car maker there either. Of 171,638 Motability cars bought with the help of Government funds last year, just 2,606 were bought from Rover.</p>
	<p pid=".32.8/3">The company creaked on. There was a possible deal to be done with the Chinese, who basically took the Government and the PVH directors to the cleaners. They bought the intellectual property, but without the car plant, and without the future of production at Longbridge. When the Chancellor of the Exchequer went to China and failed to produce a deal, the writing was on the wall that the company would close, because without a foreign investor, it simply could not carry on.</p>
	<p pid=".32.8/4">Ministers were left in something of a dilemma. The clock was ticking towards a general election, and they did not want the whole thing to blow up just beforehand. Sadly, it became clear to them that if they could not hang on to the situation, it was much better to let it blow up early in the general election rather than closer to polling day on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-05">5 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".32.8/5">I am sure that Labour Members will not believe me, but they might believe the business editor of <i>The</i> <i>Birmingham Post</i>, John Duckers, who also made this point. In his article of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-22">22 April</phrase> he wrote that when Ministers returned from China, the Government determined that they must not have a Rover crisis breaking in the days immediately before polling day. They dared not risk that happening, so they decided to dump the ailing car giant well ahead of polling day.</p>
	<p pid=".32.8/6">John Duckers went on to quote a highly placed source:</p>
	<p pid=".32.8/7" class="indent">&quot;'The election was happening and Labour could not afford something like this towards the end of the campaign. The Pope was dying, there was the Royal wedding between Charles and Camilla and that was concentrating attention.' Labour, he said, had to keep the issue controlled and so news management went into overdrive. No one is suggesting that the MG Rover might have necessarily been saved, but, it is maintained, the Government chose when it was to go down&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".32.8/8">I agree with that, bearing in mind the fact that the previous Secretary of State announced that the company would be going into receivership before the board had even decided that it would. The Government's complicity in this is clear. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am not surprised that Labour Members are having a fit about complicity in selling Rover to the PVH consortium, because the record of what PVH has done, and John Towers in particular&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".33.1/1">I will not give way. I have quite enough to say, and it is worth putting it on the record, because it is important.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/2">The reason why the Government do not want to admit any culpability is that the</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/3" class="indent">&quot;tale of greed and gullibility&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/4">as the <i>Financial Times</i> puts it, that surrounds the whole episode can be laid firmly at the door of the Government and the Towers consortium. The <i>Financial Times</i> leader of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-09">Saturday 9 April</phrase> says that it is the story of</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/5" class="indent">&quot;a spineless government taken for a ride by entrepreneurs who succeeded only in enriching themselves . . . This is capitalism at its ugliest . . . They&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/6">the PVH directors&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/7" class="indent">&quot;did what any ruthless entrepreneur would have done in their situation: incentivise, strip assets, take cash out early.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/8">That is exactly what the directors did. The &pound;427 million that BMW left for the company was put into a separate account for the benefit of the directors. Then the car-making plant was charged interest on the loan that it took from the &pound;427 million. They set up a separate little company for the car loan book, in which they have a 50 per cent. share, along with the bank, and of course they sold the entire site of Longbridge from under the feet of the company. The point is that now that the company is in administration&mdash;although obviously, we hope that some resurrection can take place&mdash;they simply do not own the land on which the car production facility sits, and St. Modwen would dearly love to use the land for something other than making cars, which has not been seen to make much money recently.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/9">John Towers and his fellow directors stand firmly in the dock accused of greed, asset stripping and taking the company, the employees and the Government for a ride. There is no question about that. Indeed, one particular fact says it all. As we all know, the car company was owned by BMW. Last year, BMW made &pound;2 billion, but its chairman, Helmut Panke, earns less than John Towers pays himself in a company that has never made a penny during the five years for which he has been in charge.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/10">It is interesting to note that when the previous Secretary of State was at the Birmingham motor show in May 2004, she defended the sums that the Rover directors had been awarding themselves. She said:</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/11" class="indent">&quot;I am very pleased with Rover's performance and I look forward to going to their stand to look at the new redesigned Rover 45. There was a very big risk involved when setting up Rover again when it looked likely to come to the end of the road for car manufacturing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/12">Quite what risks the PVH directors took, I find it difficult to establish, but their greed is clearly established, as is their &pound;16.5 million personal pension pot.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/13">Meanwhile, the other Rover car workers still face the worry about what will happen to their pension savings. That is one issue that I hope the Minister will do more to clarify, because there is considerable uncertainty. I have received written answers saying that the Government &quot;believe&quot; or that it is &quot;expected&quot; that something will happen, but there is no certainty that the Pension Protection Fund will kick in to protect the pension savings of the people represented by me and by many other hon. Members in the Chamber. We would like more clarity on that subject.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/14">As my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden said, we would also like the Minister to make clear the position of the workers who retired early, who feel particularly vulnerable about the application to the Pension Protection Fund. If that is the way forward, it will severely reduce their expected living standards.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/15">I would also be grateful if the Minister could establish for us how there can be an application to the Pension Protection Fund when the holding company of PVH is not in administration. My understanding is that until it is, there can be no application to the pension protection fund. How will we be able to engineer the moment when such an application can be made, as private assets are involved? What happens if the holding company does not go into administration? What happens to the Rover workers' pension savings, and how can we ensure that people receive the money that they have saved for their retirement? Some clarity on that issue would be particularly helpful.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/16">I understand that an inquiry is going on, but I should also be grateful if the Minister clarified whether the pension pot provided for the directors could be included in the general pension pot, so that everyone had to share the shortfall in the payout at the end of the day. Although I represent many Rover workers, I also represent many other people who are not Rover workers, but whose pensions will be subject to a levy to cover the shortfall at the plant's pension scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/17">Although I welcome that, it is grossly unfair to put a levy on other workers' pensions because funds have been stolen from the pension fund and the Rover company's assets, which rightly belong to the creditors for payment of the liabilities, and to the pension fund. It is important that we fill that pot as much as possible from the potentially stolen assets, to ensure that when we pay out on what is effectively an insurance policy, the arrangement is fair, and someone else has not run off with the money and forced the rest of us to pick up the pieces. I should be grateful if the Minister talked about that.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/18">I, too, pass on my thanks for the efforts that have gone into the taskforce. I thank all the people who manned the phone lines, organised the training and tried to establish job opportunities for people. The Minister will be aware that at the moment the job situation still looks rather bleak; slightly more than 500 people have jobs, but 6,100 people are unemployed. I hope that that situation will change and that people will be in a position to find new well-paid jobs when the redundancy money finally comes through. However, at the moment the picture is not as good as we might have hoped, bearing in mind the efforts that have been made.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/19">Will the Minister set out exactly how much money has been paid from Government funds into the taskforce? I understand that at yesterday's meeting there was a fair amount of muttering about the fact that moneys had not been forthcoming, and there was a view that the impetus from the Government had disappeared, as some weeks had passed since the general election.</p>
	<p pid=".33.1/20">Will the Minister clarify how much money has been paid over? A steady stream of my constituents have been expecting to have some training, which has not been forthcoming. They have not even been put on a training course. A good example of that arrived by e-mail just yesterday. Someone who wants to take a plastering course that costs approximately &pound;400&mdash;to learn a skill that seems highly relevant, as there is a shortage of plasterers in our region&mdash;is being turned down by the learning and skills council, which is part of the taskforce. There have been significant problems with how training has been forthcoming for many workers, although there have been some success stories.</p>

	<p pid=".35.1/1">I feel that I am eating into other people's time&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;You certainly are.&quot;] I shall simply say that I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the money position as well.</p>
	<p pid=".35.1/2">What of the future? The hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield made great play of saying that there was no future other than Phoenix Venture Holdings and the activities of the directors. However, had Alchemy taken over back in 2000, there would have been a &pound;50,000-plus pay-off for the workers. Some 2,000 people would have been employed in making MG sports cars, and suppliers would have produced component parts for MG sports cars made at Longbridge.</p>
	<p pid=".35.1/3">It is pretty sad that because we now have a fire sale, as opposed to an organised sell-off of the car plant and its land, we may well not see the resurrection of car making&mdash;not even under the very successful MG sports car brand&mdash;on the site at all. That is particularly bitter-sweet, because this year is the original Austin works' 100th anniversary, which will be celebrated in Cofton park in my constituency. The company was the pinnacle of British engineering, innovation and design over the past 100 years, and it is very sad that this particular year should see its demise. Because this is effectively a fire sale, it will be particularly difficult to resurrect the company. Nevertheless, we hope that that will be the case, and that we will have something more to celebrate by <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-08">8 July</phrase>, with that niche player coming back into the market.</p>

	<p pid=".37.2/1">Those who have seen &quot;The Rotters' Club&quot; on the television or read the book may understand a little more about my links to MG Rover. Jonathan Coe, the author of the book, which is semi-autobiographical, travelled on the same bus as me to school in my teenage years, and we used to pass the Longbridge plant. The historic importance of Leyland and MG Rover in Birmingham cannot be denied.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/2">My history with the Phoenix consortium goes back to 2000, when I brought it together. The original arrangement was that I would chair the consequent company, but from the first meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>, in the offices of Old Mutual&mdash;previously Albert E. Sharp&mdash;it was clear that John Towers did not want any community or workforce scrutiny on the board, and although there was agreement for the work force to have shares, they ended up disfranchised and the shares were essentially worthless. In April, community scrutiny was pushed out using the argument that BMW would not do the deal if community representatives remained involved. I considered what might be needed to enforce a scrutiny process in 2003; I got no external support, but did receive legal threats from one of the Phoenix Venture Holdings directors.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/3">I have been known not to be positive about John Towers and his leadership of the company for five years. However, it is wrong simply to blame the directors for today's situation. Errors were made, but it took quite a few cooks to spoil this particular broth.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/4">The insolvency caused massive problems in the west midlands, not least because it was unexpected. The deal with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation had been running smoothly for some time. It involved a payment of more than &pound;200 million to MG Rover, which would have enabled us to discover the holy grail of a stable and profitable company working as part of an international manufacturing partnership, which is what everyone sought.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/5">Insolvency is a complex aspect of company law. The issue that matters is not whether a company is insolvent on a particular day, but whether the directors believe that it will be able to pay its debts. The important legal issue is wrongful trading; if the directors believe that the company would be wrongfully trading because it could not pay its debts, it should go into some form of insolvency. If they believe that things can come good, however, it can continue trading.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/6">At a board meeting held on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-17">17 December 2004</phrase>, it was recognised that the company was balance-sheet insolvent, and therefore depended on the SAIC deal being likely to happen in order to continue trading. A letter of intent was signed on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-17">17 December 2004</phrase> that specified completion milestones. SAIC had paid &pound;37 million in September 2004 and &pound;30 million on 13th January 2005. There were people from Birmingham who had gone across to China. The deal was going forward. The intellectual property is of no value without the people who know how to do things. One could not do anything in isolation.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/7">This is where the Department of Trade and Industry got involved. Obviously, the company was burning cash, and a bridging loan was needed to handle its position until the Chinese Government could go through the regulatory processes and agree the deal. A due diligence exercise was undertaken by the DTI's accountants and lawyers, and the facility was approved in principle. Loan documentation was prepared and circulated. Within that period, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February 2005</phrase>, a revised letter of intent was signed by SAIC, Nanjing Automotive, the company and PVH, agreeing to a further cash amount of &pound;201.5 million, which would be paid progressively over a period.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase> in Shanghai&mdash;which was <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April</phrase> in Birmingham&mdash;the DTI indicated to the Phoenix directors that they did not think that the conditions they had set for providing the loan would be achieved. Without the loan, the deal with SAIC could not go through. As soon as the deal with SAIC was unlikely to happen, the company was in wrongful trading. That is the key issue: how we got from a position in which a deal would have sorted everything out, to one where it went all wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/9">There were a few very odd things that came from the DTI&mdash;and this is where, to an extent, I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1460" name="Julie Kirkbride">the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)</phrase>, although I disagree with her idea that we always knew we would end up here. I very much agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> said about there being no no-go areas for the inquiry, and the idea that nationally, MG Rover has been talked down. It was not the case that we always knew that we would be here. It would have been entirely possible for the deal with SAIC to continue. The fact that the interest there remains shows that that was entirely possible.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/10">I now come to the odd behaviour of the Department of Trade and Industry. The first thing was going public about the bridging loan on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April</phrase>. That was a massively sensitive piece of information. It had the effect of undermining credibility in the company, of increasing the working capital requirement by about &pound;50 million, and of leading traders to refuse to trade with the company the following week. That information should not have been made public.</p>
	<p pid=".37.2/11">Secondly, the DTI announced that the company was going into administration. It is not up to the DTI to make that sort of decision. It is not up to the DTI Minister to tell the company to go into administration. Ministers may have a view, but they should keep it to themselves. They should not hold a press conference saying that the company is going into administration. It is a decision for the board to take.</p>

	<p pid=".41.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is jumping from blaming the DTI to blaming someone else, while persuading us that we need an inquiry. There is something that I do not understand: around November, Government officials were in China and discussions were taking place. From then to May it was six or seven months. How long does it take, in such a situation, to know whether the business can or cannot be done? My understanding is that the Chinese were not interested after they found out that there were certain problems with the company. As for the loan that was always available, how long is a piece of string? Why jump in and out of blaming the DTI or others? The hon. Gentleman should confine himself to his original premise. Let us have an inquiry, and cut out all the rumour and innuendo, because I know no better than the hon. Gentleman does what really happened.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.41.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="41"  time="12:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew52">
	<p pid=".41.5/1">You will not be aware of what has gone on in the debate so far, Sir John, as you have only just taken the Chair, but one issue that must be considered is limiting the length of speeches in these debates, because many people have strong views and it is important that they should have the opportunity to be aired fully.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/2">This has been an important debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing it. He was right to say that there should be no no-go areas in an inquiry, and that the findings must be made public so that we can examine precisely what went wrong. I also accept his view that for those who seek to criticise the Government, there is a danger of speaking with the benefit of hindsight, to dissociate themselves from what went wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/3">I do not know the full truth of what happened, particularly in the period leading up to the acquisition of MG Rover by the Phoenix consortium. We have heard the competing claims of the hon. Members for Birmingham, Northfield and for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride). That is why it is important to have a full inquiry that examines the period and goes right back.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" name="Stephen McCabe">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe)</phrase> raised legitimate concerns about a period before that which I mentioned. Reference was made to the acquisition by BMW in the first place, and how the Honda association collapsed. Many people saw that as being a valuable association that might well have secured the future of MG Rover.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/5">There has been public debate since the tragic collapse of the company. It is worth making the point that as we argue over who is to blame and what went wrong, we ought to focus on the fact that more than 5,500 people lost their jobs, and on the impact not only on them, but on their families and the local economy, which can be devastating. The point made by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hall Green about the importance of examining whether the retraining is adequate, and whether the structures to support it are in place, is as important as examining the history.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/6">The focus so far has been on the potential culpability of the Phoenix four, whether there was wrongdoing, and the extent to which they may have profited from MG Rover. The contrast between their situation and that of the work force is stark. The Financial Reporting Council raised issues that properly require further investigation. I have no real idea whether anything sinister was involved, because so far the FRC report remains secret. It is important that at some stage, preferably sooner rather than later, it is brought into the open so that we can see what its initial conclusions are.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/7">A former director, Peter Stevens, has weighed in with accusations of naivety, muddle, mismanagement and waste. While it is right to investigate the role of the Phoenix four, there is a danger of heaping all the blame at their door when in reality the fate of Rover may&mdash;I stress the word &quot;may&quot;&mdash;have been sealed before they acquired the car maker. I fully accept <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" name="John Hemming">the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase> that a deal with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation could still have worked as a long-term association. However, many analysts reached the conclusion that the situation for Rover had looked pretty bleak for some time.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/8">We are faced with a large number of inquiries. On top of the FRC inquiry, we have the current inquiry launched by the Secretary of State and the likelihood of two Select Committee inquiries. The National Audit Office is also thinking about pursuing an inquiry. If all these inquiries are to be of lasting value, everybody must learn lessons. Centrally, the inquiries must also explore the role of Government.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/9">The strongest charge against the Government was made in <i>The Economist</i>, which described Rover as</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/10" class="indent">&quot;a classic victim of industrial policy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/11">It asserted that pinning the blame on the Phoenix four was missing the real target. The blame, according to the article, lay first with the laws of economics, and secondly,</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/12" class="indent">&quot;on the Government, whose cowardly intervention five years ago damaged the interests of the workers it said it was trying to protect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/13">That is the charge against the Government. I do not know the full story. Again, that is why an inquiry is so important.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/14">As for the economics, when the company collapsed, the world's car industry had the capacity to produce some 80 million cars and light vehicles a year, but was only producing 60 million a year. That is massive overcapacity. Most of that spare capacity is in Europe and the United States, where costs are higher and sales growth is slower than elsewhere. One could say that inevitably, a medium-sized company like MG Rover was most vulnerable in that harsh economic environment. However, many analysts have concluded that the fate of MG Rover as a volume car maker was sealed a long time ago.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/15">It is important to examine what happened in 2000. As we have heard, at that time there were two competing suitors, Alchemy and Phoenix. That is a crucial period. I have heard and listened carefully to what the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield, who was very much involved at that time, has said. It is important to examine and make public exactly what happened between March, when Alchemy was in pole position, and May, when Rover was sold to the Phoenix group.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/16">The Alchemy option, superficially, was hardly attractive. Only 20 per cent. of jobs would have been saved. But was it the only viable option for the long term? I do not know the answer, but that is a question we need to ask if we are to learn lessons from this sad story. Did the Government intervene, as some allege, swapping sides in the face of public protest? Did they favour a bid that saved jobs in the short term, but had no plan or direction to make the company viable in the long term?</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/17">What of the role of John Towers? In March 2000 he was appointed to the taskforce established to consider options for the failing company, as BMW was rapidly losing interest. Towers then became the head of the taskforce, proposing a &quot;project Phoenix&quot;. By the beginning of April, Towers had stepped down from the DTI task force to head the Phoenix consortium officially. We all know the outcome. Did the Government interfere or intervene in a way that ultimately damaged any long-term prospect of car making in the west midlands? Those are the reasons why, ultimately, we need a full inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".41.5/18">It is worth finishing with a more positive point. Many commentators have talked about the death of the British car industry. In fact, the car industry is healthy. It just happens not to be British owned. A lot of cars are being made in this country, in plants that are remarkably productive. The future, in many respects, is quite bright. We must balance that against the tragedy of this particular story. We all ought to be learning lessons here. We all ought to look at what happened over the years, at whether any of us reached wrong conclusions, and at what lessons can be learned for the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.44.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="44"  time="12:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew53">
	<p pid=".44.0/1">I echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the congratulations to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on the eloquent and sincere way in which he introduced it. It is a shame that we have to discuss the topic in an Adjournment debate in Westminster Hall, as it should have been the subject of a statement by the Secretary of State soon after the House returned. This was probably the biggest economic and industrial issue affecting the country while Parliament was dissolved for the general election, and it is shocking that the Secretary of State did not come to the Dispatch Box to set out clearly what had happened and give the House a chance to question him on it.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/2">As we have seen from today's debate, there has been a catalogue of mistakes that go back over many years and have resulted in the terrible tragedy that we see before us. Although hon. Members have spoken from different perspectives, what has come across is the fact that they are all speaking with a genuine interest in their constituents&mdash;people who were employees of Rover or whose livelihood depended on it&mdash;and with a tremendous commitment to their communities.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/3">Above all, the issue is tragic for the work force, who have lost their livelihood and find that their pensions are under threat. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" name="Caroline Spelman">my hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs. Spelman)</phrase> said, it is tragic for those who have already retired and now face tremendous insecurity, as they do not know how their pensions will be paid. It is a tragedy, too, for the creditors and dealers, some of whom will be driven out of business. A number have already closed down, and it is likely that others will follow&mdash;people who did nothing other than their best to sell Rover cars.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/4">Of course we welcome the rescue package, but we would be grateful if the Minister could clarify whether all the money is new money or whether it has been diverted from other funding packages that were already in place in Birmingham and the west midlands more generally, or elsewhere. I also endorse <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the call from the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> that the Financial Reporting Council report should be published. When it was handed over to the Secretary of State, it was made clear that it contained issues that the Department of Trade and Industry would want to address. The House should see exactly what Sir Bryan Nicholson's report concluded, so that we can understand fully what more needs to be assessed.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/5">We welcome the decision to have a full investigation, but the inquiry must also consider the actions of the DTI and to what extent they might have contributed to the closure of Rover. After all, it is only just over a year ago that the former Secretary of State defended the &pound;31 million bonuses paid to the Phoenix four, in words that bear repeating:</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/6" class="indent">&quot;I am very pleased with Rover's performance. There were very big risks involved in starting up Rover again when it looked as if it would be the end of the road . . . Company directors who take big risks and achieve big successes deserve big rewards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/7">Would the Minister care to endorse those words today, or has she changed the Department's mind from paying tribute to John Towers and his colleagues in such a fulsome way?</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/8">The report needs to consider historically what happened when Phoenix took over. As has been explained today, we want to know the detail of why the Phoenix solution was preferred to Alchemy. We also need to know why the BMW pension fund was not ring-fenced, so that the people who were entitled to expect that they would benefit from it can understand why the money is not available.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/9">The main issue that the investigation should look into is the handling of the situation as it moved towards its final stages. It is my understanding that in the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">Tuesday 5 April</phrase>, directors of MG Rover and solicitors were meeting at Longbridge. When they finished that meeting, they believed that they had an agreement for the &pound;100 million loan. It is also my understanding that the then Secretary of State had cleared time in her diary later that Tuesday to announce formally that the &pound;100 million loan had been agreed. It is also clear that the DTI press office briefed the media earlier in the week that the loan was almost in the bag. The press coverage that resulted from that actually made matters worse: it increased the pressure on the company as more creditors came forward seeking to be paid.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/10">What happened to change the Government's mind on the loan between the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">Tuesday 5 April</phrase> and the Secretary of State's decision later that day to cancel the formal announcement of the loan package? Will the Minister confirm that the Government changed the nature of the loan that they were prepared to provide, and it became a loan for two months rather than six months? Will she confirm that when that was made clear to Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, it backed out of the deal because that was not acceptable?</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/11">Will the Minister also confirm that at about 9 o'clock on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">Thursday 7 April</phrase>, PricewaterhouseCoopers was informed of the likelihood that it would be called in, not as a receiver, but to advise the company on its situation? Will she confirm that just one hour later, the Secretary of State announced on national television that MG Rover had entered administration? In the words of John Duckers, the business editor of <i>The Birmingham Post</i>,</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/12" class="indent">&quot;No one is suggesting that MG Rover might have necessarily been saved, but, it is maintained, the Government chose when it was to go down&mdash;not the company's chairman, Mr Towers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/13">What happened during that hour? Which other parties had been informed of the insolvency before the Secretary of State declared it on national television?</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/14">Will the Minister publish a report, or even better a transcript, of the discussions that took place that Thursday evening between the Secretary of State, or other DTI Ministers and officials, and senior Rover management? Is not it the case that Mr. Towers told the then Secretary of State, &quot;If the loan is not agreed, we will have to call in the receivers,&quot; not, &quot;We are calling in the receivers&quot;? That is a fundamental difference. As the Minister will be aware, the Secretary of State's announcement would in any case have brought about the collapse of Rover, because by Friday morning, the demands from creditors had made receivership inevitable.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/15">Finally, does the Minister understand the cynicism of people such as John Duckers, who believe that it suited the Government's purpose to bring forward the closure of the company so that it happened in the early stages of the election campaign, not in the middle or final stages? To counter those suspicions, will she arrange for the internal documents from the DTI, the Treasury and No. 10 to be made public so that the full process and the timings can be understood?</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/16">This is one of the biggest industrial disasters of recent years. Of course, massive responsibility lies in the hands of the directors of Phoenix Venture Holdings, but the Government's hands are not clean either. Nothing less than a full inquiry into the role of the company and Ministers, with all the findings made public, will reassure MG Rover's former employers and its creditors that the Government acted in the company's best interests. I urge the Minister to agree to that demand today.</p>

	<p pid=".46.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> on securing this important debate. His work and consistent advocacy on behalf of his constituents and others who have been affected should be commended.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/2">First and most importantly, I want to express my profound sympathy for all those who have been affected. The appointment of administrators to MG Rover on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase> was a huge blow to the company's employees, their families, the local community and companies that did business with MG Rover. The impact of its failure has been felt up and down the supply chain among suppliers and retailers. It has been felt most deeply in the west midlands, including in my hon. Friend's constituency and the constituencies of other hon. Members present, but it has also spread to other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/3">The shock was all the greater because for most of the employees, the collapse of MG Rover was somewhat unexpected at that point. Although the company's fundamental difficulties were well known, and the DTI had been tracking its fortunes since autumn 2004, the hopes of a deal with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation had been strong until that week. There was no reason to doubt the seriousness of the corporation's intent. Indeed, the Government had made it clear to the corporation and the Chinese Government that we supported a joint venture in principle and were ready to provide a short-term bridging loan.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/4">However, we were prepared to offer that loan only on certain conditions. Those included that we were sure the deal would be done, that the money could not be siphoned off and that the loan would be repaid. The DTI, the shareholder executive and others worked round the clock to see whether a deal could be done to save the company and the jobs that went with it.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/5">The company had been publicly pressing for a loan, and taxpayers' money was involved. The loan would also have had to be declared to the European Commission. There was no prospect of its remaining a secret, nor would that have been right. To respond to some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1420" name="John Hemming">the questions asked by the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming)</phrase>, as the then Secretary of State said, in the end SAIC made it clear that&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="47"  time="12:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h02.htm#50614h02_spnew55">
	<p pid=".47.1/1">I am sorry, but I cannot give way; I have many questions to answer, and I fear that I will not get through them all if I do.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/2">In the end SAIC made it clear that it was not confident of the future solvency of MG Rover, so there was no reasonable prospect of a deal. The Government stood ready to issue bridging finance of more than &pound;100 million, but without a deal there was no possibility of a bridging loan, and SAIC indicated that such financing would not have resolved its concerns. It is not correct to say that the period for the loan changed from six months to two. The collapse of the deal led to MG Rover and Powertrain going into administration on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase>. At that point it was clear that the Chinese would not proceed with the deal as contemplated. It was also clear that the Government would be unable to advance a substantial bridging loan, so the directors of MG Rover were obliged to put the business into administration.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-07">7 April</phrase> the then Secretary of State spoke several times to John Towers&mdash;who made it clear that the directors had no option but to put the companies into administration&mdash;and she made the statement that evening. The administrators were called in on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase>. That was inevitable, and would have happened whether the Secretary of State had made that statement or not. However, the development, unwelcome as it was, presented new possibilities for the sale of the company without the historical liabilities that had been among the key stumbling blocks in the way of the proposed SAIC deal.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/4">Over the weekend of 9 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-10">10 April</phrase>, the Government decided to make a loan of &pound;6.5 million to the administrators. That allowed options for the sale of the company as a going concern with an available work force to be pursued for a further week. It was a justified and proportionate decision, taken in the light of the information available at the time about potential purchaser appetite. Sadly, it became clear during that week that a quick deal with certain liabilities excluded would not be forthcoming, and the administrators were forced to make most of the employees redundant. The fate of the assets is still in the hands of the administrators, and it is not for me to speculate how and to whom those assets will now be sold. The Government will be supportive of any proposal presenting a viable economic future for parts of the MG Rover business.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/5">As soon as the fact of administration was known, the Government put into place a contingency plan that we had been developing over the course of several months in case the deal was not done. Some of this was announced by the then Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-08">8 April</phrase> and some the following week, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-15">15 April</phrase>, once it became clear that SAIC would not immediately buy the business as a going concern. In total, the Government allocated &pound;150 million to that support package.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/6">The former Secretary of State also set up the MG Rover taskforce led by Advantage West Midlands. That brought together stakeholders from across <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1920" name="Adrian Bailey">the region, including my hon. Friends the Members for Birmingham, Northfield and for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey)</phrase> and, until he became a DTI Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" name="Ian Pearson">my hon. Friend the Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson)</phrase>, as well as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1460" name="Julie Kirkbride">the hon. Member for Bromsgrove (Miss Kirkbride)</phrase>, to advise Government and local agencies on how best to respond and deliver the emergency package.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/7">The response was rapid: on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-11">Monday 11 April</phrase> a range of measures was in place. They included the MG Rover Jobcentre Plus hotline; a planned emergency package of support to help workers to find new jobs and develop new skills; a website giving advice and contact details; a package of tailored support for companies in MG Rover's supply chain; a telephone hotline for companies; a meeting at Birmingham chamber of commerce to help with proposals; and a helpline established by Birmingham city council. That work has continued over the succeeding weeks, delivering what the employees are entitled to with great efficiency. For example, the redundancy payments service paid each claim an average of 3.2 days ahead of its target of six weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/8">The way in which the Rover taskforce, Advantage West Midlands, Business Link and so many others responded was nothing short of magnificent. In the first month alone, &pound;1.5 million was paid out to safeguard more than 2,000 jobs in the supply chain, nearly 10,000 calls were taken by the Jobcentre Plus hotline and nearly 5,000 new job vacancy opportunities were offered through the employer hotline. As of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-10">10 June</phrase> some 5,500 individuals from MG Rover and its suppliers have contacted Jobcentre Plus. Some 649 of those individuals have been placed in jobs by Jobcentre Plus, and others may have found work independently. Some 2,510 have training plans, and 2,219 of those have been booked on courses. Some 461 have started training.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/9">In response to the question asked by the hon. Member for Bromsgrove, I should say that up to &pound;50 million is available for training for workers made redundant at MG Rover and its suppliers. Money is not an issue with training places, although I understand that there is some difficulty about the availability of training staff, which needs to be followed through. For training, some &pound;5 million, drawn from forecast underspend in 2005&ndash;06, has come from the DTI, &pound;5 million has come from the Department for Work and Pensions, &pound;10 million has come from the European Social Fund, and priority access to the existing &pound;25 million has come from the employer training pilots in the west midlands and nationally. I hope that that goes some way towards answering <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the question asked by the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/10">HM Revenue and Customs has spoken to more than 400 companies to discuss deferring VAT, national insurance and PAYE. Almost 50 deferrals have been agreed, amounting to more than &pound;4.7 million, and more than 2,900 employees from 154 supply chain companies have benefited from the wage replacement fund. A transition loan fund has been set up and is operating. The fund is for companies that have been damaged significantly by the collapse of MG Rover, but have a viable business plan that needs additional finance in the short to medium term to enable them to respond to the traumatic event.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield asked about tracking the impact of training. I agree that it is vital to track that impact, which is why we have asked the MG Rover taskforce to report after six months on the lessons learnt and make recommendations to the Government. I listened to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1413" name="Stephen McCabe">the proposal advanced by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Steve McCabe)</phrase>, and am sure that the DTI will consider the issue further.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/12">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield expressed several concerns today, the first of which related to benefits and the 16-hour rule as a disincentive to train. He will know that this is an issue primarily for the Department for Work and Pensions, but I can tell him that financial support is available, through the allowance payment system, to jobseekers who need to access specific training provision to help them to return to work. Allowance payments can be made to people accessing work-focused provision through Jobcentre Plus and its partner organisations. Former MG Rover workers who have been referred to work-focused provision are currently being supported in that way.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/13">Our preliminary analysis of redundancy pay in lieu of notice in insolvency cases is that very few workers will receive less than the statutory &pound;280 a week as payment in lieu of notice, despite the statutory need to mitigate damages.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/14">The Pension Protection Fund will protect members of defined benefit schemes by paying compensation if their employer becomes insolvent and the pension scheme is underfunded. We are very aware that this is a worrying time for Rover workers, but pensioners are currently receiving their pensions in full, and we believe that it remains a question of when, not whether, a PPF assessment period will start. That is the start of the PPF's formal involvement in the scheme. At the moment, the Rover scheme has not yet entered an assessment period because one of the participating employers is still solvent.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/15">In the final minute available to me, I shall discuss the issues of the investigation. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-31">31 May 2005</phrase>, the current Secretary of State for Trade and Industry appointed inspectors to investigate and report on the affairs of the MG Rover group, including Phoenix Venture Holdings and MGR Capital Ltd. The public interest requires that the issues raised by the financial reporting review panel and by developments after 2003 when the last accounts were published be investigated by independent inspectors.</p>
	<p pid=".47.1/16">The Secretary of State has asked that the inspectors report as quickly as possible, in a form that will enable the report to be made public. The inspectors will decide what is relevant to investigate, and the DTI will co-operate fully with the inspectors.</p>

	<p pid=".50.1/1">I welcome this opportunity to debate this important subject, which has an immediate impact on my constituents and those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase>, as well as a broader impact across the whole of Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/2">I congratulate the Minister on his new appointment. He has moved from the Principality of Wales to the principality of defence. I wish him well with his new responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/3">Norfolk has been living with the prospect of the closure of RAF Coltishall since 1998, when it emerged that it was likely that the Jaguar aircraft deployed there would be withdrawn within a decade. Therefore, the formal announcement in July last year, as part of the defence White Paper, that by December 2006 all RAF operations would cease at Coltishall and that the RAF would have no further use for the base did not come as a complete surprise to me or my constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/4">Nevertheless, there was a lot of local anxiety about the future, as the local catchment area that is affected covers a wide area of north and mid-Norfolk where there are scattered communities and areas of local economic and social deprivation. The closure has an immediate impact on villages within my constituency such as Horstead, Wroxham, Buxton, as well as Coltishall itself. It also has an impact on a town the size of Aylsham, and it has a similar impact in north Norfolk.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-01">1 November 2004</phrase>, an RAF Coltishall task group was established, led by Norfolk county council. Its membership included myself and the hon. Member for North Norfolk, representatives of parish councils, North Norfolk district council and Broadland district council, RAF Coltishall, Defence Estates, Business Link, the East of England Development Agency and others. The short-term issue was to address immediately problems of redundancy and economic loss of income by local communities. The medium-term strategy, as identified by the task group, was to establish whether the Ministry of Defence or any other Department might have a use for the base and to prepare for the eventuality of RAF Coltishall being declared surplus to all Government requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/6">Since <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>, the task group has met regularly and has taken forward a number of practical issues such as a comprehensive study prepared under the auspices of Norfolk county council and EEDA, which provided factual information about the immediate impact of the closure of both RAF Coltishall and RAF Neatishead. I wish to emphasise that RAF Neatishead is in the constituency of the hon. Member for North Norfolk, and that its closure, along with that of RAF Coltishall, delivers, to a certain extent, a double whammy to the local economy.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/7">Much good work has been done, and I wish to put on record my appreciation of the contributions made by Squadron Leader Paul Robins, the project officer at RAF Coltishall, who has been as open and constructive as possible from the perspective of RAF Coltishall, and Mr. Barry Sygrove, the area manager east of Defence Estates, who also brings a lot of practical experience to the issues that we have been addressing.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/8">There are many specific questions to address, such as environmental degradation of the base, the future of the married quarters, and what residual RAF use might continue after December 2006. The key question for the local community and the task group was whether the Ministry of Defence or any other Department might have a further use for the base. At the first meeting of our task group in November 2004, we were informed that the MOD had yet to declare the base surplus to its requirements, but that a decision on other possible military uses would be made by April 2005. If no MOD requirement were found, other Departments would be consulted through English Partnerships. Only after the exercise carried out within the MOD and other Departments drew a blank would the base be declared surplus to requirements. In November 2004, it was thought that the whole exercise would be completed by April 2005, giving a period of 18 months between potentially being declared surplus and disposal. That is key for consideration of planning uses other than those by a Department. The Minister will appreciate that although the task group has had to conduct a lot of forward thinking and planning on the assumption that the base would be surplus to all Government requirements, the lack of a clear decision has inhibited the work and creates uncertainty in the local communities most affected.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/9">I appreciate that, from March onwards, the expected decision by the MOD was postponed because of the general election. However, I was somewhat disappointed by the reply that I received from the Minister to a letter that I wrote on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-23">23 May</phrase> seeking clarification about the MOD's possible further requirements for RAF Coltishall. I learned that I had achieved this debate last Wednesday and, lo and behold, on Thursday I received a reply from the Minister. I am sure that hon. Members will see that purely as a coincidence, but who says that parliamentary debate and pressure do not achieve at least some results? He wrote:</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/10" class="indent">&quot;I can confirm that this Department has not yet reached a decision as to whether there is any alternative defence use for the site. Indeed, we intend that the simulator at Coltishall will remain on the site until the Jaguar goes out of service. It is possible that some of the living accommodation may be used after 2006. I understand that in order to progress further you would wish to know the outcome of our studies. We do not expect to complete our investigations before the autumn of 2005.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/11">Even keeping to that decision, the timing will have slipped by six months. Can the Minister say whether autumn means September or December? If it is the back end of December, that means that we have only about one year before most of the RAF functions cease at Coltishall. If the MOD has no further use but other Departments are to be trawled, could that mean that a final Government decision might slip further into 2006? I know that the Minister may not have control over responses from other Departments, but clarification would be welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/12">Such points are not legalistic debating points. They have a real impact on the contingency planning being carried out by the RAF Coltishall task group, which is spending EEDA money and Norfolk county council money, as well as MOD money, and they affect the morale of local communities, which feel that a lot of time has passed without a big decision being made.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/13">The local community overwhelmingly supports the RAF presence at Coltishall. Many people are sad that the RAF is leaving Coltishall and they are aware that that presence goes back to the late 1930s. RAF Coltishall is the last battle of Britain RAF base still in use operationally and there is a lot of local good feeling. I recognise the fact that some local people will welcome the end of flying, but the majority, even those directly affected, are sad to see the RAF going and appreciate the work that it did in maintaining our freedom, not only during the second world war but in the long watch of the cold war. Many RAF personnel have decided that they will live in our community when they leave the services and have married local people. There is a strong link.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/14">As far as I can ascertain from talking to local people, there would be a positive reaction if an alternative MOD requirement were found for the future of RAF Coltishall. A similar thing happened at what had been RAF Swanton Morley in my constituency nearly a decade ago. The RAF had no further use, but the Army found that it had a requirement and moved in an armoured regiment. That has worked well in terms of community relationships and the impact on the local economy. The Minister will not be surprised to hear that, even if local communities cannot agree on possible alternatives, they are certain that they do not want RAF Coltishall to be an asylum centre.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/15">The Minister should be aware that the closure of RAF Coltishall is the equivalent of the loss of a steelworks or a car factory in terms of the impact on the local economy and jobs. A recent provisional report by EEDA and Norfolk county council on the affect on the local economy suggests that it would be in the region of &pound;19 million per annum and 400 jobs. That is a major impact for an area such as mid and north Norfolk. I recognise that the Ministry of Defence is not just a job creator and economic bolster for the area, but the Minister should bear that impact in mind.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/16">The MOD owes the local community of mid and north Norfolk and must get the decision right from the point of view of local people. Also, RAF Coltishall is one of the first two RAF bases flagged up for closure in what I suspect will be a continuing round of closures of other MOD bases rolled out over the next two or three years. Is it not in the MOD's interests to get it right in this case so that, when other bases are closed, Ministers can turn to people worried in other parts of the United Kingdom and say, &quot;Look what happened with RAF Coltishall. We got it right. You can go and talk to the local MPs and representatives and they are relatively happy&quot;? The alternative would not be a good precedent.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/17">Finally, local people are apprehensive that, if the MOD ceases RAF use of Coltishall but there is an administrative hiatus before disposal, the site will deteriorate and the married quarters might be vandalised. Will the Minister assure me that that will not happen and that effective measures will be taken to secure RAF Coltishall against the kind of vandalism that has taken place at other former RAF and Army sites?</p>

	<p pid=".54.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1735" name="Keith Simpson">the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk (Mr. Simpson)</phrase> for his kind comments about my appointment to the Ministry of Defence. It is a challenging job. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" name="Gerald Howarth">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Mr. Howarth)</phrase> thinks that it is one of the best jobs in the Government. I certainly intend to make it one of the best jobs. It is very people-focused, and the issues that hon. Members have raised today are about the effect that our decisions have on people.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/2">I congratulate the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk on securing the debate. As far as I am aware, there was no connection between his securing the debate and my letters arriving, but it is an opportune debate, because the closure and reuse of defence sites is an important subject and worthy of discussion. He and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> have taken a keen and consistent interest in the future of RAF Coltishall. I thank the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk for his kind comments about the personnel who have been working, through the task group, to secure a decision on its future.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/3">I am grateful that both hon. Gentlemen gave me notice of the points that they wanted to raise, and I hope that I can respond constructively to them. This is my first opportunity since becoming a Minister in the Ministry of Defence to take part in a debate on the defence estate. The debate surrounding the rationalisation of our estate and the disposal of sites that have become surplus is important. Before I turn to specific points about Coltishall, I shall make one or two general points.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/4">First, we do not take decisions on the closure of sites lightly. The decision-making process is complex and lengthy. It involves the consideration of many options and requires a good deal of consultation. It is, however, something that we have to go through if we are to attain our goal of achieving an estate that is of the right size and fit for the demands of today. We must take account of the better quality of life and better working conditions for servicemen and women and others in the Department, and we seek to ensure that we obtain the best value for money from the estate. Secondly, we have a good story to tell about bringing surplus defence sites back into renewed economic use, whether for employment or residential use, as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/5">I am grateful for the opportunity that the debate affords me to pay tribute to the work of the personnel at RAF Coltishall. As the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk said, the base has a long and illustrious history. It was built in 1939 for Bomber Command and, while it was being used by Fighter Command, an aircraft from the base claimed the first enemy aircraft to be shot down during the battle of Britain on <phrase class="date" code="1940-07-10">10 July 1940</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/6">Until March this year, RAF Coltishall was the home of four Jaguar squadrons, at which point two were disbanded. Of the remaining two, 41 Squadron will be disbanded by <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2006</phrase>. At the same time, 6 Squadron, the last remaining, will move to RAF Coningsby. The airfield at RAF Coltishall will close later that year, although, as the hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk knows, the simulator will remain until the Jaguar goes out of service in 2007. It is also possible that some of the living accommodation on the site may be used after 2006.</p>
	<p pid=".54.0/7">It is against that background that we need to ascertain whether the site can be put to alternative defence use. Consideration is being given to potential reuse by the Royal Air Force, within the context of our long-term service estate plans. However, if no such defence use emerges, the site will be disposed of. The hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned a strong rumour that the Army would be interested in taking over the base or that it is seeking to do so. I can say only that I am not aware of any formal proposal that would lead me to believe that that is the case, but, as I have made clear, we are in discussions throughout the Ministry of Defence about future use of the base for defence needs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.55.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" speakername="Don Touhig" colnum="55"  time="12:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h03.htm#50614h03_spnew7">
	<p pid=".55.5/1">I understand how frustrating it can be for the hon. Gentlemen and the communities that they represent that the site appears to be caught in limbo for the present. That creates uncertainty in the community. However, I hope that the hon. Gentlemen and their constituents will understand that several factors must be taken into account, and that it would make no sense financially, or in management terms, to sell the base only to have to acquire another to meet future requirements.</p>
	<p pid=".55.5/2">I am aware that the long hiatus that occurred in deciding whether the site at West Raynham, which the hon. Member for North Norfolk mentioned, would be retained or disposed of was a real problem. West Raynham was potentially suitable for several alternative defence uses, and the issues involved were complex. That case was exceptional, I believe, and lessons were learned. I assure the hon. Gentleman that we shall make every effort to ensure that RAF Coltishall does not languish in the same way.</p>
	<p pid=".55.5/3">Housing was an issue at West Raynham. As the hon. Gentleman will recall from his attendance at task group meetings, the housing at RAF Coltishall is subject to the Annington Homes long lease agreement. Consequently, it will be for Annington Homes to decide on the future use of the housing should the MOD declare the site to be surplus. Of course, if further defence use of the site is identified, housing may be required.</p>
	<p pid=".55.5/4">I note the concerns over site security and vandalism if the site is vacated. The best way to avoid damage is to pass the site to a new owner as quickly as possible We find that if there is a hiatus, temporary lettings of buildings on site can be an effective deterrent to vandals, but our usual practice is to employ civilian guards to patrol the site. That would be likely at Coltishall.</p>
	<p pid=".55.5/5">It is to avoid delay, should the site eventually be put up for sale, that we are progressing consideration of alternative defence uses and initial preparations for disposal in parallel. Since October 2004, the MOD has been fully engaged with the task group attended by principal stakeholders, which will seek to mitigate or minimise the impact of the proposed closure. I am aware of the recent report that suggested that there would be a &pound;20 million loss to the local economy if the base were closed.</p>
	<p pid=".55.5/6">The hon. Members for Mid-Norfolk and for North Norfolk are members of the task group, as are representatives of the county and district councils and the East of England Development Agency. The task group has openly discussed potential future uses of the site should it be declared to be surplus. That is an excellent demonstration of the proper approach to consultation and partnership so that everyone is involved in the decision making.</p>
	<p pid=".55.5/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">18 February</phrase>, the group agreed that North Norfolk district council would draw up terms and specifications for a planning document covering the whole site. That will ensure that the planning potential of the site is fully known should it be declared to be surplus. I take this opportunity to urge the planning authorities to be as innovative and flexible as possible in considering alternative uses for the site. We also need to ensure that decisions are made as quickly as possible if the site is not to be left unused for a period, and deteriorate.</p>
	<p pid=".55.5/8">It may be helpful if I explain what will happen should Coltishall be declared surplus, and how we will progress with its disposal. The hon. Member for Mid-Norfolk asked if we had ascertained whether any other Department had an interest in the site. The answer is, simply, not yet, but should the site be confirmed as surplus to our requirements, it will be included in the English Partnerships register of surplus public sector land for 40 working days.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.61.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1548" speakername="Jim Knight" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="61"  time="13:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h04.htm#50614h04_spmin0">
	<p pid=".61.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1722" name="Colin Challen">my hon. Friend the Member for Morley and Rothwell (Colin Challen)</phrase> on securing this debate on climate change and the G8. Like me, he was elected in 2001; since then, he has established an excellent reputation as a passionate campaigner on such issues. His work on the Environmental Audit Committee and elsewhere in Parliament adds real value to our debates. I thank him for his leadership on such vital matters. Similarly, the UK's leadership on international climate change is respected and welcomed all over the world by those committed to tackling that issue; no country has done more in recent years to make it an issue for Heads of State, and we shall continue to do so during our EU presidency and presidency of the G8.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/2">Action must be taken in conjunction with our international partners, but if the UK is to influence others successfully, we must first demonstrate that we have taken action at home. Since 1997, we have established the target of 10 per cent. renewable energy by 2010; placed an obligation on energy suppliers to supply an increasing proportion of energy from renewables; introduced the climate change levy; established the Carbon Trust to work with businesses on reducing energy use; and established the first greenhouse gas trading scheme in the world and one of the toughest trading caps in the new European Union regime.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/3">We have also overturned the whole basis of company car fleet taxation, shifting it towards low-carbon emissions, and lowered vehicle excise duty for low-carbon vehicles. I can tell my hon. Friend that we are pushing for aviation to be included in future in the EU emissions trading scheme and that, just today, the Department of Trade and Industry launched a carbon abatement technology strategy, which I am sure he will find interesting.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/4">The UK has shown that tackling climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved without damaging economic competitiveness or living standards. The UK has reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. since 1990; during the same period the UK economy has grown by more than 36 per cent. We are one of only two EU countries on track to meet the target of cutting 1990 greenhouse emissions by 8 per cent. before 2010. As has been mentioned, we have more work to do to meet the domestic target of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide because CO <sub>2</sub> reductions are less than greenhouse gas reductions as a whole and because 20 per cent. is a tougher target.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/5">The climate change programme review will report later this year. We will make some announcements on that shortly and advise on those measures required for the UK to achieve the 2010 target. We cannot tackle climate change unilaterally. As the Minister with responsibility for biodiversity, I noted with concern the report today from the Royal Horticultural Society conference&mdash;it has taken a lead by organising the event&mdash;on the effect of climate change on trees and forests in this country. Clearly, we cannot do anything on our own to tackle that loss to the enjoyment that we all take from our gardens, recreation areas and rural areas.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/6">As we know, the Prime Minister has made tackling climate change a central theme of the UK's G8 presidency this year. The Government's primary objective is to raise the profile of climate change as a matter deserving the urgent attention of Heads of Government in the G8 and outside, so as to promote an international consensus on the need for further action to control emissions.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/7">We have also set ourselves more detailed but no less ambitious objectives. The first is to set out a clear direction of travel to deal with climate change, based on the science. The second is to agree a package of practical measures focusing on technologies that have significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions than traditional technologies. The third is to work in partnership with the major emerging economies to reach a new consensus on how we deal with the challenge in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/8">Our detailed proposals have been developed during the year. On science, they have been developed to reflect the outcome of a science conference hosted by the UK in February. Scientists from more than 30 different countries considered how to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions. They considered what level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would be self-evidently too much and what options we have to avoid such levels. They concluded that there was greater clarity and less uncertainty about the impacts of climate change across a wide range of systems, sectors and societies. In many cases, the risks identified were also more serious than previously thought. We are making progress in understanding the science.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June</phrase>, the science academies of all the G8 nations plus those of Brazil, China and India signed a joint statement. It states:</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The scientific understanding of climate change is now sufficiently clear to justify nations taking prompt action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/11">When independent scientists speak with such clarity, it behoves politicians to listen. The science academies called on G8 nations to</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/12" class="indent">&quot;identify cost-effective steps that can be taken now to contribute to substantial and long-term reduction in net global greenhouse gas emissions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/13">To further our aim of developing a package of practical measures, we are working on a possible technology package to be agreed at Gleneagles. Specific proposals are being prepared in collaboration with our G8 partners on cleaning up fossil fuels and improving energy performance. The G8 has already agreed, under the Evian action plan on science and technology for sustainable development, to accelerate the research, development and diffusion of energy technologies. We are hopeful that the G8 can agree on turning the political agreement that we already have from the Evian summit into concrete action.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/14">To address our third aim of working in partnership with emerging economies, we are engaging with a number of developing countries on mitigation and adaptation. The share of global greenhouse gas emissions from developing countries is set to rise significantly. As countries develop, it will be important that they are able to meet their growing energy needs sustainably. There is a role for G8 countries and international financial institutions to work with those economies to enable them to achieve a low-carbon future. Greater clean coal technology, energy efficiency, and renewable energy within the emerging economies should be supported through a combination of capacity building, technical assistance and additional finance. Therefore, we have invited the Heads of Government of Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa to the summit in Gleneagles, where they will have extensive discussions with their G8 counterparts on climate change issues.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/15">It is also important that the G8 and the major emerging economies discuss the impacts of climate change per se. It is widely accepted that some degree of climate change is now unavoidable, due to historic and current emissions. Those effects will disproportionately affect developing countries&mdash;the countries who have contributed least to the problem. I know that in many ways that is philosophically what is behind the contraction and conversion ideas about which my hon. Friend has such strong feelings. Developing countries also lack the necessary financial means to cope with the widespread effects of climate change. We need to work with vulnerable developing countries to help them respond to the challenge.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/16">Climate variability and climate change put some $10 billion to $20 billion of net overseas development aid at risk each year, threatening the achievement of the UN millennium development goals. As an important first step, we need to ensure that developing countries have adequate regional and national data and the capacity to interpret them, so that they will be able to assess their degree of vulnerability and plan effective responses for the future. We, as donors, should climate-proof our development spending through better screening and management of climate risk. As biodiversity Minister, I attended the launch of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, which has shown the clear link between the loss of biodiversity and the problem of achieving poverty eradication and, as I have already stated, the clear link between biodiversity loss and climate change.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/17">Our aims are challenging, but we are confident that they are achievable. We are not at Gleneagles yet&mdash;there is still a lot of work to be done&mdash;but momentum is moving in our direction. The Prime Minister recently visited Rome, Moscow, Berlin and Washington, and he is in Paris today. He will also be holding a video conference with his Japanese and Canadian counterparts. The Prime Minister and President Bush had constructive discussions on climate change, and I hear my hon. Friend's cynicism about the President. The differences between Europe and the US on the scientific evidence surrounding climate change are well known, but we agree on the fundamental points that climate change is a serious issue and that we need to act in response. President Bush has said he is looking forward to a discussion on climate change at Gleneagles, and so are we. He and the Prime Minister have regular discussions on the subject.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/18">We should not forget that the summit is not about creating a new Kyoto or any other international agreement, and nor is it about setting new targets&mdash;the UN framework convention on climate change is the right place for that. Instead, we want to find ways of reaching a new level of dialogue between the leading economies, private sector and technology leaders and the major emerging economics&mdash;dialogue that will lead to practical action, involving promoting new clean technologies and supporting sustainable economic growth. We will achieve that through both the measures that we agree at the summit and working together beyond Gleneagles. In many ways, Gleneagles will be about creating a will and momentum that can be then taken forward through the UN process. The package of measures on the table at Gleneagles will complement the UN framework convention process by providing the means through which the necessary emissions reductions can be more easily achieved.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/19">The UK remains open to any new international framework as long as it is realistic so that it is relevant to countries with different national circumstances, robust so that it is can be adjusted in the light of experience, and durable so that the system does not become irrelevant in a few years' time.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/20">My hon. Friend has been very patient, and I will come to his specific points on contraction and convergence. He has been an articulate and passionate champion for the framework. His points are well argued and will be compelling to many listening to the debate. Certain aspects of contraction and convergence are appealing, including the identification of a fixed level for stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations, and comprehensive global participation. It is a long-term framework and has advantages of clear equity&mdash;all things that we support.</p>
	<p pid=".61.0/21">One key element, however, of any future regime must be workability. One particular concern with contraction and convergence is the question of how globally acceptable and, in consequence, how workable that would prove to be. The debate on further action is at an early stage and to support any one framework over any other at the moment would be premature.</p>

	<p pid=".65.1/1">The argument that I am putting to my hon. Friend is that if we went with this particular framework, given that there is nothing approaching uniform support at the moment, we will be setting out our stall too early. We are very early in negotiations about how the framework can go forward at the UN convention in Montreal at the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid=".65.1/2">It is important that all existing suggestions remain on the table at present and that full consideration is given both to the possible solutions and to the elements within them that could be used to form part of a workable solution. As I said, the outcome will be decided by negotiations under the UN framework convention on climate change.</p>
	<p pid=".65.1/3">My hon. Friend asked if we could commission an independent expert study. I am told that there are already a large number of independent expert studies, which suggest a number of possible future frameworks, including contraction and convergence.</p>
	<p pid=".65.1/4">As well as the official G8 political process, we have been engaging with international business to hear its views. When the Prime Minister attended the World Economic Forum this year, he asked 25 leading multinational companies, including BP, Deutsche Bank, EDF, Ford and Toyota, to look at the issue of climate change. We are particularly pleased with their statement, issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-09">9 June</phrase>. Their message was strong&mdash;that we must take action now and Governments must send a strong policy signal to markets, taking into account the long periods over which investments in infrastructure are considered. They highlighted the need for the rapid commercialisation of new technologies, which are in many cases already developed. They also dismissed the idea that action to tackle climate change causes economic harm. They pointed out that there are likely to be economic benefits, particularly if initial costs are compared to the costs of inaction. The Government will take their message to the Gleneagles summit and beyond.</p>
	<p pid=".65.1/5">With limited membership and participation, the G8 alone cannot and should not produce a new international framework. What the UK's G8 presidency will produce is the momentum that the international community needs to develop a future framework. We hope that that dialogue continues through the United Nations framework convention on climate change, specifically at the next conference of the parties meeting in Montreal this year. We will be pressing for the conference to agree to start negotiations on the framework for beyond 2012, which we hope will produce a regime capable of tackling the huge challenge that we face. I trust that we will continue to debate such a crucial issue.</p>
	<p pid=".65.1/6">At the beginning of his remarks, my hon. Friend asked for a debate on the Floor of the House. I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House will have noted what he said. Debating the issue is important. As we move through Gleneagles to Montreal, I hope that we continue to hear from my hon. Friend as the debate continues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-14.67.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="67"  time="13:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050614/halltext/50614h05.htm#50614h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".67.1/1">I very much welcome this albeit brief opportunity to discuss electoral reform and where this country should go following the recent general election. I accept from the outset that the issue of electoral reform is far from the top of the electorate's list of priorities, and certainly far from the top of the Government's list.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/2">One problem of electoral reform is that all too often the issue gets bogged down in detailed conversations for&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;anoraks who go on about the merits of one electoral system versus another. Which is the most proportional? Which keeps the constituency link? Is the d'Hondt formula really fair? To me, all those miss a more fundamental question, which all of us who are involved and interested in politics must ask: what sort of Parliament do we want to represent us and what sort of Government do we want to rule over us? In this country, unlike in the United States, our Executive and legislature are inextricably linked, so those two aspects are in effect one and the same.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/3">I place on record my appreciation for the work of the all-party group on electoral reform, which is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase>. The group has done a power of work for many years and, having attended its first meeting of the new Parliament last week, I can tell the Minister that it is reinvigorated and ready for the debate ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/4">l do not want to use this debate to extol the virtues of any particular system. I have my own views&mdash;indeed, my party has a very clear and long-standing policy in this area&mdash;but today I am arguing for an open debate, not just in this place, but throughout the United Kingdom. I hope the Minister takes the desire for that debate back to her Department.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/5">As the Minister will be aware, this Labour Government were re-elected on the smallest share of the vote in UK electoral history. As the Electoral Reform Society has said, no Government in our history has had such a flimsy base of public support on which to rule. Surely, questions must be asked when a party can win a majority of 66 seats with only 35 per cent. of the vote. In finding answers to these questions, we need a reasoned and sensible debate in which people's differing views are respected.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/6">The Government and this Parliament cannot shy away from that debate. The House of Commons has often been called the mother of Parliaments. Rather than being the loved mother, however, we are in real danger of becoming the embarrassing relative.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/7">The Government have stated that there is no groundswell of support for changing the system. I accept that electoral systems may not be the talk of the steamy, as we say in Scotland, but there is no question but that more and more people of great reputation are coming round to the idea. Professor Patrick Dunleavy of the London School of Economics has described a change in the electoral system as inevitable. I share his sentiment, but cannot, at this stage, share his optimism. There is a great deal of work to be done to win this argument.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/8">It goes almost without saying that any change in the electoral system should be made for the right reasons. It should not merely be mooted by certain members of certain political parties, only when their position under first past the post begins to look vulnerable. It should be a principled decision, based on a desire to improve democracy.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/9">Any electoral system should work for the benefit of the public, not necessarily of the politicians, but the current system fails on that most basic of aims. The British public deserve far better from the system that they use to elect their representatives.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/10">As the Minister will be well aware, <i>The Independent </i>has launched a major campaign for electoral reform entitled &quot;Campaign for Democracy&quot;. It has already been backed by leading figures across the political spectrum, and when I last checked more than 36,000 people had signed up. This is an excellent campaign, which seeks not only support, but to educate people about the realities of our electoral system. I pay tribute to all those involved and to the work that they continue to do. To have gathered so many names in a relatively short time is very impressive. I have no doubt that the campaigners will be listening to the debate and that they will be listening particularly intently to the Minister's remarks.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/11">The figures showing the extent of the unfairness built into our electoral system have been well documented, especially in the past few weeks, and I shall revisit some of them. In the general election, the Labour party was rewarded with 55 per cent. of the seats in the House of Commons on a mere 35 per cent. of the vote. The picture is even worse when one considers the percentage of the overall electorate. Labour was given a solid parliamentary majority despite fewer than 22 per cent. of people in the UK voting for it. It received 9.6 million votes from an electorate of more than 44 million.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/12">I remember election night, when it was clear as the votes came in that the agreed line from the Labour party was that people had wanted the return of a Labour Government but with a reduced majority. That mantra was chanted by the Prime Minister, the Cabinet, Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson, but I believe it is plainly false. Only 35 per cent. of those who did vote voted Labour and 65 per cent. did not want a Labour Government at all, yet that is exactly what they ended up with.</p>
	<p pid=".67.1/13">If first past the post is used for the next election, it will be interesting to see what the electoral lottery produces. Under our current system, it is perfectly possible for the party with the most votes to come second in seats&mdash;indeed, that is what happened in 1951 and 1974. In fact, the detail of the 2005 election result shows that we faced exactly the same electoral quirk. In England, the Conservative party won 50,000 more votes than Labour, yet Labour won 92 more English seats than the Tories. I challenge anyone to defend that ridiculous situation.</p>

	<p pid=".73.5/1">Although I admit that the Labour Government have achieved a great amount in terms of constitutional reform and devolution, the voting system in Scotland under the devolved Administration is a proportional system. Would she not agree that it is about time that we moved into the 21st century and did the same in Westminster? If it is good enough for setting up a new Parliament with a modern voting system, why can we not do the same in Westminster?</p>
