	<p pid="a.191.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity this morning to talk about something that is not sufficiently discussed in the House-poverty in London, and specifically child poverty in London. It is particularly an issue for Hackney, in my constituency in east London, which still has some of the highest indices of deprivation in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/2">Statistics show that 4 million children are living in poverty in the UK, and 650,000 of them live in London: that is one in six of all the children in our capital city. Half of them-300,000, which is a massive number-live in severe poverty, which means that they go without the basic daily essentials that we take for granted. When I was a new MP in the 1980s, a Scottish Labour MP turned to me and said, as though it were an incontrovertible fact, &quot;The trouble with London is all the jobs are here.&quot; I was surprised, because I had spent my life as a young activist dealing with the issues that arise from worklessness and poverty in London. One of the reasons why I am so glad to be able to speak on this subject this morning is that too many Members of Parliament who come from outside London see only Westminster, Whitehall and the west end, and are not aware of the pockets of poverty that are outside that magic circle.</p>
	<p pid="a.191.2/3">It is worth reminding hon. Members that London has the largest group of children in poverty of any region in the country. The response to that might be, &quot;Well, that's very sad for them, but MPs have broader and more important issues to debate,&quot; but I would say not only that the number of children in poverty in London is a tragedy for those children and their families, but that wider society must live with the consequences of their growing up in poverty. I do not argue, and have never argued, that the mere fact of growing up in poverty means being doomed to a life of crime. My parents both left school at 14, and I am glad to say that both my brother and I were able to go to university and make something of our lives. However, poverty, hopelessness, deprivation and low aspirations have a relationship to the crime problems in our great city. If the media spent as much time on the underlying issues of child poverty as they do on crime, we would have a better-informed public.</p>

	<p pid="a.191.3/1">Has the hon. Lady a feeling for what is driving child poverty in London? There are two aspects. How much of it does she think is due to London factors, which affect all groups? How much is connected to the two groups that suffer child poverty above all-lone parents and black and minority ethnic communities?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.192.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="192"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0001.htm#10020969000462">
	<p pid="a.192.0/1">That is an important question, and I shall come to those issues later. There are some general London issues about poverty, but there are also issues for the groups that the hon. Gentleman mentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/2">My immediate reason for obtaining the debate was an excellent report released two weeks ago by Save the Children, commissioned by the New Policy Institute and called, &quot;Measuring Severe Child Poverty in the UK&quot;, which found that 13 per cent. of children living in the UK-or 1.7 million-live in severe poverty and that, although poverty is spread across all four countries of the United Kingdom, London is the region with the highest proportion of children living in severe poverty. About 20 per cent. of the children in London live in severe poverty, despite the fact that it is the richest city in the United Kingdom. Perhaps we should pause there; this is London and it is the age of the internet and television. Not only do all those children live in poverty, but they can see clearly, when they walk the streets and see the media, the people who live alongside them in this great city: as Disraeli described, they all live in this great city, but they live in two worlds. That is corrosive to social cohesion, not to mention to the personal esteem of the young people trapped in one world, some of whom see no hope of moving on.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/3">Severe poverty has increased every year in England and Wales since 2004-05 and, sadly, there has been no change in the number of children living in severe poverty in Northern Ireland and Scotland. Single parents and workless households are most likely to live in severe poverty. Half the children in severe poverty come from single parent families and families claiming jobseeker's allowance, and ethnic minority children are three times more likely than white children to be in severe poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/4">Many of the things that underlie severe poverty, including worklessness, low educational attainment, single parent households, social rented accommodation and being in an ethnic minority are very much issues in my constituency of Hackney. I am well aware not just of the figures but the human reality. For that reason, I tabled an early-day motion last week on child poverty in ethnic minority communities, and I urge hon. Members to sign it.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/5">I have set out the figures and tried to touch on the personal reality of poverty in London; but the tragedy is that we are in a recession. Although the macro-economic figures look a little better, my view is that the recession has a long tail and the practical consequences for jobs for ordinary people in London have yet to play out. In a recession, it will be even harder to lift children out of poverty. It is estimated that the recession is likely to have increased the number of children in severe poverty, although what are called the economic stabilisers-the automatic rise in some benefits and so on-are expected to bring the numbers back down to pre-recession figures. However, there is no doubt that what progress the Government have made in tackling child poverty has been endangered by the recession. As unemployment continues to rise, there is a danger that the number of children living in severe poverty will not drop, and might rise even higher.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/6">What is being done? The Government have made a laudable commitment to fighting child poverty. It was a Labour Government who first announced, in 1999, the aim of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it completely by 2020. Last June, the Child Poverty Bill was introduced in the House of Commons to put that pledge into legislation. The Bill is being considered in Committee in the House of Lords. It is sponsored by the Department for Children, School and Families, the Department for Work and Pensions and the Treasury. One must admire the extent to which the Government have put the issue at the top of their agenda. The Bill deals with establishing an accountability framework to drive progress towards the 2020 goal nationally and locally, and it would set up a child poverty commission, to provide advice and to report. I welcome the Bill and the Government's long-standing commitment on child poverty; however, sadly, despite the best of intentions, it will be just words unless the existing high levels of child poverty in London are tackled. The capital will have a significant impact on the Government's ability to meet the national targets, and we cannot wait for legislation before we take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/7">To return to the point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2033" name="John Howell">the hon. Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase>, there are specific issues in London. Child poverty in London is the biggest numerical obstacle to our goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020. What are the specific problems in London? All London MPs will say that one problem is the deep poverty trap caused by higher housing costs and the way in which the housing benefit system works. Housing benefit is a problem in London because of the particularly high housing costs there. Too many estates in my constituency that a generation ago were diverse-some people worked, some did not-are now entirely composed of workless families.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/8">As a result, young people are growing up who have never seen the head of the household going out to work. That may sound like a simple thing, but I was brought up in a working class West Indian family and, every day that God sent, my father went out to work. On Friday, he brought home his wage packet and gave us our pocket money and a bar of chocolate. That was the norm for me and my brother. More than school lessons or anything that we were told formally, the vision of my father going out to work every morning shaped our attitudes to work and society and our responsibilities to the rest of the family. Tragically, the children living on many estates in Hackney do not see that. That has the effect of shaping their attitude to society and their responsibility in a malign way.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/9">One thing that makes it hard for my constituents to work and sustain a job is the poverty trap caused by housing in London. Another problem is the cost of transport. Without wishing to sound party political, I note that the Conservative Mayor of London recently raised fares. Child care, too, is costly. I am among the top 5 per cent. of earners, but I was never more poor than when my son was at nursery. The cost of nursery provision for earners in London is prohibitive. That goes back to the cost of setting up nurseries, the cost of employing people and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/10">Wages in London are worth less to low income families because of the higher costs of living. I frequently meet low-income women who are trying to calculate the gain of going from benefit into work. Many part-time service sector jobs in London pay lower wages than in the rest of the United Kingdom. If we are really serious about fighting poverty in London and elsewhere, we will have to look at the interaction of the benefits system and work. A lot has been done, but more is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/11">Many people are put off going to work altogether, because they are frightened of losing their benefits; others have started work, but when the job comes to an end-jobs are often temporary or short-term-they have such a struggle to get back the benefits that they need, which makes them even more reluctant to try for another job. There are fewer part-time opportunities in London. People in temporary accommodation awaiting permanent social housing in London often face high rents. Indeed, we read in the media of the extortionate rents that can be charged.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/12">I shall touch on the question that the hon. Member for Henley asked about ethnic minority families. Some migrant families have particular difficulties in the labour market. Parents with English as a second language have lower employment rates and are more likely to have low-paid jobs. It is estimated that 86 per cent. of London's children are from refugee families, and they face even more disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/13">Those are some of the problems for Londoners, but, to be honest, one in particular is that of benefits. One of the first things my party did when elected to power in 1997 was to cut benefits for single parent mothers. The Minister will know that the Government are pushing forward with a policy to encourage-I use the word advisedly-single parent mothers to go to work when their children are still quite young.</p>
	<p pid="a.192.0/14">I take a view on forcing women to go to work when their children are of school age. It is not the official new Labour view. I returned to work when my son was eight days old. I worked until the Thursday before I gave birth, had the baby on the following Monday and was back at work, here, eight days later. It was a job that I adored. The role of Member of Parliament gave me flexibility. I could take my son with me to work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.194.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="194"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0001.htm#10020969000464">
	<p pid="a.194.1/1">Indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/2">I deprecate attempts to force young women to work as though it is the answer to their poverty. The consequence can be an impoverishment of family life. I believe that many young women on estates in Hackney would be better placed getting a proper education, learning to be proper mothers and being at home when their children finish school, rather than being forced to work in a series of low-paid, low-skill jobs, with no clear idea what their children are doing. Ministers are well aware of my views. Most women with skills want to re-enter the labour market, but unskilled women should be given help and support. I deprecate coercion.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/3">I have spoken to a number of groups, including the Child Poverty Action Group, Save the Children, London Councils, Gingerbread and the Family Holiday Association, seeking practical advice to help deal with poverty in London. I press Ministers on the fact that all groups agreed on the need to focus more on London. Given the scale and unique characteristics of child poverty in London, we need a particular focus on London. Without tackling child poverty there, it will be numerically impossible to reduce and eventually eliminate child poverty in the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/4">The second point made by those groups is that everyone agrees that local authorities have a key role to play in tackling child poverty. The Government acknowledge in the Child Poverty Bill that local authorities are best placed to develop and deliver local solutions to local challenges. However, to deliver those local solutions, it is essential that local authorities are given the freedom and flexibility to tackle child poverty locally. Poverty is a complex problem, and London is a complex area. From borough to borough, the demographics vary wildly. What may work in one area may not work elsewhere. Statutory guidance on child poverty should not be too prescriptive.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/5">The third point agreed by those voluntary bodies is that we need to remove the barriers for those who want to get back to work and tackle unemployment. In the long term, it would reduce child poverty by getting households off benefit and into sustained employment, but many of the organisations to which I have spoken believe that, although a lot is going on, more joined-up working is needed between the Department for Work and Pensions and jobcentres. The Department's consultation on housing benefit reform proposes that a transition-into-work payment should be made for the first three months of employment. That is an important first step.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/6">As I said earlier, many people are put off working because they are worried about the immediate effect-that they would be worse off as a result of losing benefit-but evidence suggests that if employment can be sustained for six months the likelihood of returning to benefit is significantly reduced. The organisations that I have spoken to say that the transition-into-work payment should not be for three months but for six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/7">With unemployment at 1.7 million at the end of last year and with the ongoing risk of an increase in the number of jobless, we need to do all that we can to prevent job cuts. The poverty rate for children in households where no one works is obviously worse than for children where somebody does work. Those on both sides of the House who are calling for cuts in public expenditure should remember that one man's public expenditure cut is another woman's job loss.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/8">People are concerned about proposed public expenditure cuts in inner London not simply because of the possible loss of services; in my borough of Hackney, the largest single employer is the public sector. If there were to be swingeing cuts in the public sector, many women struggling to keep their heads above water in a job-we are often talking about female-headed households-may find that their jobs have been taken away.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/9">Another factor that we need to consider further is the tax and benefits system; we need a simplification of the benefits system. At present, there are 51 welfare benefits in England and Wales, with different claims processes and forms to be completed. Some of those forms can be 50 pages long, often with the same questions asked for each claim. I have seen the forms; people come into my surgery and show them to me. I would have difficulty filling them in-let alone the people who come to me for help and support. With the best will in the world, it is difficult for people who genuinely want to go back to work to manage filling in the forms.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.0/1">The hon. Lady is right to say that the complexity of the benefit system is a key factor. As the Work and Pensions Committee pointed out, there is a shortage of part-time jobs and a high cost of child care. Does she accept that they are key drivers of child poverty in London?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.196.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="196"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0001.htm#10020969000466">
	<p pid="a.196.0/1">I touched on that matter earlier, but the hon. Gentleman is quite right. There is a shortage of part-time jobs and transport, and child care costs are another big disincentive. As I have said, we need to consider simplifying the benefit system. There needs to be a simplified system of support for child care costs that is clear and transparent to parents, providers and advisers. The present system is complex and has varying eligibility criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/2">Free school meals make it easier for families on tight incomes to budget. Studies have found that good-quality school meals lead to improved educational attainment and classroom behaviour. I welcome the Government's announcement of an extension of that entitlement to primary school children, but significant numbers of children who are entitled to free school meals do not receive them, and we need to look at why that is and remove the stigma about applying for them and receiving them. Many organisations have said that we can achieve that by removing means-testing, and introducing universal free school meals is a cost-effective way of helping all children in the education system, as well as having a substantial effect on tackling child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/3">As I have said this morning, I am glad to have had the opportunity to raise this subject. Members who do not live in London, or who live in the more prosperous parts of London, do not understand the poverty and deprivation that exists in London. The poverty that exists among children plays itself out in all sorts of negative social phenomena. I call on Ministers to focus on London, give local authorities flexibility, remove the barriers and complexity about the way in which the tax and benefits system interact and-this is a radical thought at this time in the election cycle-introduce universal free school meals.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.0/4">Everyone admires the Government's proposal and push on ending child poverty, but what everyone wants, even in a recession, is more progress on dealing with the specific areas that have made the issue so intractable. I say to Ministers that, without a particular focus on London, they cannot achieve all that they want. I know that it is old-fashioned to call in aid morality when we are discussing Government policy, but how can it be right that, at one and the same time, we can live in a city where people think nothing of paying &#163;1 million or &#163;2 million for a home and where at the very top end of the scale people live lives that are unimaginable to the rest of the world, we have one of the highest incidents of child poverty anywhere in the United Kingdom? Once again, I am grateful for the opportunity to address the Chamber on this subject.</p>

	<p pid="a.196.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> on securing this debate. This is a very important subject and one in which I am particularly interested. As she may recall, I was one of the Members who served on the Committee that considered the Child Poverty Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/2">It is important to go back to my earlier intervention to distinguish between those factors that are generic to London-she mentioned a number of them-and those that are generic to the individual groups that suffer the worst child poverty. She mentioned the high housing costs in London as a whole. I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase> for raising the points that were made by the Select Committee on Work and Pensions in its earlier report on child poverty. The Committee extensively examined the subject and it was concerned about the effect on London and on particular groups in London. As my hon. Friend pointed out, time and time again the lack of part-time jobs in London came out as an issue in the evidence sessions, as did the high cost of child care, to which we have already referred. When looking for solutions, it is important to understand the drivers for those individual groups. As we have already discussed, two of those groups are lone parents and ethnic minorities. On <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-17">17 June</phrase> last year, the Select Committee revealed that over the past three years there have been no real improvements in child poverty levels among lone parents, which was a great disappointment to us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.1/3">The hon. Lady will recall that the Child Poverty Bill largely passed the buck to local councils to deal with the problems of child poverty. On a number of occasions during its the passage, I expressed my unhappiness with the bureaucratic way in which it imposes duties on local government without freeing it up to take the action that is required. By and large, solutions to child poverty must relate to the specific circumstances of individual localities, and the problems that occur there.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.0/1">As for putting duties on local authorities, I was a local councillor myself and I bow to no one in my admiration of them, but I am a little wary of Government placing duties on local authorities, whether in relation to child poverty or dangerous dogs, without providing the resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.197.1/1">One of the great joys of coming here is to find that one is surrounded by people who, like me, were former councillors and who can speak from the experience of dealing with such problems on the ground, which is a great benefit to our deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.1/2">During the course of the evidence sessions in the Child Poverty Bill, we heard from a number of councillors and one council leader about the way in which councils-in this case it was Kent, which has some serious deprivation problems-have already set about tackling the problems by setting up a programme of working with other agencies. Two issues arise from that. First, is the hon. Lady, by implication, being critical of her local council because it has not tackled the problems that she illustrated in such a forceful way? Secondly, evidence came out from both Kent and Liverpool that one of the main inhibitors to joined-up working was the Department for Work and Pensions, particularly its unwillingness to play ball with local councils in schemes such as the Total Place experiments.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.0/1">I want to set the record straight. The main issues that I have flagged up as contributing to child poverty in London are benefit levels, the way in which housing benefit works, transport costs and the shortage of low-paid jobs. Such matters are not within the power of local authorities to address. I would not dream of criticising my own local authority.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.1/1">I recommend that the hon. Lady read the evidence sessions of the Child Poverty Bill, particularly the remarks made by the local government representatives, who provided one of the finest evidence sessions that I have seen so far in this House. What came across was a wish, which is borne out by my own experience, to free up local authorities and give them the relevant power so that they can tackle the problems in a way that is relative to their own areas. For example, my county council has not signed up to the child poverty target, but it has signed up to a lot of other targets that contribute directly to eradicating child poverty and particularly to breaking the cycle of deprivation.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.2/1">I welcome what the hon. Gentleman says about the aspirations of his own county council; they are very welcome. However, does he not concede that one of the problems of freeing up local government too much is that we go down the road of councils such as Barnet, which are operating a sort of &quot;Ryanair&quot; policy in their delivery of services, or that we go down roads taken by other councils, which simply want to decimate all public services and deliver a very low or zero local council tax? Surely if we are in one country and we want to eliminate poverty in this country, that requires us to place obligations on all aspects of our services, be they health or local government services, in order to achieve that target?</p>

	<p pid="a.198.3/1">I do not recognise any councils as wanting to &quot;decimate&quot; public services. Also, I do not see voters in any such council putting up with that. Ultimately, the test will be at the ballot box for those councils and I believe that people are fundamentally responsible in the way that they deal with child poverty issues, once they have been pointed out to them and they become aware of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/2">If one looks at my council, for example, what is applicable in Oxfordshire to tackle child poverty is certainly not the same as in an inner London borough; the issues do not need to be tackled in the same way. Recognising that is one of the great strengths that we can bring to the diversity that we have in local government, helping us to ensure that we are tackling the issues that are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.198.3/3">The hon. Lady has argued, and I agree with her, that there are specific issues for London. If that is the case, it is nonsensical to insist that a rural county council must impose a uniform solution to tackle problems that exist in London that may not exist in its own area.</p>

	<p pid="a.198.4/1">I agree with what my hon. Friend is saying. However, is not the complexity of the benefits system another big part of the problem? I think that I am right in suggesting that, according to the Department for Work and Pensions, there is something like &#163;10 billion of unclaimed means-tested benefits in the system. Also, there are great regional variations in the child tax credit. The complexity of the system does not help either, which is a point that the hon. Lady made.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">I agree with both my hon. Friend and the hon. Lady; I would love to see a less complex benefits system. However, I would also love to see a greater take-up of the benefits that exist. Again, during an evidence session for the Work and Pensions Committee in June 2009, it became apparent that there was very little in the way of firm targets established by the DWP to increase the rate of take-up of benefits to the maximum level that it could realistically be.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/2">I want to finish with a plea, really. We are still waiting to see a lot of the guidance about what will be imposed on local councils. If we are genuinely to have a light touch, as Ministers promised in the Committee considering the Child Poverty Bill, we need to see that light touch and we need to free up the councils to show it themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/3">Ultimate accountability for child poverty lies with the electorate in those areas and if one looks at the response from organisations such as London Councils and individuals such as the chairman of London Councils, who has welcomed the focus on child poverty in the Child Poverty Bill, one can see that many councils are just aching to take their responsibility for child poverty seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/4">Before I sit down, Mr. Martlew, I should just say that I will be unable to stay to the end of this debate, as I have to be in Committee a little later. I hope that you will accept my apology for that.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase>, who is my parliamentary neighbour, on securing the debate, on the way in which she presented her case, and on her work to promote the cause of anti-poverty in London and, particularly, the cause of education, especially regarding educational achievement for young black boys. She has done really well in promoting those causes, and she has done a great job representing people in Hackney in desperate need. I also think that her son has had a wonderful and colourful childhood, as not many children get to vote in the Division Lobby at the age of three weeks-there is nothing like bringing up young politicians.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/2">The problems of child poverty in London are obviously very serious. As I said, my hon. Friend and I have neighbouring constituencies, and while we share areas of great poverty, we also share areas of great diversity and excitement. One should not characterise London life as being entirely of grinding poverty-it is not. There is a huge degree of poverty in London, but there is also a degree of vibrancy, which is something that I value very highly and enjoy in my own community.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.2/1">I absolutely agree with the hon. Gentleman's important point about the poor educational performance of certain members of the black population.

	<p pid="a.199.3/1">Absolutely. I do not disagree at all with what the hon. Gentleman says about that issue-indeed, I will come on to it in a moment. The point that I was making was in the context of the excellent work done by my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington in trying to ensure that the aspirations of young people are met and that those young people are inspired to try to achieve. I will discuss that issue further in a moment, but we should be more than a little careful about promoting endless competition among primary schools and secondary schools through league tables, because that often has a depressive effect on people of whom we should be more supportive.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/2">I want to cite some truly horrendous figures on child poverty. First, there are the figures on the numbers and proportion of children falling below thresholds of low-income material deprivation. The three-year average in London, for the period from 2004 to 2007, was 22 per cent. For the period from 2005 to 2008, it went down to 21 per cent. That represents a slight decline from 400,000 to 300,000. Nevertheless, those 300,000 children-I repeat that they are children-in London living in a degree of poverty is the equivalent of the population of a major city in other parts of the country, or indeed in other parts of the world, living in poverty. Those are truly horrendous figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/3">If one looks at the regional poverty tables, before and after housing costs are considered, the figures are extremely significant. The poverty by region statistics, taken as a three-year average from 2005 to 2008, show the percentage of the population below 60 per cent. of median household income for each region. In inner London, the overall figure is 18 per cent. For families with children, the figure is 27 per cent., which means that there were 200,000 people in that particular group. However, if we move down that table and look at the after-housing costs figures, the proportion for inner London becomes 44 per cent., which means that there are 300,000 people in that group.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/4">I am trying to highlight the point that because housing costs in London are so much higher-extraordinarily so-than those in the rest of the country, they are a major factor in both child poverty and poverty in general in London. I will discuss that issue further later in my contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/5">Children growing up in London have the opportunity to see, do and experience just about everything. There are more theatres, cinemas and creative industries-all those types of things-in London than anywhere. The city offers the possibilities for an extremely vibrant childhood. However, there are also enormous barriers to accessing those types of things. I find it very sad when I come across children, including teenagers, in my constituency who have never been on an underground train or outside their own area because they feel insecure, because they do not have enough money to go and enjoy themselves anywhere, or because they just feel that, somehow or other, such opportunities are &quot;not for them&quot;. Even in a metropolitan and vibrant city such as London, one finds these amazing contrasts, which I still find quite shocking. It behoves us all to recognise that we must be as supportive as possible of what children do. We must also support schools as much as possible and not be over-prescriptive; I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2033" name="John Howell">the hon. Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase> about that to some extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.3/6">I visit all the primary schools in my constituency as often as I can and spend a lot of time talking to support workers, teachers, school meals workers and others. I am constantly struck by how limited the requirements on a school are-the school must get the children in, educate them, follow the curriculum and so on-yet what incredible efforts teaching assistants, teachers and support staff make to support children in other ways. Teachers have queued for three or four hours to come to my advice bureau just to go through a problem faced by one particular family. They are not paid or thanked for doing such things; they do them because they believe in what they do and want to support children. We should pay tribute to the teachers who decide to teach in difficult inner-city environments in order to do their best to inspire children. We should be more supportive of such teachers and recognise their contribution to the lives of many of our young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.0/1">I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has made that point. I also pay tribute to the teachers in my constituency-it is perhaps a slightly more prosperous area-who often engage in similar social work with disadvantaged families. They stay late on Friday nights, perhaps even trying to find a bed for a child whose family has had a row. Does he agree that that is an aspect of the work of teachers of which the Department for Children, Schools and Families is not sufficiently aware?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.201.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="201"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0002.htm#10020969000482">
	<p pid="a.201.1/1">I hope that the Department is aware of it, but the problem is how to recognise and reward it. Teachers' salary levels and housing difficulties are issues. I know that salaries have risen considerably, but we need to retain, and encourage the recruitment of, the best teachers in our inner-city schools. Over the past 10 years, I have certainly seen improvements in schools in my constituency, which now have much more money and equipment and more teachers. Head teachers no longer ring me up in tears because the roof of their school is leaking and they have no money to fix it-that kind of problem does not happen any more. Things have improved, but we have a long way to go on supporting schools and teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington raised the issue of poverty in lone-parent families in particular, as well as in families where one or both parents work for low wages. I have visited all the children's centres in my constituency-we have seven-and they are doing well. It is interesting to spend time in a children's centre and see how they work. The children are brought to the centre at various times in the morning, as a wraparound service is provided, and the parents are offered all kinds of support: from visits from Jobcentre Plus staff, to careers advice, to language and other classes. In other words, parents have a place not only where their children are well looked after, educated at a pre-school level and supported, but where their own aspirations can be improved. That is important. The opening of children's centres and their success for so many of our children is one of the great achievements of the past decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/3">My hon. Friend and others discussed the nutritional health of our children, obesity and related issues. Obesity is not necessarily a product of overeating; it is a product of bad food and advice. When children are allowed to snack on rubbish and eat over-watered hamburgers at all hours of the day and night-and when that is combined with a lack of activity-obesity and related problems will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/4">It is easy for columnists and others to keep going on about the burden on schools caused by the health police and healthy eating requirements, but healthy eating is crucial for small children. They need good-quality food, fruit and all the rest of it. The generation currently at school, who cannot bring in sugary sweets or inappropriate food but must have access to fruit and other good things, will grow up understanding much more than their parents about the importance of healthy eating. We should joke less about healthy eating in our schools and give it, and the principles behind it, more serious support.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/5">That leads me to free school meals and access to them. I personally believe in a non-means-tested approach to social support and the benefit system, and I am proud to say that Islington council, on a split vote at last year's budget meeting, agreed to the minority Labour group's proposal to introduce free school meals for all primary school children in my borough, starting this year. I welcome that absolutely. Unfortunately, the council executive decided to interpret &quot;free school meals for all primary school children&quot; as free school meals for all primary school children in six schools-I hasten to add that there are more than six schools in the borough. The provision will be extended to all schools starting next term.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/6">Will the Minister give us her views on the progress made by Islington council and ensure that there are no excessively bureaucratic funding hurdles? The children who would have been eligible for free school meals must still be identified in order to stack up the funding, so unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles have appeared on the horizon.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/7">I would also be grateful if <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase>, who will speak for the Liberal Democrats, will let me know why the Liberal Democrat council has said that if it wins a majority in the council elections on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-06">6 May</phrase>, it will abolish free school meals for all children across the borough. I have no idea of the thinking behind that, as it seems to be at variance with much else that it has said. I am sure, however, that he will be able to explain it.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/8">Another group experiencing unbelievable poverty in London is the children of asylum seekers-those who have arrived in this country and made an application for asylum. If the application is rejected initially, they may go through the appellant stage, which can last for years. I get letters from the Home Office telling me that my constituents in legacy cases can expect to wait another three years for a reply to their application. The children of such families receive an education, health care and minimal public support, as is right, but the parents often receive absolutely nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/9">A generation of children-the number is large in not just London, but throughout the country-is growing up in the most unbelievable poverty with parents who have no rights to work, to receive benefits, or to do anything but try to survive on their children's minimal benefits or what support friends or family can give them. We are not doing anybody any favours by allowing those children to grow up in such poverty and insecurity when the statistics tell us that, in the long term, most of them will end up staying in this country anyway. We are creating wholly unnecessary misery and poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/10">The biggest factor in child poverty in London is housing costs. In my area, which is fairly typical of inner London, about 40 per cent. of the population lives in social housing-property owned either by the council or by a housing association-on fixed and economic rents. About 30 per cent. of my constituents are owner-occupiers, which is a low proportion compared with the national average, and one that is declining fast. Again, that is typical of inner London; owner-occupation levels are declining fast because people cannot sell their property, so they move and rent it out privately.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/11">The private rented sector is the fastest growing sector, and the rents charged there are unbelievable. I met a family recently who lived in an ex-council flat that had been bought under the right to buy some years ago. For a two-bedroom walk-up council flat on an estate, that family was paying &#163;250 a week. That is not the highest amount; some pay far more than that. I have come across figures of &#163;400 a week for ex-council property, which is high by any standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/12">Who pays that rent? In the majority of cases, the housing benefits system pays it. We have got into the crazy situation of saying that there is a market rent and that the housing benefit system will support it. The market is therefore supported by the housing benefit system. I have made that point to successive Secretaries of State for Work and Pensions. I know that they understand the issues and that there are changes on the way, but I hope that we will be bold and go a lot further by bringing in rent controls for the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/13">I hope that we will look hard at the enormous benefit trap that is implicit in this problem. Most local authorities in London place housing applicants not in council accommodation, but in the private sector, sometimes paying the deposit so that they take up the place. That means that if someone on housing benefit with a family wants to get a job, they must earn enough to pay for the private rent for the flat of &#163;200 to &#163;300 a week. A rent of &#163;300 a week represents &#163;15,000 a year. The Department for Work and Pensions has recognised that problem and has increased the length of time for in-work benefit and for the continuation of housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/14">Some 80 per cent. of people in my constituency have no chance of buying property within the constituency. Unless we rapidly invest much more in social housing, housing associations and local authorities in inner-city areas, we will be consigning an awful lot of children to a life of terrible overcrowding and the problems that flow from it, such as illness and underachievement in school.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.0/1">On the contribution of housing issues to child poverty, does my hon. Friend agree that although our Government have a fantastic record on refurbishing old estates and bringing them up to modern standards, they have failed London with their over-reliance on the theory that councils should get out of the business of building new stock and that the market, above all, should be a provider? That was never going to be a practical option in London. I am glad that they have reversed some of that thinking, but it has created a problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.203.1/1">My hon. Friend is right that that has been an enormous problem. This debate is not solely about housing, but that is a major factor in child poverty and child opportunity. I agree that the refurbishment of estates is brilliant and that the decent homes standard is welcome, but unless we get children out of overcrowded flats, their life chances and aspirations will be damaged severely.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/2">We must imagine what it is like to be a young teenager of 13 or 14 in a two-bedroom flat with two other children of roughly the same age. What is it like for a girl to grow up sharing a room with her brothers? There is no space. They might feel embarrassed to bring friends home and they might not want to stay over with other friends because they cannot reciprocate. Those things might seem minor to us, but they are major for the children of that age group who have that lifestyle. We must invest all we can in building housing for the adults of tomorrow-the children of today.</p>
	<p pid="a.203.1/3">My final point is about job opportunities and barriers to work and training. The levels of unemployment in inner London are high by London averages and are usually above the national average. That puzzles and concerns me. The southern part of my borough and the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for Islington, South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) and for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) border the City of London. The City is a major employer. From the high-rise flats in our constituencies, we can see the gleaming office towers of the City of London. Do many of our children get jobs there? No. Do they travel there to work? No. Are they unemployed? Yes. Are they lacking job opportunities? Absolutely. There is a disconnect in London between opportunities for work and children living in the inner-London ring.

	<p pid="a.204.0/1">Some might argue that more young people in Hackney and Islington do not get jobs in the City because they do not have the requisite white-collar qualifications. An even bigger scandal is the relatively small number of children from Olympic boroughs who are apprentices, labourers, builders, plasterers and carpenters on the Olympic site. The Olympics provided an opportunity for our semi-skilled young people and those in manual trades to get jobs, but it appears to have been missed.</p>

	<p pid="a.204.1/1">Absolutely. Olympic building, as with any other building, ought to be an opportunity for training and development. Local colleges are not making sensible decisions. Carpentry, plastering and bricklaying courses have been closed down and yet people wonder why there is a shortage of carpenters, bricklayers and plasterers. It is not rocket science to recognise that if we do not invest in those skills at college level, it will result in skill shortages, underachievement and poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/2">Opportunities for work are important. It is important that the barriers that stop parents of young children from going to work are removed through Sure Start, children's centres, a more benign benefit system and a less bureaucratic approach. It is important to ensure that the minimum wage means at least that, if not more in the case of London. We must provide educational opportunities to parents so that they can take up new courses and receive education, if they did not achieve in school.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/3">The 1980s was a period of mass unemployment in this country, as much in central London as in the south Wales valleys, the north-east or the north-west. At the height of the 1980s depression, unemployment in my constituency was at about 20 per cent. That was as high as anywhere in the country, although it was probably even higher in Hackney and other parts of east London.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.1/4">This crisis is an opportunity to redress the imbalance between the rich and poor in our society. We should defend and maintain public expenditure. It will do us no favours if we start cutting public expenditure, removing services and losing public sector jobs. The public sector is a major employer in the poorest parts of the country. Such an approach would risk another generation losing the possibility of work. As my hon. Friend explained, children who grow up in households in which neither parent works, or none of the grandparents have ever worked, do not aspire to go to work themselves. I therefore hope that we will maintain or increase public expenditure on socially valuable and useful work. We owe it to our children to eliminate poverty so that they can make the very best of this wonderful city of London.</p>

	<p pid="a.205.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> on initiating this debate and on her thoughtful and thought-provoking views on child poverty and its effects on our capital city. I agree with her that as well as the issues that affect child poverty in general, there are specific issues with regard to our capital city. Solutions ought to be found to those problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/2">In their first term, the Government set the laudable and impressive target of halving child poverty by 2010 and eliminating it by 2020. It is disappointing that in 2010, 3 million children still live in poverty, 600,000 of whom are in London. Given that we have the sixth richest capital in the world, that is very disappointing. I agree with the hon. Lady that it is easy when moving around the city not to see some of the issues or appreciate the poverty that many people are living in.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/3">The hon. Lady highlighted eloquently some of the issues that politicians of all parties must tackle if we are serious about tackling child poverty. They are the worklessness cycle, the benefits trap and poor housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/4">I agree with what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said about housing being an issue that affects London more than any other region. My region-the north-west-has the largest number of children in poverty after London, so I appreciate some of those problems. Alongside the problem of housing, there is a lack of educational achievement and opportunities. Perhaps more peculiar to London is the problem that very high child care costs discourage many people from taking employment. We must tackle a range of issues with a range of policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/5">To their credit, the Government introduced the national minimum wage, but what has not been mentioned so far is that there is a living wage for London, which takes account of some of the particular factors in London. Last year, that living wage was &#163;7.45 an hour, which is higher than the national minimum wage. After some publicity last year by the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust, the Department for Children, Schools and Families agreed that it would pay its cleaning staff-contract and non-contract-the London living wage. I would be interested to hear from the Minister whether the Department for Work and Pensions is paying the London living wage, because I suspect that it is probably not. If we are talking about doing something, that should be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/6">Several hon. Members have mentioned the benefits trap, the 50-odd different benefits for which people can apply and the disincentives. As the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, the benefits system should be simplified, because we are concerned that if someone is receiving tax credits and they are working a small amount of extra overtime or additional hours, it can throw the whole system into disarray. Through no fault of their own, someone can end up owing hundreds of pounds. The system is inflexible and people have to go through umpteen call centres to try to get something rectified. We have said that one simple thing that ought to happen is that the level of tax credit should be set for the year and changed annually, rather than being constantly changed every time someone does something.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/7">The Child Poverty Bill is currently in the House of Lords. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> will reassure us with regard to that measure, because some Liberal Democrat Members of the House of Lords are expressing concern that the Conservatives might attempt to sidetrack the development of the legislation. I agree with the general point that has been made, particularly by the London Child Poverty Network and several hon. Members: the issue is not just about giving local authorities more responsibility; real power and finance need to be devolved, otherwise those freedoms will not be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.0/8">On the review of housing benefit, I agree with what the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said about it being more sensible to ensure that someone is back in work for six months. That is certainly something we would want to be developed. The number of apprentices has been mentioned. It is disappointing that there are only 350 apprentices on the London Olympic site. That golden opportunity has not been grasped. When many local authorities deal with public sector building, they try to make it a condition of the contract that local labour is employed and a number of apprentices are taken on.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.206.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="206"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0003.htm#10020969000488">
	<p pid="a.206.0/1">For some time, I have raised the issue of local employment on the Olympic site. Far from recruiting afresh, the big contractors on the Olympic site have switched people who work for them on sites all over the south-east to the Olympic sites. Not only is the number of apprentices there very low, but the number of young people from Olympic boroughs within that figure is even lower.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.206.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="206"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0003.htm#10020969000489">
	<p pid="a.206.1/1">I agree. That is something about which the Olympic Delivery Authority ought to be taken to task. Last week was national apprenticeship week and, probably like many hon. Members, I visited a company that had taken on a number of apprentices. A company that has its headquarters in my constituency of Rochdale has a contract with Hackney council and, as part of that deal, it took on eight apprentices. I understand that five of them are still working permanently with that particular company. There is a will and progress can be made, but we need to do more to ensure that it happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/2">On dealing with some of the wider issues, such as the benefits trap and encouraging more people to work, my party's policies for fair taxes, which we will put forward at the general election, will ensure that everyone who earns less than &#163;10,000 and everybody's first &#163;10,000 will not be taxed. That would give people and families an immediate increase of &#163;700 a year in their pocket, and would be paid for by ensuring that some of the people-there are many in London-who pay 18 per cent. on capital gains pay a lot more. Our mansion tax-&#163;2 million-would go some way towards paying for that. We think policies such as that and fair taxation will, again, encourage people back into work. In the same way, the pupil premium is also the way forward. That involves paying schools, so that they are funded to the level of the best independent schools, and would allow them to spend that money how they want, without central Government dictating how it should be spent with yet more targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/3">On housing, which is a particular problem for London, we must bring more empty properties into use. There is not necessarily a lack of properties in London, but there is a lack of them available at a price people can afford. Articles in newspapers such as the <i>Daily Mail</i> about the amount of housing benefit that certain individuals receive obscures the problem rather than providing a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.206.1/4">The hon. Member for Islington, North mentioned asylum seekers. Again, my party agrees with him: asylum seekers should be allowed to work. The current system is a disgrace in terms of the length of time it takes to decide on the position of asylum seekers. I shall also mention something he did not talk about, which relates to the work of the Southall Black Sisters in dealing with women who have no recourse to public funds because their marriage has broken down. Again, two years ago, the Government promised some changes on that, but they have not happened. We are still seeing women on the streets because they have come to this country, their marriage has broken down and they are not entitled to receive any public help.</p>

	<p pid="a.207.1/1">Certainly. I am just winding up now, Mr. Martlew. As I said, we would like that matter to be resolved. I was asked about free school meals by the hon. Member for Islington, North. I am not aware of what Islington council is doing. As a party, we supported the introduction of the free school meals trial, and that is what we would want to take place. I shall conclude there to allow others to contribute.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.207.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="207"  time="010:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0003.htm#10020969000492">
	<p pid="a.207.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> on securing the debate. She is absolutely right that London has particular child poverty issues and that no Government will successfully eradicate child poverty without paying special attention to London. I am grateful to her for securing the debate so that we can consider some of the issues. It is shocking that the children of black and minority ethnic communities are three times more likely to be in poverty than white children. That is a particular issue for London, and something that is wholly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/2">London also has a higher proportion of lone-parent families, and as we know from the Government's households below average income tables, that increases the likelihood of children growing up in poverty. My party backs the Child Poverty Bill and is scrutinising it fully in the Lords-we make no apology for that. For example, my colleague, Lord Freud, was able to scrutinise Ministers on the lack of an adequate definition of socio-economic disadvantage in the Bill. The Bill is proceeding in the Lords, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/3">Getting families into work in London is incredibly important. One of the great ironies about London is that although it is a great world city that has created jobs over the past decade and brought people from around the world here to work, there are such high levels of worklessness among families in London. One of my party's proposals is to bring in a work programme. We are not satisfied with the results of the Government's welfare and work programmes over the past decade. We intend to bring in a single, integrated welfare-to-work programme that will cover all those transferring from incapacity benefit to employment and support allowance as a result of work tests.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/4">The work programme will also cover the long-term unemployed, lone parents and the recently unemployed. It will be a fully funded programme that will replace the Government's new deals, which have not been as successful as they could and should have been, the flexible new deal and pathways to work. We will offer support to the vast majority of the people currently on incapacity benefit who have been abandoned by the Government. Through the work programme, we will offer people targeted, personalised help sooner-straight away for those with serious barriers to work, and at six months for under-25s.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/5">Providers will be paid by results, thus driving up quality and encouraging innovation. The principle behind payment by results is simple: if a provider does not place someone in a sustainable job, they do not earn their fee. A sustainable job, as far as we are concerned, means placing someone in work for a year or longer, unlike the flexible new deal, which rewards providers when someone has been in work for just 26 weeks. The programme is about transforming people's lives, not just a quick fix.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/6">We will also extend the period of engagement that providers have with claimants so that they can work with them over the medium to long term, thus delivering better results for those individuals. In a difficult job market, which sadly we face at present, that will also mean that providers will have a better chance of placing someone in a job and earning their fee. Under the flexible new deal, if an individual has been with a provider for a year and still not found a job, they are returned to Jobcentre Plus to begin the whole process again. That makes the flexible new deal a flawed scheme, particularly when vacancies are scarce, so we are taking a different approach to getting people back to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/7">One issue in London that has been mentioned by several hon. Members-helpfully, it is addressed in the London Child Poverty Commission's report &quot;Capital Gains&quot;, which was published in February 2008-is the shortage of part-time jobs, job-share opportunities and flexible working in the capital. Part-time work is absolutely key for parents with caring commitments and is often the first step to help them get back into the labour market. Although some of employment practices of the Department for Work and Pensions are quite good, the Government have failed to lead by example in that area, as many Departments have shockingly low levels of part-time and flexible working. The Government are a major employer and should be leading by example in that area, if they expect private employers to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/8">Several hon. Members have rightly touched on the need for reform of the benefits system. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> has undertaken a major study in that area and produced a report, &quot;Dynamic Benefits&quot;, the two principal conclusions of which are that we need to look much more carefully at earnings disregards and that we need to reduce withdrawal or taper rates, particularly for housing benefit. I was glad that the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington mentioned that point in her speech. We have proposed a reform to housing benefit that would allow tenants to choose to whom they pay their local housing allowance. That might seem a technical matter, but it is important, because it would increase the number of landlords who were prepared to offer their properties for social renting.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/9">I was glad that the Olympics were raised in the debate. It is a scandal that young, indigenous Londoners of all backgrounds do not have more jobs on the site. Frankly, that is a missed opportunity. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> mentioned that many young people in his borough did not look to the City for work, either because there are barriers in place, or because it is just not somewhere they consider going. That is a real issue within London. I talk to many groups working with out-of-work families, and it seems that sometimes people put constraints on where they are prepared to look for work, so anything we can do within schools to encourage children to have broader horizons physically-with regard to where they work-is incredibly important and will secure great benefits. We must also ensure that people in work, particularly in low-skilled jobs, have the means to improve their skills to advance themselves through what I call the ABC approach-a job, a better job, a career-so that they do not get stuck in low-paid jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/10">Skills are obviously an aspect of that, and I was delighted to read some comments made by the Mayor of London about skills at the London schools and the black child conference in 2009. On black and minority ethnic issues, to which we referred earlier, he talked about the importance of recruiting more teachers from the black and Asian communities, keeping children in school, tackling truancy and dealing with exclusions. I note, in particular, that the Mayor's fund for London is working to inspire young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to stay on in education and have role models so that they can aspire to jobs that are perhaps better than those that their parents or grandparents have had.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/11">We also know that within London there have been huge levels of immigration, and it is important that we bring immigration under control and improve the education and training of British workers. It is an irony, as I mentioned earlier, that London has sucked in workers and that jobs have been created here, but that they have bypassed many people who have remained on the welfare system-frankly that is not good enough. I want the children in the boroughs surrounding the Olympic park to benefit this year from the great opportunities there in construction and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/12">There has been no mention of enterprise or business in the debate, which is a great omission. The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington was right to pay attention to the important role of the public sector in providing jobs, but there must be a balance. We have to get London's small and medium-sized enterprises creating more jobs, because otherwise there will not be the money to pay for the decent public services that she and I want in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.207.2/13">I am therefore pleased by several actions that the Mayor is taking in his economic recovery plan to help business and to create jobs within London so that we deal with the poverty that we are talking about. He is looking at providing greater flexibility in the range of funds available for small businesses. He has created an economic recovery and investment fund to provide debt and equity finance to small businesses that cannot get that money from the banks. He is ensuring that small and medium-sized enterprises are paid by London public bodies under his control within 10 days, because cash flow is vital to ensuring that people keep their jobs. He is ensuring that contracts are open to SMEs in London, and he is speeding up planning permission.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.1/1">I will conclude in one minute, Mr. Martlew.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/2">The Mayor wants to see tax relief on travelcards. That is already in place in Nottingham, Bristol and Edinburgh, so why not in London? He is also ensuring the roll-out of the London living wage, which is currently &#163;7.60, and that even premier league football clubs in London pay that to the staff on their premises. He is developing an empty property scheme for small and start-up companies in addition to pop-up shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.1/3">Finally, on the issue of single parents, which was touched on earlier, I would like to refer briefly to <i>The Economic Journal</i> report by Richard Dickens and David Ellwood that shows that reducing the number of single parents and increasing family stability are critical to reducing child poverty. Lord Giddens said that he did not think there were academic studies on the subject, but I point him to that report, which is important as far as defeating child poverty in London is concerned.</p>

	<p pid="a.210.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr. Martlew.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> on securing a debate on this extremely important topic. She is absolutely right: child poverty is a serious problem in London, where it is 27 per cent., compared with the national average of 23 per cent. Given the extremes of wealth and poverty in the city, such a huge gap is a particular disgrace. Other hon. Members said that one of the main reasons for it is that parental employment in the capital is 8 per cent. lower than in the rest of the country and there is a particular shortage of part-time jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/3">My hon. Friend spoke about the Save the Children report, which suggested that the problem was getting worse for those on the lowest incomes. I would like to point out that the figures that it used were from 2007, and that the measures that we have taken since then will have reduced the number of children in poverty by a further 550,000. We are waiting for more up-to-date figures to see what the position actually is. At one point, I thought that she would come out as a one-nation Tory, but she held back from that conversion.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/4">In the recession, as my hon. Friend said, the working tax credit acts as an important stabiliser, and, crucially, we are supporting the labour market. We have put &#163;5 billion into new programmes, particularly the future jobs fund and Backing Young Britain. Such measures are designed to maintain family incomes and to avoid the kind of desperately high unemployment that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said existed in his constituency 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/5">One of the important things in the Child Poverty Bill is part 2, the whole of which is about the contribution of local authorities. It will mean that local authorities in London can work to design strategies that are particularly suited to the needs in their area. I shall give my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington a copy of a big research report that we just published, &quot;Ethnicity and child poverty&quot;, which shows that a particular penalty is faced by members of ethnic minority communities. We must also address that.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/6">Hon. Members spoke about the housing benefit system. They will know that we have just produced a consultation document, which has as one of its central objectives shifting work incentives by introducing fixed period awards and run-ons when a person moves into work. I remind hon. Members that housing benefit is an in-work benefit, which means that it should not disincentivise people from taking work.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/7">One of the important things that we have done is set up a large, multi-party group called the London child poverty delivery group. In January, a group on part-time working was launched to promote part-time working in the city and to address the real problems that are faced by people in part-time work.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/8">My hon. Friend spoke about the high costs of child care in the city. We are running important child care affordability pilots to look at the impact of changing the amount of money that is reimbursed from 80 per cent. to 100 per cent. and to examine actual costs. We will be able to see what impact that will have and then develop public services that actually do the trick.</p>
	<p pid="a.210.2/9">My hon. Friends the Members for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington and for Islington, North both spoke about the importance of free school meals, and I could not agree more. I was delighted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer's announcement in December about extending free school meals but appalled to hear that a Liberal Democrat council is proposing to cut entitlement to them. I cannot understand why, in a borough such as Islington, that is being proposed by a party that aspires to be taken seriously. I hope very much that we can address the bureaucratic problems that my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North raised.</p>

	<p pid="a.212.1/1">No, I am sorry. I do not have time because the hon. Gentleman did not leave me enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/2">I understand why <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> raised questions about the main Opposition party's commitment to the income targets in the Child Poverty Bill. For example, only yesterday, the noble Lord Freud said:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The targets measure household income as a proxy and, although there might be some correlation between the experience of a child and the level of household income, in many cases it is not a perfect proxy...The Bill is drafted around financial targets, but those targets do not measure child poverty, they measure household income.&quot;-[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class="date" code="2010-02-08">8 February 2010</phrase>; Vol. 717, c. GC143.]</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/4">That is an extraordinary statement from a party that purports to be interested in the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/5">Lord Freud also said in an earlier Committee debate on the Bill:</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Measurement is clearly important, but the risk is that the measures, being purely financial, drive state intervention in a particular direction.&quot;-[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class="date" code="2010-01-19">19 January 2010</phrase>; Vol. 716, c. GC130.]</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/7">What direction is that? What direction would he prefer? We know that Her Majesty's Opposition are proposing to reintroduce a married couple's allowance. The direction that that would take us in would give the bottom decile-the poorest people in this country-an extra &#163;30 a year while giving the top decile an extra &#163;380 a year. That is the direction that the Opposition want to take, and it would obviously have a serious and severe impact in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/8"><i>The Economist </i>says this week that the proposal</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/9" class="indent">&quot;does nothing for workless households. It would help only 11 per cent. of...British children in poverty, while handing bonuses to plenty of well-off people. That would be a bad idea at any time; in a period when the state must tighten its belt it is an extraordinary proposal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/10">I could not agree more. It seems utterly perverse to go down such a path when we could spend the same amount of money lifting 750,000 children out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/11">Let me return to housing in London. All hon. Members pointed out how significant the lack of affordable housing is. The Government have pledged &#163;2.8 billion over the period 2009-11 as part of the &#163;7.5 billion that we are spending to produce 112,000 affordable homes across the country. It is therefore extremely unfortunate and disappointing that the Mayor of London is stretching the 50,000 target for affordable homes that we had previously from three to four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.212.1/12">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington raised an extremely important issue this morning. She discussed lone parents and the need to get them back to work, and I very much hope that she will take part in debates on a statutory instrument that we will introduce to ensure that lone parents are required to work only during the hours when their children are at school.</p>

	<p pid="a.213.1/1">I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for selecting the debate on conflict prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/2">I am pleased to see in this Chamber my colleagues the hon. Members for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter) who, with me, are proud to be co-chairs of our all-party parliamentary group on conflict issues. It is out of the work of that group, which was formed in 2006, and out of the work of lots of other colleagues in this Chamber and elsewhere in the House, that this debate is born.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/3">It is a fact that, not just in this Parliament and this country, but in all democracies, people are realising that unless we become better at conflict prevention we will commit the world to a continuing succession of terrible conflicts that take their toll, and that conflict prevention is a wonderfully useful investment. The money spent on conflict prevention is repaid many times through avoiding the conflicts that might otherwise follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/4">Out of the all-party group, the Parliamentarians Network for Conflict Prevention and Human Security was formed in Brussels about a year and a half ago. The United Kingdom launch of that group happened in March last year: the Archbishop of York gave the keynote address and the Foreign Secretary sent a welcome message. It was not accidental that that group met here on the eve of the G20. We recognise and pay tribute to the G7, and later the G8 and the G20-including significant input by our Prime Minister-which have ensured that conflict prevention has been on not just the UK, but the international agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/5">I am encouraged that a significant number of colleagues in the House in many different parties signed early-day motion 81, which I tabled on behalf of our group. I thank colleagues for signing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/6">I am happy to see the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office in his seat. His Department takes the lead on delivering these matters across three principal Departments: the Ministry of Defence, the Department for International Development and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. I know that the Minister will want to be honest with the House and robust in setting out the Government's commitment to this agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/7">I pay tribute to the Government for the work that they have already done. It was clear from the time that they came to office that conflict prevention mattered to the Labour Government. Conflict prevention featured clearly in each of the Labour party's manifestos since 1997. I acknowledge and pay tribute to that fact. I acknowledge also, in the presence of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> who speaks for the Conservative party, that this year, as shown in the document produced by his party on these issues, his party has understood and has now made it clear that conflict prevention will be an important part of its foreign and defence policy agenda. I pay tribute to those who helped produce that document.</p>
	<p pid="a.213.1/8">It is not accidental that this debate is happening now. One of our objectives-I am direct about this-is to ensure that when each of our three major parties, and other parties, write their manifestos, conflict prevention is there clearly for all to see. Now is exactly the time for such a debate, when we are seeking to influence the agenda for the next Parliament and the next Government, whatever their composition. I hope that all parties will make it clear that this matter should not divide us when we need to be united and strong in making strong statements.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.0/1">As the hon. Gentleman is moving away from his introductory remarks, I warmly congratulate him on bringing this matter before the Chamber. He mentioned at the beginning of his speech the importance of the cost-effectiveness of conflict prevention. Does he agree that cancelling the massively expensive and eventually wasteful Trident project could be a cost-effective, sound step towards a safer world?</p>

	<p pid="a.214.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to ask that question, because it is on everybody's agenda. I can give him a clear answer to that. My party is committed to ensuring that we do not have a like-for-like replacement for Trident. We made that clear some years ago, not just because we believe that we need to find savings in those parts of our Budget that are hugely expensive, relatively, but because if we are seeking the safer world that we all want, multilaterally, we need to take the initiative. We in the United Kingdom-historically one of the world's great military powers-need to be leading, not following. I am conscious that this is the year of the multilateral negotiations on defence. Our position is clear and we will repeat it in the manifesto whenever the general election is called.</p>

	<p pid="a.214.2/1">I seek clarification from the hon. Gentleman and thank him for his kind words about the role that we have tried to play. In previous debates on this issue in recent times we have been told by his colleagues that the Lib Dems are conducting a review on what they are to do about Trident. The hon. Gentleman has just announced that we are not to have a like-for-like replacement. Will he be clear and say what that means? How does that fit with his colleagues saying, &quot;We haven't made our mind up yet. No decision made. We're in the middle of a review process&quot;?</p>

	<p pid="a.214.5/1">Thank you, Mr. Martlew. I shall try to give a short answer and then return to my central focus. My right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase> has been asked by our party leader to conduct a review. I will not pre-empt his announcement. But the party has already made it clear-my right hon. and learned Friend made it clear when he was leader, and I spoke in the debate at our party conference that addressed this issue-that we are not in favour of a like-for-like replacement for Trident. Therefore we do not take the same view as the Government, which announced their position some years ago, long before they needed to, or the Conservative party. The detail of the review will be announced by our party in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &#214;pik)</phrase> has joined us. Many colleagues, including him and my hon. Friends the Members for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) and for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore), have persistently asked oral and written questions of the FCO and DFID on issues to do with conflict prevention. I pay tribute to their interest and to the fact that we have been able today to pull together all that interest in what I think is the first formal debate on conflict prevention for many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/3">I have one other objection that I put up front straight away. We have annual debates in the House on each of the services. I hope that we will now have an annual debate on conflict prevention. [Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;] I hope that the Minister reflects on that and commits to it today or asks his colleagues to commit to doing so before the general election. The House would benefit from that and it would be good if the country knew that we took this matter so seriously that debating these things was not an accident of a ballot but something to which we returned regularly.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/4">I want to make two short comments, setting the scene, because a goodly number of hon. Members are present and I do not want to take their time or prevent strong voices from being heard about why this matter is so important and where we need to go next.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/5">When the Parliamentarians Network for Conflict Prevention and Human Security was launched, under the auspices of the EastWest Institute, it produced a simple, persuasive fact sheet with a table showing the number of wars that ended in negotiated settlement, rather than military victory, in the 1990s and since 2000. It will not surprise you, Mr. Martlew, to know that many more wars ended in negotiated settlement than in military victory: 42 in the 90s, compared with 23 by military victory. In this decade so far, at the time this fact sheet was produced, 17 conflicts were ended by negotiated settlement and four by military victory. However, the reality is that 50 per cent. of peace agreements do not hold, often because the peace has been imposed from the top rather than being built up from the bottom.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/6">One of the great successes of recent years has been in Kenya, where it was clear that a bottom-up peace process following the difficulties managed to lock in the peace that had been arrived at with such difficulty. Africa as a whole has learned the lesson of needing to do that. Success in Ghana and its ability to have a peaceful transition to different Governments has been due to its much more developed grass-roots network of engagement in such exercises.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.5/7">The financial figures are the most telling. The direct average cost of one conflict is $64 billion. When that figure was published, there were 70 ongoing or potential conflicts worldwide, and that sum translated into $17.5 trillion in cumulative, direct costs. For every dollar spent on conflict prevention, states spend some $2,000 on weapons and military budgets. That is a central and telling fact.</p>

	<p pid="a.215.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. Will he reflect-I am sure that his group would-on the situation in central America, where there has been a series of bitter conflicts, some of which are ongoing, with denial of human rights, abuses, and enormous security and military expenditure, except in Costa Rica which abolished its army in 1949, and systematically spent more on education and welfare than any other country in the region? It seems to be a much more stable and friendly place as a result.</p>

	<p pid="a.216.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right, and he has worked long and hard on Latin American issues, as I have, but to a lesser extent. Costa Rica is one of the few countries where such matters are written into the constitution, and Japan is another. It is a telling consideration when countries understand the benefit of that political position. The frustration of many people about the attempts to obtain equality in the world and some sort of redistribution and justice is that some of the poorest countries spend so much of their finance on defence and military equipment-up to 50 per cent. in some cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/2">A country in which I have taken an interest for a long time is Sri Lanka, where a terrible civil war ended only last year and there are still repercussions. It has had a huge military budget, and if there had been equal spending on peace-building and conflict prevention among the communities over the years, the whole country would have benefited and there would not have been the deaths and terrible political legacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/3">Latin America and single countries such as Sri Lanka are not the only ones to have had conflicts. I could list the countries where there have been ongoing conflicts and conflict prevention has not prevailed. When I was elected, there was, as now, ongoing tension and conflict in the middle east-it recurs regularly-between Israel, Palestine and surrounding states. Cyprus is still not at peace, so the problem exists on this continent in an EU member state and commonwealth country. There were terrible tragedies in southern Europe in the former Yugoslavia, and it is partly the international community's failures in places such Srebenica and Darfur in Africa that have made people realise that we must have different strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/4">In Africa, we did not manage to prevent the terrible civil war in Sierra Leone, but it is obvious that conflict prevention strategies are still needed to ensure that its growing and improving democracy, and that of Liberia next door, are secure in an area where a frequent cause of conflict-the battle over resources-is still alive and well, whether they are mineral resources as in that area, or other resources elsewhere. Nigeria in west Africa is still not stable because of the religious conflict between Muslim and Christian communities. The other day, the Indian Government instigated a welcome reconciliation initiative on Kashmir, where conflict has continued since the end of the second world war and since the UK pulled out of what became India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/5">The world has many conflicts, and I am conscious that in their response the Government have tried to identify the specific regions to which they are committed and in which they will invest. A key document, which may sound technical to people outside the House, is unexcitingly called, &quot;PSA Delivery Agreement 30&quot;. Its slightly more exciting subtitle is, &quot;Reduce the impact of conflict through enhanced UK and international efforts&quot;. It is a good source document, and it sets out what the Government wanted to pull together across Departments at the end of 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.1/6">There have of course been problems since then, and the reality is that, as the Minister will know, there was considerable criticism of the 2009 Budget settlement, because it seemed that the conflict prevention budget had been cut considerably. I have alerted the Minister to the sort of factual questions that I hope he will answer today, and I hope that one will be specifically about the budgetary commitments now and the Government's planned budgetary commitments for the years immediately ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.217.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate, the subject of which I agree with. Given the Government's superlative achievement of what I believe is lasting peace in Northern Ireland, does he believe that we could apply the sort of strategies that he is describing and that the Government successful applied in Northern Ireland to large conflicts such as Afghanistan? I am on record as saying that we should withdraw militarily from Afghanistan now. Is there any mileage in learning the lessons from Northern Ireland and the documents that the Government have published and applying them to those larger conflicts?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.217.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="217"  time="010:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0005.htm#10020969000509">
	<p pid="a.217.1/1">There are certainly lessons to be learned. My hon. Friend knows much more than I do about Northern Ireland from his family links and so on, although I have often been there. The peace there did not happen just because Governments in Dublin and London decided that there should be peace. It did not even happen just because the political parties realised the folly of what they were doing. It happened because the communities, led by women in large measure and young people, decided that peace was necessary. The lessons for conflict prevention around the world are that if the grass roots of communities, often women and often in rural areas, are supported in taking initiatives, they can build the structure for peace. Afghanistan is a good example.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/2">I was privileged to chair a conference in this very room at the time of the summit over the road on Afghanistan a couple of weeks ago, and it is absolutely clear that all the international policy and all the troops in the world will not provide a lasting legacy of peace in Afghanistan. The same applies to countries such as Iraq, which are made up of different communities with different traditions in one country with boundaries that were drawn artificially some time ago. There must also be a bottom-up process.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/3">The cross-party Select Committee on Foreign Affairs welcomes steps that the Government have taken-the single conflict prevention pool of funding, the creation of the stabilisation aid fund, the clear alignment between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's new public service agreement target on reducing the impact of conflict and the departmental strategic objective 6 on preventing and resolving conflict and developing indicators that make such things clearer. I am pleased that, since President Obama's arrival at the White House, the United States has understood the importance of such matters. Just the other day in January, the Chief of the General Staff made a welcome contribution down the road at the International Institute for Strategic Studies when he made clear the importance, from the military's perspective, of conflict prevention in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/4">I acknowledge and pay tribute not just to the people who support us in the all-party group, but to the groups in this country and elsewhere who lobby, inform, engage and educate on these issues and who are an important part of the debate and the political process. They include International Alert, Peace Direct, Responding to Conflict, Saferworld, the Global Partnership for the Prevention of Armed Conflict and organisations that work to ensure that the next generation understands these matters better than the last.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/5">A few weeks ago in the Macmillan Room, we were privileged to have an organisation called Leap Confronting Conflict, which talked to us about its work with young people. The reality is that if we educate the next generation of young people to understand that conflict can be prevented from home and in schools and communities, it is far more likely that politicians, diplomats and civil servants will be able to prevent conflict in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/6">To return to my questions to the Minister, if the Government accept the spending-to-save argument, why have they reduced funding for the prevention of conflict and for peacekeeping? Can we afford not to increase the money spent on reducing conflict, given that the long-term costs of conflict are so high? I hope that the Minister will tell us what is happening to the total of conflict funds year by year and inform us accurately what Government plans should be and what proportion of the budget will be spent on peacekeeping in the future. I hope that the Government will tell us how much they want to spend-and are spending-on what are called long-term or upstream preventive measures, as opposed to military interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/7">I know the commitment of the Secretary of State for International Development, and everybody agrees that conflict often prevents proper development. Is there likely to be any additional support from the Department for International Development or other Departments towards the Government's conflict prevention activities? Do the Government seek to assess the relative costs of direct military intervention in a specific country, so that they can assess what the costs of alternative strategies would be?</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/8">If we contemplate intervention in the future-whether in a place such as Sierra Leone, where we were invited in by many people, or somewhere such as Kosovo, which was clearly controversial both in international law and at home-is there a mechanism to assess the benefits and cost of direct intervention against the cost of preventive and peacekeeping measures in advance? Do the Government look clearly at the benefit of investing in local people-this is the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire-so that local communities can build the peace, as opposed to bringing in outside agencies? Given the comments of the Chief of the General Staff in January, it would be valuable to know whether the Government think that they have adequate mechanisms in place to measure the effectiveness of our efforts, both unilaterally as the UK and as part of NATO and the European Union, in preventing violent conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/9">I do not expect the Minister to elaborate in detail on all of those points, but it would be helpful to understand whether the Government see most of this work as multilateral, as opposed to work that they do on their own. In many ways, we are perceived as taking the lead on such matters. It would be helpful to know what the Government see as a gold standard whereby we can be seen to take the lead not only in those countries where we have a particular interest, but in other countries round the world. Can the Government say with confidence that international mechanisms are in place so that, in this decade just beginning, the assessment is that there is lesser risk of armed conflict globally than ever before?</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/10">I will end with a set of issues. As someone who takes a particular interest for my party in matters of energy and climate change, I am clear that the conflicts of the future are likely to be driven by competition and struggles for resources. Threats caused by the climate crisis are likely to increase rather than reduce the risk of conflict. People will struggle over water, for example, and that heightens the chance of conflict-recently, there was a fear in Bangladesh that its water supplies were likely to be cut off by a dam-building project by India upstream.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/11">Last night, I was with our noble Friend Lord Ashdown who was speaking about the fear of conflict driven by shortages of food in some parts of the world. The reality is that energy, water, food and the other ravages of climate change are likely to be the drivers of conflict, particularly in the less-developed and poorer parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/12">At the end of the debate, it would be helpful to hear not only that the Minister understands those issues from the point of view of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but that the Government have a coherent strategy. For example, all the information that comes to the Minister's colleagues in the Department of Energy and Climate Change about the risks to, and instability of, global energy supplies could be factored into Government policy, European Union policy and our activities in the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/13">My last plea is this: I am a supporter of the United Nations; it has done a fantastic job, but sometimes it does not have the effective ability to intervene where it needs to do so. I return to Sri Lanka-the world was standing by and the UN was powerless to intervene. The right to protect, which has now been accepted in international law, cannot necessarily be invoked when countries need it. When countries are likely to go into that sort of conflict and when they put up barriers and do not allow anybody in, it almost invariably ends up with genocide and a terrible legacy that is a hugely expensive and costly problem to solve for generations to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.217.1/14">I do not pretend that the world will necessarily be safer in the next 10 years than it has been in any other decade during our lives. The number of conflicts in the world have certainly gone down, but many ongoing conflicts recur and they are not necessarily solved just because peace has come once. I hope that the Government understand that investment by them and by other Governments in effective, bottom-up conflict prevention, regional support systems in the world's continents and the understanding that that must be central to the agenda of the UN, the European Union, other regional organisations and individual Governments is the best way to ensure that the decades ahead have fewer conflicts and far less money spent on defence, armaments and arms exports and that the agenda can be turned to give the world a better chance of a more peaceful future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.220.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="220"  time="011:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0005.htm#10020969000512">
	<p pid="a.220.1/1">I will try to be as brief as possible, Mr. Martlew. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> on securing this debate. There is a sense of irony in having this debate at this point in time, because we have just lost the 255th soldier in Afghanistan, which matches the loss of life in the Falklands. Furthermore, the US and the UK are preparing for the largest battle of the Afghan war so far. There is a sense of irony, but if anything, that gives a sense of urgency to the debate about conflict prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/2">It has been interesting to see the movement over the past eight years, and the momentum that has been building in the search for an alternative route to avoid conflicts rather than to pursue them. That has been found across all parties, but it has been driven by the Government and from deep within the heart of the military, as seen in some of the statements that we have had.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/3">I congratulate my colleagues the hon. Members for North Southwark and Bermondsey and for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter), who are joint chairs of the all-party group on conflict issues. I apologise that they have had to shoulder the burden of the all-party group for a couple of years, while I have been battling to save the homes of my constituents at Heathrow-that is another debate, which I will not go in to. I would also like to put on record my tribute to Eddy Canfor-Dumas and all his colleagues who have supported us on a voluntary basis to develop the all-party group. They have shouldered the burden of the hard work.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/4">I came to these discussions in 2003 when, as a result of the work done by Diana Basterfield and others, I introduced a ten-minute Bill to promote a ministry for peace. The concept of the ministry for peace was about having an alternative route to that of conflict, in which the paradigm is changed so that expressions such as, &quot;the best form of defence is attack&quot; are seen as wrong. The best form of defence is actually securing peace and preventing conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/5">How do we do that? Well, instead of having ministries of war or defence, we should imbed the search for peace in the heart of the Government by establishing a ministry for peace. It is a simple concept that has been taken up by the Government. I pay tribute to the infrastructure that has been put in place by the Government and to the personal role that the Prime Minister has played in pursuing conflict prevention at the heart of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/6">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned some of the structures put in place in recent years, but establishing the conflict prevention pool was a major breakthrough, bringing together the Treasury, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and DFID not only to co-ordinate a pool of resources and their work, but to bid competitively for resources to demonstrate how successful they could be in securing peace. That was a real breakthrough.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/7">The stabilisation unit has been developed. That is another joint unit involving the FCO, DFID and the MOD. Within the FCO, there is a unit that deals with conflict issues but specifically considers human rights. That is another agenda issue that has been discussed time and again in Adjournment debates but that the Government have now taken up. DFID has its own conflict, humanitarian and security department, which is tackling humanitarian, conflict and security and justice issues, particularly those underpinning poverty. Mention has been made of PSA 30. At least we have something that gives us a reporting-back mechanism, with some targets on time scales. We know the weaknesses and vagaries of it, but at least we are moving in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/8">I was encouraged by the statement from Sir David Richards, the Chief of the General Staff, in January. It is worth putting on the record as a statement of intent from the military. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/9" class="indent">&quot;We must put much more emphasis on preventing conflict, on ensuring fragile states do not become the Afghanistan of tomorrow. Whilst this is much more than a military role, we must be structured and resourced to play what can often be a key part... We must get this balance right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.220.1/10">We concur with that across the all-party group.</p>

	<p pid="a.221.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, at heart, what he is discussing is predicated on the assumption that most of our adversaries are sane and motivated, regardless of how objectionable their methods are, and that as long as we have sane, motivated adversaries, the real challenge is to address their motivations? That is much more effective than simply trying to kill them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.221.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="221"  time="011:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0006.htm#10020969000514">
	<p pid="a.221.1/1">That is exactly the lesson that we have learned in recent years. The hon. Gentleman mentioned Northern Ireland. The issue is addressing the causes of conflict, rather than just the symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/2">I pay tribute to the organisations mentioned by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey that have contributed to our work. I also pay tribute to those in the ministry for peace here and in the Global Alliance for Ministries and Departments of Peace and to Kai Brand-Jacobsen, the inspirational peace worker. People should read his speech from 2006 in Portcullis House on the ministry for peace website, which gives an indication of the pragmatic and practical ways in which we can inspire peace.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/3">I shall give two of the most recent examples of the practical work done by movements elsewhere in the world to secure peace that we and the Government can learn from. In Nairobi in Kenya last week, there was a seminar on building infrastructures for peace, which the UN helped to facilitate. It brought together 14 African countries, which examined a detailed programme of work for establishing structures, methods and resources that would identify potential conflicts and considered not only the problems encouraging those conflicts, particularly the scarcity of resources, which has been mentioned, but the role of development, the impact on the scarcity of resources and the models to be put in place at all levels of Government and civil society to promote peace and prevent conflict. That useful dialogue has occurred in the developing world, which we can learn from, because it deals with civil society structures as much as Government structures.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/4">Costa Rica was mentioned. It is interesting that Costa Rica hosted the Global Alliance for Ministries and Departments of Peace conference. In addition to installing in its own constitution a commitment to peace, it has established a Ministry of Justice and Peace. That is the third Ministry for peace in the world. President Oscar Arias, the Nobel peace prize winner, opened the global alliance conference and announced the establishment of that Department. Again, there are lessons that we can learn from someone who has practical and pragmatic experience of bringing about peace in his own country and promoting it on that continent, and the Government would do well to listen.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/5">This point was made by the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey. We need now a commitment to maintain the momentum in government. Given the complexities of budget structures across Departments, I and others, including peace groups, are unsure of the commitment and resources being applied in government to conflict prevention and of what is planned for the long term. It would be helpful today to have some clarity about that. If my hon. Friend the Minister cannot give us clarity, it would be useful if he attended the all-party group and we could have a more comprehensive discussion about the detail of the planned process in government for the investment of resources and about the Government's new ideas about how they can best be co-ordinated across Departments and then linked with advice from civil society organisations and the organisations that we have mentioned, so that the all-party group could be advised.</p>
	<p pid="a.221.1/6">May I also put this on the table? I do so unilaterally; I have not consulted the joint chairs of the all-party group. I would like the concept of conflict prevention to be taken out of the knockabout of the general election debate, or at least let us set a base that the parties can compete from to best one another. May I make this offer? I apologise if it is unilateral. I think that the all-party group could play a role in bringing all three political parties together to construct a cross-party manifesto for the general election on conflict prevention. It could, for example, set the principle among all political parties that the main direction of their future international policy would be peace, that structures would be established in government, linked with civil society, to promote peace and that that would be adequately resourced. If we can facilitate that dialogue and have that principle installed in the manifesto of each party, it will send the message that we are all committed, determined and serious about conflict prevention and that we will not allow future changes of government to undermine that general direction of policy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.222.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" speakername="Gary Streeter" colnum="222"  time="011:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0006.htm#10020969000515">
	<p pid="a.222.0/1">I am delighted to follow the other joint chairs of the all-party group. I am attracted to the unilateral offer that has just been put on the table and would happily pick that one up. I also pay tribute to the many groups that support us and do such excellent work. I have very much enjoyed being involved in the group in the past couple of years. That perhaps demonstrates the point that the conflict resolution agenda is not just for <i>Guardian</i>-reading left wingers; it cuts right across the political spectrum, although I certainly do not describe myself as a <i>Telegraph</i>-reading Tory any longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">I want to make one simple point in a short speech. I believe that the issue of conflict resolution feeds into a wider debate about the role of Britain in the world that we are having because of the forthcoming strategic defence review and because we have a significant problem with debt, which we all know about. That is forcing us to focus on our priorities. Although there are those in that debate who think that we cannot afford to play the international role that we play in global affairs and that we should retrench and become a Norway, a Switzerland or a country of that ilk, I am firmly of the opinion that that would be a huge mistake, both for us and for the world, and that we have a very significant and special role to play in global affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">I suggest that that role increasingly should focus, with all the assets that we have, on our being a country that focuses on peace making. That is a role that Britain can uniquely offer the world. Why do I say that? We have the armed forces. That is a significant asset because we know that sometimes the threat of force or even the use of force is essential in bringing about peace. Hon. Members may not all agree with that, but the threat of force is there. We have an incredible heritage in terms of soft power. The diplomatic skills that we have and the democracy that we enjoy in this country are part of the skill set that we can bring to the table. In addition, we sometimes underplay the vast army of non-governmental organisations, large and small, in this country that have significant experience and that focus on many issues, but particularly conflict resolution and prevention. We have so much to bring to the table; let us bring it.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4">Some might say, &quot;Who are we to go around talking about peace and conflict resolution and prevention?&quot;, because of the struggle that we have had in Northern Ireland for the past 30 or 40 years. I say that that is not a negative. We have gained experience from Northern Ireland. I sat in this room some months ago, at a meeting horribly traduced by the <i>Daily Mail</i>, and heard Patrick Magee and the daughter of Sir Anthony Berry, who had been meeting and talking together for years, talking of their reconciliation as individuals. In the end, achieving peace will come down to human beings getting together across divides to resolve issues and differences, as they have done so wonderfully in South Africa as a result of the astonishing leadership of two or three individuals. Our Northern Ireland experience can therefore strengthen our hand, and it gives us useful experience to bring to many tables around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">I congratulate the Government on their focus on conflict prevention over their 13 years in office, which are, of course, about to come to a crashing end. I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> that it would be great if policy at the Foreign Office, DFID and the MOD could focus increasingly on peace making, conflict resolution and conflict prevention and if this country increasingly acquired a reputation around the world for using its assets to bring to an end some of the conflicts that are causing such misery and poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/6">Many of my constituents will say, &quot;But what's the national interest in doing this?&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.223.1/1">My hon. Friend, who speaks from a sedentary position-I am sure that you will feel like ruling him out of order, Mr. Martlew-is absolutely right. We live in a globalising world, and the genie will never be put back in the bottle, so if we can build peace and prosperity in other nations, our children-if we must look at these things in terms of our national interest-will be able to grow up in a safer and better environment. I therefore suggest to the Minister that the UK's future is firmly one of peace making, and I look forward to his response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.224.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" speakername="Eric Joyce" colnum="224"  time="011:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0006.htm#10020969000518">
	<p pid="a.224.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> on his speech. He mentioned that regional conflicts could become international conflicts, and that we need to keep a lid on them at the regional level when we can. We tend to talk about places such as Afghanistan and Iraq, which have become the focus of international attention, but the hon. Gentleman listed a few of the many other places across the world that are witnessing conflicts, and I want to say a few words about the eastern Congo. Most people would not think of it as a place of great strategic interest, and when Governments such as ours think about where to place their emphasis and spend their money, it is not always in such places. It has to be said, however, that the UK Government are actually the main donor to every nation bordering the eastern Congo; that is certainly true of Rwanda and Burundi and, indeed, of the Democratic Republic of the Congo itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/2">I want to refer to two UN Security Council resolutions in terms of conflict resolution and prevention. The conflict in the eastern Congo is a consequence of the genocide in Rwanda, which took place in 1994. There are many armed groups in the area, and the Congolese Government have little capacity, so we rely very much on the work of the international community. UN Security Council resolution 1857 relies on member states to give the Security Council the names of people and companies involved in trading minerals in the eastern Congo and the wider region, although the process is not always smooth or easy.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/3">It is often said, although I am never absolutely clear how much truth there is in this, that UK privacy laws make it harder for the UK Government to provide the names of individuals whom they believe might be trading in minerals in the Congo in a bad way. That can simply mean that money is changing hands in a non-transparent way, but we all know what happens when that is the case: the money will invariably fund armed groups. Perhaps the Minister will comment, therefore, on how prepared the UK Government are to provide the names of people and companies operating in the UK, because one or two companies have been mentioned in international and UN documents. Britain is far from the worst offender, but in the case of at least one of the companies involved, we might not be ensuring the free flow to the UN of information that will allow it to take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/4">The other UN Security Council resolution is 1906, which essentially relates to having a better focus on international efforts to resolve and prevent conflict in the eastern Congo. The United Nations mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is the largest UN contingent in the world, with about 20,000 peacekeepers, will reach the end of its current mandate on <phrase class="date" code="2010-05-31">31 May</phrase>. MONUC does its very best to keep a lid on things, but its capacity will always be pretty limited, and many hon. Members who have been to the DRC will have observed that for themselves. The capacity of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is, if I can put it this way, enormously limited; often, they are an offender themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.0/5">The Congolese Government's remit does not really extend to protecting their citizens in the eastern Congo, so the international effort is all the more important. There are, of course, many other demands on the UN's resources, and each time resolution 1906 comes up for negotiation, there is talk of MONUC's being downsized so that the peacekeepers can be used in other important fields of conflict; indeed, we might hear more about those later. However, I hope that the Minister will assure us that when the new mandate comes up for negotiation-Alan Doss, who is a UK citizen, runs MONUC and is seized of all this-we keep the same focus on co-ordinating the international effort. I also hope that he can assure us that we will do much more than we have in the past, once the mandate has been negotiated. Of course, we must recognise that there is demand in other parts of the world, but the mandate is extremely important, and I hope that the Government will place it as high as they can up their list of priorities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.225.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" speakername="John Greenway" colnum="225"  time="011:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0006.htm#10020969000519">
	<p pid="a.225.0/1">I want to bring a quite different dimension to the debate by referring to my involvement in work with the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly that touches on this important subject. For me and my colleagues, the focus is not so much conflict prevention as conflict resolution, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> said. In our experience, the failure to resolve Europe's frozen conflicts is the real cause for concern, certainly in terms of the European geographical dimension.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/2">Last year, the Parliamentary Assembly adopted a report that I had produced under the title of &quot;Europe's forgotten people&quot;. It is about the 2.8 million people-yes, it is that many-who are internally displaced within Europe's borders, mostly in the Balkans and the south Caucasus. I had the privilege of going to Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan to talk to people about the vexed problem of the still frozen conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. On behalf of the European Security and Defence Assembly-the old Western European Union Assembly-I have also looked at the security issues in the Balkans, where the failure to resolve frozen conflicts is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/3">Some of the people I met in Armenia still live in appalling conditions, and the situation in Azerbaijan is even worse. However, when I went to Baku to visit new housing developments built by the Azeri Government, I talked to 14 and 15-year-old schoolboys and girls in the street outside their school, and these children, who were born in Baku, not Nagorno-Karabakh, said, &quot;We will go back to Nagorno-Karabakh and fight with our bare hands to get back the country that belongs to us.&quot; The failure to resolve such conflicts and frozen problems creates a breeding ground for resentment. As a result, there is real tension in the region, and I am sure that the Minister will refer to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/4">I have also had the opportunity to talk to Turkish Ministers about the situation, and there is real hope that reopening the Turkey-Armenia border will help to improve things. Again, however, it is difficult to find a political solution, because a lot of people in Turkey say that they will have to say no to such a development until problems such as that in Cyprus are resolved. However, I do not have time to develop that point further.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/5">The Assembly has looked in great detail at the consequences of the Georgia-Russia conflict, and the conclusion that we quickly reached was that the international community had ignored the warning signs-they were there, but they were not followed. The problems in the region were not resolved, and the consequences have been utterly tragic, with ethnic cleansing, property destroyed and tens of thousands of people left homeless. Two districts of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia-de facto independent states-are completely in limbo, with no protection from the international community. We should deplore that; it is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.225.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing the debate, referred to Africa. Our work suggests that there are about 31 or 32 countries in Africa that are directly or indirectly affected by conflict, yet we wonder why people want to leave there and come to Europe. That is the push factor that is driving the problem of immigration. I have said that before, and written reports about it, and it is a great joy to have the opportunity, once in a while, to talk about it in Westminster.</p>

	<p pid="a.226.1/1">Absolutely. I wish that there were more time to deal with that, but perhaps we can discuss the issue again on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/2">I want to talk about four solutions. First, hon. Members might not know that two weeks ago I was appointed chairman of the Migration Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, after four years of carrying out such work. I am supposed to be leaving Parliament at the election, but I shall get this year, so that is okay-it is so important. We have just agreed a report in the Assembly about the restoration of property rights. It is critical that redress is given to people. That does not necessarily mean saying, &quot;We will give you this flat or house a thousand miles from where you came from.&quot; What about redress for the property that was taken? International action on that is critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/3">Secondly, more work is needed on the resolution of frozen conflicts. No one has mentioned the European Union, but it is the critical driver. That is also true in relations with Russia. The matter cannot be resolved without the two sides together. The European Union's policy on neighbourhood and development can provide the support that is needed for the countries that are affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/4">Thirdly, the enlargement of the European Union is also vital. In the Balkans, all opinion shows that support for European Union membership relies on the benefits of security as well as on economic prosperity. The security issue cannot be overstated. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey mentioned Kosovo. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a problem, and even in Croatia, which is about to join, there are still difficulties. Turkey must be made a member of the European Union as quickly as possible, as Europe can never solve the problems in the middle east without Turkey. If we have Turkey, there is a chance. I know that the issue is a vexed one-<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> frowns-but I have studied the question and held seminars on it, and I believe that that is to be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.226.1/5">Finally, more attention should be given to the issue of water, resources, energy and food. To go back to the question about that posed by my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Devon in his speech, and my answer that the national interest involved is huge, I made a speech about that to my constituency association about a year ago. One lady asked, &quot;What's it got to do with us?&quot; There was a map on the wall that had been put there by Members of the European Parliament, and I said, &quot;Look at that map on the wall. Show me where the energy is and where it has to come from to get to you.&quot; There is the answer.</p>

	<p pid="a.227.0/1">I am pleased to play tail gunner and to try to sweep up some of the points that have been made-<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Sorry about that unintentional pun.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> on securing the debate. The all-party group on conflict issues is an excellent one, and I shall mention a couple of others. I chair the all-party group on Sudan, which knows a little about conflict, and I also want to mention the all-party group on women, peace and security, which also plays an invaluable part in the work on this issue. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> on the work he has done for the Ministry for Peace. When he is not present, I end up chairing most of its meetings, and Diana Basterfield has briefed me on some of what I need to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/3">To put matters in context, it is pleasing that the idea of peace institutes and peace studies is no longer seen as marginal, but mainstream. There are now more than 800 peace research institutes in the world, and about 1,500 researchers and 400 academic peace studies departments, so this is not going against the grain any more but with it. Of course, we have much to learn, and there is much to lose if we do not get things right.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/4">There is an irony about timing, given Afghanistan and Iraq. I and other hon. Members get lectured when we travel around the world. We are told, &quot;You are all right when you talk about the conflicts that you accept, but our conflicts are seen to be of a different order, and we are told to get our act together.&quot; I hope that we shall not renew the Trident programme, but we are talking about the comprehensive test ban treaty at the same time as considering that. In other parts of the world, that strikes a note of irony, and people look at us open-mouthed and wide-eyed when we cannot see the connections that they make. We must do more to get our house in order.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/5">Among the issues that have not yet come up in the debate, the role of women cannot be overestimated. I am pleased to have been an officer of the all-party group on women, peace and security, which is known in the trade as the 1325 group, after the UN resolution. We can criticise the Ministry of Defence, but it has been very good about recognising the importance of training our troops in such issues as how to deal with women in a conflict zone, including recognising sad instances of rape, abuse and mistreatment. That has a lot to do with cultural awareness-raising, and we have embraced that approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.227.0/6">As for Sudan, I congratulate the Government on our being in there for the long term. This is a key year in the history of Sudan. The forthcoming elections are of course debatable and dubious, but they must nevertheless take place if we are to get to the referendum on the potential secession of the south in 2011. I am optimistic that we can get through the process, but it will be devilishly difficult. A point that has not come up yet is the crucial role of British diplomats in Sudan. They are part of the troika with the US and Norway, and they are shuttling about-that is not good for the climate, but nevertheless vital-keeping the talking going and trying to deal with conflict resolution, if not prevention.</p>

	<p pid="a.228.1/1">To give the situation context, and to show how difficult the task is, the comprehensive peace agreement, which is continually questioned and under threat, has not prevented the events in Darfur, which represent, in my view, the first climate change war. It was all to do with nomads coming in and trying to settle where the pastoralists were, and then, as always, the north went in with two boots and to some extent the south reacted. There is always the problem with the east, where there is the potential for conflict easily to spin off from events elsewhere in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/2">What have we learned? We have learned that to bring peace to a country means being in it for the long term. There are no quick fixes; it is necessary to be there reinforcing the peace strategies. We must recognise that the problems are local as well as national. Often civil society capacity building must happen at an incredibly local level. We like to think that peace is breaking out in the south of Sudan at the moment, but there is a huge number of conflicts there, all to do with the usual things such as animal rustling and people falling out over who has taken whose bride. That can easily trigger a much bigger conflict unless we get in there and do the business. Resources have been mentioned, and water is crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/3">We must get hold of the small arms trade, which is a legacy left by the west. The arms might not be coming from the west any more but, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> said, the problem is being fuelled by all sorts of most unhelpful interventions. There is a need to bear down on those and eventually stop them. Of course, we must have views about how Governments fuel the conflicts, using small arms to repress their populations in their own way. We must keep reinforcing how important it is to stop those trades.</p>
	<p pid="a.228.1/4">I wish to make two final points. First, our country has, of course, moved forward by signing up to the International Criminal Court sanctions. That makes an awful lot of difference in Sudan because it has an indicted president. It is not easy-some find it quite difficult-to determine how to take that forward, but as we have signed up to the ICC sanctions, we must recognise their importance. Secondly, development must always go alongside conflict prevention, because without development, people will never have the time or space for us.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.229.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="229"  time="012:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0007.htm#10020969000523">
	<p pid="a.229.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> on securing this debate. The time spent by the House debating conflict prevention pales in comparison with the time that we spend discussing conflicts that have not been prevented. Perhaps that balance needs to be adjusted. I wholeheartedly support the idea put forward by my hon. Friend that there should be an annual debate on the subject rather than relying on the random nature of the ballot to secure debates in Westminster Hall.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/2">It was excellent for the quality of debate that so many contributed, including the co-chairmen of the all-party parliamentary group on conflict issues and those involved in other groups that deal with specific parts of the world. Also welcome, of course, is the great consensus that exists across the Chamber on the question of conflict prevention. I particularly liked the idea expressed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> that the matter should be removed from the political knockabout in the run-up to the general election. The all-party group would have done a great piece of work if it could get all parties to agree on some key priorities after the election, whatever the result may be, so that we have a long-term strategy and continuity.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/3">It almost goes without saying that conflict prevention is essential. It has a clear and obvious humanitarian objective. Another factor that came out clearly in today's debate was the economic imperative, which is important given that we are in a recession. I was staggered by some of the figures; $64 billion is the average cost of each conflict, and when multiplied it gives a total of $175 trillion. The figures are mind-boggling. Indeed, for every dollar spent on conflict prevention, $2,000 is spent on military defence. Saving money in future by spending more on conflict prevention would seem to be wise.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/4">I want to touch on a few key elements of conflict prevention as it affects foreign policy. They include the support given to other states, particularly to fragile states; the peace-building process and how it relates to preventing future conflict; the role of women in conflict prevention; and the future strategic threats that were mentioned by various Members, particularly climate change and access to resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase> was right to say that we often ignore the warning signs that there is about to be a massive problem in another corner of the world, and that if we take action it is not taken swiftly enough. The responsibility to protect was supposed to make things a little easier, but the world still sits back far too often when conflicts arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/6">I have listed the various parts of the world mentioned today where conflict is likely or could occur, and it is a long list. There are all the countries in the middle east, and Yemen has come very much to our attention. There are the ongoing problems in Cyprus and the Balkans. There is the Caucasus; and there are a range of issues in Africa, south America and Asia. Such a list brings home the scale of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/7">Resourcing is important. My hon. Friend asked a good range of questions, and I look forward to the Minister's response. There is genuine concern about the cuts that have been made to the United Kingdom's civilian contribution to peacekeeping, and about the recent scaling back of this year's Foreign and Commonwealth Office budget-for example, for counter-terrorism in Pakistan-as a result of the change in the exchange rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/8">The FCO is facing budgetary difficulties because of the Treasury ruling that when the exchange rate changes the FCO has to find the funds from within its budget. That difficulty, of course, is caused by the strength of the pound. It will be interesting to hear the Minister's response on such matters. It seems sensible to spend in order to prevent future conflict and future expense on that front. Even in a recession, we should not make such cuts. It would be a false economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/9">Peacebuilding is usually seen as an aspect of bringing conflict to an end. However, getting it right is essential to prevent conflict from starting up again. We have seen intervention in far too many places, with sticking-plaster solutions, where once the resources are removed the conflict revives because the underlying issues have not been resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/10">One cannot overestimate the importance of taking a proactive stance on building peace rather than taking the UN's traditional peacekeeping role. It is about involving not only regional partners in the country or area in question but stakeholders within communities. In that way, a peace can be built that reflects the needs of local people-not, dare I say it, an idea from many thousands of miles away of how it should be done. The UN recognised that when it set up the peacebuilding commission in 2005. With fellow MPs, I was fortunate to meet representatives of the commission on a visit to the UN sponsored by the FCO in 2008. We look forward to the UN review of the commission's work so that we can learn what is successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/11">My hon. Friend also mentioned the role of women, particularly in communities. It is most important when building structures for peace. Last year, the UN passed Security Council resolution 1889, which reaffirmed the principles laid out almost a decade ago in Security Council resolution 1325. Among other things, it recognised the important role that women need to play in conflict prevention. Despite making up more than half of the world's population, women are often absent from negotiating tables and decision-making circles.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/12">I recommend Gender Action for Peace and Security, a network of NGOs. It recently produced a short parliamentarian's guide to women, peace and security, which is most instructive. One statistic sticks out for me. Over the past 25 years, only one in 40 peace agreement signatories have been women. That shows their lack of involvement at that crucial stage, which I believe has an impact on whether conflicts recur. The UK is one of only 14 countries with a national action plan for implementing Security Council resolution 1325. I am glad about that. The plan is under review, and it will be released next month.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/13">It is important that we take matters forward. In October, someone from the FCO told the all-party group on women, peace and security that the Department was finding it difficult to involve women in senior positions in conflict prevention resolution, including in the UK. I would welcome it if the Minister were to update us on progress on that front.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/14">Finally, I touch on the question of climate change-again, something mentioned by various Members. We need to look ahead to the likely drivers of future conflicts. They will include access to energy, to water and to land that can be used for crop production. The changes likely to happen to all aspects as a result of climate change make it a priority to consider them in connection with conflict prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/15">The Oxford Research Group report &quot;Sustainable Security for the 21st Century&quot; states:</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/16" class="indent">&quot;This has long-term security implications for all countries which are far more serious, lasting and destructive than those of international terrorism.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/17">That puts the scale of the threat in stark terms. It should go hand in glove with the Government's policies on assisting with adaptation to climate change and preventing further dangerous climate change through mitigation. I hope that the FCO is working closely with the Department of Energy and Climate Change on those issues; I know that climate change is another of the Department's strategic priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.229.0/18">In conclusion, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss such important issues. I welcome the constructive spirit of the debate, and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.231.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" speakername="David Lidington" colnum="231"  time="012:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0007.htm#10020969000524">
	<p pid="a.231.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> on securing this debate, and welcome the &quot;tripartisan&quot; approach that he took in his opening remarks. My party supports the idea of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development, the Ministry of Defence and other Government Departments working closely together to plan conflict prevention activity in the national interests of the United Kingdom. However, we need to go further and institutionalise such practice by creating a national security council at which common strategies can be agreed to which all Departments are firmly signed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/2">However, it is difficult to define where conflict prevention starts and ends. It is inherently difficult to measure, partly because we are dealing, in most cases, with policies that aim at change over the long term-going beyond any one budgetary or electoral cycle-and partly because we can never be confident about what would have happened had we not taken particular action in another part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/3">It is important to remind ourselves that if conflict prevention is to be effective, it has to rely on other aspects of the Foreign Office's work being of high quality. Public diplomacy is one obvious example. Work through public diplomacy, including the work of the BBC World Service and the British Council, seems to be essential if we are to make contact not just with Governments and bureaucracies, but with wider civil societies. Moreover, we should not neglect that old mainstay of the FCO, the nurturing of diplomatic relationships over many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/4">I know that the Minister has recently returned from a visit to Yemen. There is agreement across the House that any successful work to prevent the conflict in that country from getting worse will depend on not what this country does but the extent to which effective action within the region, particularly by the Gulf Co-operation Council countries, can be co-ordinated. If we are to persuade our old friends in the Gulf that that should be a priority and that they should work with us to stabilise the situation in Yemen, we need to be able to act on the basis of friendships that have been nurtured over many years. We cannot expect to snap our fingers and see an instant response.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/5">I could use the same argument in respect of other parts of the world. Just to avoid any misunderstanding, I have recently been to Tokyo as a guest of the Japanese Government, and it became very clear to me that Japan's influence in many of the Asian countries where there is conflict, and its ability to exercise economic influence and to be a major provider of development assistance is something to which we should have great regard in our diplomatic policy, but that means we must spend time, energy and effort on nurturing and improving our relationship with Japan.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/6">I want to put three points to the Minister, to which I hope he will find time to respond. First, for effective conflict prevention we often have to work through international organisations. It is also clear from what the Foreign Office itself has published in its annual reports that those international organisations do not always deliver in the way that we might hope. For example, the United Nations is obviously a key institution, but the Foreign Office annual report for 2007-08 stated that too often UN peacekeeping missions are not adequately planned. The report cited the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur as an example of that. Do the Government think that there has been some improvement in the UN's performance in that regard or do they think that we still have difficulties there?</p>
	<p pid="a.231.0/7">Secondly, in addressing some of the challenges of conflict prevention around the world, have the Government considered trying to make greater use of the Commonwealth as an institution? The Commonwealth has an advantage in that it has a very diverse membership across continents and that its countries, while all committed to ideas of democracy, of human rights and of the rule of law, have many different ethnicities and religious traditions. As such, it seems to me that it has a part to play.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.0/1">I strongly associate myself with what the hon. Gentleman says. May I remind him of what the Queen said after the last Commonwealth conference about the relevance of the Commonwealth to the climate change agenda? Will he join me in making a request to Government-I have made it before and sometimes they have responded-to hold an annual debate on the Commonwealth in the main Chamber, which we have not had in the last year or so?</p>

	<p pid="a.232.1/1">That would be a very good way of enabling the House not only to assess the Commonwealth as an institution but to review relationships between the United Kingdom and individual Commonwealth countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/2">May I say a few words about regional bodies, because again they will be of great importance in conflict prevention work? In particular, I want to ask the Minister about Africa. Turning again to the FCO annual report for 2007-08, the Foreign Office says that in that year it invested</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/3" class="indent">&quot;&#163;1.5 million from the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool in building the conflict prevention and peacekeeping capacity of the African Union.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/4">Yet on page 154 of the same report it said that progress on the African Union Standby Force</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/5" class="indent">&quot;remains limited by weak capacity at the AU and in African regions.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/6">The capacity of the African Union is clearly of great importance given the points that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> made about the situation in the Sudan and the tensions that may well arise around the forthcoming referendum on the possible secession of the south. It would be helpful if the Minister could give us an update on the Government's assessment of the capacity of the African Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/7">Finally, I want to ask the Minister about the budget. In his written statement on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-25">25 March 2009</phrase>, the Foreign Secretary announced an increase in the budget for preventing and resolving conflict. However, he qualified that announcement by saying that in part it was driven by the declining value of the pound and the necessity to add to the budget in sterling terms to ensure that it continued to buy the same value in programmes. Of that budget of &#163;627 million, &#163;456 million was said to be ring-fenced for assisted peacekeeping, leaving &#163;171 million to fund all discretionary peacekeeping, conflict prevention and stabilisation work.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/8">We know from various press reports and leaked documents over the past few months that the Foreign Office is having to look very hard at its budget in the light of exchange rate movements. We know that the FCO was trampled on by the Treasury when the risk deriving from exchange rate movements was transferred from the Treasury to the FCO a couple of years ago. We also know that the permanent secretary at the FCO has written to heads of mission and FCO directors to ask them to draw up contingency plans for possible significant further cuts during this calendar year. So I would like the Minister to tell us whether the conflict prevention programmes that the Government have planned for are likely to be reined back or cut significantly as a result of those undoubtedly severe financial pressures.</p>

	<p pid="a.233.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> on securing the debate, on his very thoughtful contribution, and on his long-standing work on conflict issues. I also want to pay tribute to the all-party group on conflict issues for quite rightly raising the profile of conflict issues in Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/2">I am certainly willing to take the idea of an annual debate on conflict prevention to relevant colleagues and ask them to give it serious consideration. I shall also say at the outset that I do not think that I will have enough time to do justice to all the contributions that have been made to the debate. Therefore, I want to offer to attend a meeting of the all-party group on conflict issues so that we have the opportunity for a more in-depth and serious discussion. However, I will do my best to try to answer some of the questions that have been put.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/3">I do not think that hon. Members will be surprised to hear that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, who made a thoughtful contribution to the debate, has not been delegated responsibility for writing our party's manifesto for the forthcoming election. However, if he wants to appoint me to the position of &quot;Minister for Peace&quot;, I think that that would be a really exciting opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/4">I want to make the serious point that the all-party and consensual nature of the debate has been very healthy and positive. However, there was one discordant note. I say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">the hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> that any party that is unable to get above 40 per cent. of the vote at this stage of the electoral cycle should not be so sure of assuming power at any general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/5">I will move on to the issues that have been raised in the debate. I want to deal with why conflict prevention matters and how we are responding to conflict issues, as well as trying to respond to some of the points that have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/6">Why does conflict prevention matter so much? Every day, the terrible effects of armed conflict are felt by ordinary people around the world. Although human beings who are killed, wounded or have to flee for their lives might be the most visible and emotive consequences of conflict, the effects of conflict go far wider and deeper. Conflicts devastate economies, promote instability, impede development, promote illegal migration, contravene human rights and frequently fuel terrorism. Conflict prevention is therefore of direct relevance to our national interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/7">As well as the moral imperative of reducing the suffering caused by conflict, concerted action to prevent and resolve conflict is essential to allow the benefits of economic prosperity to spread, to allow democracy and good governance to take root and flourish, and to allow the rule of law to be established and promoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/8">Conflict prevention is at the heart of what we regard as an integrated cross-government approach. Joint policy making and programmes have enabled us to strengthen our civilian capabilities, including on the ground, and we are working with international partners and organisations to deliver earlier and more effective international responses to crises and conflicts.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/9">In a difficult and challenging fiscal environment, we have had no option but to prioritise activities. We have preserved funding for a range of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building activities, but it is right to focus our efforts where the risk and impact of conflict is greatest and where our activities add most value.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/10">Defence and military spending supports defence diplomacy and security co-operation, which make a significant contribution to conflict prevention and peace-building. Whitehall Departments are identifying options for further investment in those activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/11">Following the Prime Minister's announcement in March 2008 that we would create a pool of 1,000 trained UK civilians who would be readily deployable overseas, we are today-very appropriately-launching the new civilian stabilisation group at the Royal Geographical Society. We will continue to deploy the right people to the right place at the right time to help to rebuild countries recovering from conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/12">There are a number of ways in which we seek to prevent conflict. We do so through the conflict pool, which several hon. Members mentioned, and through working with international institutions such as the United Nations, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> asked about. In response to his question, we think that the UN is getting better, but there is a long, long way to go. Regarding the Commonwealth, which he also mentioned, we work alongside Commonwealth countries when it is appropriate to do so. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman when he says that we should consider whether there is more that can be done regarding the Commonwealth. I also agree entirely that, with regard to conflict in Africa, the long-term sustainable peace that we seek in Africa depends on building institutions within that continent, so strengthening the capacity of the African Union in the future will be crucially important.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1796" name="John Greenway">The hon. Member for Ryedale (Mr. Greenway)</phrase>, during his very thoughtful and well-informed speech, raised the issue of improved or early warning, which is another important issue-arguably the most important issue-in conflict prevention. We need to intervene as early as we can and we require the capacity to make such assessments. There is also a responsibility to protect, to build capacity and to ensure that we, as the United Kingdom, have adequate capability in the area of conflict prevention, so there is a range of ways in which we seek to respond to this challenging agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/14">I now want to turn specifically to the points that have been made by hon. Members during the debate. First, the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey raised a number of issues related to resources. I will try to address some of them, but if I do not address them all, I will write to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/15">It is true that we set aside increased resources for conflict activity in 2009-10, which is a significant symbol of how much importance we attach to this issue. However, it is also true that we are faced with competing demands. We do not have the resources to fund everything that we would like to fund. A projected rise in the UK's assessed contributions-they are obligatory contributions-to international peacekeeping missions means that we must rigorously prioritise our discretionary budgets. We have an international legal obligation to pay our bills for international peacekeeping. Unfortunately, that means that there is sometimes less money available to pay for other important activity. As for 2010-11, we are continuing to assess the amount of resources that we will have available, and I assure hon. Members that we will make an announcement to Parliament in due course on that specific issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/16">Several hon. Members raised the link between conflict and development. A very important step forward in the 2009 cross-government White Paper &quot;Building our Common Future&quot;, which was led by the Department for International Development, is that it recognises the importance of peace-building and state-building in countries affected by conflict and instability. I think that the tangible important change in that White Paper is that it commits to spending at least 50 per cent. of new bilateral country spending in those states that are identified as &quot;fragile&quot;. That is a very important recognition of where we increasingly need to shift our resources to.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/17">The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey also raised the issue of effectiveness, asking how effective our efforts in preventing violent conflict are and how we measure their effectiveness. It is not easy to measure their effectiveness. As several hon. Members have said, conflict prevention is a long-term and major challenge-there are no quick fixes. However, we review progress against delivery on public service agreement 30 targets on a six-monthly basis, using both statistical data and qualitative reporting from posts. We therefore attempt to assess impact and effectiveness, and I can provide hon. Members with further information on that issue in writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/18">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> will know that I have visited eastern Congo on two occasions. He is absolutely right about the importance of MONUC and ensuring that we get its mandate renewed. However, it is also important that we ensure that MONUC, working with FRDC and others, is as effective as it needs to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/19">I think that it was my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> who made the point that in situations such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the role of development is very important. There has to be a peace dividend alongside security solutions, and where there has been conflict for a long time, people have to see economic and social progress as quickly as possible, after moving in with a civilian response. That is absolutely crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/20">Several hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>, raised the issue of women in conflict prevention. I have two things to say about that. First, in those countries that come out of conflict, it is often women who play the most important role. They do not sign the peace treaties, but it is often women, both in local communities and at a national level, who are the biggest and most powerful advocates for peace. However, it is also women who are often the greatest victims of the dreadful violence that occurs in places such as eastern Congo, so the role of women must be central, not an add-on or marginal issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.233.0/21">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud also raised the important issue of our diplomats and the tremendous contribution that they make. In short, we need to bring together security with governance and development, if we are to tackle these issues effectively.</p>

	Seagulls (Gloucester)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.237.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" speakername="Parmjit Dhanda" colnum="237"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0008.htm#10020969000528">
	<p pid="a.237.1/1">I hope that this debate will be enlightening for you, Mr. Amess. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> highlighted in a similar Adjournment debate last year, there is far more to the issue than meets the eye. I hope that people will realise the importance of this debate; I have had a couple of days' leg-pulling about it. A few colleagues have asked, &quot;Is that really the title of your Adjournment debate?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/2">Some years ago, former Manchester United footballer Eric Cantona said:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/3" class="indent">&quot;When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/4">Perhaps Eric Cantona had a better understanding of seagulls and their behaviour than the rest of us, including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and our local authorities. As any aficionado of debates on this subject will know from the remarks of the hon. Member for Bath last year, the problem is a serious and growing one for many of our town centres and, increasingly, for our suburban communities, for reasons that I will flesh out with evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/5">Good research has been done locally by Julie Wight and Gill Ragon of Gloucester city council, to whom I pay tribute for their help and support in pulling information together. Health and safety and aggression were two issues discussed by the hon. Member for Bath during his debate. Both are pertinent when we consider the effect of seagulls on businesses in Gloucester city centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/6">Gloucester has about 2,800 breeding pairs of seagulls. Urban seagulls did not really exist before the second world war. Landfill has made a difference, as has the birds' desire to find somewhere warmer, and cities and towns are 3&#176; to 6&#176; C warmer than their natural rural habitats. They are also light in the evenings, giving birds the opportunity to feed and scavenge at night-time.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/7">In our city centre, as well as in Bath, Bristol, Cardiff and Aberdeenshire, urban seagulls' behaviour is becoming far more aggressive. To cite one example from the <i>Daily Mirror:</i></p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/8" class="indent">&quot;A terrified woman in Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire was left drenched in blood after a seagull protecting its young dive-bombed her. Jean Wemyss, 68, had to have a one-inch gash in her head glued after the attack. 'It felt like someone had hit me with a rock.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/9">Seagulls have a 41/2-foot wingspan when fully grown, weigh 2 lb and can reach speeds of 40 mph when they dive-bomb. They are a threat, and they are becoming braver and bolder in their activities. As seagulls' numbers grow, many cities throughout the country are having the same problems as Gloucester. Bird droppings on the pavements of our city centres cause hazards and cleaning costs, and mess on tables has hygiene consequences for bars, restaurants and outdoor dining. Scavenging is also a problem. Birds regularly tear up bags, open bins and make a mess and run away with food when they can find it. Sometimes they actually take food from plates. Aggressive behaviour is also a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/10">We believe that Gloucester has two colonies of seagulls. One is centred on Hempstead tip, close to the city centre, although those in the know at the local authority believe that in addition to those, a lot of other seagulls are migrating to the city centre. We are also struggling with another flock of seagulls in an area adjacent to the Bristol road, a more suburban location. A number of businesses have been in touch with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/11">I went down to the area some months ago with a sense of incredulity, not knowing more than anybody else what to make of it. I visited the Cotswold Motor Group, which sells BMWs and Minis, to see the impact of seagulls on that business and surrounding businesses. It costs the Cotswold Motor Group &#163;500 to re-spray a car. The seagulls in that area, particularly when they are roosting or have young, attack vehicles as they come into the forecourt.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/12">I never knew until I had a biology lesson down at the Cotswold Motor Group that seagull droppings become more acidic as seagulls grow more upset. Droppings on cars must be removed within a couple of hours or they can erode paintwork, which costs a lot of money. The owners of the garage have considered moving elsewhere to get away from the seagulls, as they must employ people to wash their cars every day. Keeping the premises clean has an impact on them and surrounding businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/13">Why have thousands of seagulls flocked to the area? Having been on the roof of that business's premises and looked down on the other buildings in the estate, I can only imagine that the old-fashioned stone-clad buildings resemble seagulls' natural habitat of cliffs. Perhaps that is part of the reason why they are living in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/14">We need more research to understand why the seagulls are coming to the area. The expert Peter Rock has been in touch with a number of MPs and local authorities about the issue. He tells us that there are about 130,000 to 150,000 breeding pairs of seagulls in this country in urban and, increasingly, suburban areas. That could increase to more than 1 million over the next 10 years. It could have a massive impact on local businesses as well as residents in terms of mess, droppings and the shrill noise that the birds make.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/15">What should we do about it? First, we must do more research, which needs a little investment by the Department. I will encourage my hon. Friend, who is a good listening Minister, to tackle his officials, who I know had a good meeting a couple of months ago to discuss the issue with the Government office for the south-west, DEFRA, the Environment Agency, Natural England and some local authorities. However, from my feedback at that meeting, it seems that they never got beyond the subject of research.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/16">Several universities, including the university of western England and Bristol university, are interested in conducting research on the subject. A few tens of thousands of pounds' investment would help us understand better the birds' habitats, why they come to urban areas and what methods work to tackle the nuisance. I am not proposing a cull or asking my hon. Friend to find money for local authorities to do clean-up work. In my area, the officials that I mentioned have been involved in about &#163;7,000 to &#163;8,000 of work every year-the problem is growing, so they probably need more-but if they knew exactly what would work in the first place, thanks to a little research, they could save money and help business.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/17">What solutions have been mooted? There are a range of them, and it has been an education hearing about some. The traditional method of bird-scaring is falconry, but I understand that most veteran seagulls these days are not intimidated by falcons, not seeing them as genuine birds of prey that will kill or attack them. Falconry has had a limited effect. Even where it has worked, it has merely moved the problem from one urban area or suburb to another. There has been some success with using loudspeakers to imitate distress calls to encourage the birds to move on. However, that solution simply moves the problem to another area.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/18">Egg removal and egg oiling have been tried. Egg oiling has had some success in Gloucester city where 1,100 eggs were oiled last year so that the chicks did not hatch and become fully grown seagulls. Despite that work, the number of seagulls has grown massively year on year. Caging and proofing have been tried. Proofing work includes putting up nets and spikes. The pedestrianised area in Gloucester city centre is awash with nets and spikes above shops, which is rather unsightly. The measure has been tried for a number of years, but we still have the recurring problem. More exotic solutions have been tried such as helium balloons and plastic owls. You will be sorry to hear, Mr Amess, that the plastic owls have made no difference whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/19">Hundreds of thousands, if not millions of pounds must have been spent across the country. From Gloucester and the Minister's constituency down the road, to Aberdeenshire, this is a growing national problem. As I mentioned, Peter Rock's figures suggest that there could be 1 million urban and suburban seagulls within a decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/20">If the solutions I have mentioned are not the right ones, what are? The officials at Gloucester city council tell me that research could aid and assist them. One imaginative solution being pressed at the moment is laser torches being flashed at seagulls when they are roosting. That stops them from settling on the eggs so that the eggs go cold and the next generation of seagulls does not hatch. Before we invest in that, we need to know whether it is likely to work. That goes back to the important point of funding a little research.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/21">The council tells me, and I am sure it is right, that partly because of the availability of food and partly because of night-time light and temperatures, urban gulls produce about three eggs a year, whereas in the wild gulls produce just one egg every three years. That is a stark difference. We need to understand the nature of the problem better.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/22">What seems on the surface to be a rather jokey and amusing subject for an Adjournment debate impacts on the lives of a lot of residents in my constituency, on local authorities and their funds, and on local businesses. I do not want Cotswold Motor Group or other businesses in the suburbs and town centres to move away. At the same time, I am an animal lover and am not calling for culls. We must know what we can do to restrict the size of these populations and ensure that the behaviour of gulls is not as aggressive as it has become.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/23">As I said at the outset, Eric Cantona said:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/24" class="indent">&quot;When the seagulls follow the trawler, it is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/25">I do not know whether that is true and I suspect that the Minister does not know either. Perhaps he could commit to a little investment in the matter. He may not be able to make the commitment today, but I hope he will have a good conversation with his officials. I have had encouraging conversations about the meeting between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Government office for the south-west that happened a couple of months ago, but there is a feeling that they need to go further. We must invest in the kind of research that will make a difference for the long term.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1595" name="Parmjit Dhanda">the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda)</phrase> on securing this debate. As Minister with responsibility for rural affairs, I welcome this opportunity to discuss the impact of urban gull populations on business. This is not a joke, but a serious issue. The impacts that he describes exist and they can be distressing and concerning for those who are affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/2">I recognise that gulls can be problematic when found in high density in urban areas, such as in Gloucester, Bristol, Bath, Taunton and Cardiff. This is a widespread problem. I also recognise that measures need to be taken to mitigate such problems in an appropriate and proportionate manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.0/3">We must have regard to the conservation status of gulls because some species are protected. It is interesting that despite the appearance that gulls are thriving in urban areas, UK breeding populations of herring gulls have declined by 69 per cent. since 1969 and winter populations have declined by more than 50 per cent. in the past 25 years. As a result, the herring gull is listed as a biodiversity action plan priority species and in the latest British Trust for Ornithology report, it meets the qualifying criteria for red listing as a bird of conservation concern. The great black-backed gull is a scarce breeding species in England with a breeding population of fewer than 1,500 pairs. With wintering populations declining, it meets the qualifying criteria for amber listing as a bird of conservation concern. Although I understand my hon. Friend's point, there is a decline in some gull species.</p>

	<p pid="a.240.1/1">I appreciate the Minister's statistics and am sure that they are well sourced. I had a conversation just this morning with the hon. Member for Bath, who fears that some of the statistics being used by officials in the Department relate more to the rural gull population and are out of kilter with the experience of local authorities. Perhaps it would be possible to look again at this matter. We could send the Minister information in writing so that his officials can take a closer look at whether the statistics are accurate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.240.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1904" speakername="Dan Norris" colnum="240"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0009.htm#10020969000531">
	<p pid="a.240.2/1">I would be happy to receive anything my hon. Friend wishes to send. I spoke to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase> briefly yesterday to say that this debate was taking place and receive his input. Unfortunately, he cannot be here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/2">As a member state of the European Union, the UK has an obligation to conserve wild bird populations. As my hon. Friend will be aware, that is fulfilled through the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which protects all wild birds. However, as I said, I recognise his concerns about gulls in Gloucester in the Bristol road area and the city centre. In specific circumstances, the 1981 Act allows people to apply for a licence from Natural England to take action to control bird species where they cause difficulties and there are no other satisfactory solutions. Action may be taken if Natural England grants a licence for purposes such as preventing the spread of disease, preserving air safety, which my hon. Friend mentioned, conserving wild birds and preserving public health and safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/3">A build-up of gull populations to problem levels is usually the result of the presence of readily accessible food and the availability of suitable habitats for roosting or breeding. Those are the two key components. There is often food in excess of what gulls would find in the wild and places for them to live. Although licensed control of bird populations can provide temporary relief, efforts must be maintained to remove the food and the access to the habitat that attracts them.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/4">Access to food is the single most important factor in boosting gull populations. If it can be denied, the problem may be resolved without recourse to other measures. I urge all local authorities and businesses to help address this problem by avoiding the spillage of foodstuffs, keeping food storage areas secure and bird proof-that is easily said, but it is what needs to be done-making sure that disposal and waste facilities are kept clean and tidy, and limiting or preventing the deliberate feeding of birds by the public, which still takes place in many areas. I have heard that local authorities in Devon and Cornwall, for example, have had good results by using hessian sacks for rubbish disposal, which deters gulls from accessing the food. Obviously, gulls can peck through plastic bags more easily than hessian ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/5">Natural England can provide advice on other deterrents, such as proofing buildings-my hon. Friend referred to that in Gloucester-and installing netting or metal spikes on buildings to discourage roosting and nesting. Although I accept that such measures are not the whole answer, they are a significant part of the solution. It is only by eliminating the things that gulls find so attractive in our towns and cities that we can hope to find a longer-term solution. The reality is that gulls live for a long time-many can live as long as 20 years-and they are not unintelligent animals, so they learn and modify their behaviour when we put up plastic owls or whatever it might be. Gulls are able to realise what is genuinely a threat to their way of life and what they can ignore.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/6">In addition to controlling the availability of food and preventing roosting, I understand that licensed control methods have been effective. I completely share my hon. Friend's concern for animal welfare. We are not advocating something that is cruel and unkind, but there may be situations in which, as a last resort, it might be necessary to take other lines of action. I stress that the licensed control system should be considered only if earlier attempts to manage problems have been shown to be ineffective.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/7">General licences that are used for activities that carry a low risk for the conservation or welfare of the protected species can be issued. Personal licences may also be issued for certain other controlled activities. The licensing authority-Natural England-must make sure that the licences it issues are appropriate and take account of</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/8">the risk of the activities licensed and the conservation status of the species concerned. For that reason, in January this year, following consultation, Natural England amended the relevant general licences and removed the herring gull from almost all general licences. However, it has continued to allow the destruction of nests and eggs of herring gulls to preserve public health and safety. Lesser black-backed gulls may still be controlled for a number of reasons, including to prevent serious damage to livestock and crops and the spread of disease, or for air safety reasons. That reflects the need to mitigate the problems that the herring and lesser black-backed gulls can cause in certain situations and to provide a licensing regime that is not overly burdensome.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/9">For great black-backed gulls, a general licence is now available only for the purpose of preserving air safety. I stress that, although there has been a reduction in the available general licences, it is still none the less possible to apply for an individual licence to control those species where they are causing problems. Natural England has struck a sensible and proportionate balance between protecting species and recognising the issues that can arise in areas where species may be over-abundant.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/10">However, occasionally it is clear that licensed controls will be necessary. For example, in the breeding season from April to August, removing eggs under licence and replacing them with dummy eggs can reduce urban gull populations if deployed over the longer term and, in the short term, that can reduce the likelihood of attacks from aggressive gulls. My hon. Friend rightly highlighted that in his opening remarks. Those methods have had some success in urban areas, including, I believe, in Gloucester.</p>
	<p pid="a.240.2/11">As my hon. Friend mentioned, my officials in DEFRA's Bristol office recently met officials from local authorities in the south-west, including Gloucester, to discuss the issue. Natural England also attended that meeting. I hope that experiences can continue to be shared and best practice developed to address the problems sometimes caused by urban gulls. If there are lessons to be learned-no doubt there will be some-about alternative techniques that are successful, I encourage local authorities to share that information between them. However, we must not rely on a licensing approach to control gull populations that will provide only a temporary solution to the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.0/1">My hon. Friend is being assiduous and thorough in his response. I would like to probe him on the issue of the academic research that might help us to ensure we get the best bang for our buck in terms of the investment that local authorities make. Will he consider having further discussions with his officials about looking into academic research? The other key area relates to where local authorities can come together. A forum is up and running, but what other support can the Government provide to ensure that it is a success?</p>

	<p pid="a.242.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. I can certainly say to him that, in general terms, we do not feel that additional research is necessary. We feel that we know quite a lot about the subject. That is certainly sufficient to highlight the two key areas that I pointed out in my earlier remarks: excess food being available to gulls, and places to live, roost and so on. However, his point about laser torches is interesting. I will talk to my officials about that, because it is something I would like to explore further. Any information that he can provide about that would be useful. The only obvious hazard with laser torches is that they may affect aircraft. He will be aware that there have been well-documented cases of people deliberately trying to distract pilots using powerful laser instruments. That matter needs proper consideration and I thank him for raising it with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.1/2">As I was saying, lessons need to be learned about alternative techniques and we need to encourage local authorities to share best practice when they find it works in their areas. The issue requires local authorities to work collaboratively and over a sustained period. That can be helped greatly by limiting the sources of food and making adjustments to buildings, so that gulls do not find such a warm welcome in cities such as Gloucester, as well as other cities and areas across the country. I thank my hon. Friend for initiating this important debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.0/1">My hon. Friend, his officials and I may differ in that although I understand what he is saying and it is common sense to suggest that the gulls will gravitate to areas where food is available, that confuses the matter with regards to the Cotswold Motor Group and the industrial estates around there. Those are not the best places for gulls to gravitate to for food, yet they have done so, which implies that we need to understand more about their behaviour if we are going to be able to do more to help those local businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.1/1">I hear clearly what my hon. Friend says, but my officials feel that we have a lot of information about the nature of gull behaviour. We still keep coming back to the factors of food source and places to roost. I do not know enough about the particular instance he cited to say whether that is applicable. If he could drop me a note, I will certainly look at the matter and talk to my officials. I will also ask them to consider the laser torch idea that he proposes, because that sounds as if it has some merit and should be given due consideration.</p>

	Alcohol Fraud

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.244.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="244"  time="012:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0009.htm#10020969000536">
	<p pid="a.244.1/1">It is a pleasure to be able to speak under your chairmanship once again, Mr. Amess. I would like to thank Mr. Speaker for granting me the debate, and the Federation of Wholesale Distributors for supplying me with much of the background to the growing problem of alcohol fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/2">In recent years, supermarkets have been rightly castigated for selling cheap alcohol at below cost price. The impact on public health of people buying excessive amounts of cheap alcohol is well documented. However, what is more pernicious is the growing problem of local shops and off-licences selling cheap alcohol, which is made possible because duty has not been paid on it. There is growing evidence of the impact that that is having on the ability of under-age drinkers to access alcohol, including in my constituency of Rochdale.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/3">In reply to a written question that I tabled, the Minister admitted:</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/4" class="indent">&quot;For 2006-07 estimated losses from beer give a range of between &#163;270 million and &#163;490 million in respect of duty and &#163;120 million to &#163;220 million in respect of VAT. This corresponds to a market share&quot;-</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/5">for beer-</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/6" class="indent">&quot;of between 7 and 12 per cent.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-02-02.214"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 February 2010; Vol. 505, c. 214W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/7">If the losses for spirits are included, which the Exchequer estimates at between 5 and 6 per cent., a conservative estimate of the total loss to the Exchequer is more than &#163;1 billion a year. No estimate has been provided by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs for losses of duty and VAT on the sale of wine, but I am sure that they, too, are likely to run into millions of pounds. Given the state of the public finances, the Government can ill afford such revenue losses. There is also grave concern about the likely link between those involved in alcohol fraud and serious and organised crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/8">Alcohol fraud is being carried out in several ways, and it is a significant problem at the wholesale point in the supply chain. Alcohol, after manufacture, is sold either direct to retainers, or via wholesalers for onward sale to retail outlets. The majority of wholesalers are legitimate traders who pay taxes and dues correctly. However, a growing number of fraudulent wholesalers are adopting methods to avoid paying the duty and VAT that is due. Those illicit traders are then able to sell cut-price alcohol, or to sell it at full price and reap greater profits.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/9">The methods used by the fraudsters include claiming back duty-it is known as drawback-direct from the UK Government. They are doing that by claiming that the duty has been paid in another country, where no duty has been paid, and then diverting the products within the UK market, or alternatively by exporting the goods abroad-to France or the near continent, for example, where a much lower rate of duty is paid-with the goods then immediately diverted to the UK without the payment of the higher UK duty.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/10">Some of the results of that fraud can be seen in the prices at local off-licences. Indeed, the FWD has estimated that up to 40 per cent. of beer sales through such outlets are illicit. It has identified several wholesalers that appear to be openly selling alcohol at prices far below those that federation members can match. Those include wholesalers in my constituency, Bradford, Manchester and Walsall, and several other companies that trade on the internet. I do not know whether those companies are selling illicit alcohol, but I will give the list to the Minister after the debate and I hope that she will agree to investigate them as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/11">I shall give some examples of the wholesale prices at which those companies are selling alcohol, as they are prices that no one can match. Cases of Tenants Super are being sold for &#163;22.99, while the best price an FWD member can offer is &#163;28.25, with a duty payable is &#163;17.79. Cases of Carlsberg Special Brew are being sold at &#163;18.49, while the FWD member price is &#163;26.80 and the duty is &#163;17.79. Kestrel Super is being sold for &#163;19.99, while the FWD member price is &#163;27.50 and the duty is &#163;17.79. There is a similar situation for wine: Jacob's Creek is being sold at &#163;1.40, which is cheaper than the best FWD member price, and Gallo sauvignon blanc is being sold at &#163;2.90 below the best FWD member price. Those are matters of concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/12">Despite evidence of growing alcohol fraud, the Attorney-General has admitted that only seven people were prosecuted in 2008 for crimes relating to alcohol fraud and that the number of prosecutions has fallen by almost 50 per cent. since 2006. I ask the Minister to provide further information to explain why there has been that fall in prosecutions at the same time as fraud has been increasing.</p>

	<p pid="a.245.0/1">I declare an interest as chairman of the all-party wine and spirit group.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.0/2">The issue of fraud is extremely important, and I urge the Minister to look at what greater efforts HMRC can make with regard to personnel and having the correct people to prosecute some of the very unpleasant individuals involved in that trade. Not only is the Exchequer losing more than &#163;1 billion a year, but the trade has a knock-on effect that distorts the market. The supermarkets have to compete below cost, which in turn has a knock-on effect on the Government's alcohol strategy, because the products are being sold below market price. I wholeheartedly endorse what the hon. Gentleman is saying and urge HMRC to make a stronger effort to recover that money.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.245.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="245"  time="012:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0009.htm#10020969000538">
	<p pid="a.245.1/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman's intervention. To return to my previous point, are those figures for prosecutions a result of a reduction in action by HMRC, or of a reduction in the resources that the Government are targeting in that area?</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/2">Last April, at the time of the Chancellor's Budget, the Government published their alcohol fraud strategy, which set out several measures designed to tackle fraud involving alcohol duty. I welcome the publication of that strategy and its implementation. However, according to the FWD, the impact of the strategy has been limited. Although figures for assessing the scale of alcohol fraud for beer and spirits have been provided, no figures have yet been given for wine. Is the Minister proposing that a similar estimate will be provided-I appreciate that that is more difficult-to set out the likely scale of fraudulent wine sales?</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/3">Given the estimated scale of alcohol fraud, its effects on legitimate business, to which I referred earlier, and the effects of cheap alcohol on health, what estimate has the Minister made of the effectiveness of that strategy? Have HMRC and the UK Border Agency been set targets for alcohol fraud reductions and, if so, will she enlighten us on those targets? Given that I have mentioned those companies that are causing concern, I would welcome her assurance that swift action will be taken throughout the supply chain when fraud is reported. I am aware that she has not met representatives of the FWD, although she has met representatives of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. Will she therefore agree to meet representatives of the FWD to discuss their concerns?</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/4">Will the Minister provide an update of the preventative measures that have been put in place as a longer-term solution to limit such fraud? For example, what processes does HMRC have in place, and are they being developed, to track the movement of alcohol to ensure that goods are sold through legitimate channels with the duty paid?</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/5">According to HMRC, there is a massive over-supply of beer under duty suspense being sent to the near continent, and that cannot be for legitimate sale. Given that there are a limited number of product types of beer that are at risk, surely it ought to be possible for HMRC to keep tabs on where the brewers supply it in the EU, and to whom, and on all UK suppliers of duty-suspended goods to third parties in bonded warehouses.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/6">Have the Government considered limiting fraud by imposing robust controls on the export of some high-risk products? For example, there is strong evidence that large quantities of American wines are being exported to France, where there is evidently no market for them. Surely it would make sense for those exports to be at least temporarily banned while we see what effect that has on the sale of such illicit wine on the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/7">The Government are repaying fraudsters through the drawback regime. As I said, fraudsters either claim that the duty has been paid in another country, or say that the goods are going abroad but then divert them back. Will the Minister provide an update on the checks that are undertaken prior to the repayment of drawback, and a reassurance that appropriate and thorough checks are made, including checking that documentation has not been produced fraudulently?</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/8">In a response to a written question that I recently tabled, the Minister stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/9" class="indent">&quot;It is a condition of reimbursement of UK duty under the drawback provisions that the claimant must be able to demonstrate that the goods to which a drawback claim relates have been exported from the UK and that duty has been paid or secured to the satisfaction of the fiscal authority in the member state of destination.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2010-01-29.1144"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 January 2010; Vol. 504, c. 1144W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/10">It would be helpful if she could clarify what is meant by &quot;secured&quot;, since duty either has or has not been paid. What discussions is she having with EU member states to ensure that it has been paid?</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/11">The FWD has proposed a registration of wholesalers to ensure that only legitimate traders are able to supply alcohol. As wholesalers are the only unregulated part of the alcohol supply chain, I would be grateful if the Minister would give us her thoughts on what action the Government intend to take to adopt that measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/12">I accept that the issue is not just one for the UK and that European co-ordination is needed. Given the scale of the fraud and its resemblance to missing trader intra-Community fraud, it is important that EU-level co-ordination is secured. I understand that a new EU excise movement and control system is due to be introduced. It would be helpful if the Minister would give us an assessment of the impact that it will have and of when it will be introduced in the UK. More generally, is the UK working closely with EU counterparts to tackle the issue and share intelligence?</p>
	<p pid="a.245.1/13">This is an important issue, Mr. Amess. If you go into an off-licence in your constituency, it is highly likely, according to the FWD, that you will find that 40 per cent. of beer sold through such outlets is illicit and that duty has not been paid. The resolution of the problem is important to the public finances and to public health, so I look forward to the Minister's response to this serious issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing this debate. Alcohol fraud is a serious issue that affects public revenue but also, of course, the livelihoods of honest businesses. I listened with interest to his speech and to the intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/2">The alcohol industry is very important to the UK. It supports the employment of many thousands of people and makes a significant contribution to Government revenue; for example, it provided more than &#163;8 billion in alcohol duties to the Exchequer in 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/3">The Government take all fraud seriously, and we are committed to tackling alcohol fraud. We recognise the threat to revenues and to legitimate businesses that are trying to compete with fraudsters who evade payment of tax, and the wider threat to society from the organised criminal gangs who perpetrate the fraud. That is why the Chancellor announced at Budget 2009 that Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, together with the UK Border Agency, is renewing its strategy to address fraud involving beer, wine and spirits.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/4">Reports that the illicit trading of alcohol is impacting the livelihood of large and small businesses in the wholesale and retail sectors are of great concern. I am pleased to say that the comprehensive programme of work to develop a renewed strategy to tackle alcohol fraud is progressing well. The strategy has at its core the need to work in partnership with legitimate businesses in the alcohol industry, and I am glad that my officials continue to work constructively with UK producers and retailers of alcohol through the relevant trade associations to develop measures to tackle the fraud. The Government are keen that all legal measures to tackle alcohol fraud are considered fully, and we welcome the industry's input to this ongoing process.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/5">It may be helpful if I briefly say something about the nature of the threat before I go on to outline what the Government are doing to tackle it. Beer is the largest sector in consumption terms in the UK. Spirits remain significant with relatively static consumption, and wine consumption has increased by almost 50 per cent. in recent years. All three products are subject to fraud; there is limited evidence that cider is being targeted by fraudsters.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/6">The majority of illicit beer, wine and spirits is sold through licensed premises, with an on-off trade split of approximately 60:40 by value. The illicit market manifests itself mainly in the off trade. Fraudsters infiltrate supply chains, so some retailers are unaware that their stock is illicit, but others will be aware that they are sourcing product at a below duty-paid price, and are taking a significant risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/7">Alcohol fraud has evolved since the introduction of the single market in 1993. Initially, the fraud was carried out with alcoholic drinks being smuggled into the UK in relatively small quantities, typically in private vehicles or vans. However, the organised criminals behind the fraud are now operating a more systematic attack to exploit the EU-wide excise holding and movement system which allows goods to circulate duty unpaid until released for consumption in the home market. That predominantly involves large commercial consignments of goods in excise warehouses moving between the near continent and the UK under false documentation. Goods are diverted and released in the UK market without duty being paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/8">Three significant elements contribute to the scale of the current fraud. The first is the supply of UK-produced and, to a lesser extent, imported alcoholic drinks to the near continent in duty suspension, in excess of legitimate demand. This is similar to the situation seen in recent years with tobacco fraud. It serves to position goods so that they can be returned to the UK untaxed, thereby exploiting weaknesses in the EU movement system. For example, HMRC clearance figures show that some 600 million litres of beer was exported to the near continent last year, yet the legitimate demand for UK beer is considered to be in the range of 20 million to 150 million litres per annum. That is a key source of goods for organised criminals.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/9">Secondly, there is facilitation of the fraud by UK and EU-based alcohol traders, including large buyers of duty suspended goods, and registered excise warehouse keepers, and a multitude of UK and EU transporters are involved. Without the complicity of alcohol traders and hauliers, the current fraud could not exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/10">Thirdly, there is a strong demand for illicit, cheap alcohol from some in the UK wholesale and retail sectors. It allows them to compete with others in an aggressive sector and with large multiple retailers, as the hon. Gentleman pointed out. To be successful, we need to tackle all those elements to make it more difficult for fraudsters to access illicit alcohol, to operate and to supply demand at the wholesale or retail end of the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/11">Estimating the scale of the fraud is far from a precise science. It involves analysis of consumer surveys such as the expenditure and food survey and HMRC clearances data. Estimates of illicit alcohol market share are currently published only for spirits, most recently in the pre-Budget report, and are expressed as a range. The mid-point is 5 per cent. and the upper estimate is 9 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/12">We do not yet have robust estimates for beer or wine, but HMRC's latest internal estimate for beer suggests that the illicit market share is in a range with a mid-point of 9 per cent., which is equivalent to &#163;550 million in excise duty and VAT, and an upper estimate of 12 per cent., which is equivalent to &#163;710 million. Work is ongoing to develop the methodology used, and HMRC is currently testing data assumptions with relevant trade associations, so the estimate for the illicit beer market share may be subject to revision. We do not yet have equivalent estimates for wine or cider.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/13">It is in the mutual interests of both the Government and the industry to tackle alcohol fraud robustly. The Government launched their initial alcohol fraud strategy, which was aimed at tackling sales of illicit spirits, in 2005. At that time, spirits fraud was the major threat due to spirits being a high-value, low-volume product relative to other alcohol commodities. Among other initiatives, we introduced a duty stamp scheme for spirits. The absence of a duty stamp, which is a clear indication that duty has not been paid, enabled HMRC and honest businesses for the first time to identify illicit products.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/14">The spirits strategy has been quite successful in reducing the scale of the fraud. For 2003-04, the mid-point estimate for the illicit market share was 8 per cent., which is equivalent to &#163;300 million, and as I just mentioned, the latest published figures for 2007-09 show that this has been reduced to 5 per cent., which is equivalent to &#163;150 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/15">Complementing the spirits fraud strategy, we have been tackling fraud in categories of drink with some success. For instance, in the nine months to the end of December 2009, HMRC and the UK Border Agency seized more than 4 million litres of illicit beer and wine. However, we are aware that fraud in beer and wine is becoming a growing problem, with the legitimate wholesale and retail trade particularly finding it difficult to compete with the illicit market, and we are aware that much more needs to be done. That is why in Budget 2009 the Chancellor announced that we were renewing our strategy to tackle alcohol fraud to involve types of alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/16">We are committed to tightening the law where appropriate and tackling criminals hard, but we look to the industry to support and work with us. There are three major strands to our approach: changing the law to make life tougher for criminals and easier for honest businesses to compete; working with honest businesses to secure legitimate supply chains and make it harder for criminals to source alcohol; and strengthening our operational response to alcohol fraud as part of a centrally co-ordinated effort to detect, disrupt and dismantle organised criminal networks and supply chains. HMRC is making good progress on all three strands of this strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/17">The regulatory framework is being strengthened, within what is allowable under the EU directive governing the holding and movement of excise goods, to reduce opportunities for error and fraud. For example, in June 2009 we changed legislation to withdraw the facility to draw back duty paid for goods warehoused for export, which was being systematically abused to steal revenue by people making false claims for repayment of duty. This had an immediate and substantial impact on the amount of alcohol drawback being claimed and paid. Further measures outlined in Budget 2009, including the reform of excise financial securities, have been consulted on in 2009-10 and options for regulatory change are currently being considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.0/18">A number of further regulatory changes have also been proposed in the course of dialogue between trade associations and HMRC. I would particularly like to mention the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, which, as the hon. Member for Rochdale rightly said, I have not yet had the opportunity to meet. But I am trying to meet as many stakeholders as possible. The FWD made some radical suggestions for further tightening up the duty drawback regime to prevent displacement of fraud into the remaining system, and on taking a much harder line on the seizure of goods and assessment for lost taxes where goods are being traded close to or below their full duty paid price. These proposals are being actively explored by officials to see if they are within the boundary of the law.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.0/1">I appreciate that, for security reasons, the Minister may not want to give too much detail, but I understand that the enforcement unit within HMRC is still small. Will she say whether the Government have granted HMRC more resources so that it can employ more people to chase this illicit trade?</p>

	<p pid="a.250.1/1">We take our responsibilities towards illicit trade seriously. We are looking at a three-pronged approach in this regard. We are establishing targets to ensure that HMRC and UKBA are carrying out the activities that are necessary for the alcohol strategy to be successful. So we are concentrating on that side of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/2">We have also invested in the UK implementation of an EU-wide excise movement and control system to be introduced from April 2010. This will help combat fraud, by capturing data of all excise movements between warehouses in the EU electronically in real time, allowing tax authorities to interrogate and target high-risk movements. That system also requires the validation of the legitimacy and content of movements by both exporting and importing warehouses before the movement begins. The new system will therefore provide much greater transparency about what goods are moving between which warehouses, to allow easier and more effective controls between the EU and the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/3">We recognise that the success of the strategy to tackle alcohol fraud will in large part depend on reducing the ability of fraudsters to access duty unpaid alcohol to fuel their illicit supply chains. The volume of alcohol available for fraud in the UK is something that, to an extent, is within the control of producers and their immediate customers and we will need to work in partnership with industry to reduce that.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.2/1">I have listened carefully to the proposals that the Minister is working on. When she meets members of the FWD and distributors, will she explore the registration scheme with them, because from the evidence that they have presented to me the wholesale part of the chain is now the only bit that is not regulated and is therefore the weak link in the chain? If that could be regulated we could, with all the other controls that she is talking about, close down on some of these fraudsters.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.3/1">I am always happy to consider any proposals that will help us tackle this matter in the most cost-effective way. If there are weaknesses in the system, I am more than happy to consider the evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/2">I am also encouraged that large brewers and the wholesale sector have reached agreement to work with officials from HMRC on developing practical measures to restrict the availability of alcohol to fraudsters at source. These parties produce or control more than 80 per cent. of the alcohol sold in the off-trade. I understand that work is at an early stage, but with the commitment of these key players within the industry there is great potential to reduce the supply of alcohol to the illicit market. This is key to tackling the fraud. I look forward to the sectors of the legitimate industry being fully co-operative on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/3">Building a stronger, more flexible operational response to alcohol fraud is the last line of defence against organised criminal attack. We aim to deliver co-ordinated, targeted, high-impact interventions in respect of the key players in the fraud. This new approach will aim to attack illicit supply chains end to end, targeting the largest players propagating the fraud through to the middlemen who facilitate the fraud hiding behind the facade of operating legitimate businesses. That approach will involve HMRC and UKBA working with partner agencies to deploy the full range of enforcement tools and powers to make a lasting impact, including hard-hitting sanctions against fraudulent businesses and individuals, such as assets confiscations, winding-up orders and prosecutions, as well as removing licences and approvals from others facilitating the fraud through dishonest trading. The hon. Member for Rochdale asked me about the levels of prosecutions. I do not have the figures to hand, but I think I have demonstrated that prosecution is but one tool in the armoury, because we have other means to impose sanctions on such people.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/4">This co-ordinated and systematic work will begin in earnest in April 2010. I am pleased to report good progress by HMRC and UKBA in preparing for the new approach. The aim is to make it difficult for fraudsters to operate, thereby protecting legitimate businesses' ability to thrive. This is a significant and innovative shift in approach which we expect will deliver a much greater impact on fraud. I hope industry will support us.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.3/5">We have a coherent package of measures to hit back hard against this fraud from several directions. Due to the need for detailed consultation with the alcohol industry to avoid any unintended effects of legislation on legitimate trade, and the scale of change for HMRC, the renewal of the alcohol strategy was announced as a programme of work for 2009-10. I am pleased that this programme of work is nearing completion and I expect to begin seeing the impact of its implementation from <phrase class="date" code="2010-04-01">1 April 2010</phrase>.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-02-09a.252.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="252"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100209/halltext/100209h0010.htm#10020969000544">
	<p pid="a.252.1/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about what I think, and what the vast majority of people in this country think, is a vital topic. I recall that in my maiden speech back in May 1992 the first issue I addressed was the need to renew, regenerate and re-grow Sherwood forest. It is fitting that, in the twilight of my parliamentary years and in some of the last comments that I will make, I return to the subject of forestry.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/2">It is important to recognise that during the 18 years between 1992 and now there have been major changes in thinking. At one time woodland cover was regarded as an additional extra, a luxury, the icing on the cake and something nice to have. But it has become clear in recent years that woodland policy is vital in delivering many of our mainstream policies. Let me give some examples, starting with the most pressing issue: climate change goals of mitigation and adaptation.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/3">Woodland has a vital role to play, both here in the United Kingdom and internationally: it has real benefits for soil and water and can help with flood alleviation and is a source of and background for more wildlife. We underestimate the value of good quality woodland in providing an environment for economic development and, more particularly, tourism. I shall speak later about woodland providing timber, but there are also benefits for recreation and health-walking the woodlands brings physical and mental benefits. In their low carbon transition plan, the Government state the position well when they say that</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/4" class="indent">&quot;well-targeted woodland creation can also bring about other benefits, including a recreational resource, employment opportunities, flood alleviation, improvements in water quality, and helping to adapt our landscapes to climate change by linking habitats to support wildlife&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/5">A number of reports that have been published recently recognise the value of woodland. A consensus is growing that woodland creation is a mainstream policy. The Read report, which was commissioned by the Forestry Commission and published just before Christmas-I understand that the Government will respond to it around Easter-states clearly that the Forestry Commission should try to produce 23,000 hectares of wood a year over 40 years. That would help to reduce carbon emissions in the UK by 10 per cent. The Government's low carbon transition plan, which was published in the summer, called for an additional 10,000 hectares a year for 15 years, and calculated that that would remove 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide between now and 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/6">The UK's biodiversity action plan identifies a target of 83,555 hectares of new woodland by 2010, and a total of 164,000 hectares by 2030. That is important, because we start from a very low base. The UK is the fourth least wooded country in Europe. Only 8 per cent. of England is covered, with 5.8 per cent. of that being broadleaf. We have a notion of England being a green and pleasant land where people wander in the greenwood, but that is not the reality. The figures for tree creation and woodland planting have remained stable for a couple of decades. We are not making progress to achieve our aims.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/7">I am particularly concerned about my area of the east midlands where only 5 per cent. of the region is covered by woodland. Closer to home in Nottinghamshire-the home of the internationally famous Sherwood forest-just 8 per cent. of the cover is woodland. The east midlands forestry framework states:</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Region has a relatively poor level of tree cover compared to England as a whole. Creation of new woodlands, particularly with native species, can stimulate the economy through tourism, business diversification and forestry employment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/9">Similarly, the east midlands regional strategy refers to how green infrastructure, of which woods and trees are a key component,</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/10" class="indent">&quot;transforms open space from 'nice to have' to 'must have' as an integral part of new developments. Green infrastructure helps frame the most efficient and attractive location for development and growth in the context of sustainable development. It also helps address inequalities of health and quality of life issues particularly in more deprived communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/11">Given the low base, we must take action. We need a framework for the future. I have always been a supporter of the Woodland Trust, and I was delighted when it recently launched its manifesto &quot;Growing the future&quot;. It argues keenly for a doubling of our native woodland in the UK over the next 50 years. It believes that, despite our record, that is not pie in the sky, and that we could create 15,000 hectares of new native woodland a year over the next 50 years. That would require a strong partnership, but the trust is not just aspirational. It works hard on the ground, and makes real changes and provides real benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/12">I particularly like the trust's Heartwood project near St. Albans, where more than 150 acres of new native forest will be created with 600,000 trees planted by volunteers over the next five years. It is important that St. Albans is near big conurbations, and the project offers real opportunities for people. Another project on which the Woodland Trust is working in partnership is the notion of an NHS forest with the NHS using its estate to develop new woodland and to plant 1.3 million trees-that is the number of people who work in the NHS. It would provide a clear and tangible sign that health, woodland and green land are linked.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/13">Another good example is the national forest, which, as the Minister knows, the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is considering and on which it will produce a report soon. The significance of the national forest is the introduction of new ways and new mechanisms for creating woodland. I am particularly impressed by its tendering policy to which landowners have responded strongly. We should do more of that. The national forest is a good example of an organisation pulling partners together and persuading landowners that there is a long-term future, not just for the environment, but for their own economic benefit, in planting woodland. One lesson is that the national forest team has cut the bureaucracy involved in introducing grants.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/14">I cannot talk about woodland cover without mentioning the internationally most famous forest-Sherwood forest. I praise the work of the Sherwood Forest Trust, which is a strong partnership arrangement that delivers tangible gains, including &#163;8 million of benefits. Sherwood forest has more ancient oaks that anywhere else on the planet, and many are more than 1,000 years old. The oldest at 1,200 years, which is owned by the Sherwood Forest Trust, is the parliament oak, and it is fitting to remember that in 1290, Edward I held his first parliament there. It is a link between Parliament and the woodland.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/15">The Sherwood Forest Trust has worked with 1,650 landowners and delivered 50 large and 1,600 other significant landscape improvements. It has planted more than 13,000 trees, improved about 1,500 hectares of woodland, and created 58 km of new hedging, 92 hectares of wetland, and 50 metres of river bank and associated wet woodland. I am particularly impressed by the work that the trust has done with young people. I was at a tree-planting ceremony recently when young people were given some acorns to grow in the trust's nursery as a tangible sign of developing the forest.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/16">We can and should do more. In Nottinghamshire, there has been a long campaign to establish the Sherwood forest regional park. The county council has been a significant player and has brought forward partners, consultants and the concept of a new regional park based on Sherwood. All the parties have signed up to that, and as a concept it appears good. However, we need to go further and start delivering the project. The East Midlands Development Agency, the county council and the Government's agencies, Natural England and the Forestry Commission, have a role to play in bringing forward the Sherwood forest regional park. It is important to establish that now.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/17">In May, the new Robin Hood film will appear with Russell Crowe as the hero, or anti-hero. It is directed by Ridley Scott and it has been estimated that the film could bring &#163;46 million of investment into Nottinghamshire. We want people to come and look at Nottingham castle and admire it, and then go from the home of the villain to the home of the free men in Sherwood forest. I want them to perceive that that green wood is the place to live and work and perhaps, for unreconstructed socialists, to give from the rich to the poor-a manifesto commitment for the next election.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/18">How do we do that? I have two suggestions. First, we must look at the notion of carbon funding and carbon trading. It is accepted that woodland absorbs carbon, but the arrangements for trading carbon for small, local landowners need to be changed. If something is enhanced by or benefits from the introduction of woodland, someone needs to get the carbon credit. Further work must be done by the Government to stop the notion of double counting, where farmers or landowners claim the benefit as well as the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/19">Secondly, we must target tree-planting. Work by the Woodland Trust shows that 85 per cent. of the population do not live within walking distance of a wood. However, 91 per cent. of people think that woodlands are good things for the environment and can help us to mitigate climate change. According to the Campaign to Protect Rural England, 79 per cent. of people want more trees planted around towns and cities. We must set targets in partnership with local authorities to ensure that we build towards that target of doubling our woodland cover over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/20">I have one final point to show the demand that is on the woodlands at the moment. There are a variety of new planning applications for energy generation from biomass. There is a strong debate about how much wood those plants will consume-one estimate is 40 million tonnes a year. We can produce only 11 million tonnes at the moment, so as night follows day, wood will have to be imported to feed those plants. That cannot be right in sustainability terms. We must also look at what will happen to the wood panel industry, which is dependent on wood from our forests, if all the product goes into biomass generation. That is an example of how more woodland creation and more thoughtful policies can sustain the environment and build our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/21">I talked about the Woodland Trust's manifesto. At the moment, all the political parties are producing manifestos, and one manifesto ought to be clear across the parties: woods are good for the environment and they are good for the economy; woods are good for health and woodland adds value to property. If a politician cannot sell woodland and woodland creation, they cannot sell anything. This is a win-win situation. We must move forward from talk of aspirations for the future to a set of targeted policies to bring that forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/22">I am delighted with the work of the Woodland Trust and I have great admiration for the work of the Forestry Commission. However, let us be clear: if we are to combat climate change, lift the landscape and enhance the environment, an essential tool must be new, native woodland cover. The time for talking has ended; there is a consensus that we need to go forward. The Minister has always been extremely helpful to me, and I ask him to come and join that campaign, help us to create a new Sherwood forest and help the Woodland Trust and others to do what is good for the environment, good for sustainability and good for the future. Let us double woodland cover in the UK in 50 years' time.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair today, Mr. Amess. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on drawing further attention to the need for increasing native woodland cover. I would like to express regret on behalf of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase>, who would be here in normal circumstances to participate in this debate as the Minister responsible for the environment, food and rural affairs. Sadly, he had already committed himself to other duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">Before I respond to the various points raised, I would like to note the contribution made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood, both in his role as chair of the all-party group on forestry and given his personal and continuing interest in environmental matters and his strong support for groups and trusts that campaign on forestry issues in his constituency and elsewhere. All that is well known here at Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3">Let us turn to the issue at hand, which is that of creating native woodland cover. As my hon. Friend mentioned, the Read report, published last November, gave us a better understanding of UK forestry's potential to help tackle climate change. The report is an independent, expert assessment of current scientific knowledge about UK forests and how they can help us to mitigate the effects of climate change.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">When my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs launched the report, he was clear that we need to plant a large number of trees over the next 40 years to tackle climate change and help bring down our carbon emissions, as well as addressing the biodiversity issues mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">To achieve those positive aims, we will need to work with communities and businesses. Since the Read report was published, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Forestry Commission have been developing policies on how we can increase the number of trees that we plant. However, there is more work to do to ensure that we have a clear mechanism to pay for the step change in woodland planting that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/6">My hon. Friend suggested that we should unlock potential funds by resolving the problems of double counting. Early tree planting schemes suffered from a lack of quality assurance that undermined consumer confidence. In recent years, developments in both the regulated and unregulated carbon offset market have attempted to improve confidence in offsetting mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/7">The Government are determined to create a step change in domestic woodland creation, and we are currently working with the Forestry Commission, the Department of Energy and Climate Change and other bodies to find out how else we can stimulate more private sector investment in woodlands. DEFRA and the Forestry Commission are clear about the range of policies that woodland delivers. Trees are not only part of our green infrastructure, but they also play an increasingly important role in our towns and cities. Work by Manchester university suggests that increasing green coverage, particularly the tree canopy, in high density urban areas by only 10 per cent. could mitigate temperature increases from global warming, possibly keeping temperatures at today's levels or below.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/8">I would like to highlight an example of where the right tree has been planted in right place. The national forest, which stretches across three of England's central counties and with which my hon. Friend will be very familiar, has demonstrated that it is possible to make landscape scale improvements by creating increased woodland and other habitats. That increased woodland cover has provided leisure opportunities for local people, supported local economies and driven the economic regeneration of former mining landscapes.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/9">I understand that in my hon. Friend's constituency, as he mentioned, the Sherwood Forest Trust has been set up to secure the long-term future of the forest by restoring its ancient landscape for the benefit of people and wildlife. That is another example of ensuring that woodlands are places that local people can use and enjoy.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/10">Forests and woodlands provide crucial and resilient habitats for wildlife and are a key part of our biodiversity. They will become increasingly important to enhance the English landscape's resilience to climate change and to allow mobile species to migrate to new habitats. For all the reasons that I and my hon. Friend have mentioned, native trees are exceptionally important to us. The Government are determined to ensure that we put plans in place to increase native woodland cover and to ensure that those woodlands are well managed for future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/11">In conclusion, I again congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate, and I assure him that DEFRA agrees about the importance of native woodland cover. I am sure that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will have heard his strong appeal to Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe to get over to Nottingham and Sherwood and to take their money with them as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/12" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/13" class="italic">Sitting adjourned.</p>
