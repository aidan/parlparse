<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.86.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" speakername="David Hamilton" colnum="86"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew36">
	<p pid="a.86.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> for bringing the debate to the House. Like many hon. Members present, I was part of the debate that took place previously on the Scottish Affairs Committee report. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> said, many of the recommendations in that report could be taken forward with regard to a UK position. There are differences in the market in Scotland, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the essence of the report when examining the energy review.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">I am mindful of your comments about the time remaining, Mr. Cook. The debate is about both the energy review and coal, and I would like to talk about some of the other issues relating to coal. When the comment was made about &quot;old king coal&quot;, I felt myself sliding down in my seat, because I am sometimes referred to as old king coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">With regard to the security of energy for the United Kingdom, alternative energy sources must be considered. In Scotland, hydro is about 6 per cent. of the market. Hon. Members have referred to nuclear, to renewables, including wind&mdash;wave power has not been referred to&mdash;to gas and coal and to security of energy. There was the problem that we faced at the beginning of the year. Every national newspaper carried the same headline, which was &quot;Russia turns off the gas to Europe&quot;. The issue was not just about the UK. Politicians throughout Europe did not really care about Ukraine; they were much more concerned about the pipe coming through into Europe. Many of us have been saying for many years&mdash;I do not say that with any glee&mdash;that the most important issue that we must face is Britain's dependence on sources of energy coming from abroad. That debate must take place in much more detail, and I am glad to see that there will be a debate on Thursday, although there is only a one-line Whip.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">As politicians, we must decide on the principle of whether we leave ourselves being dictated to by other countries or, indeed, whether we leave ourselves to market forces. I do not believe that either situation is acceptable to us. Or do we rely on our own resources, knowing that there will be a cost to that decision? That is important. It has been alluded to on a couple of occasions that whatever decision is made, there will be a cost factor. If we make a decision about self-reliance in the UK, there will be a cost to that, and we must bear that in mind, not only for consumers but for business and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/5">We need to consider what is happening throughout the world and especially in China, which has become the engine house of the world. According to the 2002 statistics&mdash;not the latest ones&mdash;1,393 billion tonnes of coal were produced in China. Germany is the biggest European producer, producing 207 million tonnes. The UK is right down the line again, producing only 30 million tonnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/6">It is also important to realise that several European countries produce coal, about one or two of which I was surprised. They produce coal on a greater scale than the United Kingdom does&mdash;not just Germany, but also Poland, with 161 million tonnes, Greece, with 71 million tonnes, and the Czech Republic, with 63 million tonnes. We are therefore in a market within the European network. Recognising that that is important. Britain, which has used only 15 per cent. of its coal resources, has some of the biggest reserves within Europe. At the end of the day, that we have not improved on our position is a tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/7">In many instances we are at the cutting edge of developing new coal technology, but at the same time the coal industry is on its knees. That that is happening is a contradiction in terms and, to me, ironic. We have the transport and the expertise, which we have developed along with other European countries, but at the same time we are not paying heed to our own coal industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/8">There are a number of issues that I will come on to, and one is about the Glencoe station. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase> said that there were objections when it went ahead. There will be. There are objections to every single thing that is proposed in relation to energy, whether that be open-cast, wind farms or tidal. There will be objections to hydro, which is very attractive in Scotland. The decision was made many years ago about hydro. Indeed, the organisation that represents renewables within Scotland has indicated that hydro could take up at least 20 per cent. of Scotland's needs, and in the renewable market it is talking in terms of 40 per cent. of Scotland's needs being met by renewables.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/9">The wider base brings in not only energy, but the Department of Trade and Industry. What about when planned applications go forward for housing and so on? Industrial units are being built to specifications with the worst common denominator. They are not built with a specification that includes ensuring that there is heat retention, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/10">I will give some examples. Midlothian council is a good example, with a housing stock of 7,500 council houses. Every such house in Midlothian has wall cavity filling, insulation in its attic and double glazing. Each house had to have all such things installed after the houses were built. Could the planning process not have been better? Building contractors agree with us. When we talk to them about planned applications, their argument is that they want a fair crack of the whip, a fair playing field, when they make applications to build houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/11">If every housing contractor across the UK was told that when they build a house they must have cavity filling, attic insulation and double glazing&mdash;to make sure that heat is retained, which in turn reduces the demand on energy&mdash;that would be very positive. We must look more at how we save energy, as much as how much we can produce energy. That issue has to be addressed much more than at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/12">A report from a debate in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has another good example from Midlothian. Please excuse me for the argument, but Midlothian boasts an area including Monkton Hall colliery, where I worked for 20-odd years. Although closed, the colliery, 3,000 ft deep as it was, is producing substantial amounts of hot water&mdash;geothermal water. An experiment in Midlothian, with &pound;3.5 million allocated from Europe, is considering how to use the geothermal water coming up from Monkton Hall to feed some 230 houses&mdash;to start with&mdash;industrial units and a primary school. There is a possibility of expanding the use of that geothermal water to some 4,000 new-build houses. I ask the Minister to come along for a meeting, and, with the council, to discuss these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/13">There are 230 ex-collieries within Scotland, two-thirds of which have the potential of using geothermal heating coming up from them. Therefore, using old collieries can take us up to the 21st century, which in turn can develop a strategy for us.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/14">I am mindful of what the Chair said and will cut short everything, because other speakers took far too long.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.111.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" speakername="Russell Brown" colnum="111"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.111.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank him for sending me a letter, also congratulating him on securing the debate, that he received from some constituents in my area who are part of the ongoing rural postal pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">This is about the delivery of the service. For many years&mdash;we have already heard this mentioned this afternoon&mdash;we have seen postal services delivered through village shops. My previous constituency had a post office in the village pub. I do not know whether that meant that people were picking up their pension and then spending a fair amount of it. There are also post offices in garages. The issue is about the service, not necessarily the structures and methods of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">We are talking about the rural network. I want to mention something that happened 12 months ago in my constituency, in the town of Dumfries. When Safeway changed to Morrisons, Morrisons immediately decided that it wanted the post office out of the supermarket. There was quite an outcry, because it was a busy post office. However, I was quite astonished to discover that over 50 per cent. of the business being transacted through that post office came not from the townspeople of Dumfries but from people from further afield&mdash;from villages and some of the smaller towns. We are now looking at what some people would deem to be the Crown post office in Dumfries&mdash;the directly managed service&mdash;being franchised out to Spar supermarkets. To a certain extent, it has come as a bit of a surprise&mdash;although I am not totally astonished&mdash;that only 15 per cent. of the business transferred from Safeway to the main post office. The big question is: where has all the other business gone? I suspect that it has gone to a couple of the other urban sub-post offices, but some of it may have gone back to the rural localities from whence it came.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">The public want a service and, in general, they do not worry too much about how it is being delivered&mdash;whether it is in the village shop, the pub or wherever. We have to ask ourselves what we are being asked for. Is it a public service, a social service, or a combination of both? In rural localities, it is a combination of both.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">As I indicated, my locality is one of three in Scotland where a rural postal pilot is ongoing. It is what is deemed a hub and spoke service. In other words, from a centre&mdash;the town of Castle Douglas&mdash;the sub-postmaster operates the post offices in three villages. That started back in mid-September, and there was an outcry because the first thing that happened was that the hours were reduced. All three of the post offices operate out of shops. I visited two of them and asked the sub-postmasters, as they still were at the time, whether they believed that the significant reduction in hours&mdash;one of them had gone down from 21 hours to 10&mdash;was reasonable. Both of them believed that their new opening hours reflected the amount of custom that came through their doors.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">The big difficulty was the way in which the hours were configured. A Post Office member of staff goes from one of those post offices to the next to provide the service. Like anybody else, that individual can be in only one place at a time. People wanted the post offices to be open for more hours in the morning, and there was a great demand for Saturday opening. I went to a meeting in one of the village halls and by pure chance, nothing more, a retired sub-postmaster and his wife were there when the public were demanding Saturday opening. The guy stood up and said, &quot;People can make these demands, but the reality is that when I was running the post office nobody used it on a Saturday morning, so why do people want it open then?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/7">I will not paint a rosy picture; difficult decisions have to be made. Because there was an outcry, I asked people for feedback about whether the hours suited their needs. In general, the answer was no. I am a townie, and I was surprised to find that some people used the post office every day. That might well be the case. I even had people writing to say that they did not use the post office at all, but that the new opening hours were not right. I think that we would all agree that one has to respect people's views.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/8">The pilot is to run for 12 months, and it requires the co-operation of the shopkeepers. I have made the point on the two occasions on which I have attended public meetings, one of them last night, that if there is no shop there is a difficulty: from where should we deliver the service? We could use the local pub, or whatever the case may be, but we need co-operation, especially when we are running a pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/9">I do not want to have a go at anybody, but I must be honest. Two of the villages seem to be operating fairly well. The other one has been something of a problem, and that is putting it kindly. From day 1, one individual has been turning up at the post office with a clipboard and pen. I know that I said, &quot;Keep me posted on any problems that arise,&quot; but that is harassment and intimidation, and it is not required. The gentleman has become a prolific letter writer and he is trying to drag me along.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.117.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" speakername="John Thurso" colnum="117"  time="015:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.117.3/1">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I came into the Chamber with the intention of supporting my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase>. Having listened to the excellent way he presented the case and to the other excellent contributions, I am moved to make a short contribution myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/2">It may not need to have been said, as it is obvious, but it is worth repeating how important rural post offices are to the whole of rural life and to sustaining the communities. They are important for two distinct and different reasons, both of which have come out in the debate. The first is the provision of services to people who need them, who are often the most vulnerable in society, whether through age or infirmity, and who would not otherwise have access to those services. Secondly, the point must be made in relation to the highlands about the provision of services to people on low incomes and without access to a car who live in areas where there is very little public transport. We assume these days that everyone will be able to use a car or other transport, but many people cannot do so, for a variety of reasons. Therefore the simple provision of a service is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/3">A wider point made this afternoon is that a functioning post office is often the last service to remain in a village, after the shop, the pub and so on have gone. It is the post office that keeps going. It is a point of contact, somewhere that people who do not often see other people go to see the sub-postmaster or postmistress. Sometimes that is how they signal that they are still around, alive and well. It is not uncommon in villages for people to notice that somebody has not been into the post office for a day or two and to go and check that they are all right. The wider good of the community is important in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/4">We would all like the rural network service to be kept and, if possible, enhanced, and I want to consider where the responsibilities for that lie. It would be easy to slam the Post Office and say that there is a vast conspiracy to get everything wrong, but we must be clear that in the climate that has been created for the Post Office, the commercial realities are inescapable. We cannot expect the Post Office to be a profitable organisation and at the same time to provide traditional services, as it has always done.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/5">For that reason, I welcome the pilot scheme that is under way in Caithness. When I was consulted about it I pointed out the pitfalls. In my meetings with those who were responsible for setting it up, I said that the number of hours being offered was likely to be so small that the outcome would be that people would fall out of the habit of using the post office at that time. That seems to have been the case. However, we should not criticise the Post Office for seeking to be innovative in putting forward solutions, and it should not be the whipping boy in this exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/6">I am worried about what is happening in Caithness. The <i>John O' Groat Journal</i>, a fine paper that I can recommend to anyone, drew attention in its issue of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-30">30 December</phrase> to the severe problems that are being encountered through lack of service. They are not helping the Post Office's case.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/7">I had an interesting conversation with the chairman of Postwatch about a month ago when he told me of innovations in America, which has gone for the opposite solution of a fixed, unmanned station in rural communities. By using a card people can post a letter and extract things. I shall be meeting the chairman to find out more about that because it is another innovation that the Post Office may be interested in.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/8">The Government have a clear responsibility in these matters, and opportunities have been missed. One was the opportunity with the migration of benefits. We warned the then Minister what was likely to happen to footfall. We received assurances that the marketing would be even-handed, but my correspondence with every sub-postmaster and postmistress told me that they were unable to compete with the heavy marketing and telephone campaign that took place. We have a huge range of Government and local government services that we want to deliver more closely to the population. We have a network of offices with some fine equipment which are capable of delivering some of those services. Can the Government not put the two together so that delivery to our citizens could be made through the Post Office in a profitable way?</p>
