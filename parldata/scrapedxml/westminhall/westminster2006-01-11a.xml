<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.75.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="75"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.75.3/1">I feel extremely fortunate to have been chosen to introduce this debate on future energy needs. Many of my colleagues applied for a similar Adjournment debate, which underlines the importance of energy and our future needs in the United Kingdom. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister recently said that global warming and the environment was one of the most important issues of our time. I do not want to disagree with the boss, but in my view energy and the environment go hand in hand and are not mutually exclusive.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/2">If anyone were in doubt about the importance of energy, the first few days of 2006 will have created absolute clarity. The dispute between Russia and Ukraine brings the issue of future energy needs into sharp focus and emphasises how important it is for diversity to be at the centre of the UK's energy policy, including domestic supply and the import of energy. A detailed examination of Europe's dependence on Russian gas should instruct our future policies. We should consider the following. France obtains 20 per cent. of its gas from Russia, Italy 30 per cent. and Germany 35 per cent. The figure is 20 per cent. for Poland, 60 per cent. for the Czech Republic and 60 per cent. for Austria.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/3">What is the position in the UK? This year, the UK will no longer be self-sufficient in gas production and will depend on gas imported from Europe. That gas will come from various sources. Some will come from stable democracies such as Norway and some from less politically stable countries and regions. In those circumstances, we must ensure that we are never a hostage to fortune.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/4">The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/5" class="indent">&quot;The UK's gas reserves are declining. Government and industry analysts estimate that by around 2006 the UK will no longer be self-sufficient in gas production and will revert to being a net gas importer. Gas is the largest proportion of the UK's primary energy supply, and gas-fired power plants are the main method of power generation. The UK will increasingly depend on gas imported from Europe and further afield.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/6">If in the past few weeks European countries have been shivering, that may well be down to more than the weather. We have witnessed President Putin send a shiver throughout Europe.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.4/1">Has my hon. Friend seen the projections from the Department of Trade and Industry, which suggest that, by 2020, 70 per cent. of our electricity needs will be met by gas, 90 per cent. of which will be imported? Is that not a perilous situation?</p>

Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> were known five or six years ago, when, sadly, our Government allowed the north-east Leicestershire coalfield around Asfordby, with 800 million tonnes of coal on the Nottinghamshire borders, to be sterilised and not used for the future of the country. Is that not a rather sad position? Should we not be reinvesting in deep mines with clean coal technology and avoiding the scar of open-cast coal, which would be the short-term, easy option that Governments might be tempted to pursue?</p>

	<p pid="a.76.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Cook. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">My hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> makes a valid point, and I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. No doubt some of my colleagues, who have a long history of working in the coal industry, will be able to make a contribution later.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/2">If we are to reach a sensible conclusion, any energy analysis or assessment must be free of prejudice and, above all, totally objective and evidence-based. That is a challenge we face in considering our future energy needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/3">The starting point of any energy review must be an audit of the contribution of our present energy sources. That assessment needs to consider nuclear, coal, gas, wind, oil, tidal, biomass and hydro. My view is that there is not one answer to our future energy needs. We need an energy mix that rejects dependence on foreign supplies.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/4">In planning our energy needs, a central question will be the decline of our oil and gas reserves. The prerequisite for any energy review and new policy is that the debate should not be about conventional versus renewables. Both have a valid and relevant contribution to make to our future energy needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/5">At the outset, I confirm my standpoint&mdash;I would like to see the development of renewables. I want wind, tide and wave to play a greater role in our energy jigsaw, but there appears to be a lack of urgency in the development of renewables in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/6">On the question of manufacturing and the energy industry, trade unions such as the Transport and General Workers Union are already expressing concern about major gas suppliers moving abroad. That raises genuine concern among many of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/7">All forms of renewable energy will create jobs and some manufacturing in the UK. The number of jobs will depend on the type of technology and on how far and where it develops. The jobs will cover a range of skills, including design, construction, manufacturing, assembly, installation and maintenance. The key is to provide appropriate support from the research and development stage to demonstration projects and fully operational plants.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate and on his remarks about the importance of us not being, as we are about to be, over-reliant on imports of energy from overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.0/2">Drawing upon the hon. Gentleman's last point, the energy review is a wonderful opportunity for Britain to start to become the world leader in some of the new energy technologies. Not least, it is an opportunity for this country to become a leader in clean coal technology, given the huge reserves we still have.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="77"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.77.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid and important point. The UK should become a showcase for the world, placing UK companies in a good position to win export orders for new technology. Without UK-based, full-size plants, it becomes much more difficult to prove the technologies and, more importantly, to win export orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">As I said, many hon. Members present represent mining areas. Britain has some of the largest coal reserves in Europe and that should not be lost on us. At present, many of the UK's coal-fired power stations are planning to implement the large combustion plants directive, which demands a significant reduction in emissions by <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2008</phrase>. The challenge to the coal-fired stations is to fit flue gas desulphurisation equipment and to guarantee themselves a future. In my own constituency, Mitsui Babcock is at the leading edge of new technology for coal-fired stations, which will assist them in reducing emissions of sulphur, nitrogen oxides and dust. I pay tribute to the management and work force of Mitsui Babcock. Not only can they make a major contribution to our future energy needs, but hopefully they can realise the export potential of their emissions capture technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/3">At the beginning of the debate, I expressed the view that our future energy policies need to be a genuine mix, with nothing excluded. For too long, hydropower has been the poor relation in the energy debate. It is often described as relevant in the 1940s and 1950s, but of no consequence today. I, for one, completely reject that analysis. Hydropower is relevant today. If we upgrade the pumping equipment at plants in the UK, we could achieve a 5 to 15 per cent. improvement in output. I also welcome the decision of Scottish and Southern Energy to build a new hydro-station at Glencoe near Fort Augustus, in Inverness-shire, which will generate up to 100 MW of electricity.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/4">I have said that future UK energy policy needs to give validity to every source of energy. The final portfolio needs to recognise our future needs and the protection of the environment against global warming.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that as well as ensuring continuity of energy supply, there needs to be some tighter price control mechanism? Many poor people in constituencies such as mine are struggling very hard to pay ever-increasing, spiralling energy costs, yet the profits of the energy companies increase even quicker than the prices.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. People are struggling to pay the ever-increasing, spiralling energy costs. It is not just consumers; local businesses are struggling to pay as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">I do not know whether my hon. Friend is aware of the situation in Grangemouth, where every night a lot of energy pours out of the top of the spiral and into the atmosphere. A similar plant in Sweden provides free heating for about 150,000 pensioners. Does he think that such an initiative could be part of the strategy?</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. There is a learning curve that we all have to follow. If we can learn lessons from countries such as Sweden, so be it. We would be the better for it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.78.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="78"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.78.3/1">Does the hon. Gentleman think that another important lesson that we need to learn from Scandinavia and other countries is that prices of energy will go up and down, as will the cost of heating homes, so the crucial thing for the long-term health of the occupants of homes is to get better quality standards for the conservation of energy and to reduce demand for energy and the need for people to buy it, whatever the price?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.78.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="78"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.78.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. I disagree on only one point and that is that I have had no experience of prices going up and down. I know that they go up. They very seldom come down.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.4/2">I hope that the Minister will confirm that the Government-stated objectives of getting 10 per cent. of electricity from renewables by 2010, 15 per cent. by 2015, and 20 per cent. by 2020 will not be amended or discarded. We collectively need to realise those objectives and we need to formulate our decisions with speed and consideration. Time is not on our side.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.4/3">Consumers and local businesses depend on us to provide and safeguard energy supplies. They should not, and hopefully, with Government support, will not, be held to ransom by any one supplier or source of energy supply. If we do not act now, future generations will rightly ask why we did not when we had the opportunity to do so. Economies such as China, India and Brazil are expanding and their thirst for energy will mean our competing with that to secure our own supplies. That is why I was delighted to hear that our Government and China have secured an agreement on the development of clean coal technology with carbon dioxide capture and storage, which also aims to reduce significantly the climate change impact from coal-fired electricity generation.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.5/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Coal has a part to play in our future energy supply. He has just mentioned carbon capture and storage&mdash; CCS technology. Carbon is, of course, a b&ecirc;te noir in this. He mentioned previously sulphur and nitrogen but not carbon. Does he believe that this country has an opportunity to lead in that technology, and that the Government must come forward with a regulatory framework for CCS and promote a demonstration plant, so that we can not only use up the coal that we have without damaging the environment, but sell that technology to the world, including China?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.79.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="79"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.79.0/1">I have no reason to disagree with what the hon. Gentleman says. I am sure that the Minister has also listened to what he has said. The hon. Gentleman's proposal will take a great deal of investment, and that is what we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/2">There is tangible evidence of willing partners in the agreement reached with China, working together to combat the global challenge of climate change. New technology available today could cut CO <sub>2</sub> emissions from power stations by up to 90 per cent. There are estimates among our energy experts that, within our shores, we have the capacity to store our total carbon emissions for decades to come. Known as carbon sequestration, the technology can be used to separate CO <sub>2</sub> from coal-firing and gas-firing power stations. The CO <sub>2</sub> is then pumped into depleted oilfields via disused pipelines.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/3">There are opportunities forthcoming for Government and private interests to invest in drilling into coal under our shores with a combination of drilling rigs, pipelines, storage facilities and power plants, exploiting an energy resource that has a 300-year future. Underground gasification of coal is an idea whose time has come. It has green credentials, with the potential to pump waste carbon dioxide into the underground holes. Hydrogen could be extracted from the gas for a new generation, emitting nothing but water vapour.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/4">Who knows where that new technology could take us and what other uses it could have. One thing is clear, however: there is a window of opportunity in the review. We must take it and resurrect old king coal from its premature death.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.1/1">I have had a formal request for the removal of jackets, and those of you who have had the misfortune to work under my chairmanship in Committee will know that I am normally amenable to such requests. However, in this instance, this is a parallel Chamber to the parent Chamber below, so for that reason and that reason alone, I am afraid that jackets must remain on&mdash;not necessarily buttoned, but on.</p>

	<p pid="a.79.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is timely because my hon. Friend the Minister has announced the review, and he has the unenviable task of deciding the energy mix for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/2">I want to make three points: first, I want to consider some of the issues that the Minister will have to deal with in the energy review; secondly I want to make the point that all forms of energy have a substantial impact on the environment; and thirdly, I want to refer to the position of the United Kingdom coal industry, urging the Minister to act to ensure that the industry is around when the review is completed, so that it can play its part in ensuring the security of supply of UK energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/3">During the review, the Minister will need to consider the impact of the energy mix on climate change, the retention of a diversity of suppliers, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North referred, and the security of supply. Having watched events during the past few weeks, I have no doubt that the security of supply issue will loom large for the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/4">There is also the commercial framework of the energy market to consider. The Minister will be aware that we have gone through a number of phases. We had the pool system, which gave way to the new electricity trading arrangements. Each system has impacted differently on the energy scene. Although at present there is a sparsity of gas, in the next 18 months, much more gas is likely to become available from Norway. Unless we are prepared to consider how the commercial framework of the energy economy has altered, we are likely to see a second dash for gas. In my estimation, five or six years after the start of that dash, the position for the UK could be far worse. I refer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> made: it is estimated that we could be 80 per cent. dependent on imported gas if we go down that route.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/5">The Minister will have to consider those matters in the review. I take the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North made in opening the debate: there is a need for diversity and there is room in the energy market for all energy sources. At present, roughly 40 per cent. of electricity is generated by gas, 33 per cent. by coal and about 19 or 20 per cent. by nuclear, with 4 or 5 per cent. from renewable sources. The 40 per cent. reliance on gas should be our limit. We should not allow a second dash for gas to take us into an area where we are 80 per cent. dependent on gas. In future, gas will come from areas of the world that are less stable than Norway and at the same time we have to consider the current phenomenon of terrorism. Terrorism could place us in a very vulnerable position should those gas supplies be interrupted.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/6">During the review, I should like the Minister to think about the limits on gas. In thinking about the commercial framework of the energy economy, he may decide that it should be divided between the current sources. We know that 2020 is the target for 20 per cent. of renewables. That is a commendable target. We should ensure that we reach that target because we need the renewable technology. I must tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> that, in 1992, a world-leading plant at Grimethorpe in Barnsley, a clean technology plant, which was built and administered by British Coal, was dismantled by the Conservative Government. It certainly put us in a far worse position in catching up on the technologies, which we must do now.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/7">All forms of energy have an impact on the economy and the environment. Some have a worse impact than others, which are detrimental nevertheless. I have a wind farm in Penistone in my constituency. It caused a great deal of concern when it was built because it is a very picturesque area. Many people took the view that it created visual pollution. I agree. Some argue that wind farms add to the beauty of a scene, but when one sees the wind farm on the hills above Penistone that is certainly not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.2/8">I understand that experts who have been looking at the nuclear industry will be reporting to my hon. Friend the Minister. Monday's report in <i>The Guardian </i>showed that a new regime of nuclear generation would not result in less waste, as some have argued. According to experts on the matter, it could increase eye-level waste fivefold. The Minister will need to consider that issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.1/1">The article is based on the report coming to the Minister and when it is available we will know the position. I am not attacking the nuclear industry, but just pointing out that all forms of energy have a substantial impact on the environment, which the Minister will need to consider. Coal has a substantial impact on the environment, which is why we argue for clean coal technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North referred to the large combustion plant directive, which will require the fitting of flue gas desulphurisation to power stations that burn coal by 2008. I understand that it is likely that 16 gigawatts of capacity will be fitted with flue gas desulphurisation. That leaves us with CO <sub>2</sub> and how to deal with it. My hon. Friend also referred to clean coal technology, which could be dealt with by developments in his constituency. Mitsui Babcock has a super-critical boiler that is fitted with a facility for carbon capture. Some super-critical boilers are being offered to China, as my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/3">What we require is to incentivise the generation industry to take on the retro-fitting of the new technology. Most of the coal-fired stations will be decommissioned by about 2015, so between now and then a new regime of coal-fired power stations will be needed, which means using the new technology and giving the generators incentives to do so.</p>

I understand that applications have been made for a new shaft at Daw Mill in the midlands, and a new colliery at Margam, and I understand that Scottish Coal is talking about the sinking of two drift mines. It is important that the Minister responds favourably to UK Coal, because we need the UK coal industry to be able to provide that security of supply.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.5/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this important debate. The future of coal in the energy review is important to Scotland and the UK generally. I was interested in what he said about an energy audit. He will be aware that, during the previous Parliament, the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs&mdash;several members of which I see in the Chamber today&mdash;considered the issue. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/2" class="indent">&quot;As a matter of urgency before any final, irreversible, decisions on what sorts of power generation are the most appropriate for Scotland are taken, we recommend that the Government undertake an audit of the energy resources that are currently available, and then to use that as a basis to work out the energy requirements that will be needed in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/3">That is good advice for the Government, for the UK as a whole and for Scotland. We all agree that we need a mixture of energy resources, although we may disagree about what goes in that mix and what the proportions are. We cannot rely on any one energy resource to provide our energy for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/4">Coal clearly has a potential for producing energy within the UK. It is reckoned that there are some 200 years of coal reserves left, as opposed to perhaps as little as 38 years of gas. However, most of our energy at present is produced from gas-burning stations, which does not make great economic sense. We talk about the security of energy supply, but in the UK&mdash;the situation is different in Scotland, which produces much more gas than it uses&mdash;we will shortly be reliant on imported gas. We have already seen, as the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North mentioned, what happened between Russia and Ukraine over the new year period, and the potential difficulties in that situation. There is no point in going for coal-burning technology if we do not ensure that there is a coal industry in this country to produce that coal. Otherwise, we will then start to import coal from places that are as remote and unstable as those from which we are importing gas.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.5/5">On the question of the security of energy supply, we must examine the coal industry. However, there are difficulties in doing so. As the Scottish Affairs Committee pointed out, if coal is to have a viable future, coal stations will have to take on the European directive on large combustion plants. The difficulty is that coal produced in the UK is generally higher in sulphur than elsewhere. Coal from Scotland is less sulphur-intensive than that from England.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.1/1">I will take the hon. Lady's word for that. Certainly in Scotland the coal is less sulphur-intensive than that in some areas of England. None the less, flue gas desulphurisation plants will have to be fitted to coal-fired stations if we are to meet the directive and if there is to be a future for coal. I understand that only two stations in the UK at present&mdash;Drax and Radcliffe&mdash;have that technology fitted, so considerable investment is needed and the cost of fitting the equipment to coal-fired stations will be considerable. The coal and generating industries will do that only if they are given a clear signal that there is a future for coal generation in this country. The nuclear industry is looking for such a signal in the energy review before investing in new stations&mdash;I shall not go into whether that is good or bad&mdash;and the coal industry is also entitled to look for direction from the Government and perhaps some Government investment in the production of that technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/2">Many other countries will invest in coal. China, India and the US all have huge coal reserves and can make a political reality of the situation. Despite international agreements on climate change, their coal is a large economic resource and they will burn it, particularly in countries such as China and India which have booming economies. We must deal with that reality and we must do so by considering clean-coal technology. In this country, we have developed that technology, as has the United States, and we must work together to ensure that it is available throughout the world. We must take account of climate change and we must ensure first that it is put into our coal stations that generate electricity from coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/3">Carbon capture has been mentioned and it is a relatively new technology with huge potential. Large areas in former oilfields under the North sea could be used to store carbon and new developments could help to get more oil out, as well as storing carbon gas. However, that is a relatively new technology and it may be many years before it has a significant impact.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware of the project being run in Scotland, supported by work of the university of Strathclyde, to infuse CO <sub>2</sub> into coal seams and announce gasification? For some reason, CO <sub>2</sub> does not separate at the point of burning.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.1/1">I am aware of that and various other technologies that could help.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/2">The debate has wandered somewhat from coal to other energy resources. When considering energy resources for the future we must accept the necessity for a balance between our energy and environmental needs. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">The hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> talked about the wind farm at Penistone and the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North talked about the hydro-station at Glencoe. That hydro-station also faced objections from environmental and other groups that were concerned about its environmental impact despite the fact that it is undeniably a green energy resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/3">The sad fact is that whatever energy source we adopt we must meet environmental objections, and that is as true of coal as it is of any other method. Many traditional mining areas were environmentally blighted by the coal industry for many years. Much of the current coal industry is open-cast and any proposal for open-cast mining invariably produces many objections. We must consider those issues and balance the two but, ultimately, the Government must give a clear steer to the coal industry, stating that it has a future and that, if we are to burn coal, we shall not import foreign coal, but use the massive coal reserves in this country. That is the only way to obtain security of energy supply from coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/4">When talking about the security of energy supply, perhaps we should consider what is happening with our energy companies. It is only recently that the German company E.ON Energie proposed taking over Scottish Power. I noticed in the weekend press that the Swedish state energy company, Vattenfall, is proposing a bid for Scottish and Southern Energy. If we are to consider the security of our energy supply, we should perhaps consider also the future of our energy companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.0/1">I have two speeches, and I have now created a third to try to shorten my contribution to the debate and allow other Members to get in as well. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing the debate. I was fortunate to get a similar debate at the beginning of December, in which hon. Members who are present today took part. Would that more Members than the usual suspects take part.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/2">Along with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" name="David Hamilton">my hon. Friend the Member for Midlothian (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase>, I was a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase> mentioned. The Committee produced the report on the energy needs for Scotland, and I have no doubt that the report could be easily transferred to the whole of the United Kingdom. We agreed that we should include everything in the energy mix to ensure that the needs of the people of Scotland are met, but a few members of the Committee were against nuclear energy at all costs. The hon. Member for Angus was one, and it was a sad indictment of his party. The Liberal Democrat Member, who is not present today, took the exact same position.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/3">The energy review will come up with a balanced energy policy for our energy needs, and that is the most important thing that it can do. There is also a place for coal. As far as I am aware, we in this country can have only three energy suppliers&mdash;gas, nuclear and coal. They are the main producers of energy. Although it is more than acceptable to look for new ways of creating energy, we must consider this country's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/4">The plight of the Ukrainian people and the five-fold price increase imposed by the Russians gives an example of the type of outcome that in previous discussions we were always worried could happen when 70 per cent. of our needs were made dependent on other countries. As my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North said, we must have a sustainable energy policy that is secure for the needs of the people of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/5">It is correct to mention what happened to the coal industry in the 1980s and 1990s: the industry was dismantled by a short-sighted and vindictive policy from the Conservative party. Tens of thousands of miners were put on the dole, and there were hundreds of thousands of knock-on job losses. The unemployment list, high as it was, increased manifold as a result. Those of us who were active in the trade union movement in those days well remember the collection of food and moneys for the mineworkers and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/6">We should not forget that we would be at the forefront of any new coal technology if it had not been for the then Thatcher Government. I deplore everything that they did, and I have never, ever failed to feel hatred towards that Government. The circumstances that I have mentioned are the main reasons why I feel that hatred.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/7">I should be very pleased if the Conservative Front Bench spokesman took this opportunity to apologise not only to the mineworkers and their families but to the country for what that Government did. It is important that that is put on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/8">I suggest to my hon. Friend the Minister that we seriously consider something that, again, the Conservative party did with the Board of Trade when the Department for Energy was got rid of. There is a justification now more than ever to recreate a Department of Energy with a Secretary of State who takes care of our energy needs. There is no doubt from what we have seen in Russia and Ukraine that there is a need for more than one source of energy. We must also consider how we preserve our gas reserves in the North sea and how they can be maximised for the use of the British people.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/9">I believe that many people will take part in the review and put forward their ideas about what should and should not be done, and that is absolutely right. It is important that the review and the Minister consider the needs of the nearly 60 million people in this country and not take on board some of the petty and unsustainable lies and half-truths that some opponents of coal, gas, nuclear or, in many cases, renewables have put about. The review and the Minister must seriously consider planning departments and how planning permission is given to build new energy installations, and come back to us and explain why things were done. I hope to take part in the review&mdash;I hope to make a submission&mdash;and I hope that other hon. Members will do the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> for bringing the debate to the House. Like many hon. Members present, I was part of the debate that took place previously on the Scottish Affairs Committee report. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> said, many of the recommendations in that report could be taken forward with regard to a UK position. There are differences in the market in Scotland, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the essence of the report when examining the energy review.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">I am mindful of your comments about the time remaining, Mr. Cook. The debate is about both the energy review and coal, and I would like to talk about some of the other issues relating to coal. When the comment was made about &quot;old king coal&quot;, I felt myself sliding down in my seat, because I am sometimes referred to as old king coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">With regard to the security of energy for the United Kingdom, alternative energy sources must be considered. In Scotland, hydro is about 6 per cent. of the market. Hon. Members have referred to nuclear, to renewables, including wind&mdash;wave power has not been referred to&mdash;to gas and coal and to security of energy. There was the problem that we faced at the beginning of the year. Every national newspaper carried the same headline, which was &quot;Russia turns off the gas to Europe&quot;. The issue was not just about the UK. Politicians throughout Europe did not really care about Ukraine; they were much more concerned about the pipe coming through into Europe. Many of us have been saying for many years&mdash;I do not say that with any glee&mdash;that the most important issue that we must face is Britain's dependence on sources of energy coming from abroad. That debate must take place in much more detail, and I am glad to see that there will be a debate on Thursday, although there is only a one-line Whip.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">As politicians, we must decide on the principle of whether we leave ourselves being dictated to by other countries or, indeed, whether we leave ourselves to market forces. I do not believe that either situation is acceptable to us. Or do we rely on our own resources, knowing that there will be a cost to that decision? That is important. It has been alluded to on a couple of occasions that whatever decision is made, there will be a cost factor. If we make a decision about self-reliance in the UK, there will be a cost to that, and we must bear that in mind, not only for consumers but for business and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/5">We need to consider what is happening throughout the world and especially in China, which has become the engine house of the world. According to the 2002 statistics&mdash;not the latest ones&mdash;1,393 billion tonnes of coal were produced in China. Germany is the biggest European producer, producing 207 million tonnes. The UK is right down the line again, producing only 30 million tonnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/6">It is also important to realise that several European countries produce coal, about one or two of which I was surprised. They produce coal on a greater scale than the United Kingdom does&mdash;not just Germany, but also Poland, with 161 million tonnes, Greece, with 71 million tonnes, and the Czech Republic, with 63 million tonnes. We are therefore in a market within the European network. Recognising that that is important. Britain, which has used only 15 per cent. of its coal resources, has some of the biggest reserves within Europe. At the end of the day, that we have not improved on our position is a tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/7">In many instances we are at the cutting edge of developing new coal technology, but at the same time the coal industry is on its knees. That that is happening is a contradiction in terms and, to me, ironic. We have the transport and the expertise, which we have developed along with other European countries, but at the same time we are not paying heed to our own coal industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/8">There are a number of issues that I will come on to, and one is about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the Glencoe station. The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase> said that there were objections when it went ahead. There will be. There are objections to every single thing that is proposed in relation to energy, whether that be open-cast, wind farms or tidal. There will be objections to hydro, which is very attractive in Scotland. The decision was made many years ago about hydro. Indeed, the organisation that represents renewables within Scotland has indicated that hydro could take up at least 20 per cent. of Scotland's needs, and in the renewable market it is talking in terms of 40 per cent. of Scotland's needs being met by renewables.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/9">The wider base brings in not only energy, but the Department of Trade and Industry. What about when planned applications go forward for housing and so on? Industrial units are being built to specifications with the worst common denominator. They are not built with a specification that includes ensuring that there is heat retention, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/10">I will give some examples. Midlothian council is a good example, with a housing stock of 7,500 council houses. Every such house in Midlothian has wall cavity filling, insulation in its attic and double glazing. Each house had to have all such things installed after the houses were built. Could the planning process not have been better? Building contractors agree with us. When we talk to them about planned applications, their argument is that they want a fair crack of the whip, a fair playing field, when they make applications to build houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/11">If every housing contractor across the UK was told that when they build a house they must have cavity filling, attic insulation and double glazing&mdash;to make sure that heat is retained, which in turn reduces the demand on energy&mdash;that would be very positive. We must look more at how we save energy, as much as how much we can produce energy. That issue has to be addressed much more than at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/12">A report from a debate in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has another good example from Midlothian. Please excuse me for the argument, but Midlothian boasts an area including Monkton Hall colliery, where I worked for 20-odd years. Although closed, the colliery, 3,000 ft deep as it was, is producing substantial amounts of hot water&mdash;geothermal water. An experiment in Midlothian, with &pound;3.5 million allocated from Europe, is considering how to use the geothermal water coming up from Monkton Hall to feed some 230 houses&mdash;to start with&mdash;industrial units and a primary school. There is a possibility of expanding the use of that geothermal water to some 4,000 new-build houses. I ask the Minister to come along for a meeting, and, with the council, to discuss these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/13">There are 230 ex-collieries within Scotland, two-thirds of which have the potential of using geothermal heating coming up from them. Therefore, using old collieries can take us up to the 21st century, which in turn can develop a strategy for us.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/14">I am mindful of what the Chair said and will cut short everything, because other speakers took far too long.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.2/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> for securing the debate. Our prime consideration must be to argue that coal should not only feature in the energy review, but be given a degree of prominence. Like many other Members, I am pleased that the debate about using coal has moved on and we no longer have to argue about renewables versus coal. Because of developments in clean coal technology, we can argue strongly for both. I stress that the Government should continue to press forward with their target to reduce CO2 emissions by 60 per cent. by 2050, but hopefully that can be achieved by investing in coal as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">I press the Minister to look at developments in clean coal technology and how they can be used in the UK. A number of us in this Room were at a seminar just before Christmas where the more recent developments in clean coal technology and carbon capture were outlined. It is gratifying that many UK universities are at the forefront of developing that technology. We clearly want to invest in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/3">We know that coal can be part of the environmental solution, instead of being part of the problem. We know that processes exist to remove SO <sub>2</sub> , nitrous oxide and CO2 during the electricity generation process. Coupled with modern mining methods and high energy prices worldwide, that means that we can make a powerful case for investing in a new generation of coal-fired stations, providing that the technology is in place. The National Union of Mineworkers and others make a strong case that Britain's coal reserves could contribute to our energy supply for a number of years, hence the need for long-term investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/4">It is also worth pointing out that we are not arguing for a return to the mining industry of the past, much as I celebrate that. I represent a constituency where mining has been really important and I would like mining to be part of the future of the industry in that constituency. We no longer have to produce coal tips because waste can be stored underground. Modern ventilation methods are better. Accidents still occur. We know that, tragically, from what has happened in America recently. However, there are fewer incidents. Methane gas, or mine gas, can be captured and used in electricity generation. We can also blend coal with biomass or other renewable sources, including household waste. We should be investing in the production of those renewable coal products. That should be a feature of our energy supply for the future. I am told&mdash;I do not profess to know the details&mdash;that we should be considering integrated gasification combined cycle power stations. Alongside carbon capture, that is what I press the Minister to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/5">I will conclude in the hope that there is time for another Member to speak, but it is worth emphasising that a number of us are really concerned about what happened in our constituencies during the Thatcher years. It would be very much welcomed if a Labour Government could again invest in our coal mining industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">What a challenge. The Minister will know that I am making my own contribution&mdash;I am building my house with a wood-powered boiler, solar panels and a rainwater harvesting system. I am doing my bit. When the Minister looks at the Welsh coal industry, will he return the favour? He knows my support for the UK coal industry is firmly on record. Tower colliery is facing declining reserves in its seams. There are applications for new deep mines in Wales. There is also the issue of keeping skills going in the deep mining industry. It is vital that rapid decisions are made on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/2">I also want to flag up one of the issues that was raised earlier in relation to marine and tidal energy. This is not only about south Wales and the Severn estuary, which has the second highest tidal range in the whole world; we also have the Menai straits and the Irish sea. That source of energy is massively underused and we need to do a tremendous amount on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/3">There is also a place for wind energy. There is already one wind farm in my constituency. One community has one in front of it and there is an application for another behind it. It has two more on either side of it. I do not want it to be like Custer's last stand surrounded by wind farms. We have a role to play. I have lived opposite a wind farm. I have no problems with them, but they should be in the right place and there should not be too many of them. Thank you, Mr. Cook, and do not forget Welsh coal.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.90.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="90"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew43">
	<p pid="a.90.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on introducing today's debate, on raising the wider issues of the energy review and on concentrating on the future of coal. He raised the question of our dependency on the worldwide energy market. Whatever happens and whatever the mix, we are in an interdependent world and we cannot completely hide from market forces and our trade with the rest of the world. We must therefore ensure that we maximise the stability and predictability of that trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/2">Can the Minister give us any reassurance about how market liberalisation is getting on in the rest of the European Union? One of the big distortions at present is that our market is connected&mdash;and becoming even more connected&mdash;to another market that operates under different rules. A larger market becomes a more stable market because people can predict more effectively how it will operate and how the future will pan out. They can make investment decisions based on their judgment of the commercial risks in an open and fair market in which they can have confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/3">I must declare my entry in the Register of Members' Interests: I am a shareholder in Shell. Coal has played a major part in building the UK economy. As many hon. Members have pointed out, there are major reserves of coal, so the potential is there. As has been outlined, however, the environmental impact of coal still holds it back from playing its part as an energy source in this country. I think in particular of climate change. We understand more how our world is affected by the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, and how we must meet the challenge of reducing our emissions, not only at home but around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/4">Clean coal technology shows how coal can play its part without doing any environmental damage. The ultimate goal must be carbon capture and storage. In previous debates, we have talked about the excitement of the Miller project in the North sea, where we are getting much closer to seeing the full cycle of capturing the carbon, producing the electricity and returning the CO <sub>2</sub> under the North sea, rather than letting it out into the atmosphere, with the added benefit of enhancing oil recovery in the process. There is a virtuous circle in making that process work.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/5">The Government have announced carbon abatement grants and a carbon abatement strategy. Can the Minister give us more details of how those grants will operate and how people will access them? If those grants are available and the details are out there, people can understand how best to make use of them. We could help to take carbon capture and storage forward if carbon credits were allowed under the emission trading system. Again, can the Minister tell us how that is developing and what the potential is?</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/6">The Miller project is able to take place because the CO <sub>2</sub> that is put in the North sea is used as an agent to recover more oil. Obviously, in the longer term, the discussion is about possibly storing CO <sub>2</sub> in exhausted and redundant fields. There we have the concern that the OSPAR and London conventions restrict the disposal of CO <sub>2</sub> under the North sea. People have talked about a long time scale for the development of that technology. The reality is that changing arrangements such as OSPAR takes a long time, too. It would be good to hear what initiatives the Government are already taking to ensure that conventions will not stand in the way of disposal of CO <sub>2</sub> under the North sea if we can prove the technology is successful and we want to make full use of it. That major resource, which we have developed through our oil and gas exploration and production, could now provide an added benefit. Using it to dispose of CO <sub>2</sub> could benefit coal and other energy sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/7">This debate is part of a wider climate change debate. In response to a debate initiated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase>, the Minister stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/8" class="indent">&quot;the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has also initiated a climate change review that will report by the end of the year.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-12">12 October 2005</phrase>; Vol. 437, c. 416.]</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/9">That was last year. Perhaps the Minister can update us as to whether the DEFRA report will finally appear at the end of this year or, I hope, earlier in the year. Obviously, people need to know how environmental impacts fit together.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/10">Blending coal with biomass has been raised. Perhaps the Minister could explain why the biomass that can be used in the blending process with coal is restricted to only 15 per cent. Again, a bit more flexibility could reduce the environmental impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/11">The hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North made an important point about the jobs that will be available in the renewable and marine sectors. This country has engineering skills and experience from working in the marine environment that would be eminently exploitable if we were to allow marine technologies such as wave and tidal to take off. There is great potential to transfer the skills that we have learned through all the other work that we have done in the North sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/12">It was somewhat perverse of the Government, who deal with security issues, to turn their back on the resources that we have in this country. There was considerable disappointment with the Chancellor's approach to North sea oil taxation. His pre-Budget report created concern among investors that he is changing the fiscal regime. The big picture is that he is frightening away investment at a time when we seek to maximise the production of gas in the North sea, and that seems a perverse strategy. Has the Minister had a chance to review the studies that show how marginal the gas-gathering pipeline networks for the west of Shetland are, and to consider whether the tariffs on the use of the pipeline infrastructure will tip them the wrong way?</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/13">If we are to make full use of carbon storage in the North sea, the pipelines and infrastructure are important. Obviously, some of us who look at the big picture want the Chancellor to change the tax regime back to a more attractive one for investment. Have the Government considered in detail the impact of the tariffs on the use of infrastructure? Maintaining a core infrastructure of pipelines and production networks in the North sea allows the more marginal and newer discoveries to be exploited and would also allow carbon to be reinjected. It is crucial that full use can be made of them, so putting a tax on something that we want to incentivise seems somewhat perverse. Can the Minister give some assurance that the Government will reconsider that?</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/14">I want to finish by saying again that coal played a great part in the UK's economic development. It is facing the challenge of its environmental impact. If we can tackle that issue, coal will have a role to play in supporting the UK's future energy economy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.92.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="92"  time="10:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew44">
	<p pid="a.92.0/1">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this debate. As he said, it is timely, given what happened during the Christmas and new year period. I also want to thank him for the balanced way in which he introduced the debate. He raised a tremendous number of important issues, and his approach has characterised the whole of the debate this morning. We have had an opportunity to consider the important role that coal can play within the wider policy of the energy review.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that we need balanced energy provision, and I broadly agree with the mix that he proposed. Of course, we all support greater use of renewables, but, as was made clear by several hon. Members, they are not without environmental consequences as well. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the hon. Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> said, there are considerable environmental concerns about wind power provision on land. That was brought home to me recently when I went to Switzerland. I drove out through Germany and came back through France. Throughout Germany, there is a tremendous reliance on wind power, but there is none at all in France. What strikes one is the environmental impact of row after row of wind turbines on an otherwise beautiful landscape. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase> reminded us, even hydropower, which in the security of the south-east we think of as an extraordinarily valuable means of energy provision in Scotland, is not without its environmental consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">We have seen a huge amount of balance in this debate, and I hope that the energy review will focus on that need for balance, and not allow the country to become over-reliant on any single source of energy. The hon. Member for Angus also made a valid point that we must ensure that we do not end up depending on imported energy supplies. The debate has shown the degree of expertise that exists in the House on these matters, and I hope that, during the energy review, the Minister will use that expertise and not simply rely on external expertise. If all of us can be as brief and concise as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase>, this House would operate in a better way. If, in one and a quarter minutes, hon. Members can make points that are pertinent both to the energy review and to their constituency, that is a lesson for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">In recent years, we have seen a dramatic reduction in the use of coal. In 1950, almost all the primary fuel used was coal, but in 2000 only 15 per cent. was used, the majority being oil and gas. We are also seeing a continuing decline in the provision of coal from within <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">the United Kingdom. The hon. Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> commented about how that decline happened under a Conservative Government. However, he has turned his mind away from how that decline has continued under his own Government. Since 1997, the number of mines in this country has dropped from 22 to 13, and the number of miners has dropped from 14,000 to 5,000. Coal output has halved from just under 50 million tonnes to just over 25 million tonnes.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that when the industry was privatised in 1994 it was beyond its critical mass. It was in a failed market and depended on Government support. The industry's decline was inevitable, but it was built into the privatisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">I understand where the hon. Gentleman is coming from. The point that I was seeking to make is that it has been a long-term decline which has not been reversed under this Government. Our reliance on imported coal has doubled over the last eight years, from 19 million tonnes in 1997 to about 36 million tonnes now. It is not a short-term phenomenon that only happened in the 1980s; it has been happening for over 30 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.3/1">I am not going down that route. The Conservative party may be going through a process of evolution at the moment, but I am certain that we are not going to go down the route of renationalising the means of production of energy, as the hon. Gentleman suggests.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.3/2">In introducing the energy review, the Prime Minister said that by around 2020 the UK is likely to have seen decommissioning of coal and nuclear power plants that generate together over 30 per cent. of today's electricity supply. It is clear that if decisions to invest in new coal-powered power stations are not taken soon, the future role of coal will decline further.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.3/3">It has become evident in today's debate that there is scope for a renaissance of coal as a result of new technological advances. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">my hon. Friends the Members for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> and for Castle Point (Bob Spink) set out, it is a sector in which the United Kingdom can become a world leader. There has been some discussion about carbon capture and storage, whereby carbon dioxide emissions are captured and can be kept safely. There are creative and imaginative ways in which that can be done. For many years, pure carbon dioxide has been captured and used in the food processing and chemical industries. To make that more effective, we need huge opportunities for storage. About 500 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year is produced and that requires imaginative new ways of considering the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" name="Robert Smith">The approach that the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> has talked about&mdash;storage in the North sea&mdash;would allow us to do something dramatic and novel. It is encouraging that British companies are in the lead in the use of that global technology. As he explained, additional benefits arise from that, such as improved methane extraction from the oilfields. Enhanced oil recovery, if achievable, will start to make carbon capture more economic.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.3/5">However, there is the risk that international treaties will make that process more difficult. Will the Minister clarify the legal situation as to whether the injection of carbon dioxide into the sea bed for storage will be permitted, even when it is not linked to enhanced oil recovery? A distinction is drawn in the international treaties between those two approaches, and if we cannot put it there for storage, that approach could be made more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.3/6">There is a tremendous, once in a lifetime opportunity to get decisions right in order to have a balanced energy policy that makes use of the natural advantages this country has in energy supply and other provision. We can take the lead in conservation and encourage new technologies where the UK can be a world leader. Without doubt, coal has an important part to play in that process. We wish to work with the Minister during the energy review, on a cross-party basis, to ensure that we take the right decisions. We want to examine what is right in the long term for this country in terms of provision and conservation and we hope to work with the Minister in that process.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.1/1">If one wants to have a balanced energy policy, certain aspects of it will require financial support from the Exchequer. We recognise that in order for renewables to make good progress, public funding will have to be involved. At this stage, we have not reached a conclusion&mdash;that is what we shall do during the energy review&mdash;but we do not rule out the need for Government investment in those areas to ensure a balanced provision. I hope that we can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are considering the matter in relation to the long-term needs of the country and starting with a fresh sheet of paper to ensure that we take the right decisions. After an interesting debate, we all look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is the latest in what is now a short series of recent debates. For some reason I was not invited to the Scottish debate&mdash;I am not sure why&mdash;but I remember a serious discussion in Westminster Hall.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">I am struck by the fact that, while the prime focus has understandably been coal, we have debated the matter in the wider context of other energy sources and technologies, not least carbon capture and storage. We are examining those international treaties, which were designed to prevent dumping in our seas, and we are confident that we can get satisfactory outcomes. Other nations, including Norway, have an interest in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/3">We have discussed the matter in that context, and in the context of what the United Kingdom's strategic energy objectives should be, which must be a part of the debate in the energy review. We have considered the matter in a global context. As has been noted, the new year was barely struggling into its early seconds and minutes before we had the serious dispute between Russia and Ukraine, which has now, I hope, been happily resolved. Perhaps we should delete the word &quot;happily&quot;: it has now been resolved, at least in the short term. That reminds us of the global context and the important geopolitical and national security dimensions, which have come to the fore not only here but in other nations, and even since the White Paper of 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/4">We have had an important debate. Again, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North. I shall not refer to every contribution as it would take too long, although I too was struck by the one-minute dash, without gas, by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase>. It was a model; it was energetic, yet energy efficient. Given his use of both brain and heart, it gave us an example of combined heat and power that we will remember for at least a few more minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/5">The House will be aware that the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry have asked me to lead a review of UK energy policy and to bring forward policy proposals by the middle of the year. Things have changed since 2003. North sea gas reserves have declined faster than many experts anticipated, and we know about the projected decline in nuclear power. We became a net importer of gas in 2004, and in a few years we will become a net importer of oil.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/6">There have been other changes beyond our borders. I was asked about the slower than expected liberalisation in the European Union, as it has exposed us to higher, more volatile prices. We made some headway under our presidency at the Energy Council of Ministers in Brussels just before Christmas. The Commission is determined to press forward with that liberalisation, but there is still a long way to go. Even more internationally, China is already the world's second largest consumer of energy, and reports suggest that it has just overtaken the UK to become the world's fourth largest economy. It is truly an international problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/7">We must learn from those developments, and from events so far this winter, both here and overseas. At the headline level, we need to answer a number of important questions. How do we ensure affordable energy in the future? How do we deliver a 60 per cent. reduction in carbon? That reduction was mentioned earlier, and we remain committed to it. How do we manage our reliance on imported gas, and what are the implications?</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/8">In a nutshell, how can we create and maintain a fully functioning market that provides secure, affordable and clean energy? I take the point about affordable energy for the poorest and eldest in our communities. Those are big questions. They raise vital and complex issues, and there are important and intricate links between the decisions that we make on coal and other fuel sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/9">Some assumptions have been made about the outcome of the review, but it is not about finding one solution to all those challenges&mdash;a theme that was echoed today. Hon. Members recognise that, despite the fact that enthusiasts from various quarters think the whole answer is this or that, we are talking not about where 20 per cent. or 30 per cent. of our energy supply will come from but about 100 per cent. of our energy supply. We recognise the need for diversity. There is no one solution. There is no silver bullet. There is no uranium bullet. With respect, there is no coal bullet.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/10">Renewables has been a theme of the debate, as has strategic support for renewables&mdash;although not necessarily in one's own constituency. That, of course, is one of the dilemmas when considering the investment that is needed. Renewables are important. We have a renewables obligation, with a 10 per cent. target of our electricity coming from renewables by 2010, and the aspiration that it will be doubled to 20 per cent. by 2020. I do not come to the review renewables-neutral; I am an enthusiast for renewables.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.0/1">On that point, does the Minister accept that, with his Department's support, MPs could be a useful tool during the energy review, becoming involved in confronting the renewables issues with their constituents? I am very pro-renewables, but one has to deal with them in the full light of day, putting the hard facts before one's constituents. The Minister and his Department could be a great help in putting forward those arguments.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.96.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1523" speakername="Malcolm Wicks" colnum="96"  time="10:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew52">
	<p pid="a.96.1/1">That is an important point. It is not that the whole answer is blowing in the wind; but some of it is, and we are also developing other technologies. MPs can play a role. Indeed, I would go further: when we publish the consultation document on the energy review, which I expect to be later this month, I hope that hon. Members on both sides of the House will help to lead a well-informed debate in their constituencies. There has to be a public debate, and renewables are a part of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/2">I can promise that the medium and long-term role of coal and its potential contribution to secure energy supplies is an important consideration in the review. For coal to have a future, it must be used much more cleanly than it is now, with significantly lower emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/3">We have therefore developed the carbon abatement technology strategy to develop mechanisms such as research and development support, which will encourage the development of more efficient coal-fired plants, the use of coal with biomass and eventually the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. The latter technology has the potential to eliminate up to 95 per cent. of CO <sub>2</sub> emissions from coal use, not only in power generation but in other industrial processes. However, the review will be investigating ways we might encourage generators to deploy all these important technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/4">The Chancellor has set aside &pound;35 million of Government grant aid for the demonstration of carbon abatement technologies, which will be made available from April 2006 and will last about four years. My officials are working up a scheme for supporting those demonstrations and we plan to announce it by March, with a call for proposals to follow. I hope that my hon. Friends can see that we are providing serious support to enable coal to have a future in a sustainable world.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/5">On coal production in the UK, the Government has paid out almost &pound;37 million in coal investment aid and expects mine operators to draw down most of the balance of their awards during the first half of 2006. That investment aid, and about &pound;160 million of UK coal operating aid, helped mines such as Thoresby, Kellingley and Daw Mill to maintain the investment they needed to keep them in production through the difficult early years of this decade. It was a relief to see the latest output figures, which show production at the remaining deep mines up almost 5 per cent. in the three months to the end of November compared to the same period last year. The outcome reflects the commitment of Government, management and, of course, the work force alike. However, as we know, there has been an overall decline in home production and an increase in imports&mdash;up 16 per cent. in the first nine months of 2005 compared to the same period a year previously. That compares with the latest figures of just under 18 million tonnes of UK production.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/6">The continuing rise in imports highlights the availability of coal on world markets. The UK has unworked reserves of coal, in shallows and at depth, but with reliable, competitively priced supplies from South Africa, Colombia, Poland and elsewhere, many coal customers are choosing to import, which is the reality that we have to grapple with.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/7">I said in a debate in Westminster Hall&mdash;back in those historic days when it was functioning as a modern debating chamber&mdash;that the time was right to take a new look at the UK coal industry and to consider how best to create a climate in which to attract the long-term investment needed to secure its future. The future of coal in meeting our energy policy goals in the medium and long term will be an important part of our review of energy policy. That is the right context in which to consider the matter. We are considering the proposal on Haworth colliery and I will respond to the company in the very near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/8">The work on the energy review has now started, and I assure hon. Members that the views they expressed today and, indeed, the views I want them to discuss in the coming months with their constituents, will be taken into account as it continues over the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.1/9">Again, I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North for securing what has been a lively and energetic debate&mdash;pun intended&mdash;and hon. Members for their considered contributions to it. I wish you, Mr. Cook, albeit late, a very happy new year.</p>

	Private Sewers
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.98.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="98"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h02.htm#60111h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.98.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the problems associated with private sewers. This is an important matter, particularly for those facing problems, and has a long history but, until recent years, has not had much attention. Perhaps it has been a case of out of sight, out of mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/2">I commend the Government for what they have achieved and particularly the Minister for his help over many years. However, I am concerned about the delays in making announcements on the way forward. The timetable for decision making has slipped and that underlies this debate. I want to press the Minister on what issues remain to be resolved, when definitive policy announcements will be made and, most importantly, when we will begin to tackle the problems on and under the ground.Most Members will know about these problems from their constituency work, and I am delighted to have <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the support of my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/3">I have been associated with the problem for about 10 years and I am grateful to Newark and Sherwood district council, and particularly to one of its environmental health officers, Jeremy Hutchinson, who has provided a great deal of help and support. The council estimates that about 1,500 properties are involved in its area alone. I believe that that is an underestimate because we know the scale of the problems only when they arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/4">I shall talk about three real and current problems in the Sherwood constituency. First, in Branston avenue, Farnsfield householders discovered in the autumn that their sewers had become blocked and sewage was being discharged on to gardens. The first that they knew about private sewers was when they began to explore the problem. They were horrified when they realised that they were responsible for repairs, and there is a profound argument in Farnsfield about who is responsible for the collapse of the sewer. The residents believe strongly that a new school&mdash;St. Michael's school&mdash;and the heavy traffic involved when it was being built or the utility companies making connections to the school have caused the problem. They pointed out that they had no problems for 40 years until the new construction. Not surprisingly, the school, the diocese and its contractors deny all responsibility and there is no causal link at this point. While we are debating the matter, contractors are digging the ground. I take the strong view that if the construction of the school has contributed to the problem, the school and the diocese, not the residents, should accept the cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/5">At the moment, the residents are buying a pig in a poke. Newark and Sherwood council has issued notices, the contractor is on site and the repairs will be done. The householders may be charged, but they do not know what the cost might be. They are mainly elderly people and the situation is most unsatisfactory for them. They would like it to be resolved quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/6">Secondly, there are also problems in Hardwick drive, Ollerton. It is a nice estate and a nice place to live. The estate has been built for 40 years and the developer never put the sewers forward for adoption. There are long-standing problems on the estate and, again, Newark and Sherwood council has issued notices. The cost of the repair will probably be about &pound;1,000. The repair will sort out a small gap, a leakage and a rodent problem, and I expect that the householders will be charged about &pound;25 a house. That is not a great deal of money, but the problem does not stop there. It is a long-standing problem. The repair will be done but Severn Trent will not adopt the sewers and so there will be problems in future until policy decisions have been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/7">At Reynolds way in Calverton, residents have had to pay much more. In this case, Gedling borough council issued notices and major work has been done at substantial cost to the individual householders. Some, but not all, have been able to claim against their insurance. That has been a major piece of engineering work, but with all the work that has taken place, and despite much discussion, Severn Trent has decided not to adopt the sewer. It argued that the sewer is not up to adoptable standard. Most particularly, the company is not prepared to adopt because part of the system runs under a private household and is not on the highway.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/8">There are further problems looming at Reynolds way in Calverton because a planning application has been made for major residential development on adjoining land. Gedling borough council and Severn Trent were unaware of problems with the sewers, and it has taken a great deal of argument from the residents, supported by myself, to establish that one of the issues in determining a planning application should be that of flooding and sewage disposal. Unless serious thought is given to the planning application, there will be increased problems at Reynolds way.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/9">These are profoundly unsatisfactory situations for the householders involved. I am pleased to say that the Government are mindful of the issue, have recognised it and are taking action. A considerable amount of action is taking place. First, there has been some welcome research from WS Atkins, which, for the first time, has given indications&mdash;not definitive ones&mdash;of the scale of the problem. I was surprised&mdash;I think most were&mdash;when the Atkins report suggested that up to 50 per cent. of all households in one way or another could be connected to private sewers. Atkins went further and made a number of recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/10">The second area in which the Government have made significant progress is in putting out those options for consultation. The overwhelming, rather than unanimous, view is that water companies and sewage undertakers should take responsibility for the sewers over a period to bring them up to standard. Of course, there are issues connected to that, particularly cost and timetables and the division between residential properties and commercial decisions. I understand that there are problems, but I know from the discussions in the consultation that the Minister is mindful that this is the preferred way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/11">Thirdly, the Minister convened and spoke at the opening of a seminar with stakeholders on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-26">26 January 2005</phrase> about possible ways forward. I was at the seminar. It was lively. There was a good debate, acknowledgement of the problem and a resolve that we needed to make progress. In parallel to all that, the Government have taken other action. The Minister&mdash;in this Room, I think&mdash;accepted and refined amendments to what became the Water Act 2003, which gives the Secretary of State the opportunity to introduce a scheme by secondary regulation for the adoption of private sewers. We have a legislative peg to help us make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.1/12">Importantly, too, the all-party parliamentary group on sewers has been set up. I do get some jobs: I am the chairman of the group and 105 MPs are involved. Residents' associations and all the interested parties in the sewerage industry are also involved. It is a lively group that is keen to make progress. It recognises that it needs to have good relationships with the Minister and his officials, and those exist. I am pleased to be able to thank Frank Jones from the Plastic Pipes Group, who acts as secretary to the group.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on holding this important debate. He has already alluded to its scale. He has complimented the Department on the great strides that it has taken to clarify the matter and lay out the options, none of which is without pain. Does not he agree, however, that many residents, including hundreds who are affected on the Sarn estate in my constituency, are looking for a way forward, even if it is painful? They want to be able to say: &quot;We can get out of this mess. Even if it is over a period of years, we know the way forward.&quot; That is what we are looking for.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.100.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="100"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h02.htm#60111h02_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.100.1/1">My hon. Friend has picked up the main thrust of the debate. That is what I am pressing the Government to do: to make an announcement, if not today, certainly soon, about the way forward. There are problems associated with any way forward, but I know the Minister, and I know that his officials are aware of the problems and are determined to take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.1/2">One area in which action has been taken is on the new protocol adopted in April 2002 to deal with new sewers. The notion is that if new houses are built to adoptable standards, there will be no problems in future. Again, the Government have been careful about that approach, and they have asked WS Atkins to consider how successful the protocol has been. I was astonished to read in the Atkins report that only 1 per cent. of new houses are being built with sewers to adoptable standards. The report gives a variety of reasons for that, but its conclusion must be that when building new houses, mandatory steps must be taken to put the protocol in place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.100.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" speakername="David Drew" colnum="100"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h02.htm#60111h02_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.100.2/1">I apologise for missing the first few minutes of what my hon. Friend has said, and we commend him on bringing this matter to the notice of the House. Does he agree that as well as installing traditional sewers, water companies must be encouraged to consider soft technology solutions as one way forward? Does he agree that there have to be other options?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.100.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="100"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h02.htm#60111h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.100.3/1">My hon. Friend takes a great interest in the matter, and in rural areas the notion of reed beds may be one way forward. Severn Trent Water has undertaken some work on it, but unfortunately, it seems to have come to an end. Different steps will need to be taken in different areas, and I am keen to press the Minister to consider the use of building regulations, particularly part H, to ensure that new houses are built with sewers up to adoptable standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/2">I want to make two further points from the industry. First, although there is a code of practice for developers on the design and construction of new sewers for adoption, it is beset by several different appendices in different parts of the country. It would make sense to have a universal approach throughout the country to the laying down of sewers. Secondly, it would make sense to have a workforce that was able to do the work. The industry has been pressing for the energy and utility sector skills council to be tasked with producing appropriate NVQs in those areas. I should like the Minister to consider those practical proposals and solutions from the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/3">It is clear that the Government have achieved a great deal. Much research has been undertaken, more work is in hand and consultation has been successful; but my central concern that underlines the debate is the need for an established decision-making timetable, and to keep to it. In October 2004, Ministers announced that a decision would be made in spring 2005, but the timetable was extended to autumn 2005. In a recent parliamentary answer, the Minister stated that the Government expected to publish a decision on transfer in the new year that would not rule out further consultation on the options for implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/4">Happy new year. New year 2006 has come. It is almost a year since the seminar that I mentioned earlier. Important discussions are continuing between players such as Ofwat, WaterVoice and Water UK. For me, the way is absolutely clear: I want water companies to be able to adopt the majority of the sewers. I know that there are problems associated with that, but it is the appropriate way to resolve the issue. There will be costs, but the cost per householder of a levy across all water users would be less than the cost of private sewers.</p>
	<p pid="a.100.3/5">I am confident that progress has been made, and I have been delighted with the help of the Minister and his Department. However, I want from him today a firm announcement about the timetable for the adoption of private sewers. Unless we take that approach, there will be dismay across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.0/1">I join my colleagues in wishing you all the best for the new year, Mr. Cook.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" name="Paddy Tipping">my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the thoughtful and constructive way in which he presented what are, as he knows, complex arguments and real issues. I would like to express my appreciation for the work of the all-party group on sewers and sewerage, which had a major input in developing options to address the problems caused by private sewers and lateral drains.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/3">My hon. Friend rightly stated that the Government accept that there is a problem that must be addressed. He also pointed out that there are no simple options. Alternatives for addressing the issues are what we need to deal with at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/4">My hon. Friend said that a great deal of progress has been made to ensure that sewers in new build are built to adoptable standards and that we avoid the problems of the past. That has been done, and it has been effective. A new protocol has been introduced for the construction of new sewers. In fact, we are considering whether it should be made mandatory, as recommended by the Atkins report. I am pleased that it will be referred to in the reprinted building regulations and the upcoming review. That is the first stage in preventing such problems from developing in the future, and we have addressed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/5">As my hon. Friend rightly said, we have taken the necessary powers under the Water Act 2003 to give us flexibility for implementing whatever option we decide on. That is part of the second stage, which involves dealing with the existing private sewers&mdash;the legacy of the past&mdash;and the problems that they present. He mentioned the Atkins report. Like him, I was surprised by the high percentage of sewers identified as being in private ownership. There has been extensive consultation, including the stakeholder conference in January 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/6">My hon. Friend asks, where do we go now, what progress has been made, where are we? Obviously, we must address the questions that came out of the seminar and the consultation about the scope of any transfer, the form that it might take, costs and funding, which, of course, are significant issues, the impact on the drain repair and insurance industries, and public expectation. Those are the key questions that we need to look at. If we decide that transfer is the best way forward, we have those enabling powers. We also need to ensure that we have the maximum input from the various stakeholders who are affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.0/7">WaterVoice, which is now the Consumer Council for Water, felt that there was a need for further work to gauge customers' views. That is not an unreasonable request. To address that, DEFRA has been overseeing qualitative customer research which has examined customers' views on current ownership, and possible transfer. It comprises 20 focus groups&mdash;two in each of the water and sewerage company areas&mdash;and was completed in August 2005. DEFRA was closely supported by the Consumer Council for Water and we also received input from the Office of Water Service, which is another key player in this.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.0/1">On a technical point, can the Minister confirm that that consultation included the relevant agencies in Wales?</p>

	<p pid="a.102.1/1">My understanding is that it did. We are looking at England and Wales in relation to these measures. It will perhaps come as no surprise to my hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood that the outcome of those consultations was that the focus groups believed that current ownership arrangements were unfair, inconsistent, complicated and untenable. The majority also believed that private sewers and laterals should be transferred to the water and sewerage companies, reinforcing the support for that option expressed in other responses. The full report and the findings of the survey are available on the DEFRA website.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/2">We need to look at the scope for and the form of the transfer, what the costs will be, the funding, the impact on industry and public expectations. None of those are straightforward issues. I share my hon. Friend's frustration that the wheels and machinery of Government appear on occasion to turn very slowly. I am as frustrated as he is. In fairness, my officials have done an excellent job in trying to pull together all these very difficult issues. Should private sewers, serving local authority owned commercial and industrial premises, be classed in the same way? That is a significant question that is complicated by the fact that some commercial sewers also serve domestic properties. Excluding some sewers might result in a piecemeal transfer leaving pockets of private sewers, thereby not securing effective and integrated management of the network as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/3">The real options are overnight transfer&mdash;the whole lot moved into the ownership of the water and sewerage companies&mdash;or phased transfer, which could have the benefits of reducing the cost impact. If we go for phased transfer, do we encourage a voluntary approach or do we go for a compulsory approach? There are pros and cons for each option. While an overnight transfer would immediately resolve anxiety for private sewer owners and provide clarity for business, it might still take a considerable time as the companies work their way through the problems of the private sewers.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.1/4">Whatever option is taken, we must be open and honest with people that in some cases it may be some years before there are solutions. We are talking of situations where nothing has happened for decades. Even if people expect that there will not be overnight solutions, if there is a potential solution, it will certainly be an improvement on the current situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that one of the issues that I encounter in my constituency&mdash;I think that this happens throughout the UK&mdash;is that, because we are now decades into some of these ancient private sewer issues, an increasing number of residents will make complaints? While I fully appreciate what his Department has done and what he says about the complexities, there will be an increasing urgency to move forward on this matter.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.103.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="103"  time="11:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h02.htm#60111h02_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.103.1/1">I accept that. People suffer from problems with the sewage network. I well understand that there are real difficulties, which are likely to get worse rather than better the longer they are left.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/2">Those are the considerations that we need to think about: overnight transfer, phased transfer, and whether phased transfer helps with the costs. All are important considerations. Ofwat has a major interest because of the impact on consumer bills. The last price round was a significant increase for many consumers, because of major works that are still being undertaken.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.103.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" colnum="103"  time="11:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h02.htm#60111h02_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.103.2/1">Is it not the case that the consumer research&mdash;the focus group that the Minister referred to&mdash;addresses the problem and that the generality of view was that people were prepared to look at a levy?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.103.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1805" speakername="Elliot Morley" colnum="103"  time="11:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h02.htm#60111h02_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.103.3/1">Yes. Another question is whether the people affected would consider the option of a levy. Again, there are pros and cons. Some of the advantages are outweighed by the technical issues of applying the levy&mdash;the collection and costs. All the issues have to be weighed up.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/2">My hon. Friend might like to know that Ofwat's research estimated that the impact on the average bill would be between &pound;3 and &pound;6 per annum for the highest cost option and between &pound;1 and &pound;2 for the lowest cost option. Those are within a range that is not unreasonable. The crucial issue before us is that, whatever step we, the Government, take next, we will have to produce a regulatory impact assessment. That is right. The assessment will look at the options, costs and of course benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/3">My officials are well into the process of drafting two RIAs. The first is to accompany the Government's decision on the transfer of private sewers and laterals to water and sewage companies, if that is the step we take. The second is a partial RIA to accompany the public consultation on implementation options that will be taken forward if the decision to transfer is made by the Government. That looks at the burden on the industry, which is an important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/4">A competition assessment and a small firms impact test have already been undertaken as part of the RIA process. That work, which is a crucial precondition of the decision the Government will make, is well established. The object at the beginning of the review was to alleviate the anxiety and distress caused to householders who suffer from some of those problems, which I know well and which have been clearly highlighted by the all-party group. I thank Ofwat, Water UK, the Consumer Council for Water, the all-party group and other stakeholders, which have been very much involved in and have assisted the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/5">While I cannot give an exact time scale for the announcement, I can say to my hon. Friend that Ministers across Government will soon be in a position to weigh up the costs and benefits of transfer and to make a decision. I want to see that done as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/6">I also appreciated the point about skill training. I welcome proposals from the industry. It is essential to have proper qualifications and skilled work force and companies&mdash;both the water companies and small companies can do that kind of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/7">In relation to the particular constituency issue that my hon. Friend mentioned, I understand that the work he referred to will start tomorrow. I certainly hope that that resolves the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.3/8">In conclusion, we are not too far away from an announcement. I know that my hon. Friend and others have worked hard and long on the issue. Although an announcement will not solve the problem overnight, I hope that what will be clear is that there is a solution in the offing for those people who have suffered from the problem for many years.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.0/1">It is a pleasure once again to serve under your chairmanship in Westminster Hall, Mr. Cook.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/2">I am very grateful that this important topic has been selected for debate today, because the future of the rural post office network is vital to rural communities, not only in my constituency, but throughout the highlands and islands of Scotland and the length and breadth of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/3">As the Minister knows, I requested the debate after his answer to my question to him during Trade and Industry questions on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>, which led me to have real concerns about the Government's intentions for the future of the rural post office network. What is the Government's commitment to the network, and are they willing to consider more broadly how its value should be assessed? That assessment should not simply be a crude financial one; it should consider much more broadly the social and economic value of the rural post office network.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/4">The Minister's answer followed Postcomm's advice, which was published earlier this year after requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">my hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>. That advice on what should be the future of the rural post office network called, in effect, for a rural reinvention scheme to mirror the urban reinvention scheme that has already taken place. It postulated that some 1,600 rural post offices should be closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/5">How should we assess the Government's record on post offices so far? To be fair, the social network payment of &pound;150 million a year to support the rural post office network is a significant item on the credit side, and is worth noting. On the other hand, of course, it is equally worth pointing out that that is due to run out at the end of March 2008, subject to the funding for the period 2006 to 2008 securing the appropriate European Union clearance. Perhaps the Minister will mention that in his response.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/6">Furthermore, Post Office Ltd has a duty to prevent avoidable closures of post offices in rural areas. That requirement, too, expires at the end of March 2006, and the Government have yet to say whether it will be extended or what will take its place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.105.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" speakername="Philip Hollobone" colnum="105"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.105.1/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate, which, as he rightly says, is relevant up and down the country. I draw his attention to Naseby post office in my constituency, which closed as a result of an armed robbery. Mr. Steane of the local &quot;The Fitzgerald Arms&quot; wanted to reopen it, but the Post Office has refused him leave to do so. I do not believe that avoidable closures are being dealt with as the Government say they should be.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.2/1">I am very grateful for that intervention. The point is that, as well as preventing avoidable closures, we should also consider reopenings, where appropriate.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.105.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" speakername="Peter Bone" colnum="105"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.105.3/1">On the very same point, my office received a note from the Post Office only five minutes ago telling me that the post office in the village of Isham in my constituency, the only post office for miles around, is now to be considered permanently closed. There seems to be a difference between what is being said and what is actually happening.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.106.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="106"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.106.0/1">I am grateful for that intervention, which again serves to underline the point that despite the duty to prevent avoidable closures, there are closures. Indeed, they number some 100 a year, and are gradually eroding the breadth of the rural post office network. That in itself is a significant concern.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.106.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="106"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.106.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman believe that the Post Office needs to be imaginative about its network, particularly in rural areas? I suspect that there are few villages without a pub. Rural post offices may have been closed, but is it not time that the Post Office started actively to consider how many pubs in rural areas could double up as post offices? Some already do, including &quot;The Eagle and Child&quot; in Hurst Green; the post office there was closed but it has been reinvented in the pub. That is the sort of reinvention that we want to see; we want openings in rural areas, not closures.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.106.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" speakername="Frank Cook" colnum="106"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.106.2/1">Order. I am not in the business of encouraging bad habits. As I am partially deaf, and because <i>Hansard</i> writers have to hear precisely what is being said, I would appreciate it if hon. Members directed themselves to the Chair and to the microphones.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.106.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="106"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.106.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Cook. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. The point about imagination is important and I shall return to it later. As for the duty to prevent the avoidable closure of rural post offices, I would be grateful if the Minister spelled out what the position will be beyond March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/2">On the downside when assessing the Government's record on post offices is the urban reinvention scheme&mdash;a title that conceals more than it reveals. In effect, the scheme closed a substantial number, several thousands, of post offices in cities throughout the country. In my constituency, three post offices in Inverness were closed under that scheme. All those who passed the main post office in Inverness during the run-up to Christmas will have seen queues stretching out on to the streets, with people having to wait for 40 or 45 minutes; they will have seen at first hand the consequences of those closures and the additional pressure brought to bear on the post offices that remain. That scheme was by no means a unalloyed benefit&mdash;I see hon. Members nodding. It significantly eroded the post office network.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.3/3">Another major issue is the direct payment of benefits. People who used to collect their pension from the post office using their pension book have been encouraged, or even persuaded through aggressive telephone sales campaigns, to switch to having their pension paid into their bank account.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.106.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" speakername="John Thurso" colnum="106"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.106.4/1">Does not my hon. Friend think that it is particularly regrettable, given the lack of footfall that that decision has caused post offices, that the Government did not look creatively at the delivery of their own services, perhaps using post offices to deliver those services?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.107.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="107"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.107.0/1">I am grateful for that intervention. The point is very sensible. A much more innovative consideration of what Government services could be delivered through the rural post office network would help increase the footfall&mdash;the number of customers coming to post offices for a variety of services. I intend later to suggest some of the services that could be extended to rural post offices to help sustain the network. Direct payments is one.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.0/2">It is important to understand why rural post offices are so important. Put simply, they are the heart of our rural communities. At the end of June 2005, there were 8,001 rural post offices in the UK, of which 1,144 were in Scotland; 170 of those were in the Highland council area within which lies my constituency. The rural network currently serves about 12 million customers, and provides communities with about 170 products, including, in some places but not all, new services such as mobile phone top-ups and foreign currency exchange. Indeed, over two thirds of villages with populations of between 500 and 1,000 have a post office.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.107.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="107"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.107.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. It gives us the chance to emphasise again to the Minister that in many villages the post office is the last available public service, and the last point of contact for public services generally. That is why the Government should be obliged to come forward with a safety net&mdash;one that will keep those services going&mdash;especially given that their decision on direct payments created the crisis in the first place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.107.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" speakername="Danny Alexander" colnum="107"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.107.2/1">I agree. One example of such a post office, which is the only remaining public service in the community, is in the village of Foyers, in my constituency, between Fort Augustus and Inverness on the banks of Loch Ness. Through creative and sensible business practices, opening a caf&eacute; and shop alongside the post office, the post office has been maintained, but the income generated through it is vital to ensure that all those services can continue in that village. There will be hundreds or thousands of similar examples up and down the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/2">The public view is that the rural post office network has a special value as a focal point for our communities, forms a social function and is a trusted source of guidance and advice. The post office provides vital financial services to the 15 per cent. of rural households that do not have a car and the 49 per cent. of people living in rural settlements who do not live within walking distance of a bus stop with a daily service. Post offices are essential for vulnerable people. The people most dependent on post offices are the elderly, the disabled and people living on low incomes. Those are also the people who are least able to adapt if a post office closes. As Citizens Advice says,</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/3" class="indent">&quot;the closure of rural Post Offices has a profound impact on the local community and hits vulnerable groups such as the elderly, the disabled, and those with mobility problems particularly hard.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/4">Of course, post offices are economically important, too. They support village shops and other businesses&mdash;caf&eacute;s, pubs and even petrol stations&mdash;where they are co-located. As I mentioned earlier, the post office combined with a shop is often the last remaining retail outlet. If the post office side of the business is removed, the private retail business may lose customers, threatening its viability. In rural areas, only 4 per cent. of villages have a bank but 60 per cent. have a post office branch. Rural post offices provide for many people the only method of accessing financial services on their doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/5">Local post offices have environmental benefits, too. Carbon emissions are reduced because people can walk down the road to their post office rather than driving 10, 15 or 20 miles to the next town or village. We talk a lot about building sustainable rural communities. There are many elements to that: affordable housing, good health and education services and so on. However, a community is much less likely to be sustainable if basic financial, communication and retail services are not provided within it. That is what post offices provide and support, and it is why they should be seen as a cornerstone of rural policy, not to be dispensed with lightly as a financial burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/6">If rural post offices are so great, what is all the worry about? There is uncertainty about the funding for the rural network from 2008 onwards. The Minister will, I hope, acknowledge that the lack of certainty is causing problems for all concerned. Without a clear Government policy that goes far into the future, sub-postmasters and Post Office Ltd cannot plan for the future or ensure that rural services are maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/7">Post Office Ltd is a company with financial responsibilities, and the nearer it gets to 2008 with no decision taken on what funding will be available from that date, the more it will have to take steps to reduce the service. It has been made clear to me by Post Office Ltd that</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/8" class="indent">&quot;changes to the funding would inevitably mean changes to the network&mdash;but the extent and timing would depend on the detailed nature of the funding change.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/9">In plain English, if funding is cut, branches will be closed. Postcomm says that 1,600 branches face closure, but it has also said that only 10 per cent. of branches are financially viable, so a purely financial measure could mean even more closures. Indeed, the Minister has hinted that he considers the issue in such financial terms with his remarks about 800 post offices serving an average of only 23 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/10">I am grateful to the Minister for his letter prior to the debate, but I am not convinced that it offers a great deal of reassurance. He writes that</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/11" class="indent">&quot;we must look beyond the number of outlets and focus more closely on the accessibility of service provision.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/12">Indeed, he goes on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/13" class="indent">&quot;it is clear that many existing Post Offices have too few customers to be viable&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/14">I urge the Government to put away their slide rule and bring their social conscience to bear. The fundamental driver of Government policy towards the rural post office network should be its social and economic value to the communities that it serves, not just the Treasury bottom line. I would argue that &pound;150 million is a relatively small price to pay for a network of 8,000 branches serving 12 million people in rural communities across the country. With a bit more innovative thinking on the part of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">the Government, as my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> suggested earlier, much better use could be made of that network.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.2/15">Let us take a comparative example; it may not be perfect, but I will use it just the same. My constituents are among the taxpayers from all over the country who contribute every year to the &pound;2 billion Government contribution to the London transport network. The post offices in Aviemore or Foyers in my constituency are as important to the social cohesion and accessibility of services in those communities as the tube is to London.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman accept that many people who live in rural areas do not benefit from the expenditure of taxation in urban areas on services such as swimming pools and libraries? They are not able to access those as much as people living in urban areas, so expenditure on the rural post office network is giving some of that money back to support those in rural areas. It is basically giving them their fair share.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.1/1">I share the sentiment of that intervention. Public spending needs to be spread throughout the country in different ways and there has to be a balance. I urge the Minister to give us his estimate of the overall social and economic value of the rural post office network. I am sure that it is hundreds of millions of pounds more than the funding provided by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/2">The Minister will no doubt tell us that the Post Office is piloting innovative new ways of delivering its services. Indeed, it is, and I welcome those pilot schemes. I would be grateful if the Minister told us of any assessment he has received on the success of the pilot schemes and whether he will publish any such reports. I know that some have been relatively successful&mdash;those using the hub and spoke method&mdash;but new ideas also include the use of mobile units. I hope that the Minister will be honest about what he finds from the pilots. According to one report that I have received, a scheme to provide post office services through a mobile unit in Caithness has been &quot;a disaster&quot; with technological problems proving to be a real &quot;nightmare&quot; and causing difficulties to many individuals.</p>

	<p pid="a.109.2/1">I gave my hon. Friend that report, so perhaps I should first draw to his attention the fact that the scheme has suffered from considerable difficulty with the technological support that was promised. Secondly, post offices that were open daily or for several days a week are now open for half an hour or one hour per week. Thirdly, I extracted from the Post Office a promise that if the scheme failed, it would revert to the status quo. Perhaps in his questions to the Minister my hon. Friend would like also to ask whether such a promise will be valid in light of the fact that the guarantee expires in 2006?</p>

	<p pid="a.109.3/1">I am grateful for that intervention. My hon. Friend has put the question more eloquently than I could and I trust that the Minister will answer it during his response.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/2">It is also worth pointing out that the trials have their limitations. Postwatch has expressed its disappointment that the different types of services were not piloted in each region or in any remote island communities. The pilots only address how the service is delivered; they do not look at what service is delivered. Through direct payments, the Government have taken away a large chunk of income from rural post offices. What about looking for new services that could provide income and help the Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/3">A joined-up approach by the Government could find a wide range of additional services to be provided through post offices. For example, the Government are currently embarked on a process of opening 70 new passport offices, to which every new passport applicant will have to travel for an interview. How absurd, when there is a perfectly serviceable network of local offices throughout the country that could do the job perfectly well: post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/4">In Fife, local police have worked with the post office to allow local residents to report low-level crime and lost and found property at the post office. Witness citations may be served and people required to produce driving documents may do so at their local post office. That not only improves access to police services, but helps to safeguard post offices in those rural communities. The scheme has recently been extended to Newburgh and Tayport. Why not consider rolling it out throughout the country?</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/5">In my constituency, pensioners are having real difficulty booking bus tickets. That will be even more of a problem as free bus travel for pensioners is rolled out. Why not enable post offices in rural areas to take such bookings? The technology is already available to make that happen. Other examples include locating lottery ticket machines in post offices, which will help to encourage footfall, and providing vehicle licensing, which is currently available in some post offices but not in others. In my constituency, there was a temporary switch of DVLA services to the Kingsmills post office in Inverness because another post office had closed, and a dramatic boost in services took place as a result. Spreading that to rural post offices throughout the country would bring real benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/6">The Government must acknowledge the importance of rural post offices to the community and to vulnerable people in particular. They must take decisions on future funding based on the social and economic value of that service. The Minister will know that Professor John Farrington and his team at Aberdeen university received Treasury funding to develop a tool for measuring the impact of policy changes on social inclusion in rural areas. Why has that not been used in this case? Currently, the risk impact assessments that are undertaken when considering where money should be spent do not include the social impact that rural post offices have on their community. The Government should have a statutory requirement to maintain the rural network. Will the Minister consider legislation to introduce such a duty before embarking on any further change to the network?</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/7">Will the Minister also explain how he is working with other Departments and the devolved Governments to put together a joined-up plan for the rural network? For example, is the Department of Trade and Industry willing to continue funding the rural network from its budget, or is the Minister currently seeking financial support from other Departments? Given that the DTI does not necessarily have a social remit, is it necessarily the best place to make decisions about vital community services?</p>
	<p pid="a.109.3/8">The Minister will understand that there is real concern that the urban reinvention scheme that led to the closure of several thousand urban post offices is soon to be followed by a rural reinvention scheme that will do the same. Let us be clear what that means. In many cases, it means reinventing rural communities without post offices. I do not want that to happen, and the attendance at this debate shows, I hope, that many hon. Members from all parties do not want it to happen either. Let us have a Government policy that ensures a flourishing and sustainable rural network long into the future, because that is in the best interests of rural communities, vulnerable people and the country as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank him for sending me a letter, also congratulating him on securing the debate, that he received from some constituents in my area who are part of the ongoing rural postal pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">This is about the delivery of the service. For many years&mdash;we have already heard this mentioned this afternoon&mdash;we have seen postal services delivered through village shops. My previous constituency had a post office in the village pub. I do not know whether that meant that people were picking up their pension and then spending a fair amount of it. There are also post offices in garages. The issue is about the service, not necessarily the structures and methods of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">We are talking about the rural network. I want to mention something that happened 12 months ago in my constituency, in the town of Dumfries. When Safeway changed to Morrisons, Morrisons immediately decided that it wanted the post office out of the supermarket. There was quite an outcry, because it was a busy post office. However, I was quite astonished to discover that over 50 per cent. of the business being transacted through that post office came not from the townspeople of Dumfries but from people from further afield&mdash;from villages and some of the smaller towns. We are now looking at what some people would deem to be the Crown post office in Dumfries&mdash;the directly managed service&mdash;being franchised out to Spar supermarkets. To a certain extent, it has come as a bit of a surprise&mdash;although I am not totally astonished&mdash;that only 15 per cent. of the business transferred from Safeway to the main post office. The big question is: where has all the other business gone? I suspect that it has gone to a couple of the other urban sub-post offices, but some of it may have gone back to the rural localities from whence it came.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">The public want a service and, in general, they do not worry too much about how it is being delivered&mdash;whether it is in the village shop, the pub or wherever. We have to ask ourselves what we are being asked for. Is it a public service, a social service, or a combination of both? In rural localities, it is a combination of both.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">As I indicated, my locality is one of three in Scotland where a rural postal pilot is ongoing. It is what is deemed a hub and spoke service. In other words, from a centre&mdash;the town of Castle Douglas&mdash;the sub-postmaster operates the post offices in three villages. That started back in mid-September, and there was an outcry because the first thing that happened was that the hours were reduced. All three of the post offices operate out of shops. I visited two of them and asked the sub-postmasters, as they still were at the time, whether they believed that the significant reduction in hours&mdash;one of them had gone down from 21 hours to 10&mdash;was reasonable. Both of them believed that their new opening hours reflected the amount of custom that came through their doors.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">The big difficulty was the way in which the hours were configured. A Post Office member of staff goes from one of those post offices to the next to provide the service. Like anybody else, that individual can be in only one place at a time. People wanted the post offices to be open for more hours in the morning, and there was a great demand for Saturday opening. I went to a meeting in one of the village halls and by pure chance, nothing more, a retired sub-postmaster and his wife were there when the public were demanding Saturday opening. The guy stood up and said, &quot;People can make these demands, but the reality is that when I was running the post office nobody used it on a Saturday morning, so why do people want it open then?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/7">I will not paint a rosy picture; difficult decisions have to be made. Because there was an outcry, I asked people for feedback about whether the hours suited their needs. In general, the answer was no. I am a townie, and I was surprised to find that some people used the post office every day. That might well be the case. I even had people writing to say that they did not use the post office at all, but that the new opening hours were not right. I think that we would all agree that one has to respect people's views.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/8">The pilot is to run for 12 months, and it requires the co-operation of the shopkeepers. I have made the point on the two occasions on which I have attended public meetings, one of them last night, that if there is no shop there is a difficulty: from where should we deliver the service? We could use the local pub, or whatever the case may be, but we need co-operation, especially when we are running a pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/9">I do not want to have a go at anybody, but I must be honest. Two of the villages seem to be operating fairly well. The other one has been something of a problem, and that is putting it kindly. From day 1, one individual has been turning up at the post office with a clipboard and pen. I know that I said, &quot;Keep me posted on any problems that arise,&quot; but that is harassment and intimidation, and it is not required. The gentleman has become a prolific letter writer and he is trying to drag me along.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is quite right, and that point was made to the gentleman last night by a representative of the Post Office. Let me give hon. Members an indication of the situation. I wrote to the constituent in question on <phrase class="date" code="">16 December</phrase>, and he wrote back on <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase>. Regrettably, I did not get a reply away to him until <phrase class="date" code="">27 December</phrase>. I went into my office on <phrase class="date" code="">28 December</phrase> to discover that he had written to me on Christmas eve asking for a response to his letter of <phrase class="date" code="">17 December</phrase>. I responded to him on <phrase class="date" code="">29 December</phrase> and, lo and behold&mdash;I appreciate that the man has moved into the area and is not a Scot&mdash;he found time on Hogmanay to write me another letter. I have responded.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">The local newspaper has been filled with nasty letters having a go at the Government and at me. I do not have a problem with that. However, I do object when the sub-postmaster and her staff are being harangued by a few individuals. That is not fair on them. They are public servants and they have been doing their best to keep the service running. During the initial two to three months, the position was reviewed. That demand from one village for morning sessions resulted in a change of hours on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>. That gave it two morning sessions, a late morning to early afternoon session and an afternoon session. It was admitted last night at the public meeting that some of the problems have died down. It did not help that, in the first week after the introduction of new hours, the machine for giving receipts broke down, but therein lies a problem with IT.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">The new hours were introduced on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>. I visited two outlets on the previous Friday with the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1994" name="David Cairns">my hon. Friend the. Member for Inverclyde (David Cairns)</phrase>. As far as I was concerned, the good news at those outlets was that business in the shop had not diminished in any shape or form; in fact, those involved were quite pleased with what was happening, and I suspect that there might have been a little additional business. If those shops closed, we would need to find a new base for the post offices, so I am relieved that business is going well.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">I mentioned my constituent, the prolific letter writer. Among the things that he has written to me about is the fact that only 860 mm of counter space was negotiated. In the same letter, he even talks about the payment that the shopkeeper gets from the sub-postmistress. I have had to write back to him to say that that is neither his business nor mine, but a business transaction between two parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">Some of the problems, I have to say, are being stoked up by the previous sub-postmaster. Nobody has been forced out of their position. There has been co-operation, although&mdash;this may have been the same with the urban reinvention programme&mdash;some sub-postmasters may not be too happy to tell their customers that they have co-operated in what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/6">There is a great fear that there is an alternative agenda on the part of the Post Office. In another village in my constituency, the sub-post office operates out of a portakabin&mdash;there is nothing else there. The lady who runs it is getting on in years and decided that she wanted to call a halt to the whole thing. Fortunately, the Post Office moved in, knowing that it probably would not get anyone else in the area to run the post office. It went to the lady, looked at the hours that she operated and at the amount of business going through the post office and said, &quot;You really need to be open only three sessions a week.&quot; On hearing that, the lady decided to stay with it and open only three sessions a week. We need to be conscious of just how much business goes through some of these places.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/7">About 50 people went to the meeting that I attended in my constituency yesterday on what we in Scotland would call a dreich winter's evening&mdash;it was wet and windy to say the least. All but three or four of those people were elderly. We need to recognise that all ages use the post office, but there is a clear indication that the elderly value post offices more than the generations that are coming through.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/8">At the meeting, the public were able to air their views. The Post Office rep, Steve Miller, who is a tremendous guy, said&mdash;this comes back to the point made by the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey about the customer base&mdash;that one post office in the highlands had eight or nine customers a week. The cry in the village hall yesterday evening was, &quot;Close it! We in this village are paying the price for that.&quot; I would say, however, that we should not close it down, but look at delivering the service in some other way. If people need a service, let us ask what other structure we can put in place to provide it. It is always the same: everyone believes that everything in their patch is fine and that everyone else is to blame. One person commented, &quot;We just want the Royal Mail the way it was,&quot; but I sincerely hope that colleagues in this Chamber accept that it is 2006, that life has changed and that people carry out their business in a different way.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/9">One of my great frustrations as regards the postal pilot is that the sub-postmistress is unable to do what she wants to develop, promote and market products. The one respect in which we have problems is that she is constantly tied up doing other things. She appreciates more than anyone else that she has to build the customer base&mdash;the opportunity is there, and she sees it. Last night, the Post Office representative pointed to the full range of products that were available, and it was astonishing that people were simply not aware of them. The fact that the sub-postmistress's efforts to promote those products are frustrated creates difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/10">Others will learn from the postal pilots and from the experiences that my constituents are going through. Last night, I was asked how much longer the sub-postmistress wanted to promote products&mdash;was it a week or two weeks? I had to say that it is a 12-month pilot. I look forward to further debates in this Chamber and the main Chamber once we have a report about the pilots, just to see how we might deliver services to people. I emphasise again the importance of this debate, and repeat my congratulations to the hon. Gentleman. The future is about the services and the way in which we deliver them, not the structures.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing the debate on this important issue, in which I have taken some interest as the Member for North Shropshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">A couple of years ago, in the summer, I drove 150 miles around my constituency. The Minister bumped into me in the Tea Room and asked whether I represented a rural seat; the fact that my constituency is a 150-mile drive around shows that it is rural to an extent. I visited 28 post offices&mdash;I apologise to the four that I did not get to on that day&mdash;and found an extraordinary, consistent pattern. At that time the Government were being, quite frankly, brutal in ramming through a change in the way benefits were paid. The proportion of turnover in relation to benefits then was extraordinarily high in my post offices: it was 60 per cent. in Gobowen, 80 per cent. in Treflach, 70 per cent. in Pant, 60 per cent. in West Felton, and 50 per cent. in Baschurch and Prees. There was a real feeling that, unfortunately, the Government had not pursued the outgoing Tory Government's plan to pay benefits by card, which would have been just as secure but would have kept a proportion of the &pound;400 million annual income going through the sub-post office network.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/3">The current problem is very much of the Government's making, and is partly because they are an urban Government. I do not think that there is a single rural Member in the DTI team&mdash;they are all urban Ministers. I sympathise with the hon. Gentleman who secured the debate, and I want to get across the point today that this is a real problem in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/4">I draw attention to one particularly hard-working sub-postmaster, Colin Doyle, who has just retired after 25 years of working, probably seven days a week, in Knockin. His marketing has been to allow those who do not come from Shropshire to pronounce Knockin &quot;Knockin&quot;, and he has a large sign over his shop saying &quot;The Knockin Shop&quot;, which attracts large numbers of tourists on their way to Wales, who buy merchandise from his shop. He knows an awful lot about post offices and was very helpful when I went to see him. Following my tour, I took him to see the Minister's predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1563" name="Stephen Timms">the hon. Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms)</phrase>, to try to ram through to him the problems with what the Government were doing in so brutally forcing people to receive benefits by direct payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/5">Colin Doyle had done everything one could ask for: he acknowledged the importance of benefits as the core of the post office business, which attracts customers in for other post office products, letter-writing materials and other stationery, he had a fresh food business and a fruit business, and, like many other post offices that I visited, he had diversified into having an off-licence. In fairness to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the comments made by hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase>, I take my hat off to the sub-postmasters in my constituency, who have bust their guts to diversify and get into general merchandise.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/6">I have a great quote from Colin. He said, &quot;If the post office goes, the shop goes, and if the shop goes, the village goes.&quot; There is a real social benefit in keeping that focus of activity in the village, because the post office is not just about postal activities and other products that are sold; it becomes a focus for information. There is a village notice board for advertising jobs and so on. There is a real social dimension to the post office in an area such as mine, where large numbers of elderly people live on their own. It is noticed if they do not come into the shop and pick up a pint of milk or a loaf of bread.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that older people are among the most vulnerable and often the most isolated groups in rural areas who depend on post office services? On my last trip to a rural post office, an elderly gentleman visited, and it was the first time that he had left his house for two years; it was the major social event of his day. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the Government should accept and recognise the important social role that those village post offices play for many older people, in particular?</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">Yes, I entirely agree. That was a most helpful intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">The point that I was trying to get across was that the activity of rural post offices is not just commercial and postal, and it cannot just be replaced, as the hon. Member for East Ham said when Colin Doyle went to see him, by the universal bank&mdash;which we have not heard much about, I must say&mdash;and other banking services. Those are all welcome, and the hon. Gentleman was hopeful that insurance products and foreign exchange products, which have taken off, would be of real benefit. However, I must be brutal with this Minister: it was a terrible error to rip out &pound;400 million of benefit payments. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">the hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase> said, the majority of people claiming those benefits were elderly. It brought them to the post office, but now there is no need for them to go, because the benefits are paid directly. That was a major error, and it has got the Government into a mess on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">Following all that, I have become secretary of the all-party group on sub-post offices. I do not expect everyone to stand up and sing &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, but it is a most interesting role that I enjoy, under the splendid chairmanship of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">the hon. Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>. We intend to hold a series of regular meetings, to which all Members of all parties are invited. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">My neighbour, the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, is the treasurer, but I think that he may be otherwise occupied, as many Liberal Democrats may be this week.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/4">I invite all hon. Members to attend meetings of the all-party group, and I hope that the Minister will come along. I am indebted to the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters for statistics showing what an important sector of activity rural post offices are. There are 8,000 post offices in rural areas, which are defined as areas with a population of fewer than 10,000 people. The rural network serves about 12 million customers a week, and 84 per cent. of the rural population live within one mile of a post office. The other interesting figure, which I found surprising when I received it, is that the 14,500 sub-postmasters each provide jobs to an average of 4.6 people, 83 per cent. of whom are part-time. That ties in with other comments that were made earlier, about the social aspect of the activity, which provides part-time employment in thinly populated rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/5">To get themselves out of their muddle, the Government put up the &pound;450 million, which was due to run at &pound;150 million a year. I find it hard to see how sub-postmasters can gain access to the money. How is it available? How do sub-postmasters get at it? Most of those in my constituency find it difficult to do that. As I understand matters, it was originally scheduled to run from 2003 to 2006. That is what the hon. Member for East Ham told me at our meeting. I understand that it will now continue to 2008, but that it is subject to EU approval, because it might count as state aid. What is the exact position? The issue ties in with the comments made by the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway: is the matter in question a social activity or is it a state-funded activity, and how does it qualify, if it counts as a social activity, under EU state aid rules?</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/6">We have had trials of hub and spoke, mobile vans and so on, carried out by Post Office Ltd. I understand that they were due to be completed in December 2005. Is that correct? Will the Minister tell us when Post Office Ltd will report, and what the Government's reaction will be?</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/7">What does the Minister see as sub-post offices' role? How does he see the future? We cannot keep stumbling on. We have ripped out the &pound;400 million of benefits, and that presents a huge threat unless we obtain other viable activity. I strongly support all the attempts to bring in banking and foreign exchange, but according to the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters there is a &pound;140 million a year deficit&mdash;a gap between income and cost&mdash;in the activity. I should like to know the Minister's long-term strategic view.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">While we are trying to work out exactly what the role of the rural post office is&mdash;and we know that it has a social role for those in receipt of its services&mdash;will my hon. Friend also pay tribute to the men and women who staff rural post offices? Some of them do not earn much money; they are on marginal incomes. They offer a social service to their community, and they should be rewarded, not spurned.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.1/1">I thoroughly endorse my hon. Friend's comments. When the previous Government were in power, many of those people took a big risk, made the post office the activity for the latter part of their working lives and sank their pension into it, trusting that there would be a steady income stream based on benefits, around which they could build a range of other activities, as I tried to explain. As my hon. Friend said, those men and women work extremely hard and they are exasperated.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/2">I quote the postmaster for Prees, which the Minister will not like&mdash;I could quote some much ruder comments, which would not be parliamentary&mdash;who described the Government's attitude to sub-post offices. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/3" class="indent">&quot;They are totally clueless. They are destroying the infrastructure of country life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.117.1/4">That sums up the frustrations of sub-postmasters. Perhaps the Minister will tell us his long-term view, so that we do not just stumble from crisis to crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.3/1">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I came into the Chamber with the intention of supporting <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase>. Having listened to the excellent way he presented the case and to the other excellent contributions, I am moved to make a short contribution myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/2">It may not need to have been said, as it is obvious, but it is worth repeating how important rural post offices are to the whole of rural life and to sustaining the communities. They are important for two distinct and different reasons, both of which have come out in the debate. The first is the provision of services to people who need them, who are often the most vulnerable in society, whether through age or infirmity, and who would not otherwise have access to those services. Secondly, the point must be made in relation to the highlands about the provision of services to people on low incomes and without access to a car who live in areas where there is very little public transport. We assume these days that everyone will be able to use a car or other transport, but many people cannot do so, for a variety of reasons. Therefore the simple provision of a service is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/3">A wider point made this afternoon is that a functioning post office is often the last service to remain in a village, after the shop, the pub and so on have gone. It is the post office that keeps going. It is a point of contact, somewhere that people who do not often see other people go to see the sub-postmaster or postmistress. Sometimes that is how they signal that they are still around, alive and well. It is not uncommon in villages for people to notice that somebody has not been into the post office for a day or two and to go and check that they are all right. The wider good of the community is important in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/4">We would all like the rural network service to be kept and, if possible, enhanced, and I want to consider where the responsibilities for that lie. It would be easy to slam the Post Office and say that there is a vast conspiracy to get everything wrong, but we must be clear that in the climate that has been created for the Post Office, the commercial realities are inescapable. We cannot expect the Post Office to be a profitable organisation and at the same time to provide traditional services, as it has always done.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/5">For that reason, I welcome the pilot scheme that is under way in Caithness. When I was consulted about it I pointed out the pitfalls. In my meetings with those who were responsible for setting it up, I said that the number of hours being offered was likely to be so small that the outcome would be that people would fall out of the habit of using the post office at that time. That seems to have been the case. However, we should not criticise the Post Office for seeking to be innovative in putting forward solutions, and it should not be the whipping boy in this exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/6">I am worried about what is happening in Caithness. The <i>John O' Groat Journal</i>, a fine paper that I can recommend to anyone, drew attention in its issue of <phrase class="date" code="">30 December</phrase> to the severe problems that are being encountered through lack of service. They are not helping the Post Office's case.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/7">I had an interesting conversation with the chairman of Postwatch about a month ago when he told me of innovations in America, which has gone for the opposite solution of a fixed, unmanned station in rural communities. By using a card people can post a letter and extract things. I shall be meeting the chairman to find out more about that because it is another innovation that the Post Office may be interested in.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/8">The Government have a clear responsibility in these matters, and opportunities have been missed. One was the opportunity with the migration of benefits. We warned the then Minister what was likely to happen to footfall. We received assurances that the marketing would be even-handed, but my correspondence with every sub-postmaster and postmistress told me that they were unable to compete with the heavy marketing and telephone campaign that took place. We have a huge range of Government and local government services that we want to deliver more closely to the population. We have a network of offices with some fine equipment which are capable of delivering some of those services. Can the Government not put the two together so that delivery to our citizens could be made through the Post Office in a profitable way?</p>

	<p pid="a.119.0/1">My hon. Friend is quite right about the importance of post offices to rural communities and the need for Government support. Does he agree that unless the Government give a commitment soon to provide more funding through social network payments or more services, post offices will close? They are businesses, and if the people running those businesses do not have a guarantee of long-term security they will not continue to invest in them.</p>

	<p pid="a.119.1/1">My hon. Friend is quite right. That is precisely what happened in the town of Golspie where the gentleman who ran the business decided to quit because he could not see a way ahead. My comment to the Government is that there are two requirements. The first is a long-term vision and the second is a bridging plan to get to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.1/2">I commend some of the private sector. For example, Clydesdale Bank is now using post offices to distribute cash and front-line services for the bank. There are opportunities. Will the Government please understand how necessary post offices are to our communities and that if we do not act reasonably quickly those post offices will not be there to be saved?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.119.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" speakername="Nigel Evans" colnum="119"  time="15:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew28">
	<p pid="a.119.2/1">I did not intend to speak either, but I was also enthused enough to have my two-penn'orth. I shall make a short contribution; it is not worth going over the same ground as we are all much of the same mind on the importance of rural post offices. It is difficult to put a price on their service because of all the various components that make up the worth of post offices to people in rural communities. We all recognise that they will not be profitable and that they require support because without it they will close&mdash;it is as simple as that. I cannot envisage how many rural post offices could ever be profitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/2">I want to speak about matters such as the ageing population. We all know that this country has an ageing population, which will get worse&mdash;that is not the right way to put it. The ageing population will increase as more people remain alive longer. <i>[Interruption.] </i>At least I corrected myself. Many elderly people come into my retail convenience store in Swansea. I can see that that is a bit of a social thing for them and I wonder what will happen to people in rural areas. At least the location of my shop is urban; in rural areas, the situation is much more difficult. Going to the post office may be the only time when some people get out of the house during the day, and mixing with other people in the post office and with the postmaster or postmistress is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">My hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> mentioned that the postmaster or postmistress knows if people have not been in. In my village, Pendleton, the postmistress once told me, &quot;I have to nip out. Mrs. Jones hasn't come in for her pension and I want to see if she's okay.&quot; That is exactly what she did, and what a fantastic social service it is. I therefore ask the Minister to consider carefully what will happen in such areas to people and disabled people. How will they be looked after? Not everyone will be able to access everything on the internet. I know that the future is rosy as far as new technology is concerned, but it is good now and again to value what we have. I suspect that if we let it all go, some bright-spark politician in 50 years' time will try to reinvent and reintroduce everything that we have lost, but we know how much more difficult that will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/4">There was mention of the experiment with a mobile unit, which is interesting. I am thinking of large urban areas in the United States. I have seen mobile units operating in New York and I suspect that they work fairly well there, but to have one turn up for half an hour once a week is pretty pointless; it means the loss of the social aspect of the post office and the convenience of its being there when people want to use it.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/5">The Government can be imaginative in the sense of putting post offices into pubs, which already happens, and perhaps into some garages, village halls and other places. Perhaps they could even be put into people's living rooms in certain villages, but we should not let everything go and just have a mobile unit. I do not think that it would work. In addition, because the postmaster or postmistress knows the people, they help to cut down on fraud in the post office. The value of the fact that they know the people who are turning up should not be underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.119.2/6">We want the Minister to answer all these questions and we are putting many challenges to him, but the call must also go out to the 12 million people in our communities who can make use of the post offices to do so more often. &quot;Use it or lose it&quot; is a message that everyone knows, but we cannot over-emphasise it. When people go into the post office and use it time and again, they are doing their little bit to ensure that the service that they are receiving will continue for future generations.</p>

	<p pid="a.120.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I shall now try to confine myself to describing him as my hon. Friend. I am not nearly as brave as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>, who tried to say the name of my hon. Friend's constituency and performed extremely well.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">My hon. Friend has been very active and effective in campaigning for rural post offices, and I applaud him. As I said, this is an important debate, and valuable contributions have been made by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber. Why is there so much concern about maintaining the network? It is a remarkable network. We have heard that 60 per cent. of villages across the country still have a post office. The relevant figure is massively higher than that for all the banks put together. The network is a precious resource. My great frustration is that much more could be done with it but is not being done; it could be exploited much more effectively. Several hon. Members have made that point, to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/3">The hon. Member for North Shropshire and others have said that the network serves 12 million customers a week. That is a very large number of people throughout rural areas in this country. It is an essential service and that is how it needs to be seen. It is essential for elderly people, disabled people and people without access to a car. There is often a fear that the Government do not fully understand the problem of rural poverty. Government Members largely represent urban areas, and sometimes there is a failure to recognise hidden poverty in rural areas and the problem of isolation that goes with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/4">If the public transport system is no good, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> mentioned, and there is no post office or shop in the village, one really is stuck. More and more frequently, carers who look after loved ones are completely isolated in small rural communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey also referred to the dramatic loss of business through the transfer to direct payments and the aggressive pressure on people to transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/5">It has not been mentioned that the core function of post offices, the dispatch of letters and parcels, is important for rural businesses as well. I have been fascinated by the potential growth area whereby more and more people are trading on the internet through eBay. When I visited two small sub-post offices in North Norfolk and asked whether they were seeing any growth of business from eBay, they pointed to two people in their 20s or 30s who were there to dispatch goods that they had traded on eBay. The fascinating thing is that those people were much younger than the average age of customers that we have become used to in post offices. We should not ignore that potential for growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/6">The other point that has been made is that often, the post office is part of the only shop left in the village, and it helps to keep it going. Without the post office, the shop goes. As a note of dissent from the other Opposition party present, I have to say that the decline has been going on for a long time&mdash;the challenge dates from long before 1997. One big problem with Royal Mail is that it has had no investment for 20 or 30 years, and that has affected the post office network as well as the delivery of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/7">What is the Government's strategy? I find it hard to define or identify it. In October 2004, Postcomm urged the Government in a report to be clear about their objectives for the network. Postcomm referred to the &quot;pressing need&quot; for the Government to decide what they want from the rural network. In a report way back in June 2000, the performance and innovation unit said that by 2006&mdash;now&mdash;there should be a framework in place to ensure &quot;continued convenient access&quot; to post offices. The year 2006 has arrived, but sub-postmasters and postmistresses are still waiting. An air of depression hangs over the network and those people running small businesses. No one has any confidence in the future, and we are still waiting for the Government to decide their strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/8">In March, in seven or eights weeks' time, the obligation on the Post Office to prevent avoidable closures of rural sub-post offices expires. That could open the floodgates for closures unless something is put in place. To make matters worse, the &pound;150 million subsidy of the rural network runs out in 2008. Post Office insiders say that if the extension is not confirmed soon, they will have to embark on a wholesale closure programme. Small businesses need certainty, and many sub-post offices will be worthless in terms of their saleability without the renewal of the subsidy. Still, however, there is no announcement from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/9">I want to highlight a couple of structural problems that pose a bigger threat to the network. Responsibility within the Government rests with the DTI, a Department that can hardly be said to have a core social remit. When it asks other Departments whether they are interested in supporting the network in some way, it gets a flea in its ear. Every Department's budget is already committed. There is no objective reason why Royal Mail, which is required to make a profit, should want to maintain the social network. It is a drain on the resources of Royal Mail, but it has an interest in keeping competitor mail delivery companies away from the network. The danger is that Royal Mail will preside over a declining network that it has no real interest in maintaining, and that it will deny business opportunities to small sub-post offices that are desperately in need of a break.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/10">That all points to a fairly bleak future&mdash;no wonder morale is low&mdash;but things could be so different if the Government had vision, if they were determined to exploit this remarkable network to the full, and if post offices were able to develop new business opportunities in the competitive mail market. How could the network be exploited? My hon. Friend mentioned the crazy fact that the Government are opening 70 new passport offices&mdash;an obvious opportunity for post offices goes begging. There are also real opportunities for local authorities and Government agencies to work in partnership with post offices, which would give them reach into so many deprived and remote communities. The police are conducting some interesting pilots in Scotland and Norfolk. There are also the Learning and Skills Council and health services. All those bodies could use the local post office to provide information and to establish links with communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/11">I mentioned internet trading and shopping over the internet. Post offices ought to be free to develop new business opportunities with other mail and delivery companies. These days, many goods are delivered to people's homes. The post office is the obvious deposit point if the person is out, but that real business opportunity is denied to them unless the goods are being delivered by Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/12">Sub-post offices often complain about tight restrictions on their right to enter other business arrangements; for example, the sale of pre-payment cards for electricity. I have nothing against their finding new, innovative ways to deliver post office services&mdash;I positively support such experimentation&mdash;but can the Minister confirm when he will receive the report from Post Office Ltd? I admit that I am confused. In a letter to my hon. Friend dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-05">5 January</phrase>, the Minister says that he is still waiting for it, but the chief executive of the Post Office states in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-04">4 January</phrase> that he has already delivered it. Perhaps it has been lost in the post&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I urge the Government to change their mindset from one of contraction to one of taking advantage of this far-reaching network to help in the delivery of services to remote and deprived communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/13">I wish to conclude by posing some questions to the Minister. I would be grateful if he could answer them in this debate or in writing. Of most pressing concern: will the no avoidable closures obligation be extended beyond March, and, if not, what will be put in its place? Secondly, will he confirm whether the rural subsidy will extend beyond 2008, given the serious concerns of Post Office Ltd? Thirdly, what assessment has he made of the number of post offices that would exist if the subsidy were ended, given that 90 per cent. of rural post offices are already unprofitable, according to Postcomm? The east of England would be left with 88 post offices if 90 per cent. closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/14">Fourthly, given the structural problems that I referred to, will the Minister consider introducing a statutory obligation on the Government to maintain the network? The framework could be set for fixed periods, giving some certainty to post offices. Fifthly, will any pool of money be available at any stage for investment in the network, so that sub-postmasters and postmistresses can take advantage of the opportunities that could be available to them to help them make their business profitable?</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/15">Sixthly, serious concerns have been expressed about rumours that the Post Office card account will be phased out in 2010. Can the Minister give an absolute undertaking that that is not the case? What steps will he take to enable sub-post offices to build new business opportunities by working with other mail and package delivery companies? Finally, will he conduct a comprehensive review of the true social and economic value of the network, which still has not been done?</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/16">To conclude, the post office network faces an uncertain future. Morale is low, and there is a sense of terminal decline. The Government give no impression of having any effective strategy to turn it around and reinvigorate the network. I hope&mdash;but doubt&mdash;that the Minister will be able to reassure us on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.0/1">I join o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">thers in congratulating the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the way in which he introduced it. Can I link that with a plea that there should be no further boundary changes in Scotland? Every time that that happens, the name of his constituency gets longer and longer. I remember when it was Inverness, then it became Inverness, Nairn and Lochaber and now it is this hugely lengthy constituency name. I cannot imagine what his letterhead is like, because there cannot be any room for writing any text on it after he has printed the constituency name on the top. However, I warmly congratulate him on the way in which he introduced the debate, which has been extremely useful and constructive.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/2">It is disappointing that, with the hon<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">ourable exception of the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase>, there has not been any Government contribution to the debate. They were claiming before the election that they were a rural party, but when it comes to a key rural issue that affects all of us with rural constituencies, they could not find Members, from south of the border at least, to take part in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/3">As has been made clear, post offices are the lifeblood for many small rural communities. They are not just a source of stamps, or from where people collect their pensions. All too often, it is the sub-post office branch that ensures the viability of other local services, particularly village shops. If the village post office closes, so too does the only other shop in the village. We have often seen that if a post office closes, it never reopens, and examples have been given during this debate about where that has been the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/4">There is an example in my constituency: the shop in Hadlow Down closed, and when it was found that someone wanted to reopen that facility, they were refused permission by the highways authority, which said that it was not safe to park there. We had a village shop there for 100 years, and after it was closed, somebody said that they were prepared to put in the hours and effort to make it work again, but they were denied the opportunity to make it work.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/5">We should recognise the tremendous dedication of the sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses who run village post offices, who work many more hours than they are paid to do, and who provide a tremendous social service to make their communities work cohesively. In introducing the debate, the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey talked about the range of other services that can be provided through post offices. I introduce a note of caution when he talks about the national lottery, because it can compound the problems. There is a recent example of Buxted village shop where, because a pedestrian crossing was introduced outside, that reduced the number of people stopping outside the shop and using it. Because of that, the turnover of the national lottery was reduced, so the shop had the lottery taken away. That has compounded its problems as a village shop, so we should not always see the lottery as a solution. It is a hard-headed business making hard-headed decisions about where it wishes to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/6">The rural post office network is the largest retail branch network in Europe. About 84 per cent. of people living in rural areas, as has been said, live within a mile of a post office branch. Other ideas have been suggested, notably by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>, who suggested that we could put post offices in pubs. That would lead to 24-hour post offices. How convenient that would be: every time that someone needed another pint, they could draw out a bit more of their pension. However, we must look creatively at how we go down that route. As my hon. Friend also said, the solution is also partly in our hands. If we and our constituents do not support the rural post office network, it will close. Although we recognise that the Government have a role to play in that, so do we as individual consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.125.1/1">I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman, if he will forgive me, because I know that we are tight on time and the Minister wishes to address many points.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/2">It is clear that the Government do not have a long-term strategy for the rural post office network. Without a strategy, sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses and Post Office Ltd cannot plan for the future or ensure that rural services are maintained after 2006. The Government have made comments that ostensibly show a commitment to the rural post office network, and in an answer to a parliamentary question to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Government recognise the importance of the rural post office network to local communities and will not take any decisions on the future of the network without a proper assessment of those needs. My officials are working closely with Defra and the devolved Administrations to identify future options for sustaining access to post office services for rural communities. This work is still at an early stage, but I am sure that they will seek the views of bodies representing parish and town councils at an appropriate point.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-21">21 December 2004</phrase>; Vol. 428, c. 1616W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/4">The Government have made a firm commitment to prevent avoidable rural closures until this year. Perhaps that is not so much a long-term commitment as one to get them past a general election, but to do it they made available a &pound;2 million fund to support community post office initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/5">As has also been said, the Government made available &pound;450 million&mdash;&pound;150 million a year for three years&mdash;to help to continue to provide access to services in rural areas when they could not otherwise be sustained commercially. They have announced another &pound;300 million to help rural post offices until 2008, but they do not continue to provide that duty to avoid closures, which is what so many people have called for in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/6">That may sound all well and good, but it masks the frightening decline in the number of village post offices. The total number of post offices has fallen by 17 per cent. in the past 10 years, but the figures are even more dramatic for sub-post offices. The number of sub-post offices has declined by 35 per cent. since 1997. That is a drop of 4,600 sub-post offices in eight years. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> said that this had been a longer-term trend, but we need to get it into perspective. The 4,600 small post offices that have closed in the lifetime of this Government are more than have closed in the previous 22 years. That is an extremely worrying decline.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/7">The closures are partly a direct consequence of Government policy. The Government's decision to introduce pensions and benefits to be paid directly into bank accounts has removed 40 per cent. of post office income, causing many smaller rural post offices to close. As has also been said, the Government were not passive in all this, but actively encouraged people to switch to that system while saying that they were neutral.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/8">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> said in a notable contribution, they were brutal about the policy; they recognised what the consequence would be. Indeed, when the Conservatives considered the matter back in the 1980s, when I was a special adviser at the Department of Trade and Industry, we rejected that change precisely because of the implications for small post offices. We decided that it was sufficiently important to support the Post Office network not to go down that route then.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/9">Direct debit payment was not supported by the National Consumer Council, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The end to cash benefits just hasn't been thought through properly,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/11">and that the new arrangements</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/12" class="indent">&quot;take little account of people's real needs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/13">Direct debit payments were also criticised by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, the trades unions Amicus and the Communication Workers Union, the National Federation of Women's Institutes, which should frighten the Prime Minister, and Age Concern, which expressed concern at the considerable hurdles that seem to be put in the way of opening Post Office card accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/14">We believe that the Government have been hasty in pushing the policy forward, and we recognise, just as the Countryside Agency has done in a survey that it recently carried out through MORI, that these changes have had a negative impact, and are likely to lead to mass post office closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/15">What is needed is for the Government to have a clear vision of the future of the rural post office networks&mdash;a genuine plan for stopping closures&mdash;to ensure the longer-term prosperity of post offices. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire has said, not one member of the ministerial team at the DTI represents a rural constituency. The team represents Hull, Croydon, Dudley, Cardiff, Bradford, Brent, and Sheffield, and it is unsurprising that the interests of rural consumers are being overlooked when no one in the entire ministerial team at the Department that is driving the policy represents a rural post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/16">The Government should consider allowing post offices to offer more services. At present, post offices are not allowed to offer services that would compete with the Royal Mail, but independent parcel delivery firms such as DHL and UPS would welcome the opportunity to sell their services through post offices. Indeed, postmasters and postmistresses are in favour of that prohibition being lifted. It would be lifted for all post offices, but it would be of particular benefit to rural post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/17">As well as expanding the financial services that post offices can offer, the Government should also be more imaginative in expanding the role of post offices as a banking portal. They would then become places where people can access banking services from high street banks in the way that it is suggested that they can have access to the postal services of companies other than the Royal Mail. That would be more relevant for postal services that may not have a high street bank than for post offices in towns and cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/18">The Government have thrown some money at the issue, but they have shown little vision. While they dither, the post offices that are so central to the economic life of villages throughout the country quietly slip away. The key issue which the Minister must answer is the one posed by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire: what is the Government's vision for rural post offices? We have had an excellent debate and I hope that we can now have some answers.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.0/1">I begin by saying that our debate has lasted one hour and 20 minutes and I now have 10 minutes in which to attempt to respond, which is completely inadequate. I want to assure you, Mr. Cook, and all hon. Members present that I will write to all those who have spoken in today's debate, ensuring that all the questions that were raised and are recorded in <i>Hansard</i> receive a full and proper response.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> is not only the Member for the parliamentary constituency with the longest name, he is also the Member for one of the largest geographically and most beautiful constituencies&mdash;I say that as someone who has holidayed in Glen Affric&mdash;in which all but six of the 42 post offices are classified as rural. The reason for his interest in the future of the rural post office network is therefore self-evident.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/3">The future of the post office network is an issue of relevance to every member of the House, whether our constituencies are rural, urban or a mixture of both. We all share concerns for the future provision of post office services to our constituents. Most of us recognise that there had been underinvestment in the business for decades until the Government reversed the decline with our sustained programme of investment since 1999. Some &pound;500 million was injected to create a fund for new IT infrastructure and since 2003 the Government have committed &pound;150 million a year up to 2008, subject to state aid clearance, to support the rural network. On top of that, the Government put &pound;210 million towards the urban reinvention programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/4">That represents an investment of &pound;1.41 billion of taxpayers' money from the Government. Yet on the website of the Highland Liberal Democrats the hon. Member who initiated the debate is quoted as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/5" class="indent">&quot;There has long been a suspicion that Mr. Blair's Government is not committed to the rural post office network&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/6">The hon. Gentleman should perhaps take a leaf out of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">the book of his colleague the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>, who told me following a recent debate that the more research he carried out, the more he realised just what the Government had done.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/7">Advances in technology, greater mobility and changes in shopping and financial habits have resulted in a growing proportion of people not using post offices in the way that they did in the past. Custom across the network has sharply declined creating the spectra of the spiral of decline. If the post office network is to survive and thrive it needs to change significantly. The Government want to see a post office network that can prosper, but on the basis of today's needs and those of the future, not those of 20 or 30 years ago. In doing so we also must face present reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/8">Major sectors of the network are losing substantial amounts of money. The rural network is making losses of about &pound;150 million a year and the directly managed Crown offices are losing in the region of &pound;70 million a year. Clearly the status quo is not sustainable. Several important steps to restructure and revitalise the Post Office have been taken but the future of the network rightly remains an issue of national debate, and it is clear that there are still considerable challenges to be faced.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/9">The decline in transaction volumes is not just about the changes in benefit arrangements that were completed last April. The decline started well before the move to direct payment. Even before the migration from order books started in April 2003, 43 per cent. of the Department for Work and Pension's customers had opted to receive all of their benefits by direct payment. By last October, 97 per cent. of customers were receiving direct payments with 76 per cent. opting for payment in a bank account and 21 per cent. for payment into a Post Office card account. That is an example of an efficient Government delivering benefit more cost effectively, reducing the burden on the taxpayer at the same time as being more convenient for the recipient and cutting out the potential for fraud. However, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> portrays us as a mean Government plotting to reduce the profit margins of sub-postmasters.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.6/1">Thank you, Mr. Cook, for that clarification. Of course the hon. Member for North Shropshire is refusing to respond to the proper issue. That is clear; it is that the Government have acted entirely responsibly in delivering the service more cost effectively. The Public Accounts Committee would have something to say if they did not. The hon. Gentleman's party will not pledge itself to row back that policy because it knows the truth of what I am saying.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.6/2">The trend of declining transaction volumes applies not only to benefit payments but to a much wider range of services, including Girobank and national savings transactions, telephone bill payments and postal orders. We must also recognise that 96 per cent. of the nation's post offices are run by sub-postmasters. They are private business people who have invested in their businesses not only their own money but, as has been mentioned particularly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase>, a great deal of care, which has helped the post office network to achieve its highly regarded status.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.6/3">However, with declining profitability in the network as a whole, the viability of many individual offices has taken a severe knock. Decisive action, in the form of the urban reinvention programme, was taken to restructure a sector of the network in which there was extensive over-provision, with the aim of better matching supply to demand, and of creating the viability necessary for a network that would be sustainable into the future. That is why we backed the plans of Post Office Ltd for managed restructuring of the urban network, which involved almost 2,500 office closures but ensured that, nationally, 99.3 per cent. of people in urban areas still live within 1 mile of their nearest post office. Lest anybody should forget, each one of those 2,500 closures happened in a place where the sub-postmaster wanted to close and volunteered for closure. Nobody was forced out of business by POL or Government. They closed because they chose to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.6/4">We now need to address the issues facing the social network of sub-post offices in rural and urban deprived areas. That part of the network is no longer financially sustainable in its present form. That is a problem, but it is not the only problem. It is no longer clear that the needs of those communities, or of the most disadvantaged, are best served by the present traditional costly and inflexible fixed office network structure. Those who believe that financial sustainability does not matter, and that Government should simply pour more money in to sustain the network come what may, are failing those of their constituents who are not getting the service that they deserve because somebody else in a village down the road is keeping an inefficient physical structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.6/5">The social network payment of &pound;150 million a year from the Government was introduced in 2003&ndash;04 as a transitional measure against the background of migration to direct payments of benefit. It was intended to provide a financial breathing space in which POL would develop new products to replace lost income from traditional business, and would identify more cost-effective ways of delivering its services. It is becoming increasingly urgent that we find innovative and more cost-effective ways of delivering post office services to rural and many urban deprived communities. We cannot ignore the fact that many rural offices have an impossibly low customer base, with some 1,600 offices averaging fewer than 100 customers a week. The 800 smallest offices are averaging 23 customer visits a week and generate&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.130.1/1">I thank you, Mr. Cook, for the opportunity to hold this debate. I want to raise a matter of local, regional and national significance. The Thames valley makes a huge contribution to the UK's economic performance and success. Through its businesses and people, it generates a larger slice of revenue for the Government than anywhere outside central London.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">At the heart of that success over the past 20 years has been Reading, which has been transformed from a modest industrial town into a vital regional centre. Reading's economic transformation began in the 1980s, but it is becoming harder to sustain the success story in Reading and the Thames valley. One of the biggest threats to our continued economic success is transport infrastructure, which will fail without significant investment&mdash;possibly within the next decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/3">The implications of failure for the region and the UK's economic performance will be huge. The region is particularly susceptible to the forces of globalisation. Just as multinational companies make their homes in and around Reading, taking advantage of the area's strengths, our collapsing transport infrastructure could rapidly force them to relocate, probably overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/4">It is little wonder that transport infrastructure is failing. It sounds incredible, but my local authority assures me that there has been no Government transport infrastructure investment in our region or in Reading for the past 20 years. What investment there has been seems to have come from the private sector. I do not know whether the Minister knows this, but committed Government investment in the south-east is currently 40 per cent. for the Thames Gateway, 35 per cent. for the south coast and 25 per cent. for other areas, but there is 0 per cent. for anywhere in the Thames valley.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/5">It is not that we do not put forward great ideas and excellent schemes. For example, there is the M4 junction 11 scheme, which is ready to go. When assessed against the Government's own criteria, it gives very high value for money.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.2/1">I share my hon. Friend's concerns, particularly on his last point. In the Thames valley, the point has been reached where we shall not be able to cope with the additional pressure on our roads without more infrastructure investment. The M4 junction 11 scheme is a case in point, and it is vital not only for my hon. Friend's constituency, but for mine. At peak times, traffic can stretch all the way to the Hampshire county boundary, causing congestion on the A33 for constituents who use the route as a way to work or for business. The situation is set to get considerably worse, with proposals for 7,000 houses at Kennet meadow. Additional investment is vital.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend, who makes the point well.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/2">As businesses in the Reading area&mdash;big and small&mdash;will tell the Minister, no more infrastructure capacity is available, and only new provision will ensure that Reading and the Thames valley maintain their role in the national economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/3">We have seven major schemes for greater Reading listed in the regional priorities and businesses are asking me why none has had any commitment to funding or any time scale for implementation. Perhaps the Minister could explain why that is the case. I invite her to come to Reading and listen to what businesses are saying for herself. They are saying to me that we need transport infrastructure investment and that we need it now. One needs only to read the latest report from the Thames Valley Economic Partnership to see that.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.3/4">In Reading, we have a dual problem, involving both roads and rail. As I have said, roads are at pretty much maximum capacity in Reading. The problem is made worse by the fact that we have only two crossings over the River Thames. Reading needs a third bridge, which will make a north-south bypass for the town.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.0/1">I remind Members of my entry in the Register of Members' Interests. This year is the 10th anniversary of the opening of the Newbury bypass, which has made an enormous difference to the sustained economic viability of the community at the centre of my constituency. That has dealt with the north-south problem. We now have an east-west problem, which my hon. Friend has highlighted in relation to the M4. I firmly support what he says about the need to consider the difficulties faced by traffic on the M4 if we are to maintain the prosperity of the region.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.131.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="131"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h04.htm#60111h04_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.131.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful intervention. He makes the point very well. As in Newbury, the north-south bypass in Reading is extremely important to the sustained viability and economic success of the town. The problem that we face is that the boundaries of four local authorities are involved. We cannot start planning for another Thames bridge unless those four authorities come to an agreement because access to the bridge will involve infrastructure in all four of those local authority areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/2">Until recently the Government have not expressed a view on the need for the additional north-south Thames capacity, so some local authorities have pursued specific local, rather than regional or national, agendas and have tried to dismiss any third Thames bridge scheme through their own structure plan process. Fortunately, following a study in 2003, the Secretary of State for Transport agreed that the issue of the north-south routes over the Thames in Reading needed to be resolved. He required the authorities concerned to come together in quantifying the problem and identifying and delivering a solution, which all political parties in the town have welcomed. That has led to some progress in terms of some cross-boundary meetings of officers and lead councillors on a reasonably regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/3">However, the process has been painfully slow and it appears that, for every two steps forwards, there are three steps backwards&mdash;mainly because of the view of South Oxfordshire district council, which is being incredibly parochial about this matter. Meanwhile, Reading borough council is adopting strategies that prioritise local traffic in Reading, obviously to the detriment of through traffic. We have now reached the point at which we desperately need direct Government intervention to break the logjam between those local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/4">Business is saying that it needs answers to these questions and it needs them urgently. It needs a time frame from Government for the preliminary work to be completed and for a scheme to progress. At the moment, it seems that we can settle the problems of a civil war in Ireland, but not the difference between two of our local authorities. It is preposterous.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/5">My suspicions about Reading's roads having a negative impact on business were confirmed when I recently had a meeting with the managing director of Hewlett- Packard in the UK. His company has just announced that it is pulling out of Reading, taking more than 1,000 jobs with it. The Hewlett-Packard site lies to the south of Reading, which is just outside my constituency, by junction 11 of the M4. The managing director told me that one of the main reasons&mdash;admittedly not the only reason&mdash;for moving away from south Reading was the terrible traffic congestion at junction 11.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Does he share my disappointment that much of today's traffic congestion is caused by poor estimates of future traffic growth by the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency? Does he share my concern that not enough money is being invested by the Highways Agency in vital road schemes throughout the country?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.132.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" speakername="Robert Wilson" colnum="132"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h04.htm#60111h04_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.132.1/1">I share my hon. Friend's disappointment. There seems to be a failure to get those numbers right in the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/2">Huge queues have developed at junction 11. One of the main reasons that Hewlett-Packard finally decided to up sticks and move out was that its staff were sometimes sitting for hours in these queues, which is not sustainable for staff productivity in any company. Over the years, Hewlett-Packard says that millions of pounds were wasted by staff sitting in traffic. Not only that, staff were increasingly dissatisfied about their quality of life. No one likes to spend two hours plus sitting in their car trying to get to work in the morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/3">The impact of the lack of investment in transport infrastructure is seen on the ground in Reading today. Junction 11 has long been identified as a problem&mdash;since 1999, anyway. It is a key gateway to Reading, and both Woking district council and Reading borough council have put in first-class bids to resolve the issue. Those bids passed all the Department for Transport's assessment criteria.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/4">Great hopes were raised in 2004 when the Government accepted the junction 11 scheme and the Department allocated some funding. On that basis, Reading borough council spent &pound;6 million on structural reviews, geotechnical surveys, contamination works, landscape architecture and so forth, which is equivalent to 12 per cent. of Reading's council tax: a huge investment for the local authority to undertake. The scheme was then delayed for a public inquiry on the basis of a complaint from one individual. We do not know the result of the inquiry, but funding for the scheme has been suspended in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/5">The business community in the Thames valley and Reading needs a message of reassurance from the Minister. We need a positive decision about the junction capacity improvement. The scheme is supported in the east by BAA and in the west by Vodaphone in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase>. We would like to know when there will be a decision. Are the Government prepared for the adverse affects to actual and perceived business confidence if that decision is negative or is positive but not implemented particularly quickly? Perhaps the Minister will deal with that in her response.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/6">There is also a significant problem with Reading railway station. As the Minister is probably aware, Reading is the second busiest station outside London, providing direct train services to more than 360 towns and cities throughout Britain. More than 20 million passengers use the station each year. Pressure on the station has already passed saturation point. Put simply, capacity constraints on Reading station cause one of the major bottlenecks in the national rail network. There are not enough platforms or track capacity to accommodate the frequency of services, especially at peak times. Currently, the north-to-south freight services coming from Southampton mean that passenger services are often held up.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/7">The Great Western main line connects London to Wales and the west country. The problems at Reading station are considered by those region's governing bodies to be a paramount issue for them. As the Minister will know, they have made representations to the Government on the matter. We have a once-in-30-years opportunity to do something about it because re-signalling is required at Reading station by 2013. With that, comes the opportunity to resolve the capacity issues in a cost- effective way.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/8">The cost in addition to the re-signalling&mdash;the latter is already budgeted for&mdash;is about &pound;68 million, and it would offer a 5:1 return on the Government's assessment terms, whereas normal rail schemes achieve less than 3:1. To assist the Minister, I would add that because the Great Western mainline is a trans-European network, it could attract European funding. I would like to know whether that is a possible source of funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/9">Reading has the status of a transport hub in the south-east plan, in which housing and business development opportunities will be created. Improving the station capacity will be an important part of that change. A good proposal has already emerged, funded through the resourcefulness of local authorities. However, it is time for the Government to step in, with ongoing funding for the detailed design of the scheme and a commitment to its being implemented at the same time as the re-signalling in about 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/10">When questioned, the largest companies in the area say that they have located in Reading because of its proximity to the airport. Visitors to Reading are therefore astonished to find that we have no direct rail link to Heathrow. We have direct links to Gatwick and Stansted airports, and Heathrow has three links from the west. If Crossrail comes about, there will be a fourth link.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/11">We could easily have a link to Heathrow if we were to build what rail people call a collar at the point on the Great Western railway known as Heathrow junction. That would cost only &pound;56 million. The benefits to Reading and the region would be huge. It would add to the region's selling points, and it would reduce car travel as well as improving access to the airport. Reading would then become a hub for international travellers from the west of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/12">There has been no proper commercial rail study of the links to Heathrow via the Great Western line. The Government should undertake a realistic and practical assessment of direct rail access to Heathrow from the west. It could be done as part of Crossrail. I have said it before, and I shall say it again, but if Crossrail is to be of value to Reading and the west in general, it must be extended to Reading, connected to Heathrow airport and able to provide a fast and semi-fast commuter service into London. If it cannot do that, Crossrail might as well end at Paddington.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.1/13">I have spoken at some length, and I want to give the Minister enough time to respond, but if I had three wishes this afternoon they would be these. First, the Minister would pledge that the Government will intervene to press for a timetable between local authorities on a third Thames bridge. Secondly, the stalled M4 junction 11 would be given the green light immediately, or as soon as possible. Thirdly, the Government would intervene to get the Reading station upgrade properly scheduled and supported. I thank the Minister and other hon. Members for their patience. I hope that the Minister will come to Reading for further dialogue about these important issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1773" name="Robert Wilson">the hon. Member for Reading, East (Mr. Wilson)</phrase> on securing this debate. It gives us the opportunity to discuss transport in Reading itself and between Reading and the greater Reading area. As the hon. Gentleman said during the Christmas Adjournment debate, Reading has the good fortune to sit at the hub of road and rail links and to be within a short distance of one of the world's major airports. He was right to say that that is a major factor in business location and quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/2">Reading also has the good fortune to have excellent staff working in the transport office of the borough council. I congratulate them on helping to make it one of only five local transport authorities to achieve the top rating in the annual performance report and the provisional second local transport plan document. As a result of that, the council will receive an additional 25 per cent. of funding on top of the original indicative baseline allocation for 2006&ndash;07. That will help Reading to build on the progress made during the first five years of the local transport plan period, during which time it received more than &pound;36 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/3">Reading has received the highest level of Government funding per head through the local transport settlement of any local transport plan area since 2000, at an average of &pound;38 per head compared to a national average of &pound;13 per head. Over the next five years its local transport settlement will be 27 per cent. higher than the national average. It could, of course, continue to receive even more if it produced an excellent local transport plan and continued to demonstrate strong delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/4">The hon. Gentleman concentrated on three issues and I am grateful to him for giving me an idea of what they would be. I hope that I will be able to answer many of the matters that he has raised today, although I will probably not be able to deal with all of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/5">We all recognise the importance of the case that has been made for the proposal to improve junction 11 on the M4. Indeed, I met Reading councillors and representatives last year to hear about that. They impressed on me the fact that, as the hon. Gentleman has reiterated, that is the most important transport infrastructure issue for greater Reading. I appreciate that the scheme has had a long and sometimes difficult history and I am also conscious that, following the decision in 2004 to refer the scheme for regional consideration, there are increasing calls from local partners for Government to provide some clarity about whether and when funding for the scheme will become available.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/6">The Government have set out and consulted on proposals to establish regional transport funding allocations. We believe that that will give the regions a stronger base on which to plan and that it provides a better basis for informing resource decisions. Now that the principle has been established, any decision on the junction 11 proposal, as with any other scheme of the size, will be made when we have obtained advice from the region on its relative priority compared with other major schemes that are being put forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/7">Once the region has advised us on the priorities I shall be able to consider the scheme in more detail, to provide as much certainty as I can, as quickly as possible. As part of the process we will also, of course, take into consideration the inspector's report on whether the compulsory purchase orders and side road orders that form an essential part of the scheme should be confirmed. Of course, if the south-east region recommends the scheme as a priority for funding, it will need to meet value for money criteria, to ensure that we are using public money effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.0/1">Will the Minister give us some indication of how long the process might take? One problem that we have is the great uncertainty that is being caused. While it continues, companies such as Hewlett Packard will move out of the area. That company is not moving too far&mdash;to Bracknell&mdash;but the thinking in overseas businesses in the area might be that if things do not improve they should up sticks and go. A timetable would be enormously helpful.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="135"  time="16:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h04.htm#60111h04_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.135.1/1">The certainty that I can give the hon. Gentleman is that we are expecting the advice on regional priorities to be received shortly&mdash;in early spring. It would be completely wrong&mdash;tempting, but wrong&mdash;to pre-judge the outcome of the regional prioritisation process, because it is part of a much broader and longer term strategy to encourage more local, regional ownership, because of the size of the schemes, of what will always be competing demands for a pot of resources that will never be unlimited. Therefore, it would undermine the process if I were to jump in with comments in advance. However, I assure the hon. Gentleman that time is very short for conclusion of the relevant process.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned congestion. I am very pleased that Reading has made progress in tackling the issue and appears to be willing to make some difficult decisions. The fact that Reading managed to increase bus patronage by nearly 450,000 journeys last year is to be celebrated. Obviously, encouraging modal shift, from cars to public transport, is one integral measure that helps us to tackle congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">Reading has not just sought to reduce congestion through more buses. It has also considered, and is developing, a wider range of interventions, which has led to an 87 per cent. increase in the number of park-and-ride journeys into town. I congratulate the council on that, because, almost inevitably, whenever an option arises that might involve encouraging or incentivising behaviour or, in some cases, introducing disincentives for drivers to use their vehicles, there is always a degree of controversy. The development of park-and-ride schemes is not without controversy, but I am afraid that if we are serious about tackling congestion across the country, we will have to consider requiring some courage from local authorities. Reading has certainly demonstrated that courage.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">The hon. Gentleman talked about progress on the proposal for a third Thames crossing. I am aware that the issue of additional capacity for crossing the Thames in the Reading area has been subject to much debate. The hon. Gentleman is right that the Government have asked the local authorities to work together to address the issue and a group has been set up to take the work forward. The group has carried out study work that suggested a need for additional capacity and made suggestions on where any possible structure could be placed. I understand that some councils have expressed concerns about the study results, but further work is to be carried out that aims to address those.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/5">I fully expect that all local authorities involved will make a joint statement on progress in their final local transport plan second-round documents, which are due to be submitted by the end of March. However, it is entirely appropriate that local authorities continue to work in partnership to come to a collective view on the appropriate way forward. Once they have developed a suitable scheme and a robust business case, we can then consider any request for funding and that will be dealt with in the normal way in light of advice from the region on its priorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/6">The hon. Gentleman's third area of concern was the development of Reading station. He is right to say that Reading is a busy hub that acts as a major strategic point on the national rail network. Passenger numbers are increasing across the country, including at Reading, and in response to that the new Greater Western franchise will see a further increase of 20 per cent. in additional seats to Paddington in the morning peak and a 30 per cent. increase in seats back from London in the evening peak. That is in addition to similar increases introduced in December 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/7">I am pleased that local partners are working together to bring forward plans for the redevelopment of the station, which include the development of two new through platforms. It is a reflection of the &quot;can do&quot; mentality in the local partnership that it has been able to reduce the proposed cost of the core scheme, which builds on the re-signalling works, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and have brought that cost down to &pound;68 million. I appreciate that that meant that certain aspects of the wider proposals have been delayed but I think that it at least means that we will be able to take advantage of the opportunities that the proposed re-signalling works will provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/8">When the re-signalling work takes place, we will want to take account of the views of the region and many of the surrounding regions on the relative importance of the proposed redevelopment scheme compared with other major schemes coming forward from the south-east. I assure the hon. Gentleman that the Department for Transport has attended the Reading station partnership board and has been kept fully briefed on the proposals as they develop. As the business case becomes available, the Department will be happy to assist further in working through the proposals, although I have to tell him that no public funding has yet been identified for the enhancements.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/9">On the issue of access to Heathrow, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that at present the connection from the west is not direct. However, there is a recently introduced stopping service to the airport, which means that passengers from Reading can interchange at Hayes and Harlington without having to travel all the way into Paddington and back out again. The hon. Gentleman may also be aware of Airtrack, an alternative proposal to serve Heathrow from the west that would provide two trains per hour from Reading and Guildford to the new terminal 5 at Heathrow and to London Waterloo. The Department is working on the specification for the new south-western franchise. We are considering the inclusion of Airtrack services as a priced option within the new franchise so that those services could be provided if third party funding can subsequently provide for the infrastructure changes required. We are also continuing to discuss the scheme with BAA in the context of improved surface access to the airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/10">In conclusion, I reassure the hon. Gentleman that the Department has a good understanding of the transport issues that affect the greater Reading area. There has been considerable investment through the local transport plan and we are working with local partners to see how the major developments that he has identified can be addressed in the most cost-effective and efficient way.</p>

	West Yorkshire Police
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" speakername="Paul Truswell" colnum="138"  time="16:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h05.htm#60111h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.138.1/1">This is a sad day for the people of West Yorkshire and for West Yorkshire police force in particular, as we commemorate the ultimate sacrifice made by Police Constable Sharon Beshenivsky. It would be wrong not to record our respects to her and her colleagues&mdash;especially Teresa Milburn, who was wounded in the incident in which PC Beshenivsky died&mdash;and to extend our condolences to her family.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">Although we often join constituents in robust discussions with senior police officers about shortcomings in the police and their performance, we should also acknowledge their successes and support their efforts to sustain those. There are serious concerns in West Yorkshire about whether movement in the right direction might be undermined by developments regarding resources and major reorganisation. Those concerns prompted me to request this Adjournment debate, which Mr. Speaker has been kind enough to grant me.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">Crime levels in West Yorkshire have been falling. The division covering my constituency has made a significant contribution to that. In the past full year, April 2004 to March 2005, there were 8,383 fewer crimes in the Pudsey and Weetwood division, a fall of 19 per cent. for the year. Figures for burglary, robbery and theft of and from motor vehicles fell even further. The latest figures show a continuing downward trend. Police numbers are at record levels after falling for most of the 1990s, but we still need more resources to exert downward pressure on burglary, robbery and car theft, and to make an even greater impact on antisocial behaviour and violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/4">The recent assessment of West Yorkshire police by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary, published in October 2005, showed improvements across the board, with an &quot;excellent&quot; rating for investigating crime, and &quot;good&quot; ratings for reducing crime, promoting safety, and use of resources. However, the force's ratings in the areas of local policing and dealing with the public, although now improving, still fell far short of what is required. The handling of calls, for example, is a continual source of complaints from my constituents and, no doubt, those of other Members present.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/5">In terms of funding, the greatest concern is that once again West Yorkshire police appears to have been penalised by the allocation of an almost flat-rate grant across the board. On paper, it has gained from changes to the funding formula, and if it had been applied this year, the formula would have provided raw allocation for West Yorkshire of &pound;151.51 per head of the population. That is still below the allocations for comparable forces such as Greater Manchester police, Merseyside police and West Midlands police, but it is a movement in the right direction. Notionally, the formula would have provided &pound;320 million&mdash;a figure sufficient, together with a modest precept, to fund the base budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/6">Although some dampening was expected to avoid major budget cuts for other authorities, we did not anticipate the bucket of cold water thrown on West Yorkshire's legitimate expectation of a much fairer proportion under the formula. In total, &pound;14.3 million has been clawed back from the force to subsidise forces that would otherwise receive an increase of less than 3.2 per cent. That is the third largest clawback for any force, and it represents 10 per cent. of the total amount needed to support those forces below the 3.2 per cent. floor.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/7">The three forces most affected, including West Yorkshire, all contain significant deprived communities, and they have particular protective service needs. Last year it appeared that a greater emphasis was being placed on the formula, but this year we appear to have reverted to a rigid system of floors and ceilings.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/8">To compound that formula-funding failure, the change to the new pension financing arrangements has also hit West Yorkshire police adversely. Although it was intended to be cost-neutral at individual authority level, its impact means a loss of &pound;2 million for the year 2006&ndash;07. It has impacted also on the budget that the authority can spend before capping criteria are breached.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/9">Those factors have created a serious funding shortfall. To bridge it would require a double digit precept or measures that would seriously undermine the capacity of the force to move things forward as we should want it to. The force's latest estimate of the budget increase needed for next year is &pound;17 million higher than the funding available with a precept increase of 5 per cent. In fairness, the estimate includes growth of &pound;4.4 million in the areas of counter-terrorism, quality of service commitment and police community support officers. However, even without that desirable growth, the gap is substantial.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/10">I appreciate that Ministers cannot make special provision for individual forces, but there are at least three specific and legitimate ways in which my hon. Friend and his colleagues could assist West Yorkshire police to make up some of the budget shortfall. The first would be to fund a counter-terrorism unit. The second would be payment in full of the force's outstanding claim in respect of the policing that it carried out as a result of the <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> bombings in London, and the third would be the designation of Leeds-Bradford airport for security purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/11">The force's request through the terrorism and allied matters advisory group of the Association of Chief Police Officers for funding for a local counter-terrorism group similar to the one that has already been set up in the west midlands is still outstanding, and the force would be grateful for any influence that my hon. Friend can exercise in that direction. The current estimate of the cost of policing arising from the London bombings is &pound;5.9 million, which would make a significant contribution to dealing with the funding gap, at least in the short term. Again, I trust that my hon. Friend and his colleagues will smile favourably on that bid.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/12">It has long been argued that Leeds-Bradford airport should have designated status for security purposes. It has always been inexplicable to me why it does not. It certainly impacts on the day-to-day policing in the Pudsey and Weetwood division, which covers my constituency as well as the airport. As I understand it, designation would bring in some &pound;300,000 of additional funding. It would allow the force to provide the right level of security, and it would also mean that it would not constantly suffer from abstractions from the local division.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/13">Let me turn to the question of force mergers. There has been considerable concern in West Yorkshire about this process, starting as it did during the recess and with tight deadlines and little opportunity for engagement, especially by MPs. It sounds a bit like the Department of Health and primary care trusts, but I shall not go down that avenue. There were also concerns about a prescriptive agenda that makes merger obligatory rather than optional. I appreciate that the Government cannot ignore the advice of the Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary about protective services and the inability of smaller forces to meet the challenge, but I make no apologies for looking at the issue from a West Yorkshire perspective.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/14">There continue to be major concerns: the cost and funding of the restructure, the nature of the new governance arrangements that will be required, implications for council tax, fear of a levelling down of services and, above all, fear of a massive reorganisation submerging the thrust to develop community policing. To varying degrees, both amalgamation options have the same shortcomings, and it is incumbent on my hon. Friend and his colleagues to demonstrate why West Yorkshire must be merged when there are strong arguments, including the Home Office's own criteria, for retaining the present operational boundaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/15">West Yorkshire is the fourth largest force in the country and easily meets the Home Office's minimum size for a strategic force. It has demonstrated its capacity to deal with the challenge of terrorism. The requirement to address the need for protective services must not impinge on, or undermine, neighbourhood policing&mdash;that is a given. The fear is that the enormity of the work required to achieve mergers, especially on the massive regional basis that is being considered, will inevitably do just that. Inevitably, work at neighbourhood level will be diverted, but the resources available for dealing with yobs, burglars, robbers and car thieves must be maintained and increased, not submerged into some gigantic bureaucratic change.</p>

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.140.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" speakername="Paul Truswell" colnum="140"  time="16:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h05.htm#60111h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.140.1/1">No. The hon. Gentleman is not observing the conventions of the House. Many other Members would have wished to contribute, but it would have been invidious to select individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/2">The distinction between West Yorkshire and other forces in the region is reflected by the fact&mdash;nominally, at least, as I have already said&mdash;that it receives more Government funding per head than other forces. There are also significant differences in performance. West Yorkshire's score on the protective services assessment recently carried out by the HMIC was relatively high. It was the highest scoring force in the region, with a combined score of 53, compared with totals of 42, 35 and 32 for South Yorkshire, Humberside and North Yorkshire respectively. There is, therefore, an understandable fear that there would be a levelling down of services as far as West Yorkshire is concerned, rather than a levelling up, especially in the early years. Using the Home Office's own criteria, the option is easily the best approach for West Yorkshire, and has achieved a protective services score of 502. The Minister will be aware of the much lower scores that were achieved using the other two options.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/3">Some collaborative and lead force arrangements with neighbouring forces are already in place, and I understand that they operate pretty well. As the submission from West Yorkshire police says, such arrangements could be formalised and extended if necessary to provide extensive and robust policing to meet the requirements of the protective measures. That would satisfy that particular requirement without incurring the enormous set-up costs and disruption associated with amalgamation.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/4">I appreciate that that option requires creative thinking rather than a neat bureaucratic solution. It is not a no-change option, and its financial and operational impact needs to be taken into account, but its impact would be much less than that of either of the two options that the Home Office currently seems to favour. Policing must be tailored to geography and population, especially if neighbourhood policing is to be a reality. West Yorkshire has little common ground with neighbouring forces in its social diversity, culture and ethnicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/5">The Government recognise those differences in policing demands through the funding formula, if not through the grant system at the moment. Compared with other forces in Yorkshire and Humberside, West Yorkshire receives a relatively high level of Government support, which as I said is nominally about &pound;151 per head, which reflects the comparatively high risk of crime. Residents in other counties receive comparatively less support. In North Yorkshire, for example, the figure is &pound;83.73 per head.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/6">Although Yorkshire people are proud of their county and its traditions, in practice its local services have never been provided or governed at county level. We had the ridings, and now we have the diverse structures that have developed in more recent decades. The four counties have distinct and different economic, industrial, social, demographic and ethnic profiles that would present significant barriers to a successful merger.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/7">The regional merger option in particular looks and feels overblown. A service that has such an intimate impact on neighbourhoods and individual citizens has never been delivered by such a large organisation outside London. Without major changes to existing arrangements, the effect of amalgamation would be to equalise Government funding in the new police region, and to equalise the police precept paid by residents. That would immediately create unfair disparities in the precept. Currently, annual precept payments for a band D household in the region range from &pound;176 in North Yorkshire to &pound;107 in West Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/8">Using a crude equalisation approach, both the amalgamation options would lead to an increase in the precept paid by West Yorkshire residents by 20 per cent. There are other organisational considerations. Policing boundaries in West Yorkshire are coterminous with crime and disorder reduction partnerships and other community safety partners. All district councils have representation on the police authority that is proportional and reflects the political make-up of the county. The number of councillor members of the authority allows them to engage fully as members of the authority, as well as carrying out the other duties for which their constituents elected them. That would not be possible under either amalgamation proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/9">West Yorkshire has recently reorganised its basic command units. That was not a painless exercise, but they will, we hope, develop better neighbourhood policing and improve engagement with the community and individuals who need to contact the police. However, trying to get that right amid the maelstrom of a major strategic reorganisation would traumatise any student of local government and services and fill them with trepidation. It certainly has that effect on this student of local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/10">The regional amalgamation of personnel would be on an unprecedented scale in mainland policing outside the Metropolitan police. Integrating two different sets of systems and work forces would be difficult enough; integrating four would be a mammoth and elusive challenge. It would certainly, whether fairly or unfairly, be blamed for every shortcoming in service at every level for the foreseeable future. A regional force would feel very remote to the public. It would not have a firm political identity and would not share any current boundaries with partners. Most of the amalgamated force would be concentrated in the south-west of the region, which would be a bone of contention with residents and the force in the rest of the region. We want to avoid that sort of resentment.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/11">In summary, those are the principal reasons why West Yorkshire police authority, West Yorkshire police force, councils in West Yorkshire, MPs such as myself who are present, and those who are not, feel that West Yorkshire, in the Home Office's own terms and beyond, meets the challenges of providing protective services while continuing to develop effective neighbourhood policing. It would be a great irony and perversity if in striving to address the demand and needs of protective services, we were to undermine policing at the grass-roots, neighbourhood level.</p>

	<p pid="a.142.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate, and begin, as he did, by mentioning the funeral of Police Constable Sharon Beshenivsky, which took place earlier today. I join my hon. Friend and all Members present from West Yorkshire in conveying my sincere sympathy and thoughts to her family. Her tragic death is a timely reminder to us all of the bravery of our police officers in dealing with all aspects of crime, sometimes, unfortunately, as in this case, with tragic consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/2">I welcome the fact that my hon. Friend has touched on some controversial issues this afternoon. I say that as a humble Mancunian facing the serried ranks of the force of West Yorkshire. It is important that we have this debate. Having what I hope will be an informed and constructive dialogue will be an important part of our reform programme. We need to engage with and try to understand and answer some of the legitimate questions being raised by hon. Members and the communities that they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/3">The effectiveness of British policing is based on the principle of consent. It is important, particularly through a period of change, that police forces are supported and understood in terms of both structure and purpose by the communities that they serve. Although the debate about restructuring has sometimes been caricatured as a move toward regionalisation or the creation of large forces for their own sake, it is precisely because we value local policing services that we are making reforms. A constant theme of my hon. Friend's speech was the need to keep the focus on local neighbourhood policing. I hope to persuade him in the next few minutes that that aspiration lies at the heart of the reform programme on which we have embarked.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/4">For most people, indeed for everyone, policing is about their local community. Many of the concerns that my hon. Friend expressed today centre around neighbourhood policing and the connection with local communities. People want their police to help create a safe neighbourhood for them to live in. Increasingly, they also want to have a greater say in setting the priorities for the police who operate in their area. That is right and legitimate. Any proposals to restructure police forces will build on that approach, improving the services that are provided to individual neighbourhoods and addressing the particular problems that they face. We are committed to providing dedicated, visible, accessible and responsive neighbourhood policing in all parts of the country by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/5">The focus for neighbourhood policing has always been the basic command unit and levels below that, and that will not change through the period of reform on which we have embarked. In fact, I contend that local people will experience an improvement in their local policing. The creation of strategic forces with sufficient capacity and resilience to deal with major investigations or public order incidents will help to safeguard local policing by reducing the need to abstract officers away from policing local neighbourhoods to deal with those serious incidents, so it is to protect neighbourhood policing and stop people from being drawn away from it that we are taking the measures that we are taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/6">My hon. Friend used the word submerged. He does not want neighbourhood policing to be submerged in the process of change. I promise him that that will not happen, and that that focus on neighbourhood policing will remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/7">The real purpose of our reforms is to create police forces that are committed to local policing, but have the necessary capacity and resilience to respond effectively to serious crime or public order incidents whenever they happen. We need forces that can be more proactive in countering organised criminal networks&mdash;by gathering the intelligence that is needed to understand and pre-empt their activities in communities&mdash;while working consistently to national standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/8">This is not an academic exercise in redrawing boundaries on a map. We need a fundamental change in our approach to terrorism, serious and organised crime, civil contingencies and emergency planning, public order and other protective services. It must be more strategic, but must have neighbourhood policing very much at its heart.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/9">My hon. Friend mentioned the report &quot;Closing the Gap&quot; produced by Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary. It is an extensive examination of how effectively the protective services are currently provided. The expert and independent advice given in the report was that, given that the current structure of policing is no longer fit for purpose, strategic forces offer the best business solution. HMIC concluded that if nothing were done, the situation would be likely to worsen rather than to improve in that, increasingly, resources would be drawn away from neighbourhoods in order to provide protective services. It found that larger forces&mdash;my hon. Friend mentioned the figures: those with at least 4,000 officers or 6,000 staff&mdash;are more likely to have the capacity and resilience needed to cope with the demands of cross-border crime without abstracting from local policing. Below that level, forces are not considered to have the critical mass to provide the protective services that all communities require.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/10">To achieve the reforms, the process needs to be owned and led by the police service itself. I do not have a blueprint for reorganisation, nor does my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. I accept that the time scales that have been set for the process are challenging. Police forces and authorities have been working extremely hard, and I am grateful, as is the Home Secretary, to all, including those in West Yorkshire, who have contributed to the process, for all the work that has gone on and the efforts that have been made to identify the options for restructuring. Some forces and authorities have been extremely proactive and creative in the ways in which they have sought to engage with the public and sound them out about the proposals. There has been a high level of consultation throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/11">We need to keep to the challenging time scale. This is an important discussion, but we do not want it to detract from the important business of day-to-day policing; we do not want it to sap morale, and we do not want the police to lose their core focus on protecting the public. Going forward, we will need to consider a range of issues. My hon. Friend mentioned a number of them. I cannot dwell on the detail of the answers this afternoon, but I acknowledge that important questions have been asked and that we are determined to get a proper response to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">Going back to what the Minister said a few minutes ago, the crux of the concern in West Yorkshire is that the force easily meets the minimum level that would satisfy the requirements of the HMIC. He mentioned 4,000 officers. I think that there are 5,700 in West Yorkshire, so that is not marginal; it easily meets the criteria. I should be grateful if my hon. Friend would explore why West Yorkshire is still being pushed down the road of amalgamation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.144.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="144"  time="16:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h05.htm#60111h05_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.144.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point and reads my mind. He is right, and I can give the precise figure. The current strength of West Yorkshire is 5,671 officers and 3,452 staff, a total of 9,123, so the force fulfils the criterion set down by HMIC on its own. However, that is only one of a number of criteria, and my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has made it clear that any force standing alone should not do so to the detriment of other forces within a particular region. There is a balance to be struck.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/2">There are two other options, which I shall mention. The option of the stand-alone police authority and force for West Yorkshire has not been dismissed. That will be evaluated as part of the whole process. Two options have come forward: one for a regional force and the other for two forces based on the current system with West Yorkshire police merging with North Yorkshire police and South Yorkshire police merging with Humberside police. Those options will be evaluated properly and we shall continue to engage in discussion of them. My hon. Friend is right. On its own, West Yorkshire police fulfils the criteria, but we must take account of the wider context.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/3">I hope that my hon. Friend understands that it is not possible in the context of this debate to comment further on the details or merits of the proposals. We must continue to evaluate all the options carefully to ensure that we have a coherent system for West Yorkshire and the whole of England and Wales. We want to continue to work with local forces, police authorities, other bodies and Members of Parliament in that discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/4">My hon. Friend raised a number of issues about finance and I want to respond to them in the time that I have left. He spoke particularly about the estimated loss of some &pound;14 million in each of the next two years compared with what the raw grant would have given to the West Yorkshire authority. It is true that had it been just the grant the figure would have been higher. However, we set a floor of 3.2 per cent. for next year and 3.7 per cent. for the following year. In setting that floor, there are winners and losers and the money must come from the pot. I freely acknowledge that a tough decision must be taken, but we are clear that we want all parts of the country to benefit from the considerable increase in funding for the police in recent years&mdash;a 27 per cent. increase in real terms since 1997 with a huge cash increase and more police on the front line. We have had to take a balanced view about that. West Yorkshire police has benefited enormously overall from that extra investment. We want all areas to benefit and we have had to make a balanced judgment. The decision was tough but we believe that it is the right decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/5">I confirm to my hon. Friend the application for special grant for the cost of policing in the period immediately after <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> and join him in commending the police on the careful, sensitive and robust way in which they dealt with many of the issues. That application is still being considered and as soon as a decision is made we will convey it to the police authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/6">My hon. Friend also mentioned counter-terrorism units and asked whether there was a possibility of funding for such a unit in West Yorkshire. That will be considered as part of the roll-out of counter-terrorism units throughout the country but it plays into the debate about future force structure and we cannot have one debate without the other. However, I acknowledge the importance of my hon. Friend's point, which has registered strongly with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/7">I cannot make a promise to my hon. Friend about the designation of Leeds-Bradford airport although I acknowledge that issues arise. I have an airport in my constituency and am familiar with the sort of issues that he raised. I promise to look carefully again at the matter and will write to him setting out our detailed thinking behind the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/8">I acknowledge that many difficult issues must be addressed in the restructuring process. Crime is still too high despite the fact that we have reduced it by 35 per cent. in recent years. We need police forces that can deal with bigger issues of counter-terrorism and organised crime as well as the bread-and-butter, day-in, day-out issues of neighbourhood policing. As we go forward we seek a force structure that enables us to do both so that my hon. Friend's constituents can rely on a police service that meets all their protective needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.1/10" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
