<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.86.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2001" speakername="David Hamilton" colnum="86"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h01.htm#60111h01_spnew36">
	<p pid="a.86.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> for bringing the debate to the House. Like many hon. Members present, I was part of the debate that took place previously on the Scottish Affairs Committee report. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" name="John Robertson">my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West (John Robertson)</phrase> said, many of the recommendations in that report could be taken forward with regard to a UK position. There are differences in the market in Scotland, but I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will consider the essence of the report when examining the energy review.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">I am mindful of your comments about the time remaining, Mr. Cook. The debate is about both the energy review and coal, and I would like to talk about some of the other issues relating to coal. When the comment was made about &quot;old king coal&quot;, I felt myself sliding down in my seat, because I am sometimes referred to as old king coal.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">With regard to the security of energy for the United Kingdom, alternative energy sources must be considered. In Scotland, hydro is about 6 per cent. of the market. Hon. Members have referred to nuclear, to renewables, including wind&mdash;wave power has not been referred to&mdash;to gas and coal and to security of energy. There was the problem that we faced at the beginning of the year. Every national newspaper carried the same headline, which was &quot;Russia turns off the gas to Europe&quot;. The issue was not just about the UK. Politicians throughout Europe did not really care about Ukraine; they were much more concerned about the pipe coming through into Europe. Many of us have been saying for many years&mdash;I do not say that with any glee&mdash;that the most important issue that we must face is Britain's dependence on sources of energy coming from abroad. That debate must take place in much more detail, and I am glad to see that there will be a debate on Thursday, although there is only a one-line Whip.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">As politicians, we must decide on the principle of whether we leave ourselves being dictated to by other countries or, indeed, whether we leave ourselves to market forces. I do not believe that either situation is acceptable to us. Or do we rely on our own resources, knowing that there will be a cost to that decision? That is important. It has been alluded to on a couple of occasions that whatever decision is made, there will be a cost factor. If we make a decision about self-reliance in the UK, there will be a cost to that, and we must bear that in mind, not only for consumers but for business and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/5">We need to consider what is happening throughout the world and especially in China, which has become the engine house of the world. According to the 2002 statistics&mdash;not the latest ones&mdash;1,393 billion tonnes of coal were produced in China. Germany is the biggest European producer, producing 207 million tonnes. The UK is right down the line again, producing only 30 million tonnes.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/6">It is also important to realise that several European countries produce coal, about one or two of which I was surprised. They produce coal on a greater scale than the United Kingdom does&mdash;not just Germany, but also Poland, with 161 million tonnes, Greece, with 71 million tonnes, and the Czech Republic, with 63 million tonnes. We are therefore in a market within the European network. Recognising that that is important. Britain, which has used only 15 per cent. of its coal resources, has some of the biggest reserves within Europe. At the end of the day, that we have not improved on our position is a tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/7">In many instances we are at the cutting edge of developing new coal technology, but at the same time the coal industry is on its knees. That that is happening is a contradiction in terms and, to me, ironic. We have the transport and the expertise, which we have developed along with other European countries, but at the same time we are not paying heed to our own coal industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/8">There are a number of issues that I will come on to, and one is about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the Glencoe station. The hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase> said that there were objections when it went ahead. There will be. There are objections to every single thing that is proposed in relation to energy, whether that be open-cast, wind farms or tidal. There will be objections to hydro, which is very attractive in Scotland. The decision was made many years ago about hydro. Indeed, the organisation that represents renewables within Scotland has indicated that hydro could take up at least 20 per cent. of Scotland's needs, and in the renewable market it is talking in terms of 40 per cent. of Scotland's needs being met by renewables.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/9">The wider base brings in not only energy, but the Department of Trade and Industry. What about when planned applications go forward for housing and so on? Industrial units are being built to specifications with the worst common denominator. They are not built with a specification that includes ensuring that there is heat retention, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/10">I will give some examples. Midlothian council is a good example, with a housing stock of 7,500 council houses. Every such house in Midlothian has wall cavity filling, insulation in its attic and double glazing. Each house had to have all such things installed after the houses were built. Could the planning process not have been better? Building contractors agree with us. When we talk to them about planned applications, their argument is that they want a fair crack of the whip, a fair playing field, when they make applications to build houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/11">If every housing contractor across the UK was told that when they build a house they must have cavity filling, attic insulation and double glazing&mdash;to make sure that heat is retained, which in turn reduces the demand on energy&mdash;that would be very positive. We must look more at how we save energy, as much as how much we can produce energy. That issue has to be addressed much more than at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/12">A report from a debate in the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs has another good example from Midlothian. Please excuse me for the argument, but Midlothian boasts an area including Monkton Hall colliery, where I worked for 20-odd years. Although closed, the colliery, 3,000 ft deep as it was, is producing substantial amounts of hot water&mdash;geothermal water. An experiment in Midlothian, with &pound;3.5 million allocated from Europe, is considering how to use the geothermal water coming up from Monkton Hall to feed some 230 houses&mdash;to start with&mdash;industrial units and a primary school. There is a possibility of expanding the use of that geothermal water to some 4,000 new-build houses. I ask the Minister to come along for a meeting, and, with the council, to discuss these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/13">There are 230 ex-collieries within Scotland, two-thirds of which have the potential of using geothermal heating coming up from them. Therefore, using old collieries can take us up to the 21st century, which in turn can develop a strategy for us.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/14">I am mindful of what the Chair said and will cut short everything, because other speakers took far too long.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">the hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank him for sending me a letter, also congratulating him on securing the debate, that he received from some constituents in my area who are part of the ongoing rural postal pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">This is about the delivery of the service. For many years&mdash;we have already heard this mentioned this afternoon&mdash;we have seen postal services delivered through village shops. My previous constituency had a post office in the village pub. I do not know whether that meant that people were picking up their pension and then spending a fair amount of it. There are also post offices in garages. The issue is about the service, not necessarily the structures and methods of delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">We are talking about the rural network. I want to mention something that happened 12 months ago in my constituency, in the town of Dumfries. When Safeway changed to Morrisons, Morrisons immediately decided that it wanted the post office out of the supermarket. There was quite an outcry, because it was a busy post office. However, I was quite astonished to discover that over 50 per cent. of the business being transacted through that post office came not from the townspeople of Dumfries but from people from further afield&mdash;from villages and some of the smaller towns. We are now looking at what some people would deem to be the Crown post office in Dumfries&mdash;the directly managed service&mdash;being franchised out to Spar supermarkets. To a certain extent, it has come as a bit of a surprise&mdash;although I am not totally astonished&mdash;that only 15 per cent. of the business transferred from Safeway to the main post office. The big question is: where has all the other business gone? I suspect that it has gone to a couple of the other urban sub-post offices, but some of it may have gone back to the rural localities from whence it came.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">The public want a service and, in general, they do not worry too much about how it is being delivered&mdash;whether it is in the village shop, the pub or wherever. We have to ask ourselves what we are being asked for. Is it a public service, a social service, or a combination of both? In rural localities, it is a combination of both.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">As I indicated, my locality is one of three in Scotland where a rural postal pilot is ongoing. It is what is deemed a hub and spoke service. In other words, from a centre&mdash;the town of Castle Douglas&mdash;the sub-postmaster operates the post offices in three villages. That started back in mid-September, and there was an outcry because the first thing that happened was that the hours were reduced. All three of the post offices operate out of shops. I visited two of them and asked the sub-postmasters, as they still were at the time, whether they believed that the significant reduction in hours&mdash;one of them had gone down from 21 hours to 10&mdash;was reasonable. Both of them believed that their new opening hours reflected the amount of custom that came through their doors.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">The big difficulty was the way in which the hours were configured. A Post Office member of staff goes from one of those post offices to the next to provide the service. Like anybody else, that individual can be in only one place at a time. People wanted the post offices to be open for more hours in the morning, and there was a great demand for Saturday opening. I went to a meeting in one of the village halls and by pure chance, nothing more, a retired sub-postmaster and his wife were there when the public were demanding Saturday opening. The guy stood up and said, &quot;People can make these demands, but the reality is that when I was running the post office nobody used it on a Saturday morning, so why do people want it open then?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/7">I will not paint a rosy picture; difficult decisions have to be made. Because there was an outcry, I asked people for feedback about whether the hours suited their needs. In general, the answer was no. I am a townie, and I was surprised to find that some people used the post office every day. That might well be the case. I even had people writing to say that they did not use the post office at all, but that the new opening hours were not right. I think that we would all agree that one has to respect people's views.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/8">The pilot is to run for 12 months, and it requires the co-operation of the shopkeepers. I have made the point on the two occasions on which I have attended public meetings, one of them last night, that if there is no shop there is a difficulty: from where should we deliver the service? We could use the local pub, or whatever the case may be, but we need co-operation, especially when we are running a pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/9">I do not want to have a go at anybody, but I must be honest. Two of the villages seem to be operating fairly well. The other one has been something of a problem, and that is putting it kindly. From day 1, one individual has been turning up at the post office with a clipboard and pen. I know that I said, &quot;Keep me posted on any problems that arise,&quot; but that is harassment and intimidation, and it is not required. The gentleman has become a prolific letter writer and he is trying to drag me along.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.3/1">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I came into the Chamber with the intention of supporting <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase>. Having listened to the excellent way he presented the case and to the other excellent contributions, I am moved to make a short contribution myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/2">It may not need to have been said, as it is obvious, but it is worth repeating how important rural post offices are to the whole of rural life and to sustaining the communities. They are important for two distinct and different reasons, both of which have come out in the debate. The first is the provision of services to people who need them, who are often the most vulnerable in society, whether through age or infirmity, and who would not otherwise have access to those services. Secondly, the point must be made in relation to the highlands about the provision of services to people on low incomes and without access to a car who live in areas where there is very little public transport. We assume these days that everyone will be able to use a car or other transport, but many people cannot do so, for a variety of reasons. Therefore the simple provision of a service is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/3">A wider point made this afternoon is that a functioning post office is often the last service to remain in a village, after the shop, the pub and so on have gone. It is the post office that keeps going. It is a point of contact, somewhere that people who do not often see other people go to see the sub-postmaster or postmistress. Sometimes that is how they signal that they are still around, alive and well. It is not uncommon in villages for people to notice that somebody has not been into the post office for a day or two and to go and check that they are all right. The wider good of the community is important in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/4">We would all like the rural network service to be kept and, if possible, enhanced, and I want to consider where the responsibilities for that lie. It would be easy to slam the Post Office and say that there is a vast conspiracy to get everything wrong, but we must be clear that in the climate that has been created for the Post Office, the commercial realities are inescapable. We cannot expect the Post Office to be a profitable organisation and at the same time to provide traditional services, as it has always done.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/5">For that reason, I welcome the pilot scheme that is under way in Caithness. When I was consulted about it I pointed out the pitfalls. In my meetings with those who were responsible for setting it up, I said that the number of hours being offered was likely to be so small that the outcome would be that people would fall out of the habit of using the post office at that time. That seems to have been the case. However, we should not criticise the Post Office for seeking to be innovative in putting forward solutions, and it should not be the whipping boy in this exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/6">I am worried about what is happening in Caithness. The <i>John O' Groat Journal</i>, a fine paper that I can recommend to anyone, drew attention in its issue of <phrase class="date" code="">30 December</phrase> to the severe problems that are being encountered through lack of service. They are not helping the Post Office's case.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/7">I had an interesting conversation with the chairman of Postwatch about a month ago when he told me of innovations in America, which has gone for the opposite solution of a fixed, unmanned station in rural communities. By using a card people can post a letter and extract things. I shall be meeting the chairman to find out more about that because it is another innovation that the Post Office may be interested in.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.3/8">The Government have a clear responsibility in these matters, and opportunities have been missed. One was the opportunity with the migration of benefits. We warned the then Minister what was likely to happen to footfall. We received assurances that the marketing would be even-handed, but my correspondence with every sub-postmaster and postmistress told me that they were unable to compete with the heavy marketing and telephone campaign that took place. We have a huge range of Government and local government services that we want to deliver more closely to the population. We have a network of offices with some fine equipment which are capable of delivering some of those services. Can the Government not put the two together so that delivery to our citizens could be made through the Post Office in a profitable way?</p>

	<p pid="a.120.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I shall now try to confine myself to describing him as my hon. Friend. I am not nearly as brave as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase>, who tried to say the name of my hon. Friend's constituency and performed extremely well.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/2">My hon. Friend has been very active and effective in campaigning for rural post offices, and I applaud him. As I said, this is an important debate, and valuable contributions have been made by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber. Why is there so much concern about maintaining the network? It is a remarkable network. We have heard that 60 per cent. of villages across the country still have a post office. The relevant figure is massively higher than that for all the banks put together. The network is a precious resource. My great frustration is that much more could be done with it but is not being done; it could be exploited much more effectively. Several hon. Members have made that point, to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/3">The hon. Member for North Shropshire and others have said that the network serves 12 million customers a week. That is a very large number of people throughout rural areas in this country. It is an essential service and that is how it needs to be seen. It is essential for elderly people, disabled people and people without access to a car. There is often a fear that the Government do not fully understand the problem of rural poverty. Government Members largely represent urban areas, and sometimes there is a failure to recognise hidden poverty in rural areas and the problem of isolation that goes with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/4">If the public transport system is no good, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">my hon. Friend the Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> mentioned, and there is no post office or shop in the village, one really is stuck. More and more frequently, carers who look after loved ones are completely isolated in small rural communities. My hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey also referred to the dramatic loss of business through the transfer to direct payments and the aggressive pressure on people to transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/5">It has not been mentioned that the core function of post offices, the dispatch of letters and parcels, is important for rural businesses as well. I have been fascinated by the potential growth area whereby more and more people are trading on the internet through eBay. When I visited two small sub-post offices in North Norfolk and asked whether they were seeing any growth of business from eBay, they pointed to two people in their 20s or 30s who were there to dispatch goods that they had traded on eBay. The fascinating thing is that those people were much younger than the average age of customers that we have become used to in post offices. We should not ignore that potential for growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/6">The other point that has been made is that often, the post office is part of the only shop left in the village, and it helps to keep it going. Without the post office, the shop goes. As a note of dissent from the other Opposition party present, I have to say that the decline has been going on for a long time&mdash;the challenge dates from long before 1997. One big problem with Royal Mail is that it has had no investment for 20 or 30 years, and that has affected the post office network as well as the delivery of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/7">What is the Government's strategy? I find it hard to define or identify it. In October 2004, Postcomm urged the Government in a report to be clear about their objectives for the network. Postcomm referred to the &quot;pressing need&quot; for the Government to decide what they want from the rural network. In a report way back in June 2000, the performance and innovation unit said that by 2006&mdash;now&mdash;there should be a framework in place to ensure &quot;continued convenient access&quot; to post offices. The year 2006 has arrived, but sub-postmasters and postmistresses are still waiting. An air of depression hangs over the network and those people running small businesses. No one has any confidence in the future, and we are still waiting for the Government to decide their strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/8">In March, in seven or eights weeks' time, the obligation on the Post Office to prevent avoidable closures of rural sub-post offices expires. That could open the floodgates for closures unless something is put in place. To make matters worse, the &pound;150 million subsidy of the rural network runs out in 2008. Post Office insiders say that if the extension is not confirmed soon, they will have to embark on a wholesale closure programme. Small businesses need certainty, and many sub-post offices will be worthless in terms of their saleability without the renewal of the subsidy. Still, however, there is no announcement from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/9">I want to highlight a couple of structural problems that pose a bigger threat to the network. Responsibility within the Government rests with the DTI, a Department that can hardly be said to have a core social remit. When it asks other Departments whether they are interested in supporting the network in some way, it gets a flea in its ear. Every Department's budget is already committed. There is no objective reason why Royal Mail, which is required to make a profit, should want to maintain the social network. It is a drain on the resources of Royal Mail, but it has an interest in keeping competitor mail delivery companies away from the network. The danger is that Royal Mail will preside over a declining network that it has no real interest in maintaining, and that it will deny business opportunities to small sub-post offices that are desperately in need of a break.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/10">That all points to a fairly bleak future&mdash;no wonder morale is low&mdash;but things could be so different if the Government had vision, if they were determined to exploit this remarkable network to the full, and if post offices were able to develop new business opportunities in the competitive mail market. How could the network be exploited? My hon. Friend mentioned the crazy fact that the Government are opening 70 new passport offices&mdash;an obvious opportunity for post offices goes begging. There are also real opportunities for local authorities and Government agencies to work in partnership with post offices, which would give them reach into so many deprived and remote communities. The police are conducting some interesting pilots in Scotland and Norfolk. There are also the Learning and Skills Council and health services. All those bodies could use the local post office to provide information and to establish links with communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/11">I mentioned internet trading and shopping over the internet. Post offices ought to be free to develop new business opportunities with other mail and delivery companies. These days, many goods are delivered to people's homes. The post office is the obvious deposit point if the person is out, but that real business opportunity is denied to them unless the goods are being delivered by Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/12">Sub-post offices often complain about tight restrictions on their right to enter other business arrangements; for example, the sale of pre-payment cards for electricity. I have nothing against their finding new, innovative ways to deliver post office services&mdash;I positively support such experimentation&mdash;but can the Minister confirm when he will receive the report from Post Office Ltd? I admit that I am confused. In a letter to my hon. Friend dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-05">5 January</phrase>, the Minister says that he is still waiting for it, but the chief executive of the Post Office states in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-04">4 January</phrase> that he has already delivered it. Perhaps it has been lost in the post&mdash;I do not know&mdash;but I urge the Government to change their mindset from one of contraction to one of taking advantage of this far-reaching network to help in the delivery of services to remote and deprived communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/13">I wish to conclude by posing some questions to the Minister. I would be grateful if he could answer them in this debate or in writing. Of most pressing concern: will the no avoidable closures obligation be extended beyond March, and, if not, what will be put in its place? Secondly, will he confirm whether the rural subsidy will extend beyond 2008, given the serious concerns of Post Office Ltd? Thirdly, what assessment has he made of the number of post offices that would exist if the subsidy were ended, given that 90 per cent. of rural post offices are already unprofitable, according to Postcomm? The east of England would be left with 88 post offices if 90 per cent. closed.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/14">Fourthly, given the structural problems that I referred to, will the Minister consider introducing a statutory obligation on the Government to maintain the network? The framework could be set for fixed periods, giving some certainty to post offices. Fifthly, will any pool of money be available at any stage for investment in the network, so that sub-postmasters and postmistresses can take advantage of the opportunities that could be available to them to help them make their business profitable?</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/15">Sixthly, serious concerns have been expressed about rumours that the Post Office card account will be phased out in 2010. Can the Minister give an absolute undertaking that that is not the case? What steps will he take to enable sub-post offices to build new business opportunities by working with other mail and package delivery companies? Finally, will he conduct a comprehensive review of the true social and economic value of the network, which still has not been done?</p>
	<p pid="a.120.0/16">To conclude, the post office network faces an uncertain future. Morale is low, and there is a sense of terminal decline. The Government give no impression of having any effective strategy to turn it around and reinvigorate the network. I hope&mdash;but doubt&mdash;that the Minister will be able to reassure us on that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-11a.125.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="125"  time="015:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060111/halltext/60111h03.htm#60111h03_spnew32">
	<p pid="a.125.1/1">I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman, if he will forgive me, because I know that we are tight on time and the Minister wishes to address many points.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/2">It is clear that the Government do not have a long-term strategy for the rural post office network. Without a strategy, sub-postmasters, sub-postmistresses and Post Office Ltd cannot plan for the future or ensure that rural services are maintained after 2006. The Government have made comments that ostensibly show a commitment to the rural post office network, and in an answer to a parliamentary question to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">the hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" name="Gerry Sutcliffe">the hon. Member for Bradford, South (Mr. Sutcliffe)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Government recognise the importance of the rural post office network to local communities and will not take any decisions on the future of the network without a proper assessment of those needs. My officials are working closely with Defra and the devolved Administrations to identify future options for sustaining access to post office services for rural communities. This work is still at an early stage, but I am sure that they will seek the views of bodies representing parish and town councils at an appropriate point.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-21">21 December 2004</phrase>; Vol. 428, c. 1616W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/4">The Government have made a firm commitment to prevent avoidable rural closures until this year. Perhaps that is not so much a long-term commitment as one to get them past a general election, but to do it they made available a &pound;2 million fund to support community post office initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/5">As has also been said, the Government made available &pound;450 million&mdash;&pound;150 million a year for three years&mdash;to help to continue to provide access to services in rural areas when they could not otherwise be sustained commercially. They have announced another &pound;300 million to help rural post offices until 2008, but they do not continue to provide that duty to avoid closures, which is what so many people have called for in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/6">That may sound all well and good, but it masks the frightening decline in the number of village post offices. The total number of post offices has fallen by 17 per cent. in the past 10 years, but the figures are even more dramatic for sub-post offices. The number of sub-post offices has declined by 35 per cent. since 1997. That is a drop of 4,600 sub-post offices in eight years. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1736" name="Norman Lamb">The hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb)</phrase> said that this had been a longer-term trend, but we need to get it into perspective. The 4,600 small post offices that have closed in the lifetime of this Government are more than have closed in the previous 22 years. That is an extremely worrying decline.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/7">The closures are partly a direct consequence of Government policy. The Government's decision to introduce pensions and benefits to be paid directly into bank accounts has removed 40 per cent. of post office income, causing many smaller rural post offices to close. As has also been said, the Government were not passive in all this, but actively encouraged people to switch to that system while saying that they were neutral.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/8">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1818" name="Owen Paterson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson)</phrase> said in a notable contribution, they were brutal about the policy; they recognised what the consequence would be. Indeed, when the Conservatives considered the matter back in the 1980s, when I was a special adviser at the Department of Trade and Industry, we rejected that change precisely because of the implications for small post offices. We decided that it was sufficiently important to support the Post Office network not to go down that route then.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/9">Direct debit payment was not supported by the National Consumer Council, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The end to cash benefits just hasn't been thought through properly,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/11">and that the new arrangements</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/12" class="indent">&quot;take little account of people's real needs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/13">Direct debit payments were also criticised by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters, the trades unions Amicus and the Communication Workers Union, the National Federation of Women's Institutes, which should frighten the Prime Minister, and Age Concern, which expressed concern at the considerable hurdles that seem to be put in the way of opening Post Office card accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/14">We believe that the Government have been hasty in pushing the policy forward, and we recognise, just as the Countryside Agency has done in a survey that it recently carried out through MORI, that these changes have had a negative impact, and are likely to lead to mass post office closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/15">What is needed is for the Government to have a clear vision of the future of the rural post office networks&mdash;a genuine plan for stopping closures&mdash;to ensure the longer-term prosperity of post offices. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire has said, not one member of the ministerial team at the DTI represents a rural constituency. The team represents Hull, Croydon, Dudley, Cardiff, Bradford, Brent, and Sheffield, and it is unsurprising that the interests of rural consumers are being overlooked when no one in the entire ministerial team at the Department that is driving the policy represents a rural post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/16">The Government should consider allowing post offices to offer more services. At present, post offices are not allowed to offer services that would compete with the Royal Mail, but independent parcel delivery firms such as DHL and UPS would welcome the opportunity to sell their services through post offices. Indeed, postmasters and postmistresses are in favour of that prohibition being lifted. It would be lifted for all post offices, but it would be of particular benefit to rural post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/17">As well as expanding the financial services that post offices can offer, the Government should also be more imaginative in expanding the role of post offices as a banking portal. They would then become places where people can access banking services from high street banks in the way that it is suggested that they can have access to the postal services of companies other than the Royal Mail. That would be more relevant for postal services that may not have a high street bank than for post offices in towns and cities.</p>
	<p pid="a.125.1/18">The Government have thrown some money at the issue, but they have shown little vision. While they dither, the post offices that are so central to the economic life of villages throughout the country quietly slip away. The key issue which the Minister must answer is the one posed by my hon. Friend the Member for North Shropshire: what is the Government's vision for rural post offices? We have had an excellent debate and I hope that we can now have some answers.</p>
