<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.71.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0001.htm#07101030000527">
	<p pid="a.71.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I pay tribute to him, also, for his work in highlighting the similar problems of Welsh seaside towns. The situation is different from what he referred to, in the sense that the coalfield and steel areas were affected by the fairly immediate and dramatic loss of a mono-industry. However, there are similarities. I know that the Government have thus far found it difficult to find an appropriate ring-fenced formula, but there are merits in considering some elements of what was done in relation to the coalfields taskforce. I certainly think that the Minister's Department needs to look more positively at the issue of an overall regeneration taskforce than its response to the relevant Select Committee report suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">The final point that I want to make about funding&mdash;I do not want to be too technical&mdash;is that seaside towns such as Blackpool suffer from the so-called pepper-pot principle of deprivation. We have severe deprivation in certain areas of Blackpool, but it is in pockets. One of the problems with Government and European funding and grants is that, historically, because of the practice of averaging out across a borough or larger area, we have not attracted the sort of funding that we need in that respect. That is an important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">The scale of the challenge is identified by Blackpool council in its response of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-05">5 September</phrase> about the taskforce to the Minister's Department. The executive director of regeneration, Jackie Potter, said that, unlike other areas, which are often struggling with single industrial market failures, Blackpool's case is more complex as it is the compound effect of coastal resort decline and socio-economic and housing market failures. She went on to say that the action plan was therefore designed to tackle these failures and drive regenerations on multiple fronts, based on an understanding that investment solely in developing the economy would not deliver the change required, and that a programme of housing renewal in isolation would not address the underlying causes of market failure. Likewise, she said that it would be crucial to reshape the town's image to attract a more dynamic population and labour force. She went on to say that that means renewal of the town as a resort, with conferences, attractions, accommodation and infrastructure, regeneration of the town centre as a strong sub-regional centre&mdash;that involves retail, education and commerce&mdash;and intervention in the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4">As I have already said, a problem in the past has been that figures have not picked up the deprivation. However, one or two snapshot figures will remind the Minister and colleagues of the scale of the problem. Official figures describe 29,000 of Blackpool's residents&mdash;a fifth of the population, and obviously a larger proportion in relation to the working population&mdash;as income deprived. Three of Blackpool's assessment zones, which are smaller sub-ward zones, for elderly people's living standards, are within the most deprived 3 per cent. nationally; 29 of the 94 sub-ward areas in Blackpool, amounting to almost a third of the whole, are within the 10 per cent. of most deprived areas nationally. Blackpool is rated by the Minister's Department as the 24th most deprived English local authority out of 358. My final statistic is that all 94 of Blackpool's sub-ward classes are within the most deprived 40 per cent. for ill health and premature deaths nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/5">The challenge of sustaining and building a community is also affected by transience. I do not have much time to talk about transience today. It is a major issue in other seaside and coastal towns. I shall give one example. In schools in two or three of my wards in the centre of Blackpool, the turnover on the school roll can be between 30 and 40 per cent. a year. That is the result of internal transience&mdash;people moving around within the town&mdash;as well as people coming from outside. One might say, &quot;Well, that is very bad, but how does it affect economic activity and regeneration?&quot; It affects them substantially because it builds up pressure on schools and teachers, and historically it has tended to lead to low skill levels, lower than average achievement and low levels of economic activity. Whatever we do in Blackpool, we need to get the balance right between civic renewal and the needs of the visitor economy and local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/6">There have been major steps in the past 10 years&mdash;I pay tribute to the previous Labour administration of Blackpool for this&mdash;by way of a new sports centre, a new business enterprise centre, and the building up of local institutions, such as area forums and police and community together meetings. Blackpool has won a series of awards, culminating three or four years ago in an award from the Minister's predecessor Department, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, for the top sustainable community in the country, Grange Park.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, my near neighbour, for giving way, and I apologise for the fact that owing to Select Committee duties I shall not, sadly, be able to stay to the end of the debate. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that, given the scope and scale of the problems that he has so eloquently outlined this morning, and the impact that Blackpool has on the whole Fylde coast economy, it will require the concerted effort not just of Blackpool council but of the councils of Wyre and Fylde, working together, to try to reach a genuinely lasting solution?</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.73.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10b.73.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.73.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" speakername="Gordon Marsden" colnum="73"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0001.htm#07101030000529">
	<p pid="a.73.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right and, in a spirit of cross-party consensus, I pay tribute to the support that he and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1668" name="Ben Wallace">his colleague, the hon. Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace)</phrase>, have given me and my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood on this issue. Of course, what affects Blackpool affects the whole of the Fylde coast. The good news, as the right hon. Gentleman has suggested, is that co-operation is developing between the councils in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2">What I have described is the reason why, since 2000, debate in Blackpool on how to become a strong, viable, sustainable economy has been a central issue, from the first suggestions of a casino development that were put forward by Marc Etches, the former managing director of Leisure Parcs&mdash;to whom I pay tribute for his sustained interest in the regeneration process&mdash;to the ideas coming forward for future use of the three piers and the Winter gardens and, finally, the major master plan that was produced in 2003, designed to address so many of the issues, which was instrumental in the setting up of ReBlackpool, the urban regeneration company. That has the distinguished international planner Sir Peter Hall as its chair, and an energetic chief executive in Doug Garrett.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3">We realised from the beginning that infrastructure investment alone was only a means to an end, and that is where the casinos came in. There was a need for an economic motor. Whatever people's views are on casinos and where we now go with that issue, the means-to-an-end argument must be clearly understood. The renewal of Blackpool involves, at its heart, the search for a new force&mdash;the development of an adequate and sustainable economic generator that will not just initiate but also maintain a virtuous circle of investment, profit, skills and jobs. Without it, even the most visionary schemes of design and planning cannot deliver the full and final renewal that 21st century Blackpool needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/4">Blackpool has had a glorious past because its energetic and innovative inhabitants understood better than almost anyone else the business of mass leisure, but we can have a glorious future only if the new forms of leisure and attraction have a viable business sense behind them. That, and no other reason, is why my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and I, the members of Blackpool council&mdash;nearly all the town's councillors of all political parties&mdash;and most of the major business organisations in the town, supported the idea of casino-led regeneration; it was the only big enough project in the past six years to be potentially on the table with guaranteed bids from multi-million pound enterprises, and the resources to make it happen. However, that that does not rule out, nor has it ever ruled out, the options of alternatives or additions to the project, as long as those pass muster in the down-to-earth and pragmatic arena in which Blackpool's entrepreneurs have always had to contend.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/5">That is why the casino advisory panel's comments and recommendations were wrong in January, and why its report was shredded by the House of Lords Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee. Outside observers, including Rachel Cooke and James Collard, who wrote excellent articles in <i>The Observer </i>and <i>The Times</i> respectively last August, have understood that if there were to be such a regenerative force, Blackpool would be the place for it. That is why the people of Blackpool were not prepared to take the decision lying down and why we received such a strength of support in the Lords and in the House. Again, I wish to pay tribute to Lord McNally of Blackpool, who led so ably our views and who has been a tireless representative of the town in the Lords and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/6">I do not expect the Minister to go beyond what the Government have already said on the issue, or to offer a review on the issue of the casino regeneration, but he needs to understand the passion and determination that united all but one council member and the vast majority of people in Blackpool, and which brought 11,000 signatures to Downing street. Those signatures were of people not only from Blackpool, but around the north-west. A recent poll in the Blackpool <i>Gazette</i>, which has been tireless in arguing the case for regeneration, showed that the majority still believe that casino-led regeneration might have an important part to play. The Government have a job to convince us that there are alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/7">The Government have responded to the controversy. The previous Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport set up a taskforce an <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-25">25 March</phrase>. The Prime Minister understands our problems, as do others. He gave a personal commitment to finding a solution as recently as the press conference on Monday. The regeneration review set up on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-11">11 July</phrase> as a response is in the Department for Communities and Local Government. The taskforce to which I referred presented a series of options to the Minister at the beginning of August&mdash;I am sure that he will mention that in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/8">The Minister needs to understand that there is frustration and anxiety resulting from the fact that progress on the matter has been slow. It is now six months since the super-casino debate and three months since the Prime Minister's announcement. The council has received detailed written requests from and has provided information and background to the Department for Communities and Local Government, but no meeting with officials or the Secretary of State has been fixed. My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and I wrote to the Secretary of State in August. The message to the Minister from the people of Blackpool and the broader north-west area is that we urgently need some movement on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/9">I shall give one example of why that is so. The best part of three years ago, we submitted a bid for the major renewal of the tramway&mdash;I am sure that my hon. Friend will say more on that issue. We have jumped through various hoops and we have had some funding for the tramway's basic renewal, but we have not had a decision from the Department for Transport. Council officials now say that the delays have affected their ability to complete the project on budget and on time. If a decision is not made by that Department soon, the funding schedule might slide, and the project might not be completed until 2012. I appreciate that that is not within the Minister's or his Department's direct competence, but it indicates the need for it to liaise with other Departments to look at what can be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/10">The taskforce submitted a broad range of proposals. It said at the beginning, and rightly so, that the existing plans would not on their own be enough to provide comprehensive regeneration. In fact, it produced a range of alternative plans and suggestions, including investment in higher education and the housing market, which could go a significant way to addressing some of the regeneration issues. However, at the heart of the matter is the need to give top priority to increasing visitor numbers and to the regeneration of the tourism economy. Blackpool could diversify but, like other seaside towns, its peripherality of 180&deg; means that it will always have greater challenges. A Communities and Local Government Committee report&mdash;I pay tribute to that Committee's Chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>&mdash;made many of those points and they were debated in the House in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/11">The Government need a greater sense of co-ordination on such matters. I am not in favour of setting up meetings with civil servants for the sake of it, but I shall repeat what I said in this Chamber four months ago: without some form of co-ordination between Departments&mdash;it is currently led by the Department for Communities and Local Government&mdash;and without a sense that people are getting out of their silos, we will not make the progress that we need to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/12">Some things have been done. I pay tribute to the Minister of State, Department for Culture, Media and Sport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1383" name="Margaret Hodge">my right hon. Friend the Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, who in her previous ministerial post brought together groups of civil servants from the various Departments concerned, but we need a more sustained mechanism, not only for Blackpool, but other seaside towns.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/13">Blackpool's regeneration must involve making it an attractive town for people to live in as well as for visitors. It includes getting the townscape right and valuing its heritage. I put forward a number of ideas on how we could do that in a speech to the civic trust in August. I am repeating what I have said on various occasions when I say that an imaginative Government approach to lowering VAT on repair and restoration, and an imaginative package of incentives for businesses to free up space above their premises for low-cost, low-rent accommodation, would make a big impact. Those things are in the air and, as I mentioned, next week an English Heritage coastal towns conference will look at the options open to towns such as Blackpool and at the issues of sustainable heritage, community and economy, which are linked.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/14">At the end of the day, we come back to the question of the economic motor. We need to have one to sustain the virtuous circle. In practical terms, we in Blackpool are in little doubt about what we need. We need a new conference centre, an upgraded tramway system and better direct transport links, an upgraded skills base, and significant retail and new enterprise investment. They are all urgent priorities. We might be able to build a conference centre, but we will not be able to sustain it without income and investment. The question of how and from where we get those things takes us back to the reason why there was such passion and interest in the idea of a super-casino.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and has given me the cue for what I was about to say. People in Blackpool are not sitting back passively and do not simply expect sums of money or master plans to descend from Government. We have imaginative ideas for retail outlets, restaurants and entertainments, and we have submitted an imaginative bid to a lottery fund with the aim of building the people's playground along the seafront, but we need some form of incentive to bring in outside investment. That is why the Government need to take seriously the idea of Blackpool having some sort of special status as an investment zone.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">We are not passively sitting back. For the past seven years, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood and I, the other Fylde MPs and many others have been at the heart of the debate and plans. I am proud of the passion, enthusiasm and dogged insistence of the people of Blackpool. Those things are reflected in the work of ReBlackpool, the regeneration company, the hoteliers and the StayBlackpool organisation, and of the pleasure beach, which has an amazing family history featuring 100 years of investment and innovation in the town. An active civic trust promotes heritage trails and conservation, and the heads of sixth forms and of the Blackpool and the Fylde college are fully aware of the crucial role that further and higher education expansion can play in Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">We have the support of the Northwest Development Agency. We have a commitment to raising quality among the hoteliers&mdash;the No. 1 guesthouse in Blackpool was recently named the top bed and breakfast in the country. We have a bid in for the theatre museum from the Victoria and Albert museum to come to Blackpool, with exciting ideas to put it in the Winter gardens. There is the people's playground project. We are not just waiting for the lottery decision; we are going ahead with the St. Chad's headland. Those who know of them may be interested to know that we recently had a highly successful one-off free concert by the Kaiser Chiefs, and what is still the greatest light show on earth&mdash;the illuminations&mdash;will be packing people in as a result of a combination of the activities of Dr. Who and Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4">Blackpool has always had to renew itself. It had to renew itself in the early 20th century to meet changing tourism and other patterns. It did so then through a combination of enlightened public funding, local government funding and private entrepreneurship. That model is still relevant for the 21st century. Blackpool is not looking for a handout from Government or a succession of subsidies, but we are looking for a leg up. We are not looking just for warm words; we are looking for proper liaison, proper co-ordination, a proper response to the taskforce report and a sense of urgency at the heart of Government about how that needs to be addressed. I look to my hon. Friend the Minister and his Department to be at the centre of that argument and to begin to provide some of the solutions.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.1/1">I was in the Chamber when my hon. Friend made that point earlier this week. I thought then that Blackpool wants one of those.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2">The Select Committee report mentioned seasonal labour. The Government's response was dismissive, yet when the lights are turned out in November, about 950 people will be going to the jobcentre. It is like a major business closing down; tourism is an industry. What we need from regeneration is a 52-weeks-a-year economy. We do not have that now, even though many people try desperately hard to ensure that hotels stay open for as long as possible. There are real issues about how to encourage our businesses, but that will have to wait for another day because I want to refer briefly to transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/3">It is essential that we get the money for the tram. The tram transports not only visitors, but people to work. My constituents in Fleetwood get on the tram to travel to work in the hotels along the promenade. The tramway serves some very deprived wards in Fleetwood and in Blackpool. It has been calculated that if the tramway was to close&mdash;God forbid&mdash;we would need 45 more buses every hour to transport the 3.4 million passengers who use it. One can imagine the gridlock on the promenade!</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/4">Investment in the tramway is key, but so is investment in the A585, the trunk road from the M55 to Fleetwood that skirts Blackpool. We need investment in the A585 to open up more land for economic development as part of Blackpool's regeneration. Again, I pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Fylde. He and I have worked closely together on that issue. The road starts in his constituency and ends in mine, and runs alongside Blackpool technology park. If we want more development there, we have to ensure that traffic can move on that road. At the moment, the traffic gets stuck, and we do not want that.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/5">I quickly move on to the casino. It is a key point. What other organisations are queuing up to spend &pound;400 million in the centre of Blackpool to bring in new visitors? I am waiting to hear. We want a new product for our visitors. If we had one that generated the income to support a conference centre, I would welcome it. However, the majority of people in Blackpool still think that the casino is the only product that will give us that.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/6">I want Blackpool to have a new casino so that I can welcome colleagues from all political parties to an up-to-date, new conference centre that will give them the sort of facilities that they need. That will bring back all the other conference trade and give us a 52-weeks-a-year economy. It will ensure that our visitors enjoy their stay, that our residents have jobs, and that they can enjoy the town centre and shop there. Blackpool could then satisfy their needs and the needs of our visitors.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.82.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1894" speakername="Chris Ruane" colnum="82"  time="010:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0003.htm#07101030000544">
	<p pid="a.82.1/1">I hope, Dr. McCrea, that you will allow me some leeway in describing the successes in my constituency and my home town and how they could benefit Blackpool. I shall drop Blackpool's name into my speech as often as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/2">I shall concentrate on two key issues that were mentioned by many of those who have spoken&mdash;the need for a focus, especially on seaside towns, on joined-up governance. It was a key Labour catchphrase in 1997, but it has drifted a little. We need that focus back, especially in seaside towns. I mentioned earlier in an intervention the importance of housing in the regeneration of seaside towns. Many residents have poor health, so health provision is important; and education and skills are key to raising the skill levels so that the people in those towns can get good jobs in their local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/3">The Department for Work and Pensions has city strategies aimed at getting people on long-term sickness or incapacity benefit back into work. Another key issue is that of policing. People will not come to the town if they feel that it is not safe for them and their families. My plea to the Minister is for joined-up governance for Blackpool, Morecambe and Lunesdale, and Rhyl and Prestatyn in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/4">The other need is for ring-fenced funding for seaside towns. I tabled a parliamentary question between seven and eight years ago asking how much the Government had given them. They have been very generous to rural communities in times of crisis and with general subsidies&mdash;tens of billions of pounds&mdash;and tens of billions have been given also to the coal communities that have suffered with the pit closure programme of the previous Governments. Steel communities&mdash;I refer especially to Shotton in north Wales&mdash;suffered the biggest layoffs in British industrial history, with 8,000 workers sacked in one day. Such communities have received billions of pounds, as have inner city areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/5">The problems in our seaside communities are just as great, and we need that level of funding to be targeted in our direction. In my area, in Rhyl and Prestatyn, we have managed to get objective 1 money&mdash;the highest level of European funding&mdash;and that has primed local projects. It makes a difference. It can tilt the balance towards investment in marginal cases. If money was ring-fenced for Blackpool, we could market the town and development sites and attract developers. Focus and ring-fenced funding are the key.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.1/6">Much has been said today about physical investment in transport, casinos and regeneration. We should also consider the people who live in those communities. In Rhyl, six or seven years ago, I set up an employment group, like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase>, whose constituency had 29,000 people unemployed or low-paid or suffering poverty. I looked at the figures for my constituency and in most of the 32 wards in Denbighshire unemployment had virtually disappeared. Some 50 per cent. of unemployment in the county of Denbighshire was in two wards: Rhyl west and Rhyl south west, which is where I grew up. We need to crack that concentration of poverty and the Department for Work and Pensions' city strategy pilot projects will provide some of the answers. If the Minister is co-ordinating that project will he take a careful look at the city strategy in Rhyl? I formally invite him to visit my constituency as although many of the functions of regeneration in my constituency are devolved, such as health, housing and education, issues dealt with by the DWP and policing are not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.89.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="89"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0004.htm#07101030000551">
	<p pid="a.89.0/1">May I say, Dr. McCrea, what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship for the first time? I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1425" name="Gordon Marsden">my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South (Mr. Marsden)</phrase> on securing the debate, and other hon. Members who have contributed.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">I commend my hon. Friend's efforts, and those of other hon. Friends, in promoting the regeneration of the area and especially their commitment to improving the conditions, prospects and quality of life for their constituents, and for visitors to Blackpool. Over the past 12 months, Blackpool has been in the news for a variety of reasons, particularly the casino. That was due in part, I think, to the high quality of parliamentary representation that hon. Members here today provide to the people of Blackpool, Morecambe and Fleet.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/3">T he Government recognise that Blackpool has faced deep-seated and long-term deprivation, with severe social and economic challenges over many decades. In many ways Blackpool's problems with poor health, drugs, alcohol, poor housing, low educational attainment and high crime rates mirror those of many inner-city areas. As has been said throughout this debate, however, Blackpool, as a coastal town, faces other significant problems. Many coastal towns have suffered a gradual decline over the last 50 years with a transient population, falling tourist numbers and the closure of hotels and guest houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/4">Blackpool is having to address a long-term cycle of neglect and underinvestment in the resort. But it is not all doom and gloom. I have taken real pleasure from the manner in which hon. Members, and particularly my hon. Friends, have handled this debate. It would have been very easy to feel bitter and resentful, and to say that everything is going down the toilet. However, as we have heard, Blackpool is a great place and has improved a lot over the last decade. There is the ambition to improve further still.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/5">As in my own area of Hartlepool, some people like to slag off the area in which they live. In the era of globalisation, in which investors can go anywhere in the world they like, the first things that they will look at are press cuttings and how people talk about the area in which they live. If people are constantly running down an area, I do not think that others will choose to invest there. However, the dignified, resilient and ambitious manner in which my hon. Friends have promoted Blackpool&mdash;recognising the challenges, but showing what a great place it is to live in&mdash;is a true testimony to the calibre of hon. Members here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/6">There is an increasing recognition of the importance of Blackpool at local, regional and national levels. Local partners are rising to the challenge and there are encouraging signs of progress. Investment in local schools and health services has resulted in improvements in school performance and improved health and life expectancy for Blackpool residents. The quality of the local environment is improving with cleaner and safer streets and public spaces. There is a solid base, therefore, on which to build the economic regeneration of Blackpool.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/7">Before I go into greater detail about Blackpool I shall touch on another matter. Hon. Members have mentioned the broader issue of coastal towns. As a Member who represents a coastal town, I would like to comment on that for a moment. The Communities and Local Government Committee report on coastal towns was incredibly useful and informative. However, I think that we have heard today that Blackpool suffers from unique problems, and I would be very reluctant to have a one-size-fits-all approach to coastal towns. My coastal town difficulties will be different from those of Blackpool. I have been to Bournemouth and Brighton recently. They are very different as well. That one-size-fits-all approach is not appropriate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.90.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="90"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0004.htm#07101030000553">
	<p pid="a.90.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a very strong point and I agree with a lot of what she said. The Government are reconsidering their response to the Select Committee's report on coastal towns, in the light of representations made to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government by the Chairman of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" name="Phyllis Starkey">the Select Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes, South-West (Dr. Starkey)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1424" name="Joan Humble">My hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, North and Fleetwood (Mrs. Humble)</phrase> is absolutely right to say that a cross-departmental approach is the right one to take. My Department is currently working with the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the regional development agencies. We are working with them on cross-cutting policy issues affecting coastal towns in order to see whether current co-ordination arrangements at national and regional levels can be improved. As I have pointed out, as a Member representing a coastal town, I am very keen for those cross-cutting initiatives to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3">My Department is also developing a regeneration framework as part of the follow-up to the sub-national review of economic development and regeneration in order to identify the kinds of places where regeneration activity might best be focused. I think that it is entirely plausible that those could include coastal towns.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/4">In an Adjournment debate before the recess on the Select Committee's report, my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South suggested that officials could meet a few times a year to discuss an agenda put to them by bodies such as the British Urban Regeneration Association, in which I know that he has an interest, and the British Resorts and Destinations Association on coastal town regeneration and renewal. I think that there is value in that suggestion and that that level of engagement could be important. We are currently seeking the views of other Departments on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/5">An awful lot of points have been covered in the debate, and I pledge to write to hon. Members who have participated if I do not get everything across that I would like to. I shall turn to the Blackpool taskforce. Following the decision not to grant Blackpool a regional casino licence, the Government committed &pound;1 million to the Blackpool taskforce, which was set up in March this year to look at long-term regeneration plans for the town. Representatives from Blackpool council, the Northwest Development Agency, English Partnerships, the Government office for the north-west, the urban regeneration company, ReBlackpool, and Business Link Northwest, as part of the regional development agency, have developed an action plan for Blackpool which was presented to the Government in August of this year. In preparing for this debate, I was incredibly impressed by the proposals in the action plan. I really enjoyed reading it and would like it implemented as much as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/6">The action plan complements the north-west regional economic strategy and the regional spatial strategy, and proposes a vision for Blackpool to be developed around three themes: revitalising business and enterprise, transforming access, infrastructure and the environment, and creating sustainable communities. Officials from across Departments with an interest in the programme put forward by Blackpool have had some extremely useful discussions with the urban regeneration company and with the council to follow up the report. We are now actively considering our response and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has said that she will meet the taskforce for a further discussion, which we hope will take place shortly. And as my hon. Friend the Member for Blackpool, South said, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has played a key role. He has taken a personal interest and wishes to be closely involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/7">The taskforce report encapsulates a way forward that covers both activity under way and new projects that could contribute to changing and broadening the economic base of the town and to addressing some of the most deprived areas within it. We recognise that this programme, which covers many of the issues that I had hoped to touch on&mdash;I do not think that time will allow me&mdash;depends for its success on a co-ordinated effort across a range of local and regional partners and within Government; I stress that there has been very active discussion on the taskforce report across all relevant Departments. The response from the council and the urban regeneration company has been extremely helpful in demonstrating the connections between different elements of the taskforce programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/8">The projects are being looked at in the round so that, for example, the relationship between improvements to further and higher education in the area, the renewal of the town centre and housing&mdash;a major interest of mine&mdash;is addressed properly. My Department is ensuring that all the taskforce recommendations are considered and we are looking at the sensitivity of timing on some decisions, including the tramway, which has been mentioned today.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/9">However, it has been made very clear today that there has been some frustration with the level of progress and the pace of change. Given the importance of ensuring a co-ordinated response, I shall go back to my Department and others and stress the importance of ensuring that progress is made and continues to be made. That is a major priority for my Department and for other Departments, and it has the personal endorsement of the Prime Minister, which I do not think will be ending. I give my pledge on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">Before I say a few words about this democratic issue, perhaps I could dedicate the debate to one of the finest parliamentary democrats, John Garrett, who sadly passed away just a couple of weeks ago. He was an inspiration to many of us in the House, and I hope that this debate conforms to that long tradition.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">The Prime Minister devoted his first White Paper to the governance of Britain, and he devoted his first speech to the House as Prime Minister to the topic of the new democratic settlement. He also promised the</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3" class="indent">&quot;devolution of powers and responsibilities to local government and accountability of our local police and health services to their communities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">I know that the Minister&mdash;keen to ensure that the Prime Minister's wishes come to fruition&mdash;will take those words very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">On the other side of the argument, Simon Milton, who runs the Local Government Association, has called for a &quot;constitutional convention&quot;, which I presume would grow out of the proposed concordat between local and national Government. What is certain is that any local power worth the name must be the right and property of local government, not of the centre. Local power that is loaned by central Government&mdash;by edict or even by parliamentary statute&mdash;is a sham, because it can be taken away just as quickly as it can be offered. Only Britain has such a dysfunctional political system that does not recognise local autonomy. Other western democracies take for granted independent local government that is backed by constitutional guarantee and genuine financial autonomy. Professor Michael Genovese, one of the foremost scholars of presidential politics, said recently, quoting Jefferson:</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Only on the basis of little republics will people be able and be trained to effectively participate in a mature democracy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/7">Those words are as true today as when they were first coined.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/8">As a result of genuine local democracy, people will benefit from activity and involvement locally, making a serious difference to the quality of life in our local communities. Given the reduction of local government over recent decades to little more than an agent of central Government, this proposal would amount to the largest denationalisation ever undertaken and the restoration to the public of their ownership of their own local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/9">The centralisers in British politics have had their day. Whatever success they may or may not have had nationally over the past 40 years, they have delivered neither economic nor social progress locally. I speak not only as an MP but as the chair of a local strategic partnership. We see short-term finance, interference, distortion of local priorities, people spending much of their time bidding or working to protect their jobs, and a plethora of schemes and bodies to circumvent local democratic decision making, which is barely understood by anybody but a new cadre of local professionals.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/10">Successive Governments have occasionally served dainty hors d'oeuvres of localism, but the main course has always been the same&mdash;a stodgy, lumpy stew of targets, orders and inspections that have been force-fed to local councils by central Governments of all political complexions. I hope that the concordat will offer us not more amuse-bouches but a completely new menu for local democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/11">Almost every business and every other democratic nation has concluded that the economic complexities in modern society are way beyond the capacities of a command economy. They not only speak the language of decentralisation, devolution, local budget holding, participation, and teamworking, but deliver its promises. The European charter of local self-government was signed by our Government, but its spirit still needs to be given form. Only the United Kingdom, and England in particular, stays stuck in a command-style politics that died with Leonid Brezhnev elsewhere in the world. That style is at its starkest and most wasteful in the central control of local government. It robs communities and individuals of the ability and ambition to run their own lives, and it has atrophied political parties of all colours. We know that that has happened throughout the United Kingdom, whatever else we pretend,</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/12">Free local democracy will provide more diversity and independence in our political system, in turn leading to more creativity, sensitivity and innovation throughout our society and economy. The mere removal of some of the worst excesses of centralism, such as ending the capping of local spending, democratising quangos, releasing capital receipts and adding a drizzle of &quot;localist&quot; jargon, has not been enough. We must put local independence beyond the reach of central Government, and admit that the gentleman in Whitehall&mdash;even if it is a Labour gentleman and a very good friend of mine&mdash;does not know best. Petty interference from the centre must be denied any legal or financial basis, and local government must be given unchallengeable legitimacy. That must be done in two ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/13">Ambition must be at the heart of the concordat that the Government are to negotiate with local government. It should be able to slot easily into its rightful place in a written constitution, when that day comes, and the vision must be powered by the Prime Minister above all. Local government must be a part of the vision that he has outlined for a new democracy. It must be driven by local government leadership, which needs to get off its knees and argue for two fundamental principles of its own freedom.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/14">First, to guarantee local authorities' independence, they must be created in law as independent and sovereign entities. They would then be able to undertake, as of right, all the duties and functions for which they are elected locally. That power should be further guaranteed by a legally enforceable definition of subsidiarity in the European constitution. I shall not veer into the debate about the constitution, but it would be nice to have one, and, if we had one, to define subsidiarity so that it could defend British local government in the same way that it seeks to defend it in the other European Union nation states.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/15">In that new settlement, local authorities would be able to do anything not prohibited by law, turning on its head the present injunction that prohibits them from doing anything unless it is expressly allowed by law. Like all public bodies, local government would have to perform its duties within a legitimate national inspection regime, and without infringing the human rights that would be found in a modern and comprehensive British Bill of Rights&mdash;another part of Britain's governance jigsaw that we hope will be proposed in legislative form in the not too distant future. Local government could therefore be held to account by any citizen for any arbitrary breach of those rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/16">The pull of centralism, however, is so great that even a Government who had created independent local government, as I hope our newly refreshed Government will, might succumb to the temptation to meddle unless such local rights were put constitutionally out of bounds. That could be achieved initially by an amendment to the Parliament Act 1911 that would allow the second Chamber to veto legislation that threatened the agreed rights of local government. In the longer term, such a fundamental bedrock of our democracy needs to be guaranteed by clauses in a written constitution for the United Kingdom. The American constitution provides a very helpful starting point.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.1/1">Rather that be critical of any Government, I would seek all-party support for where we go from here. If there is to be constitutional change, it will need cross-party agreement if it is to stick and not be unpicked by parliamentary statute. I know that the hon. Gentleman supports the essence of what I have been saying.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/2">I turn to what must be the second fundamental principle. Central to the concordat is that, while we may return ownership of local government to local people, we must also restore control to them. Political independence for councils would mean nothing without financial independence. The bulk of local authority spending&mdash;more than half&mdash;is now provided by central Government and only a fraction, one eighth, is raised locally by the council tax. That dependency must end. Central Government must be removed from the financial equation and localism given monetary teeth. To do so, a radical new settlement on taxation needs to be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/3">At present, income tax is first collected from local taxpayers by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs and then distributed back to localities via central Government. That essentially technical function of distribution has become politicised and arbitrary because of decades of governmental manipulation and the desire to impose central priorities and targets. In future, the same level of income tax revenue should still be collected by the Revenue, leaving the taxpayer and tax rates completely unaffected financially. However, the precise amount that currently goes to local government should be ring-fenced and go directly to it, not via the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/4">Central Government spending on local services in England and Wales is &pound;54.6 billion and the income tax take is &pound;109 billion, so in effect about 50 per cent. of the income tax take would become local, with 50 per cent. going to the Chancellor, as it does now. That redistribution could take place via the Local Government Association or an independent commission, legally separate and dislocated from Whitehall. Yes, what we did for the Bank of England we must do for local government. Such a body would receive local government's slice of income tax directly from HMRC, and be charged with distributing it to councils and equalising it on exactly the same basis as the Department responsible for local government currently does.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.1/5">There is no reason why most of such a commission's members should not be elected councillors from all parties. Local government's national bodies have shown themselves to be mature and confident in working cross-party and co-operating among themselves, and there is no reason why they could not perform the task. The amounts of income tax going to national and local expenditure would then be clearly identified on payslips as national income tax and local income tax, which would be a massive aid to accountability and to individuals in knowing the reality of what they pay for local services. It would be seen clearly and visibly, and therefore aid accountability.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.101.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="101"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0005.htm#07101030000564">
	<p pid="a.101.2/1">I suspect that the Minister's effective response to this debate will be short. In so far as the reconfiguration of local hospital services is concerned, I imagine that she will say, first, that such reconfiguration is a matter for local medical opinion, and, secondly, that Ministers will act in such matters on the advice of the independent reconfiguration panel. If the Minister were to say that, she would be wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">Local general practitioners are against the cuts, as are those hospital staff who have been able to speak out against them. Patients and local residents are petitioning and rallying against the cuts to general hospitals in their tens of thousands. In my constituency, local medical opinion is overwhelmingly against the proposed changes to services at Horton general hospital, but it has simply been ignored, and, although the existence of the IRP is welcome, it can, of course, only advise the Government within the policy parameters set by them.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/3">For example, the Government have given some clear indications as to what they consider should be the minimum size of a consultant-led maternity unit, although it should be observed that our European neighbours safely manage consultant-led maternity units substantially smaller than those in the UK. Indeed, the existing maternity unit at the John Radcliffe in Oxford is already larger than practically every consultant-led maternity unit in Germany, France, Holland and Belgium.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/4">I believe that everyone can understand, after the turmoil of the junior doctors' training fiasco and the somewhat patronising approach of the previous Secretary of State, that when the present Secretary of State came into office, he was keen to give the impression of drawing a line in the sand and to institute a year-long review of the national health service. I suppose he hoped that that would buy him time to sort out what was going on in the NHS, to try to understand why so much extra investment has led to so little by way of improved outcomes and, in the meantime, to try to shuffle off any difficult decisions to the IRP. Indeed, a study published at the beginning of this month found that health services in the UK are some of the worst in Europe. The UK is in the same league as countries such as Slovenia and Hungary, which spend far less on health, and is languishing below Estonia and the Czech Republic in respect of health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/5">Unfortunately for the Secretary of State and his ministerial colleagues, the approach of seeking to shuffle off decisions was completely undermined as soon as the present Prime Minister walked into No. 10, because one of his first actions was to appoint to the Health ministerial team Professor Darzi, now Lord Darzi of Denham. On the day that Lord Darzi was appointed, he observed to <i>The Guardian</i> that:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The days of the district general hospital...are over.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/7">Indeed, he went on to say in that interview that in the not too distant future there will be far fewer general hospitals in London, and that many of them would be replaced by what he described as &quot;polyclinics&quot;. Ministers have doubtless seen that the Government's proposals for downgrading general hospitals in London and replacing them with polyclinics have been attacked by the British Medical Association. Dr. Hamish Meldrum, the BMA council chairman, recently observed that costly, unproven polyclinics could lead to</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/8" class="indent">&quot;a damaging fragmentation of care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/9">Ministers would do well to reread Lord Darzi's report, &quot;Health care for London&quot;. On page 26, he compares productivity in various types of hospital. He concludes that the best results outside London are achieved by small general hospitals. On page 49, in discussing the proposals for more midwife-led care, Lord Darzi states:</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/10" class="indent">&quot;Prompt transfers are vital&mdash;the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists recommends that such transfers should ideally take fifteen to twenty minutes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/11">Lord Darzi clearly has not considered the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals NHS Trust's proposals for the Horton.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/12">It is not just in London that the Government are presiding over a damaging fragmentation of care of hospital NHS services, but in the rest of the country. Some 25 to 30 general hospitals in England are threatened by substantial downgrading, through which maternity services and accident and emergency services could close, or combinations of various services could be downgraded or closed. If such changes go ahead, hospitals will no longer be general hospitals but simply a collection of medical services.</p>

	<p pid="a.103.0/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. As I shall show the House, GPs feel that they are being not only marginalised but patronised as a result of the way in which the changes are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/2">The medical establishment's attitude, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> just referred, was effectively demonstrated by the dean for medical training in the Thames valley, who gave evidence to the health overview and scrutiny committee on the proposed downgrading at the Horton hospital. The dean was asked by the committee why it would not be possible to send doctors who are in training on rotation from the John Radcliffe in Oxford to the Horton in Banbury. After all, both hospitals are in the same NHS hospital trust. The dean responded to the effect that it would be unreasonable to expect junior doctors to travel the 26 miles from Oxford to Banbury. I believe that the dean was somewhat surprised by the wry laughter around the council chamber in which the meeting took place. Everyone said, &quot;Hang on a moment, the Oxford Radcliffe NHS trust is expecting huge numbers of patients and their families, sick children, concerned parents and mothers in labour to make the 26-mile journey from Banbury to Oxford.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/3">Indeed, on the trust's own figures&mdash;putting its own best case&mdash;it is expecting as a consequence of its changes that hundreds of mothers in labour will have to be transferred from the Horton to the John Radcliffe. I am thinking of mothers such as my constituent Alison Bentley, who enjoyed a trouble-free pregnancy, but whose baby's cord dropped beneath the neck during delivery. To prevent brain damage to the baby or death by oxygen starvation, Mrs. Bentley had to be placed on all fours while a midwife physically prevented the baby's head from being delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/4">In future, such a mother in those circumstances would have to be put in an ambulance and sent on an hour's journey to Oxford, so it is not surprising that the Royal College of Midwives is vigorously opposing the removal of consultant-led obstetric services at the Horton. It is not surprising that Judy Slessar, the regional organiser of the RCM, recently observed that:</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The RCM does not consider the Oxford Radcliffe Hospitals Trust has provided a strong enough argument to transfer services to Oxford.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/6">What the Government are presiding over is a fragmentation of NHS hospital services. My straightforward question to the Minister is, how do the Government explain to my constituents and the constituents of many parliamentary colleagues how a comprehensive downgrading of services at the Horton in Banbury is in any way an improvement in NHS services for the hundreds of thousands of people from Oxfordshire, Warwickshire and Northamptonshire who look to it as their local general hospital? Of course, perhaps it would help Ministers to answer that question if they could be bothered to come to Banbury, or at least to understand that the Horton is a general hospital. I am glad to say that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State for Health, has taken the time and trouble to come to Banbury to talk to those who are concerned about the future of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the Horton, as have my hon. Friends the Members for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, and for Guildford (Anne Milton), who has recently joined the Conservative shadow health team.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/7">When the chair of the Oxford Radcliffe patient and public involvement forum wrote to the Secretary of State specifically inviting him to Banbury&mdash;we must bear it in mind that the Government set up such forums to be the voice for patients and the public&mdash;he could not be bothered to reply. Instead, a letter from an official in the Department's events and visits unit wrote saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Regrettably due to heavy diary and Ministerial commitments the Secretary of State is unable to accept your invitation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/9">That is civil service-speak for saying that the Secretary of State could not be bothered to come to Banbury. Perhaps he did not want to face up to the local PPIF, which expressed on the record considerable concern at the lack of proper consultation by the trust. Jacqueline Pearce-Jervis, the chair of the forum, observed in a letter to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.103.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The truth is, as we all know, consultation has been minimal...the public are telling us that no attempt whatsoever has been made to talk to young mothers or, older people.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.105.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="105"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0006.htm#07101030000574">
	<p pid="a.105.0/1">My hon. Friend makes two good points. First, the Government have made absolutely no attempt to obtain a derogation from the European working time directive. Secondly, Ministers say that reconfiguration of local services is a matter for local medical opinion&mdash;and then completely ignore the views of local general practitioners as though they simply do not exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/2">Against that background of ministerial indifference and poor consultation, it is perhaps not surprising that as recently as a couple of weeks ago, during the Lab<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">our party conference, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>&mdash;another health Minister&mdash;was on the Bill Heine show on BBC Radio Oxford describing the Horton as &quot;a small cottage hospital&quot;. The Government's intention may be that it becomes a small cottage hospital, but it has for many years been a general hospital, and everyone locally is determined to do everything possible to keep the Horton general.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/3">I am conscious that a number of colleagues understandably wish to contribute to this debate, and I suspect that one and half hours is far too short to do justice to the importance of the issues. I want to focus briefly on the proposed changes to services at the Horton.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/4">At the moment, the Horton has a 24/7 consultant-led children's service to look after sick children. That came about following the tragic death of a little boy in the 1970s because, at the time, the Horton did not have the necessary facilities. That little boy's death demonstrated that for a sick child, Oxford is often simply and tragically just too far away. Following his death, Barbara Castle set up a statutory public inquiry, which directed that there should be 24/7 children's services at the Horton. What is now being proposed will take us back 40 years. What is now being proposed is that no sick child will be admitted as a patient to the Horton, and during evenings and weekends&mdash;bar about three hours on Sundays&mdash;there will no longer be any consultant-led children's services at the Horton.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/5">That will present every GP and every parent with a considerable conundrum: if they have a sick child, do they take their child to the Horton, which is nearby but might not be able to treat the sick child, or do they start the journey to Oxford? Ministers who are too busy to visit Banbury will probably not know that it contains three wards&mdash;Ruscote, Grimsbury and Neithrop&mdash; with some of the highest social needs in south-east England, and many people who simply do not have access to a car, so for them, getting a sick child to Oxford will be something of a nightmare.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/6">An indication of the trust's desperation is that in its most recent proposed service reconfiguration, it announced:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Transition arrangements should include an education programme to advise parents and the public about the new service and what to do with a sick child out of hours.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/8">Will my constituents and those of neighbouring Members of Parliament be expected to recognise illnesses such as meningitis? How do the Government explain to local parents that the removal of those services is in some way an improvement in the NHS? Without 24/7 consultant-led paediatrics, there can no longer be a special care baby unit, and the trust is also proposing that the Horton will no longer have a consultant-led maternity unit, but that it will become the largest midwife-led maternity unit in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/9">Ministers make much play of the fact that the reconfiguration of medical services should be informed by local medical opinion. When the trust's proposals were first promulgated, they were met with an excoriating response from the north Oxfordshire and south Northamptonshire general practitioner forum, with some 86 GPs supporting a joint submission in which they said:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/10" class="indent">&quot;We remain opposed to the proposals on the grounds of safety, sustainability and the reduction of access to basic health care and choice for our patients, which will affect especially the most vulnerable. We have little confidence in the process of consultation and the spirit in which it was conducted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/11">On paediatrics, the GPs observed that much of their discussions</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/12" class="indent">&quot;with the Oxford Consultants are centred around our genuine concerns about safety&mdash;we have highlighted these areas to them in a detailed and specific way. Their response has been a reactive and a rather inadequate 'sticking plaster approach' which would seem to confirm the fundamentally flawed nature of the proposed model in the first place. It would seem quite inappropriate to take forward such a flawed proposal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/13">The GPs described the proposals for maternity services as inhumane, and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Under the proposed model mothers who may fail to progress, or show signs of foetal distress in the second stage of labour, or who have prolapsed cord or haemorrhage would require very rapid transfer to Oxford. Given the numbers involved this would carry significant risk and would be inhumane...babies born in need of immediate resuscitation would incur a transit time of approximately one hour. The idea that paediatric cover could be provided safely from Oxford in these circumstances is false and dangerous.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/15">The GPs continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Without 24 hour paediatric cover locally, the A&amp;E Department could not continue to accept paediatric emergencies. If proposals to remove local emergency surgical services are carried through, it will also lack surgical cover for acutely ill surgical patients. The domino effect would lead to the result of downgrading to a minor injuries unit in the mid to longer term.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/17">There would be no accident and emergency department. The GPs concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/18" class="indent">&quot;We believe that these proposals and the tenor of discussions relating to them pose a risk to the overall integrity and sustainability of the Horton as a General Hospital. They undermine the morale of its staff and impact adversely on recruitment and retention of high quality personnel. Far from creating excellence in health care...they betray a lack of will, vision and imagination and consequently degrade it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/19">Clearly, it was impossible for the trust to assert that it was introducing service changes at the Horton hospital on the grounds of safety, when every GP whose patients were within the Horton's catchment area described the proposals as unsafe and inhumane. The trust took the original proposals off the table, ceased the consultation and established two clinical working parties. Somewhat bizarrely, it refused to disclose the names and professional qualifications of any of the members of the two working parties, which somewhat undermined any confidence in the integrity of their work. The changes consequent on the work done by the clinical working parties were fairly cosmetic, and if the clinical working parties were an exercise intended to persuade local GPs of the need for downgrading services, they failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/20">Giving evidence to the health overview and scrutiny committee, Dr. Richard Lehman and Dr. Emma Haskew, representing the local GP forum, reported that they had carried out a further survey of the original 86 GPs. Some 56 remained clearly opposed to changes and they could find only three who supported them, and that was on the basis that they were the &quot;least worst option&quot;. I am not sure what that phrase means&mdash;how does the &quot;least worst option&quot; differ from the worst option? I do not want NHS hospital services for my constituents to be provided on the basis that they are the &quot;least worst option&quot;. The present views of local GPs on the changes were well summarised in a recent letter from Charles Perrott, the lead partner of the health centre in Brackley, which is in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1529" name="Tim Boswell">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase>. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/21" class="indent">&quot;Many of us have seen cases where delays in treatment would have resulted in death or disability had the Horton hospital not been available...It is true that for specialised conditions the outcomes in the specialist centres are better, but one has to be able to get to the hospital first. The overall population-based mortality rates (as opposed to hospital mortality rates) will rise if frontier hospitals such as the Horton General are not able to provide the full range of general services such as paediatrics and obstetrics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/22">Senior local GPs are still making it clear that they believe that local mortality rates will rise and that delays in treatment will result in death and disability as a consequence of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/23">Another group that the trust must persuade about the wisdom of the changes is the midwives at the Horton. After all, they will go from working in a consultant-led unit to working in the largest midwife-led unit in the country. That unit will be 26 miles and approximately one hour's ambulance journey away from the nearest consultant obstetrician. The midwives at the Horton have made their views clear. The Banbury branch of the Royal College of Midwives, in a letter to the <i>Banbury Guardian</i>, stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/24" class="indent">&quot;The branch wishes to make it clear that the majority of its midwife members have expressed their support for maintaining the full range of maternity and paediatric services at the Horton. The current service provides true choice for the benefit of women, their babies and families...The branch notes an article of August 30 which quotes comments made by the clinical working group that the proposals were the 'safest option'...The branch does not consider the changes to be the safest option when compared with the present service. Over the past few weeks, it has been made clear through the Banbury Guardian by local women of the wide variety of situations that have been dealt with successfully by the Horton and that they wish the full coverage of the current service to continue.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/25">Since then, articles such as that by Professor James Drife in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> have been published. He is a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology at Leeds university, and he has made it clear that the lives of women and babies will be put at risk under the Government's plans to encourage births at midwife-led units. I am sure that the Minister has noted that Professor Drife observed in his article that thousands of women may need to be rushed to hospitals from such units if complications arise that put the lives of mother and child at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/26">The Minister wrote a letter to me in anticipation of this debate. It states that</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/27" class="indent">&quot;it is vital that the views of local people are taken into consideration which is why service improvement proposals are subject to full consultation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/28">I must tell the Minister that local people have made their views extremely clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.108.1/1">My hon. Friend is correct that such service reconfigurations are characterised, almost universally, by bogus consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/2">Local people make their views clear. Some 35,000 local people signed a petition against the downgrading of the Horton, which was presented to 10 Downing street, and I presented a petition of some 15,000 signatures to the House. The Minister will find that the independent reconfiguration panel will receive hundreds, potentially thousands, of individual letters from local people setting out the reasons why the existing services at the Horton are valuable to them and why they wish to retain them.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/3">Indeed, with the help of the &quot;Keep the Horton General&quot; campaign, ably led by George Parish, a local Labour district councillor, local people have done pretty well everything that it is permissible to do in a democratic society to demonstrate their almost total opposition to, and collective concern about, the proposals. Huge churches have been packed full, and there have been petitions, rallies and marches. We had &quot;Hands around the Horton&quot;, at which local people formed a huge chain of support around the hospital, but they do not believe that Ministers are listening. They cannot understand why the Secretary of State cannot be bothered to come to Banbury. They do not understand why <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" name="Ben Bradshaw">the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Exeter (Mr. Bradshaw)</phrase>, referred on Radio Oxford to the Horton as a &quot;small cottage hospital&quot;. If Ministers do not recognise general hospitals, there is a problem for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/4">Local people were totally bemused when the Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">the right hon. Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase> accused <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> of scaremongering by including the Horton on the list of general hospitals currently threatened by the Government. Even today, at Prime Minister's questions, the Prime Minister suggested that there is no threat to the Horton. That is deeply insulting to local people, and the Prime Minister would do well to ensure that he is properly briefed by Ministers and officials before making such ludicrous assertions. When Ministers in the Department do not recognise that the Horton is being threatened by the Government, they are clearly not living in the real world but in some parallel universe.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/5">Local people find it insulting when the Prime Minister starts talking about citizens' juries, and when he clearly does not know what is going on. Why do we need citizens' juries when local people have made clear their views in a 35,000-signature petition presented to Downing street, and in a 15,000-signature petition that I presented to the House?</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/6">A stakeholder group, including representatives of patient, community and public bodies, rejected the clinical group's support for the trust's proposals, saying that they</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/7" class="indent">&quot;represented a significant downgrading of access to services and a worsening of choice for women and children&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/8">Against the background of such comprehensive local and medical professional opposition to the trust's proposals, it was perhaps not surprising that the trust could not find a single witness&mdash;other than members of its own staff&mdash;to give evidence to the health overview and scrutiny committee in support of the proposals, or that the committee unanimously decided that the proposals should be referred to the IRP. Incidentally, that is the first time in the four years of its existence that the committee has made such a recommendation, so it was clearly not lightly made.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/9">One of the fundamental principles of the NHS is, rightly, equity of access, but if the Government's proposed changes go ahead at the Horton and at other general hospitals, my constituents and thousands of other people in the country will not have equity of access. Intolerably, they are going to have services that are less safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/10">Dr. Richard Lehman, the senior partner in one of Banbury's fastest-growing GP practices, describes the trust's proposals thus:</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/11" class="indent">&quot;It is as if a third of the mothers in my practice are being randomised without their informed consent to a kind of provision which has never been shown to be safe and on basic first principles is very unlikely to be safe. If somebody tried to carry this out as a clinical trial, I cannot believe that any Ethics Committee would give it a second look.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/12">Next year is the 60th anniversary of the founding of the NHS. If the Government continue to undermine general hospitals, they will be undermining a fundamental principle of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/13">There are concerns about whether the John Radcliffe hospital could cope with the increase in the number of sick children as a consequence of their no longer being treated at the Horton. Figures sent to me by staff at the Horton show that the children's ward was used as a safety net for the John Radcliffe on 18 occasions during July. So for more than half of July, the JR was full so far as new admissions of sick children was concerned, and had to refer them to the Horton. Indeed, statistics show that the Horton children's ward was also on call for Milton Keynes, Stoke Mandeville, and the Royal Berkshire and Kettering hospitals. July is not a winter month, when pressures are high. If there are no 24-hour children's services at the Horton and if the John Radcliffe is unable to take them, where are the children who currently go to the Horton going to go? Will they go to Swindon or Reading?</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/14">On a weekly or sometimes daily basis, GPs all over north Oxfordshire are told that the John Radcliffe cannot cope and that they should refer patients to the Horton. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">Tuesday 2 October</phrase>, Thames Valley Emergency Access sent an e-mail to many GP practices stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/15" class="indent">&quot;We have been advised by the Ops Team at the JRH that capacity remains tight today in all areas especially in adult and paed. medicine. As a result of this they would like you to refer adult and paed. medical admissions to the Horton Hospital in Banbury.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/16">Exactly the same thing happened the next day, <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-03">Wednesday 3 October</phrase>, and again on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-05">Friday 5 October</phrase>. On three out of the past five days in the last working week, the JR was unable to accept new admissions, and the Norton had to shoulder the burden.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/17">What about this week? Yesterday, <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, exactly the same thing happened. JR wanted all adult and paediatric medical admissions to go to the Horton, and said that</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/18" class="indent">&quot;there are also issues with Gynae&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/19">so GPs were asked to</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/20" class="indent">&quot;refer Gynae patients to the Horton.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/21">Exactly the same thing happened today. On the day of this debate, the JR is asking adult and paediatric medical admissions to go to the Horton. That rather prompts the question: on what day is the John Radcliffe able to accept admissions? If downgrading of services goes ahead at the Horton, it will not be possible to send such patients there. Where are they going to go? Who will be responsible if things go wrong?</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/22">Catherine Hopkins, a qualified midwife who is now a solicitor in Oxford, has a practice that is devoted almost entirely to helping parents of children who have been brain-damaged during birth. She says:</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/23" class="indent">&quot;It is not sufficient to say that women will be carefully screened and high risk cases will be delivered at the consultant unit at the JR. How many emergency Caesarean sections were there at the Horton last year? I question what would have happened to those who would not have been assessed as having high risk pregnancies. If the current proposals are put in place, when a midwife at the proposed new unit decides a woman in her care needs emergency medical attention, the mother, possibly in an advanced stage of labour, will have to be transferred by ambulance to a consultant unit. The clinical Working Group found that an ambulance transfer from the Horton to the JR could be achieved in 48 minutes. This delay could lead to serious damage occurring to mother or child. As a former midwife and solicitor who acts for children brain-damaged in the course of their birth, I believe that (negligence) claims of this sort could rise as a result of this proposal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/24">Interestingly, there appears to be no evidence of the Department of Health having done any work on the safety and risk of midwife-led units&mdash;no assessment of whether there are any greater risks to mothers and babies inherent in a midwife-led unit. In this instance, on the trust's own figures, a significant number of mothers who start labour in the MLU will need to transfer during labour to a consultant-led unit. On the trust's most optimistic figures, a significant number of mothers who start in the midwife-led unit will&mdash;not might but will&mdash;have to be transferred during labour some 26 miles to a consultant-led unit. It should not be forgotten there are many occasions when the M40 between Banbury and Oxford is closed, either due to bad weather such as fog or snow or due to road traffic accidents, which appear to be becoming, sadly, all too common between junctions nine and 10. As I said, I understand that the trust today told Radio Oxford that the journey could be achieved in 30 minutes&mdash;that is complete hogwash.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/25">It is not only the Horton that faces t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1945" name="Peter Bottomley">his threat. I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing, West (Peter Bottomley)</phrase> for his early-day motion on births on the road. It is tragic that hon. Members are having to table early-day motions asking that the strategic health authority guide the local primary care trust in maintaining consultant-led maternity services at Worthing, with the aim of reducing the number of babies born before arrival at hospital. This is third-world medicine.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.1/26">What is the degree and range of added risk to mothers and babies of such moves? GPs locally have reviewed all the major medical journals for the past nine years, and no work at all appears to have been done on considering whether and to what extent larger midwife-led units may increase risk to mothers and babies. Indeed, I understand that there will be no sound data on this matter until September 2009, when the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit is due to report.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase>. We have had two powerful speeches about saving hospitals, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> on securing such an important debate. I also feel very sorry for the Minister. I know that she is an excellent Minister, but not a single Labour Back-Bench MP has bothered to turn up to support her in the debate, whereas there are Conservatives, Liberals and independent Members in the Chamber today.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">I will not, the Minister will be pleased to hear, campaign today to save a hospital. There are hundreds of thousands of my constituents in Wellingborough, Rushton and east Northamptonshire who do not have a hospital. It takes them the best part of 40 minutes to get to the nearest hospital, and if one were to travel by public transport it would take up to two hours. The hospitals that they must go to are at Kettering and Northampton. They are full to bursting point. There is no room for them to expand. Yet the Government have said that Wellingborough must be at the heart of a growth area, with 52,000 new houses to be built in the next 10 years or so. Even the Government, in their policy document, say that there should be a new general hospital in the area. There are no plans for such a hospital. Yet the same Government, who say that Northamptonshire should have a certain amount of money for its primary care trust, have, every year since the formula was devised, deliberately underfunded Northamptonshire. I am saying to the Government: take the money that you should have given Northamptonshire, build the hospital for Wellingborough and Rushton and relieve the pressure on the other two hospitals, in Northampton and Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">I have a listening to Wellingborough and Rushton campaign. The idea is to discuss local issues. Unofficially, two weeks ago, I launched a campaign for a hospital in our area. I have had more than 1,000 letters&mdash;people bothering to write to me, put on a stamp, and post their letters&mdash;before we have even launched the campaign. I hope that the Minister will consider the issue and realise that in a growth area it is really necessary to have a hospital to serve the people.</p>

	<p pid="a.123.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1626" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> on his appointment and I welcome him to the Opposition Front Bench. I look forward very much to working with him. I thank all hon. Members who participated in the debate. With your permission, Dr. McCrea, I acknowledge the presence of those in the Public Gallery.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> on his success in the Speaker's ballot and on initiating this debate on the future of smaller hospitals. I know that he will understand that, as he mentioned at the beginning of his contribution, the matter concerning the Horton General hospital is now with the independent reconfiguration panel and I am personally unable to acknowledge those comments. He will understand that I cannot do so because, as was mentioned, we want to take the politics out of the decision making; that is the purpose of what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/3">It is a testament to the popularity and success of the NHS that we have such beloved institutions that are held so dear by the people whom they serve. That is a huge compliment to the national health service locally and all the people who work in it, who provide the best possible care for patients. It is obvious from the numbers of Opposition Members who are in attendance today that they are committed to the NHS&mdash;to its funding and its structure in its modern format. As a former nurse who worked in the NHS for more than 25 years, it is extremely encouraging for me to see Opposition Members who are so committed to the NHS and its future. I say to the hon. Members for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor), Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) and Wellingborough (Mr. Bone), who were so complimentary, that I am listening; the Government are listening. That is the whole purpose of the review. The hon. Member for Banbury quoted Lord Darzi and what was quoted or rather misquoted in the newspapers. It is important that I put on record what Lord Darzi actually said:</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/4" class="indent">&quot;I have been widely quoted as saying the &quot;days of the District General Hospital are over&quot;. Let me be clear about what I did and did not say. The days of a one size fits all provider, repeated over and over again in a Metropolitan Capital are over. This does not represent the world-class service that a world-class city deserves. However, in my Report I did describe a key role for &quot;Local Hospitals&quot;. This is where the future of District General Hospital lies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/5">It is important that we put that matter to bed once and for all and that we accept what Lord Darzi actually said.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/6">When people talk about the reorganisation of services they think that it is about money, but it is not; it is about safety, quality and what is more convenient. That is why the consultation is taking place with clinicians, patients and user groups across the areas that the local health service serves. Lifestyles, society, medicine, technology and the NHS itself have all changed over the past 60 years, and I am sure that all hon. Members would agree with that. Change is certainly nothing new in the national health service. The NHS has always responded to change and the latest treatments by organising itself to deliver that care. We are responding to a variety of drivers for change. The change that we are asking all clinicians, patients and communities to consider is about clinical practice, clinical safety and delivering services to the user in the best possible quality way. It is not about reorganising staff or health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/7">As a former nurse, I make no apology for why some of these changes are essential. If we do not keep up with the times, services will not keep on improving. Today we are reaping the benefits of new medical technologies and safer surgery, which means quicker recovery times for patients and shorter lengths of stay in hospital. For example, years ago, in cardiology we had to have beds for patients suffering from heart attacks. Patients were kept in coronary care units for two or three weeks at a time and surgery was not possible. We have advanced our surgery and bypass techniques to the extent that we can look into the coronary arteries on a day-case basis and provide a surgical procedure through the coronary artery. We can also now provide drugs, such as statins, to stop cholesterol building up in the coronary arteries. Thousands and thousands of lives have been saved and with the cessation of smoking people can look forward to having a healthier heart and lifestyle. We look forward to that change; it is a massive change. The needs and the way in which we care for cardiac patients will always change. Medicine is and always should be dynamic.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/8">We need to consider the issue of inappropriate buildings. We love our buildings. I for one was brought into the House to save my local hospital, so I empathise with everybody who has come to this debate. That hospital was to be closed and the land sold off. The issue was not about acquiring services locally and nobody consulted the people in that constituency and community about where we could have services. Such a consultation is what is being suggested in the present format of reconfiguration; it is documented that that is how it is being delivered. The Government, Lord Darzi and myself are committed to that process; it is being clinically led. Now we have an independent review looking at some areas in the country. I do not think that we could be fairer than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/9">There was a history of widespread hospital closures in the 80s and that is why people fear the existing consultation. Yes, there is mistrust of the past and people would be right to mistrust what happened in the 80s and 90s. They would be right to mistrust a period when people had to collect money for urgent hospital equipment. People do not have to do that today. We have just seen a settlement to the NHS that is 4 per cent. above what was expected. We know that there is a sense of safety in relation to the health service. Everyone of us who represents a constituency has a duty to ensure that that message is put across because the fear is damaging. The hon. Member for Mid-Sussex mentioned stress of constant change. I recognise that that is not good for staff or for delivering services. I urge managers and those who are conducting consultations to do so in a manner that reduces stress as far as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/10">We have modernised facilities. We have 54 major new hospitals, more than 2,500 refurbished or replaced GP surgeries, 520 new one-stop centres and more than 60 walk-in centres. We are considering every district general hospital and every area that delivers an aspect of the health service, every area that has specialist nurses and every area that has maternity services, which were mentioned today. I ask all hon. Members to debate with the Royal College of Midwives on having a midwifery-led centre that is in fact safe. Midwife consultants are safe. Yes, different measures of maternity care are required and will require different levels of either obstetrician or midwifery-led care, but that does not mean to say that we should not discuss that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/11">When someone takes an ambulance journey, the practice of paramedics means that it is a very different experience from 10 or 15 years ago. That is because of the knowledge of our paramedics. I would like hon. Members to acknowledge the knowledge that paramedics have and the advancements that we have made in waiting times in accident and emergency departments. Patients are expected in accident and emergency on a controlled arrival because their journey has been controlled by many expert paramedics. That is different from what we offered patients some years ago; it is an advancement, and I hope that all hon. Members recognise the difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/12">Yes, there is always anxiety about any change. Yes, there are always problems with consultation. Also, it is not easy to get practitioners to change their practice. Sometimes we have to encourage our peer group to accept change. That is not easy, and that is why the wide scope of Lord Darzi's review includes all staff and patients; not just the top docs, but everybody concerned. The role and expansion of the primary care team must also be considered. The GPs who are the real backbone of our services and who are willing in many instances to look at change would be grateful for the consultation not to be dealt with in a manner that spreads fear because to do so is unfair. Some 60 years ago Aneurin Bevan said that the NHS will always have to change. Aneurin Bevan asked us to look towards the professions and people of responsibility to consider that change.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.0/13">I thank everybody for their contribution today. I will listen. I have listened. I will go away and consider what has been said, and in the future, I hope that there will be a consultation process that hon. Members and their constituents can accept.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.4/1">This debate is the first parliamentary opportunity to discuss the mobile telecommunications and health research programme report 2007, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-12">12 September</phrase>. I intend to touch very briefly on handsets&mdash;not in an attempt to catch out the Minister, but because they featured in the report. I think, therefore, that they are worth discussing today.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/2">It is clearly true to say that mobile phones are very much part of our way of life. I have got one and I suspect that everyone else in the Chamber has as well, with one possible exception. In the UK, there are 70 million mobile phone subscriptions, compared with just 9 million 10 years ago. However, that rapid growth has been accompanied by growing concerns that exposure to radio waves from mobile phones and base stations pose a health risk. Concern about masts has been expressed by residents of the Ridge, in Woodcote, of Green Wrythe lane, in Carshalton, by those living next to the Oaks Park golf club, and by those living just about everywhere else in my constituency and, I suspect, in every other constituency where masts are being erected. Concerns about the health impact of handsets are more muted, possibly because people have a choice of whether they carry a mobile phone. Clearly, they do not have a choice about whether they live next to a mobile phone mast.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/3">The balance of evidence from research to date suggests that no health impacts have been identified. However, gaps in scientific knowledge, particularly about the long-term health impacts of this very new technology have prompted calls for further studies to be conducted, which is happening in the UK and around the world. What are people's health concerns about masts? The major concern is the possibility that radio waves cause cancer or a greater risk of cancer owing to the heating up of cells in the body. Some studies have shown that there is a greater risk of cancer-related conditions in those situated near telecommunications masts. However, many other studies have suggested that that is just a possibility. I think that people are concerned about the lack of clarity in those different messages.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/4">One of my constituents, Mr. Simon Densley, is here today for the debate. He tracks very carefully the research on mobile phone masts and describes the health concerns in this way:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/5" class="indent">&quot;They fall roughly into two categories: short and long term. Short term covers immediate and near immediate effects such as headaches, dizziness, extreme irritation, etc. These seem to currently only affect a small percentage of the population. There is research which offers an explanation for this. Also there is thought to be evidence that long term chronic exposure can increase electro-sensitivity over time and therefore the number of people susceptible to these short term effects.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/6">Later I shall move on to what the mobile telecommunications and health research programme report had to say about that. He also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/7" class="indent">&quot;Long term problems cover anything that can be caused by a long term build up of cellular and neurological damage. Specific symptoms that have been noted in laboratory or epidemiological studies include depression, cancer, leukaemia and brain tumours.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.4/8">Mr. Densley's concerns are echoed by a group of German doctors who launched the Freiburger appeal after noticing a correlation between higher incidents of depression, cancer, leukaemia, brain tumours, heart rhythm disorders, heart attacks and strokes among an increasingly younger population, brain-degenerative diseases and epilepsy, and exposure to pulsed high-frequency microwave radiation, as used by mobile phone masts, wi-fi, terrestrial trunked radio and several other new technologies. That appeal now has nearly 37,000 signatories, of whom&mdash;this is important&mdash;some 1,000 are medical doctors.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a sound point and underlines the need for ongoing research and extensive monitoring. As I said, we are dealing with a new technology, and I do not think that anyone could say hand on heart with total certainty what the possible implications might be down the line a number of years from now.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/2">Let me return to the subject of the Freiburger appeal. It is important to note the number of medical professionals who are signatories to that appeal. We are talking about neurophysicians and people in general medicine, paediatrics and so on. We are not talking about people who do not have a scientific view on those matters, but about people who have an active involvement in health and the possible impacts of telecommunications. Clearly, the medical establishment does not necessarily support the view put forward by the Freiburger appeal.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/3">The World Health Organisation says that one of the main causes of people's concern is due to newspaper reports that publish new and unconfirmed scientific results, and to people feeling a loss of control over their environment and what is put there. That is certainly something that appears in the appeal and addresses <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1843" name="Robert Flello">the point that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent, South (Mr. Flello)</phrase> made about the extent to which local communities have any say on the location of masts.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/4">The WHO goes on to dismiss anecdotal reports of cancer clusters around mobile phone base stations because, in its view, clusters are in any case unevenly distributed and with the number of masts located in the country statistically there would be clusters around mobile phone masts in the way in which there would be clusters around places with no masts. Clearly, medical opinion is not entirely united on mobile phone masts or on handsets and their impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-12">12 September</phrase>, the Mobile Operators Association welcomed the report published by the mobile telecommunications and health research programme. In its press release, the MOA said that</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the report concludes none of the research supported by the programme and published so far demonstrates that biological or adverse health effects are produced by radiofrequency exposure from mobile phones&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/7">If it had used an exact quote, it would have said:</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The six year research programme has found no association between short term mobile phone use and brain cancer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/9">That is an area to which I shall refer again, because it is the significant gap in the research that has been conducted to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.1/10">The MOA went on to state that it found the findings reassuring and consistent with the conclusion that there are no adverse health effects, but that there was a need in some areas for more research. It equally underlined the fact that in its view, and that of the report, there were areas where no more research needs to be carried out. When I get to the end of my speech, I shall ask the Minister to clarify whether there are any areas where, in her view, the science is now so well defined that there is no need for further research.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.1/1">Absolutely. Of course, I shall be asking the Minister whether she would support a precautionary principle that would suggest that no mobile phone masts should be located next to schools or hospitals. I hope that T-Mobile will be receptive. I am pleased that there have recently been a couple of occasions in my constituency where mobile phone operators have appeared to be more willing to listen to representations and not to locate masts close to places where there have been high levels of concern. I hope that the hon. Lady will receive a positive response.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">I want to quote Professor Lawrie Challis, who heads up the MTHR programme and acknowledges the need for more investigation. In an interview with <i>The Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-20">20 January</phrase> of this year, in advance of the production of the report, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/3" class="indent">&quot;It's encouraging because they found nothing for people who've used phones for less than ten years, but there is a hint of something for people using them more.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/4">Clearly, if the person who heads up the Government's programme into the impact of mobile phone use and mobile phone masts is of the view that there is a &quot;hint of something&quot; in the effect on people who have been regular users for more than 10 years, we should definitely investigate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/5">Sufficient funds are, I hope, available for the research. Nearly &pound;9 million has been contributed to the programme by a variety of sources, including the industry and Government. Although I am absolutely certain that the programme is independent and that the firewall is doing its job so that no influence is being exerted by the operators, I still think that there will be a problem of perception for those who are worried about the technology about the independence of the reports.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/6">Although the weight of the evidence so far suggests that there are no health implications, we need to acknowledge the body of evidence and the support coming from some medical professionals in favour of caution. The industry is responding to that to a certain extent, and it is providing commitments as to how it will address public concerns over whether it is funding reports and research into the subject. It is trying to ensure that emission levels from handsets are clearly indicated. However, on that point, Members might have seen a report published just a few days ago that highlighted the fact that people really have to look if they want to find which mobile has a high emission level and which does not. I purchased a mobile phone for a friend a couple of weeks ago, and I cannot say that anything in the documentation leapt out at me to say whether that mobile phone was high-emitting or not.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.0/1">On the subject of the obligations of the mobile phone operators, does the hon. Gentleman agree that the five mobile phone companies that operate in the UK should now consider sharing mobile phone masts? That could be one of the major steps that could be taken to reduce the number of mobile phone masts erected, and we should be actively considering that now, given the levels of public concern.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a perfectly valid point. My understanding is that two of the operators are seeking to do exactly that, although there may be some competition issues about whether they are allowed to do it. I hope that, if not reducing emissions&mdash;I do not believe that it would necessarily do that&mdash;it would reduce the visual intrusiveness of a proliferation of masts. I hope that we can have some clarity from the Minister on whether those two operators, or indeed others, will be allowed to share masts. I hope that competition reasons will not get in the way of that happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">The Government's position is clearly set out in the Stewart report, which is what Members produce in evidence when they raise issues about mobile phone masts with Ministers. It highlighted some issues on the environmental impact of base stations and the need to discourage the use of mobile phones among young children.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/3">I want to give the Minister a reasonable amount of time to respond to a couple of questions. In light of what the MTHR report said about the need for a substantial ongoing programme of long-term research into the impact of masts, will the Government support that research? How do they see that programme rolling forward, and who should be funding it? On a specific point, would the Government support more research into wi-fi, which has received a lot of coverage in recent months? There are concerns, and some schools have taken out their wi-fi because of health concerns. Do the Government believe that there is a need for more investigation?</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/4">Does the Minister agree with the point of view put forward by the MTHR and the MOA that there are some areas in which the science is now so well defined that there is no need for further research? If that is her view, perhaps she will set out in what areas she believes that to be the case. Given the uncertainty about the long-term health implications of mobile phone use and masts, would she support, as the hon. Lady suggested, the idea of a precautionary principle being adopted around schools and hospitals?</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/5">I do not consider myself a luddite in relation to mobile phones. There are genuine concerns about the long-term health impact of phones and masts, and they require the science to be kept under regular review. Detailed monitoring of those subject to the effects of mobile phone handsets and masts needs to be undertaken. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me and hundreds of my constituents, and constituents of other Members present, that there will be no no-go areas of research. We need certainty about the health impact of masts and handsets, which will be achieved only through constant monitoring of the science and regular and detailed health assessments.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">I shall turn to the evidence, and in particular to the way in which the Government are advised. At any point with regard to health, whether an individual consultant recommends a particular drug when NICE has evaluated it and said that the quality and impact is not as such, or evidence comes forward that needs to be considered, the approach is to embrace it.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/2">An important development, following the Stewart report, was the establishment of a new research programme: the mobile telecommunications and health research programme. The hon. Gentleman referred to it himself, and I have with me its report, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-12">12 September</phrase>, just one month ago. It is a report from 23 completed projects, and therefore a report on the very latest research findings from a very high-quality research programme. None of the research published by the MTHR programme showed that radio frequency emissions from mobile phones affected people's health, at least in the short term. The hon. Gentleman referred to that point, and I am looking at the conclusions now.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/3">One study specifically analysed whether short-term exposure to radio frequencies from base stations could have an effect on people's health, and although some people attribute their ill health symptoms to phone masts, the MTHR peer-reviewed study did not find any convincing evidence that their symptoms were caused by exposure to signals from mobile phones or masts.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/4">Although there is no scientifically proven risk to health from base stations, the Government take very seriously the continuing public concern about the possible health effects from mobile phone masts. Indeed, the report touches on that point. I say to the hon. Gentleman that the Government will continue, with the precautionary principle to which he referred, to respond to the public's concerns and to support high-quality scientific studies that seek to address the very problems that my hon. Friends and the hon. Gentleman have identified in the debate. Ministers from the Department for Communities and Local Government, the Department of Health and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform regularly meet representatives of mobile phone operators to discuss the matter, and we shall meet again shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.0/5">In conclusion, the only sensible and&mdash;if I could use the word in response to the hon. Gentleman&mdash;precautionary way in which the Government should proceed on the matter is to follow the scientific evidence recommended by people who are properly qualified to assess it. That is what we have in the 2007 report. Some issues have been identified for further research, and they will be taken forward. I hope that we can continue to address people's concerns by providing the evidence that answers their concerns, at all times advised by the scientific evidence.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.1/1">Good afternoon, Dr. McCrea. It is a pleasure to serve under you.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/2">My purpose this afternoon is to place on record my concern and that of many people in Sunderland about proposals by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to close its two city centre offices, Gilbridge house and Shackleton house, which between them employ 430 people. Although the proposals might make sense to the number crunchers and master strategists at headquarters, they make no sense at all once the wider considerations are taken into account. Indeed, they are in several respects directly contrary to Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/3">I thank Ministers and the management of HMRC for the wide-ranging and genuine consultation that they have undertaken with all interested parties on the impact of their proposals. I am grateful for my meetings with senior officials and with my right hon. Friend the Minister, who listened courteously to the representations that I made. They are also considering representations from the city council, the relevant trade unions and others. From my right hon. Friend's predecessor, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, who has just departed from the Chamber, I welcome the assurance that wider considerations such as the impact on the local economy will be taken into account, as well as the assurance that whatever happens, the very successful drop-in service, which at peak times attracts up to 500 callers a day, will be retained at a city centre location.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/4">Sunderland has come a long way in recent years. In the late 80s and early 90s, the local economy was devastated by the collapse of our shipyard, the colliery and a large swathe of our manufacturing industries. The process continues: only the other day we lost the last part of our historic glass-making industry. Today, thanks to a huge regeneration effort involving the public and private sector, supported by successive Governments, our city has been transformed. Our once derelict riverside is coming back to life, thousands of new jobs have been created, the shopping centre is thriving and people are starting to want to live in the city centre again. However, the recovery is fragile, and it would not take much to tip the scales in the opposite direction. Acres of brownfield sites are still waiting to be redeveloped, which is why I am so concerned about HMRC's plans to take several hundred secure and relatively well-paid jobs out of our city centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/5">In several respects, the proposals are contrary to Government policy. I had understood&mdash;perhaps the Minister will confirm that this is still true&mdash;that it was Government policy to devolve civil service jobs from high-cost London and the south-east to areas such as Sunderland, where rents and wages are lower, and which are badly in need of jobs. I see the Minister nodding, I think, so I shall take that as read. Indeed, that is how we came by the Shackleton house jobs in the first place. I may be wrong, but I believe that the building was purpose built as recently as 10 or 12 years ago, precisely to house London tax jobs that were devolved to Sunderland as part of Government regional policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/6">I put it to my right hon. Friend that in these days of allegedly joined-up government, it makes no sense at all for one part of the Treasury to seek to devolve jobs to the more deprived regions while another seeks to take them away. It is time that those parts of the same Department met up. I hope that by now my right hon. Friend has introduced them to each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/7">It is also policy, or so we say, to encourage job creation in sustainable locations that are well served by public transport, which is precisely what we have: Shackleton house and Gilbridge house are close to the city centre and well served by public transport&mdash;bus and metro. The plan is to relocate most employees in two already congested out-of-town business parks&mdash;Longbenton near Newcastle, and Waterview Park in Washington. HMRC already employs 6,700 people at Longbenton and 2,300 at Washington. Clearly, it is going through a &quot;big is beautiful&quot; phase. There is no pretence that most of the Sunderland employees will get to their new place of work by anything other than car. Indeed, the consultation document contains a table showing:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Indicative travelling times (by car).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/9">The journey times that are suggested to cover distances of 14 or 15 urban miles from their present location are a tad optimistic&mdash;at least as regards Longbenton. I would be very surprised if it is possible to get from Sunderland to Longbenton in rush-hour traffic via the frequently congested Tyne tunnel in 32 minutes, and goodness knows how long it would take by public transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/10">In terms of planning and environmental policy, the proposal makes no sense at all. That point is made forcefully by the chief executive of Sunderland city council, Mr. Ged Fitzgerald, in the council's response to the consultation, which I commend to the Minister. He states:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/11" class="indent">&quot;I consider that the removal of...jobs from a central location within a well-connected city centre and relocating them to a suburban area some distance from urban centres north of the Tyne is fundamentally unsustainable in planning terms, is against current Planning Policy Guidance and is likely to throw additional pressure on transport routes in the Longbenton area which are already struggling to cope with increased traffic.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/12">He adds:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/13" class="indent">&quot;It may also not be in the interests of HMRC in terms of staff retention and staff turnover to have offices located in unsustainable locations away from good sources of labour.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/14">I also draw my right hon. Friend's attention to a letter from Mr. David Walker, the chief executive of the Sunderland arc, the urban development company charged with overseeing the regeneration of much of Sunderland's riverside. The arc is hoping to generate investment of nearly &pound;1 billion, one third of it from the public sector, over the next 15 years. Mr. Walker states:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/15" class="indent">&quot;The loss of 430 jobs and the creation of over 6,000 square metres of empty floor space at a time when Sunderland arc is trying to build confidence in the private sector market, gives us grave cause for concern.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/16">He adds that he is</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/17" class="indent">&quot;aware of the emphasis government places on promoting city centre office markets ahead of out of town business parks...I am, therefore, somewhat surprised that this proposed relocation appears to represent a disconnect with other strands of government policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/18">In conclusion, perhaps I might make a suggestion. Instead of moving Inland Revenue jobs out of Sunderland, how about moving some in? As Mr. Walker says, the arc is in the process of putting together a huge investment in state-of-the-art new office space on a site which, by happy coincidence, is exactly opposite Gilbridge and Shackleton houses. If HMRC is consolidating its estate in the north-east, where better than in Sunderland? If that is not possible, how about taking over a couple more floors of Gilbridge house and moving the staff from Shackleton house into it? Whatever happens, I hope that the Minister and her officials will look at the big picture, not just the small one.</p>

As he will be aware, HMRC has designed a systematic process of review, consultation and announcements on decisions that is being implemented across the whole of the UK. I am grateful for his complimentary remarks on the process. As he rightly said, it is a genuine consultation, and I commend the hard work of the officials involved and the genuine efforts being made to take on board information and intelligence that is often brought up by local people. It helps to influence how the final decision is shaped.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.0/4">The process is virtually complete for the urban centre of which Sunderland forms a part, and I expect an announcement to be made to staff and trade unions next week. At the same time, Members who have a constituency interest in the area will be notified. However, I reassure my hon. Friend, before he seeks to intervene, that the comments that he made today will be taken into account before a decision is taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.138.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Dr. McCrae.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">The Minister referred to decentralisation, but that decentralisation is from a town that suffered badly during the 1980s and has now turned round. A small number of key people will be decentralised to a site that is bursting at the seams and, from the transport point of view, that is not needed. The problem is not just the traffic on the A19; it is the traffic that will be diverted on to the A1, which is a nightmare. If anyone can travel from Sunderland to Longbenton in 32 minutes, they are driving faster than Lewis Hamilton.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="138"  time="016:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0011.htm#07101030000620">
	<p pid="a.138.1/1">I know the A1 because my parents still live in the north-east, and I have not-so-fond memories of difficult journeys on it. I know the point that my hon. Friend makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">I want to make one or two further comments to emphasise the way in which the service that HMRC delivers is changing, and how that is impacting on the decision-making process, before I come to directly to the points about Sunderland. I am aware that I have a few minutes in which to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3">Many customers now choose to telephone HMRC offices and staff or to use the internet to file returns or make claims, so it is right and appropriate for the organisation's senior management to look at all their operations to ensure that they are run as efficiently as possible. In some work areas, it believes that that need is best served by concentrating work, as I have described, in larger units where processes can be streamlined and improved. In other areas, a more mobile work force is seen as the best solution to meet customer needs. Finally, there must be an emphasis on improving compliance throughout HMRC by matching resources to the risks that it deals with in particular locations.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/4">I want to emphasise some of the key commitments given by the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" name="Dawn Primarolo">my right hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, South (Dawn Primarolo)</phrase>, who responded to the previous debate. I am happy to confirm her commitment that, whatever the outcome of the review for the offices in which my hon. Friends have shown an interest, the inquiry centre in Sunderland will be maintained and the same level of customer service will be provided. The face-to-face opportunity will continue to be made available to the constituents whom my hon. Friends represent. Staff will not be required to move to an office beyond reasonable daily travel, and that test of reasonability will be rigorously applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/5">An established process for managers and staff to discuss options for their future employment, dependent on the outcome of the review, is open, transparent and accessible to the trade unions. I encourage my hon. Friends to consider the experience of staff in areas where the process has taken place and where a fair effort was made to meet the concerns and aspirations of staff who were affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/6">Turning to Sunderland and the sustained case that has been made by my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South and the organisations to which he referred, not least the local authority, the proposals to rationalise work and office space throughout Sunderland, Washington and Newcastle were put forward for consultation earlier this year. Staff, trade unions, Members of Parliament and local authorities all contributed to that consultation. Information on travel routes, economic interests in the locations&mdash;that is important&mdash;the position of other employers and Departments, as well as individual circumstances, will be taken into account. A report summarising those main responses was published in June, and we have listened to the further reaction to the report. I acknowledge the strong representations and I am aware of my hon. Friends' concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/7">Turning to the jobs that were created in 2005, as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-17">17 September</phrase> this year the <i>Sunderland Echo</i> carried the story that Northern Rock may be unable to carry through its plans to bring a further 1,500 jobs to the area as a result of its recent difficulties. My hon. Friends' concerns are real, and I do not wish to minimise them in any way.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.139.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10b.139.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-10-10a.139.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="139"  time="016:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm071010/halltext/71010h0012.htm#07101030000622">
	<p pid="a.139.1/1">I am aware of that, but their representations have been taken into account and considered as part of the review process. All the information that was provided during that consultation and since has been considered and will be reconsidered during the remaining week.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/2">I want to take the opportunity briefly to outline some of the factors that have been considered. The three offices in Sunderland&mdash;two in the city centre and one on the outskirts&mdash;accommodate some 900 staff in total. Throughout the entire urban centre, HMRC expect to need approximately 4 per cent. fewer staff than they currently employ by 2010. That contrasts with a net reduction through efficiencies that we are requiring HMRC to achieve of around 25 per cent. since it was created. That is a measure of the high level of efficiency that already applies in the areas that we are discussing today.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/3">Public sector jobs in Sunderland increased by more than 8,500, or 33 per cent., between 1997 and 2005. An analysis of the individual travel times for staff suggest a high degree of mobility between existing sites in the area that might allow staff to commute between them. In proposing to move to an efficient structure&mdash;notwithstanding my hon. Friend's comments about the purpose-built building that is being considered for closure&mdash;HMRC is confident that the majority of staff can be relocated with their own or similar work nearby. Overall, HMRC estimates that it has up to 40 per cent. too much accommodation throughout the UK, and the position is no different in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/4">I well understand the concerns of people who work in the area about the extra travelling time that might be involved for some if they are relocated to different offices, the availability of transport links from their homes, including private transport, and the A1. I would like to reassure the Chamber that individual members of staff will have the opportunity to discuss their circumstances with managers before any decision is taken on their suitability to relocate, and that that will be backed by a trade union supported appeal process.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/5">Throughout the programme, senior management in HMRC are committed to being open with staff, to explaining the options available to individuals and to exploring how their expectations can be matched with the need to make the operations more efficient. However, I want to make it clear that those are not easy decisions, and they can be made only when all the facts are known.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/6">With the exception of one year, I have been in government for nearly 10 years, and in almost every Department in which I have worked I have had to rationalise to some extent the estate for which I was responsible, so I am battle-scarred from dealing with those processes. I understand how traumatic they can be, and you may be amazed, Dr. McCrea, to learn that when I was first in the Lord Chancellor's Department, local magistrates courts suddenly became popular when proposals were made for them to be closed. I was the responsible Minister then. I appreciate hon. Members' concerns and I have a lot confidence in what I have seen of the process being followed in HMRC. The staff taking it forward are to be commended.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/7">When decisions have been announced in this location, as elsewhere, HMRC will begin the process of relocation and release of its surplus accommodation according to the decision. That process will take some time, as individual cases and contractual commitments must be reviewed. As individual buildings are identified for closure, HMRC will publish an individual building impact assessment covering customers, staff, local communities and local diversity. HMRC is keen to match those skills and experience with its aims of achieving a more efficient operation and improving customer service. I welcome this debate as part of the Department's commitment to the process of consultation and openness. It is a long-term programme that will deliver a more responsive and efficient service for taxpayers and claimants, and I know that in the long run, my hon. Friends want us to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.139.1/9" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at ten minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
