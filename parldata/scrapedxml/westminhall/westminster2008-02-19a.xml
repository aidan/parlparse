<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0001.htm#08021973000444">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to serve under you this morning, Miss Begg? I had the pleasure of working alongside you in the Work and Pensions Committee in the last Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">I am very grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate. This important subject does not get the attention that it deserves, and it is extremely distressing and upsetting to our constituents. I speak this morning directly at the request of a number of my constituents who have urged me to bring the issue of thefts from the cloning of debit and credit cards to the attention of the House, the police and the banks and credit card companies&mdash;or financial institutions as they are known. I have endeavoured to do that over the past few weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">I am particularly grateful to Bedfordshire police for the specific briefing that they have given me on the matter, and I look to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> to assure us this morning that the Home Office will hold an urgent and serious review of the current procedures. The procedures are clearly failing and I will try to set out why.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">In brief, at the end of November or in early December, a skimming machine was inserted in the credit and debit card machine at a garage in the south of my constituency. Bedfordshire police tell me that, to date, 745 debit and credit cards have had money stolen from them, often on multiple occasions. One credit card may have had five, six, 10 or 12 amounts of money stolen from it. We are not talking about small amounts of money either. Typically, sums of &pound;1,000, &pound;2,000 and &pound;5,000 are taken. I declare a personal interest. My wife had &pound;1,000 stolen in four or five withdrawals from cash points in New York in early January. It was lucky that she checked her bank statement pretty soon after that and realised that something was wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5">I shall quote briefly from letters from some of my constituents, who are unhappy with the current system for dealing with this serious crime. On many occasions, I have told Bedfordshire police that if 745 purses and wallets had been stolen, mainly in the two villages of Studham and Kensworth, there would probably have been police officers behind almost every hedge trying to catch the culprits. Card crime is no less serious. We are talking about a lot more money than most people have in their purse or wallet. The fact that the money is almost always reimbursed by the financial institutions does not make the theft any less traumatic, difficult and upsetting for the person, or any less of a crime. I object to the fact that the people who have money stolen from them in that way are not described as victims in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">Financial institutions are described as the victims because they have to reimburse the money, but if someone steals my wallet, I am a victim even if I get the money back later. I do not like that terminology. One police officer said to me, &quot;We don't report gun crime to the small arms manufacturers. We don't report alcohol-fuelled violence to the drinks manufacturers.&quot; Yet, in the current system, card crime is reported to the financial institutions. I am not calling for that law to be scrapped because I understand the reasons for it. However, there are serious flaws in the procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7">My constituents have written to me to say that they are outraged about what is going on. One stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/8" class="indent">&quot;No law-abiding citizen can witness the large-scale theft of money from the UK without indignation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/9">A woman from Luton had her card skimmed from another garage close to my constituency. She wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/10" class="indent">&quot;They cleared our account down to &pound;5. We have two kids to feed as well. We were worried about how we would survive for three weeks until my husband got paid again.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/11">In many cases, banks and credit card companies try to reimburse people as quickly as possible, but that does not always happen. Imagine the person who is abroad and reliant on their credit card. Suddenly, because of illegal withdrawals, they go over their credit card limit and their card issuer will not let them take out any more money. They could be completely stuck. What about small businesses which have their accounts frozen and are not able to pay their suppliers? The ramifications of this crime are absolutely huge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/12">It is interesting to look at the range of countries from which money is being withdrawn. Britain has chip and pin&mdash;all credit to UK financial services, we are the most chip and pin compliant country in Europe and possibly the whole world. We are even better than Luxembourg, which is the next best in Europe. However, that does not mean that as UK citizens we are any safer. Highly organised criminal gangs clone the details from the magnetic strips on the back of our credit and debit cards and take our pin numbers through the skimming machines, and money is then withdrawn all over the world. From talking to my constituents and the police, I have found out that money is being withdrawn from the following countries: Malaysia, America, India, Hong Kong, Philippines, Dubai, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Germany and Thailand. There was an attempt in Ghana, but it was not successful. Let us pause for a moment and consider the scale of that highly organised, sophisticated criminal operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/13">Furthermore, there is the question of the use to which the money is put. I have no evidence, but it has been suggested to me that some of the money may have found its way to the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka, to Pakistan and possibly to funding terrorism. It is, therefore, a very serious issue. I am talking about not just theft from our constituents but also the use to which the money is put.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/14">The Fraud Act 2006 is in general a good Act. Much of it is sensible and is welcomed by the police. It simplified things and I am not calling for its repeal, but since <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, if someone finds that thousands of pounds have been stolen from their bank account or from their credit card, they can no longer go to the police unless the card has been stolen. In most cases, however, the card has not been stolen; the details have been skimmed and the card has been cloned. One must go to one's financial institution&mdash;bank or credit card company&mdash;and it will be up to them to inform the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit, which will then liaise with local police forces. However, Bedfordshire police tell me that of the 745 debit and credit cards that were cloned, they did not have one single referral back from a bank or a credit card company.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/15">That is where the current system is completely failing. The most serious issue is this: had just one bank been even semi-switched on, perhaps action would have been taken after five or 10 cards had been cloned. Everyone knew locally that one particular garage was involved. Do not ask me how they knew, but everyone said, &quot;It's that garage that is doing it.&quot; If Bedfordshire police had been alerted, they could have gone in within days. If they had raided the garage immediately, they probably would have seized the skimming machine. They might have mounted a covert operation if they had seen that the skimming machine was there, because such machines need to be in place only for three or four days to capture thousands of details. Then they could have caught the criminals coming back to remove the machine, perhaps to take it to another garage. The police would have had fantastic intelligence and would have been able to question the criminals involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/16">I understand from Bedfordshire police that typically a lone employee is in a garage, perhaps late at night. The criminal gang arrives and threatens violence, offers bribes or perhaps both. The criminals say, &quot;We'll beat you up. We'll do in your family unless you turn a blind eye. We're going to put something into the card reader. You keep quiet or you'll be in trouble.&quot; The machine is there for only a few days and then they remove it. That is how the crime happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/17">The current system is failing. The public are not being protected. Bedfordshire police raided the garage to which I have referred, partly because my constituents were not content just to tell their banks and credit card companies; they got on to the police. Prompted by my constituents, I got on to the police as well, but when they eventually raided the garage, two or three weeks ago, it was a classic case of locking the stable door after the horse had bolted. The key point that I want the Minister to do something about is ensuring that information is passed on to local police forces as soon as a pattern emerges, so that the public can be protected. If action had been taken earlier, many hundreds of my constituents and, indeed, other people passing up and down the A5 could have been protected. It is the first duty of Government to protect their citizens from crime, and that is crime by any standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/18">It is often said that such activity is victimless crime because people are, by and large, compensated by banks and credit card companies. I refute that suggestion entirely because, as the British Bankers Association said,</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/19" class="indent">&quot;ultimately the financial burden is carried by the general public as a whole in the form of direct personal financial losses, increased charges and premiums, failed businesses, devalued investments, increased taxation, reduced public services and lost jobs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/20">That is clearly the case. At the very least, the Government are losing out on the corporation tax they could be receiving from the banks, because it is a legitimate expense when they repay customers from bank profits. Banks will recoup that money in the form of higher charges or higher interest rates, just as shops have to do from shoplifting and insurance companies have to do from illegal activities. We all lose out, including the Government, from this crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/21">Since the introduction of the Fraud Act 2006, particularly the provisions that took effect from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>, people have commented that because the police are not directly informed, card cloning will become a forgotten crime. Derek French, a banking campaigner, has certainly said that. Ross Anderson, the professor of security engineering at Cambridge university's computer laboratory, is also unhappy about the procedures now that</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/22" class="indent">&quot;banks completely control the reporting and prosecution of card fraud&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/23">I also have concerns about the position of fraud as a police priority. There is only one police force in the whole country for which fraud is a paramount consideration, because its police authority insists that should be the case&mdash;the City of London police. The view of the British Bankers Association is that fraud is largely &quot;a Cinderella function&quot; for every police force in the country. I do not say that just to score a cheap point. Fraud is not given the priority that it deserves, which is surprising because I am informed by the British Bankers Association that the Home Office's own assessment of different types of crime</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/24" class="indent">&quot;places the harm to society caused by fraud as second only to that caused by Class A drugs, and more than that due to people trafficking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/25">Many of us might be slightly surprised by that prioritisation, but it is apparently the Home Office's view of the seriousness of fraud in general, of which the cloning of credit and debit cards is a very serious part. As that is the Home Office's view, people might reasonably assume that one or more of the 147 statutory performance or key diagnostic indicators would relate to fraud or financial crime, but that is not so. Again, I am informed by the British Bankers Association that not one of the statutory performance or key diagnostic indicators relates to fraud or financial crime. I happen to know that only last week the association wrote to the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing to ask why that was the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/26">The police are ranked according to the targets and indicators that they have to meet. They are only human, like everyone else, so if fraud is not one of the priorities put on them, they will put their resources towards the areas on which they are ranked and from which league tables are created to show how well or badly they are doing. If the Home Office says that fraud is the second most serious type of crime, why does it not feature among the priorities? That is a fair question, to which I do not have an answer, so perhaps the Minister can enlighten us when she replies to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/27">I do not think that we know the scale of this crime, but I found out that, according to the Association for Payment Clearing Services, the incidence of overseas fraud using cloned UK cards rose by 126 per cent. in the first six months of 2007, so it is a fast-growing area of crime&mdash;probably limited only by the criminal gangs' capacity to manufacture or put skimming machines in place. Frankly, it is easy money. I am not aware that the gang to which I referred have been caught up with. They must be laughing their heads off somewhere with suitcases or bank accounts full of money. Given how they acquired it, perhaps they have better systems to ensure that their bank accounts are not skimmed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/28">There is a loss to the Exchequer&mdash;to UK plc&mdash;from the activities that I have been describing. I wrote to all four main high street clearing banks last week and one of them, a major one that may hold many of the bank accounts for the 745 cards that Bedfordshire police knew about last week, said that</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/29" class="indent">&quot;if we discover linked fraudulent events, for example, a petrol station compromising card details, we directly notify the DCPCU.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/30">If the bank was doing that, what did the people at the DCPCU do with the information? Did they just sit on their hands from late November through to the end of January, when enough of my constituents were so fed up that they were almost beating down the doors of Dunstable police station? I was regularly on the phone to acting Chief Superintendent Andrew Street asking him what he was going to do about the crime. I am afraid that the information flow is not working well and something needs to be done about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/31">The purpose of the debate is not simply to have an interesting discussion but to bring about change so that something is done. My hope that something really will be done rests in part on a written answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" name="James Brokenshire">the Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)</phrase>, who will speak from the Conservative Front Bench in this debate. The Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing affirmed the Government's commitment to</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/32" class="indent">&quot;continually assess the effectiveness of new arrangements for reporting and recording of cheque and plastic card fraud introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase>.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.922"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 462, c. 922W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/33">I hope that I have demonstrated as reasonably, clearly and logically as possible that the arrangements are not working well. Of course the Government have good intentions; they clearly have no interest in fraud being perpetrated on such a scale. However, I contend that although the Fraud Act 2006 was put on the statute book with the best of intentions, it is failing our constituents in a major way when they could be protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/34">Having money stolen from one's bank account is as bad psychologically as having one's house broken into. Someone comes into the most personal and private area of another person's life and takes from them what they use to feed their family, put petrol in their car, put clothes on their family's backs, pay their mortgage and so on. I want action to follow from the debate, and I hope that when the Minister replies she will assure me that it will happen urgently.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19a.9.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="9"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0002.htm#08021973000452">
	<p pid="a.9.0/1">I believe that the FSA should take a tighter view. To be fair, the crime has been zooming up at every stage and at every move and countermove, but it is now time to ensure that what is in place works or to put things in place that will work if there are failures in the system, which there clearly are.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/2">I wish to consider the future of credit card fraud and efforts to foil those who use cloning technology. Figures show that a significant proportion of such fraud is now online. Indeed, online banking losses due to fraud have increased by 44 per cent. from &pound;23.2 million in 2005 to &pound;33.5 million last year. That is easy pickings for would-be online fraudsters. In a virtual world, it is possible completely to bypass the complexity of replicating chip and pin technology&mdash;put a reader in place, get your hands on stolen card details and you're away. Only yesterday in Hornsey and Wood Green, a cupboard filled with people's personal data was found in an old housing benefits office. The papers had been dumped by the council when the staff moved out, and squatters reported the matter to <i>The Sun</i>. Details are not always entirely safe, and bank details such as those found in that pile of papers yesterday are enough to make a start.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/3">It is already possible to get plug-in chip readers for personal computers, and it will become easier to do so. It will not be long before the online industry works out how to use personal physical identification&mdash;the Government have gone down that road with identity cards and passports. I could go to Tottenham Court road today and buy a laptop computer complete with a fingerprint reader. It does not take a great leap of the imagination to envisage how the industry might turn its mind to the verification of who is using a computer and who is ordering. That might play an important part in helping to authenticate online transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/4">I am a Liberal Democrat&mdash;we are nothing if not persistent&mdash;and we are averse to automatic biometric database systems. I throw into the pot the fear that such hugely sensitive information can be accidentally lost, whether the situation is similar to that in Haringey yesterday, whether a laptop is stolen from a bank employee's car or whether a data disc turns up in a dumpster. If people are worried about receiving a letter from the bank stating that their banking details had been lost, how would they feel if they received a letter saying that their fingerprints, their iris scan or another physical record&mdash;details that are theirs for life&mdash;has been mislaid?</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/5">Before banks contemplate going down that route, they should give a cast iron guarantee that such monumental data breaches are physically impossible&mdash;as we were promised with other data. That is where we could go in an effort to stop fraud. Frankly, I find it incomprehensible that such a large amount of data can be physically downloaded from a computer system on to a disc and taken out of a building. In my view, that should be impossible.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.0/6">Finally, I would like to consider what the state can do to help banks fight that crime. As the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has said, we are discussing an international racket supported by organised crime. We welcome the moves to make reporting of the crime easier for the victim, but I have not found much evidence that the Government are responding to an international problem with an international solution. I would welcome some comments from the Minister about what the Government are doing to co-ordinate their response with European police forces. We cannot treat this issue in a silo, because such treatment would ultimately lead to failure as organised criminals pay scant regard to borders and pick off police forces one by one. Some parts of the Lisbon treaty, which is going through now, address some of those issues, but I would welcome the Minister's comments about what she feels can be done specifically to deal with that crime, which, as we have heard, leaps around the world with such ease and causes such grief for its victims.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">May I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South-West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> on securing this morning's debate on what is a very serious and growing issue, and one that affects all our constituents? I can think of a particular case in my constituency in which a petrol station was subject to a skimming attack. Many of my constituents were defrauded and that fraud had a major impact on them. We can look at individual cases. As my hon. Friend said, in one case the details of 745 individual cards were taken from just one outlet. That example highlights how quickly this crime can be carried out and the number of people who can be involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/2">My hon. Friend was absolutely right to state clearly that this is not a victimless crime: neither for the individuals concerned nor for the financial institutions that seem ready to bear some significant losses arising from the fraud perpetrated through the skimming and cloning of cards. There is also the direct and personal impact on individual victims of credit card fraud or any other kind of financial fraud. It can be quite traumatic for many people and it dents and knocks their confidence in terms of their willingness either to use their credit card or to engage in other financial transactions.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1707" name="John Leech">The hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr. Leech)</phrase> highlighted an individual case involving his relative. In many ways, he put this crime into a physical context, demonstrating the impact that this type of fraud can have. The person involved has a sense of their security or safety being invaded or breached, especially as they do not expect to become a victim. So it is perhaps even more shocking when they do become a victim, because the fraud comes out of the blue, when they are least expecting something like that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" name="Lynne Featherstone">The hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Lynne Featherstone)</phrase> was right to make the point that things are moving quickly in relation to this crime. Innovation among criminals presents a growing and changing threat. The banks, Government and law enforcement agencies must be equally fast-moving and reactive in examining criminals' changing patterns of behaviour, and in considering how best we can confront the organised criminal gangs that perpetrate such offences and use the funds obtained for various unsavoury purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/5">APACS, the Association for Payment Clearing Services, is the trade body for the banks and financial institutions, and its figures indicate that the use of counterfeit cards is a growing trend. For the first six months of 2007, plastic card fraud losses as a whole rose by 26 per cent. to &pound;263.6 million. Of that figure, counterfeiting losses, of which skimming forms a part, amounted to &pound;72.3 million, which was a rise of 37 per cent. Given that counterfeiting losses for the whole of 2006 were less than &pound;100 million, we can safely say that the 2007 figures to be released next month will show a significant increase in the losses that have occurred due to the skimming, cloning and counterfeiting of cards and of the metallic strip, which is then put on the back of a number of these fraudulent cards that are subsequently used overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/6">APACS describes the operation of this counterfeiting process quite clearly:</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Most of this fraud involves skimming, whereby a card's magnetic stripe data (on the back of the card) is electronically copied by a criminal. Fraudsters often skim cards by using a device that is fitted to a cash machine or a PIN pad. This data is then transferred onto a fake magnetic stripe card. A counterfeit magnetic stripe card can potentially be used in any UK or overseas shop that hasn't upgraded to chip and PIN or at an overseas cash machine that hasn't been upgraded to chip and PIN - although to use a fake card at a foreign cash machine a criminal will also need to have obtained the card's PIN by separate means.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/8">I suppose that that explains how the advent of chip and pin and the use of other technology has provided an element of protection, but we cannot be complacent about this crime, given that criminals will use technology and other means to get round the chip and pin mechanism and to try to obtain details of the pin numbers. Such numbers can be obtained by various means.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/9">In discussing this issue, we must look at it in its wider context; by that, I mean the overall cost of financial fraud, including banking and credit card fraud. A report for the Association of Chief Police Officers' economic crime portfolio in February 2007 tried for the first time to demonstrate the total cost of financial fraud, of which this type of credit card fraud forms a part, to the UK economy. That report came up with the staggering figure of &pound;13.9 billion in 2005&mdash;including the cost of having to deal with financial fraud&mdash;of which fraud against private individuals amounted to &pound;2.75 billion. Those are huge numbers and they demonstrate the real cost of fraud and the fact that it is certainly not a victimless crime. Furthermore, it shows the impact that fraud has on our economy, if this level of finance is getting into the hands of organised criminal gangs.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/10">Credit card fraud is part of a wider picture of financial fraud. We might be talking this morning about counterfeit card fraud, skimming and cloning, but that fraud links into the selling of details abroad, using the internet and other technology that is now available. It also links into identity fraud, with the matching of information, such as matching credit card details with other personal information, and how that information is then combined to commit other frauds. Furthermore, once individuals have been identified by fraudsters, they can be targeted time after time.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/11">Also, with the advent of mass e-mailing, phishing e-mails and spam have been used to try to attract people either to some sort of direct fraud or to attract them to visit another website, where they can input their pin number and other information. If fraudsters can identify an individual and match their personal information with the information that has been skimmed off a credit card, it is easy to see how that combined information can be used to perpetrate perhaps even more convincing frauds. Therefore, this crime needs to be focused on clearly, because it is developing very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/12">I think that my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire made the point about the use to which these fraudulently obtained funds are being put. Increasingly, questions are being asked about whether such funds are going not only to those involved in organised criminal activity&mdash;sophisticated, international, organised gangs&mdash;but to those involved in terrorist activities. That is why it is so important that, for our own safety and security, we do all that we can to counteract this very serious criminal activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/13">My hon. Friend talked in detail about the changes to the reporting of financial fraud that were introduced last April, since when I have been concerned about not only their practical impact, to which I shall return, but the message that they send. If an individual cannot report financial fraud to the police, that sends the very damaging message that it is not an important priority; indeed, it almost sends the message to criminal gangs that we are not bothered about financial fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/14">Therefore, I remain critical of the way in which the changes were introduced. It was suggested that the aim was to reduce the bureaucracy involved in fraud recording and to streamline the reporting, recording and investigation of fraud. However, nothing happened in the case highlighted by my hon. Friend, in which 745 individual cards were, effectively, stolen after their details were obtained. That highlights a real failure in the system, which is not even operating in the way that was intended or meeting the goals that were set for it in terms of recording and reporting financial fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/15">Last summer, I put several questions to the Government about the manner in which the new arrangement was to operate. In response, the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/16" class="indent">&quot;From <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April 2007</phrase> each police force now has a single point of contact...that has been set up to receive reports of cheque and plastic card crime direct from financial institutions. It is a matter for the financial institutions which crimes they decide to refer to the police for recording. It is then a matter for individual chief officers to decide which crimes will be investigated.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.462"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 922, c. 462W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/17">The system almost has two limbs: there is the question of whether financial institutions report fraud to the police, and whether the police do anything about it. From the individual case highlighted by my hon. Friend, it seems that the system is falling down on two levels, because there are questions about whether any of the incidents are properly reported to the police and&mdash;even when they are&mdash;whether anything is done about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/18">It is almost as if a double inertia has been created in the system, which masks the true extent of what is going on. Although we have the figures provided by APACS, the association admits that banks and financial institutions have no common standards governing the reporting of data to the centre or, indeed, whether to report it at all. That raises significant concerns because financial institutions almost have an incentive not to report. There is a fear that they do not want to show the true scale and nature of the problem, and nothing actively encourages them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/19">I heard clearly what my hon. Friend said about the letter that he received from the Financial Services Authority, and that raises an important point. We must ensure that the regulations that sit behind financial institutions operate robustly and clearly. I hope that the Minister will say that she has had contact with her colleagues at the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform to ensure that the regulation of financial institutions dovetails with other provisions so that we have a streamlined process. When I asked about that a few months back, however, I was given no real assurance that that was happening. Even if we assume that this is the right way forward&mdash;there are very real questions about that&mdash;the issue must be addressed at several different levels to ensure that regulation is robust and effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.0/20">The second part of the issue relates to the manner in which the police deal with such matters, and there is a certain chronology to the way in which different police forces are intended to investigate such crimes. First, there is the police force covering the location of the fraudulent operation, and then the police force area where the greatest number of individual usages has taken place. We then move down to the police force area where the first offence was committed and finally to that where the victim is located. I appreciate that we need a protocol and standards in place, but such an approach highlights the bureaucracy and complications involved. When someone has become a victim of a crime and wants something done about it, they must go through such a process or even get their Member of Parliament involved if they want the issue addressed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19a.13.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" speakername="James Brokenshire" colnum="13"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0003.htm#08021973000455">
	<p pid="a.13.1/1">The clear point that is being made is that fraud is not a victimless crime, and any suggestion to the contrary is counter-productive and unhelpful in ensuring that we crack down on fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/2">Interestingly, that flows from the issue of reporting, which we have discussed. The answer that I got from the Minister of State last summer stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Where an account holder does contact the police to report this matter without having first spoken to their financial institution, a crime related incident will be recorded and the account holder will be referred to their financial institution.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-07-02.462"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2007; Vol. 923, c. 462W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/4">I appreciate that one reason why that change was introduced was that people's experience of reporting such crimes to police stations was not good. Trying to get someone to focus on such things was difficult, and the whole experience continues to draw criticism from individuals and the business sector. However, something is wrong if someone who has taken the time and trouble to report something to the police is turned away and told, &quot;It's not our problem. It's not something we really want to be involved in.&quot; Again, there is the question of whether such things are regarded as important and of what message that sends out. That also plays into the issue of whether people will actually bother to report fraud to the police or their financial institution if they are not confident that something will be done about it. If they do not, we will end up with under-reporting and under-recording, and the law enforcement agencies will not have a proper indication of patterns of offending or the nature and scale of the problem that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/5">I have a lot of respect for the dedicated cheque and plastic crime unit, whose representatives I have met. I have been to see its facilities, and I know that it takes this issue extremely seriously. The City of London police, as the ACPO lead on the issue, has also been pushing hard to raise the issue with the Government in the context of the ongoing fraud review, which I shall discuss shortly. However, there is not a level playing field in terms of the response that people receive from individual police forces, and although some police forces are very good, some are not. The Government's target-driven approach perhaps means that if we do not have a target, the issue is not a priority. That has perhaps meant that the discretion that people should have to treat crimes seriously has been fettered, with the result that the offences that we are discussing cannot be treated properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/6">I was shocked to hear about an individual case involving a financial institution. The institution had packaged up a number of offences, followed the protocol and given the case to the local police force that was responsible under the ranking system. First, nothing happened. The institution pressed again. What happened? The material was given to the dog handler. The institution was frustrated because it had tried to package the offences up and to give 20 different offences to an individual police force, after which nothing happened, and they were not treated seriously. Getting fraud prioritised and dealt with as a serious crime, in relation to cost and the increasing number of victims falling foul of it, is a serious issue. With the advent of the internet, and the changing nature of offending, the problem will become more serious, and we are not properly prepared either for the threats that we must withstand today or those that the country will face in the months and years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/7">It seems that there has been no proper assessment of the manner in which the system is being operated. My hon. Friend the Member for South-West Bedfordshire is right to urge the Minister today to undertake an assessment of the practicalities of the system and the proportion of cases that are actually reported to police forces after financial institutions have been notified, and to find out how many are then investigated. There is no real incentive to take the issue seriously. The way the scale of the problem is almost masked can, in some ways, bizarrely, suit financial institutions, in that it does not show the scale or nature of the problem. One might say that it also assists the Home Office, in that it ensures that the crime figures do not record that level of reporting.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/8">The Government have undertaken a fraud review, and in the spring of 2006 they published their interim report, in which they euphemistically accepted that</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the lack of a national strategy meant that some problems are not being addressed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/10">From the reports that we have received, and the individual reports of cases, that is an understatement. However, one thing that has come out of the proposal is the establishment of a national fraud strategy and a national fraud reporting centre. In principle, that is clearly a good idea, but I am entirely unconvinced about how it will work in practice. It is one thing to establish a national fraud reporting centre, but how will that fit into the arrangements that have been described this morning? How will it be promoted so that people understand that they should and can report individual incidents to the national fraud reporting centre? What guarantees are there that, even if the reports are sent through, something will be done to provide a proper insight into the nature of the problem and to ensure that criminals will be convicted of related offences, with a consequent reduction in harm?</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/11">One of my concerns is that the online environment and the e-crime aspects of fraud reporting have not been properly factored into the establishment of the NFRC. Many industry players to whom I have talked say that that does not appear to have been on the radar screens until very recently. Therefore, practically, I have significant concerns about how effective the arrangements will be. Judging by the feedback that I am receiving, the prognosis is not good. I should be interested to hear from the Minister how the NFRC will tie into the existing reporting arrangements, and what comfort there will be in the sense that, if reports are made, something will be done. Will financial institutions be obliged to share reports with the NFRC? Otherwise it seems as if there will be no meaningful picture on the nature and extent of, or trends in, financial fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.1/12">The Government have not been speedy in coming forward to address the matter. It does not appear to be the priority that it should be. I suggest that the approach to credit card fraud and e-crime has been lacklustre. Clearly, there is a growing problem, but the Government appear to prefer to see it as someone else's, not theirs. Sadly, it looks as if in the months and years ahead the consequence of that inaction will be that more people will fall victim to this growing crime, with all its impact and effects.</p>

	<p pid="a.17.1/1">I am not familiar with <i>The Luton News, </i>but I look forward to receiving a copy and passing it on to the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker)</phrase>. I am sure that he would be interested to read about that approach from the local police in Bedfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/2">As the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has rightly acknowledged, chip and pin represents a major improvement in tackling card fraud. It was introduced to tackle precisely the type of fraud that we are discussing today. The chip makes it impossible to use a cloned card in a cash machine and for a criminal to use a lost or stolen card. The Government supported the banks in introducing that, and fraud on lost or stolen cards fell by 23 per cent. in 2006, compared with 2005, with a further 15 per cent. fall in the first six months of 2007. Losses in this country have fallen, but that has led, as we have heard, to clever approaches by fraudsters to use those cards abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/3">I shall return to my point about how the Government alone cannot solve this problem. I have some sobering statistics that demonstrate the challenge at the international level. In 2006, plastic card fraud losses were &pound;428 million&mdash;3 per cent. lower than in 2005&mdash;but in the first six months of 2007 losses increased by 26 per cent., compared with the first six months of 2006. That increase was largely driven by increasing fraud abroad on UK-issued cards. Members will be pleased to know that the European banking industry has set a target of completing its chip card roll-out by 2010, which will protect British citizens and their cards from the sort of fraud that we have heard about today.</p>
	<p pid="a.17.1/4">Last year, the Home Office worked with the Association for Payment Clearing Services and the Foreign Office in order to raise the profile of the problem in the countries that account for the largest amount of fraud on UK-issued cards, and we continue to engage on an international level. That demonstrates, again, that many other people and Governments need to be involved in tackling such fraud. Hon. Members might be interested to know that fraud on UK-issued cards in America is increasing and that, in 2006, it accounted for 14 per cent. of total fraud losses abroad, so clearly work needs to be done. The industry has found it particularly difficult to engage with bodies in America over this problem. However, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling&mdash;this is primarily his area of responsibility&mdash;recently agreed to write to his political counterparts in the United States to raise the profile of the problem. We hope for progress on that and co-operation from the Americans.</p>

	<p pid="a.18.1/1">With permission, I shall ask the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling to respond to that in writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/2">As hon. Members have mentioned, the Government introduced a fraud review, which led to us allocate &pound;29 million in order to implement recommendations arising out of it. I shall list the key points: we are setting up the national fraud strategic authority, which will drive UK anti-fraud strategy, as hon. Members have mentioned; we will establish a national fraud reporting centre, which will help to improve our intelligence and information on fraud; and we will establish a national lead force, which will enhance policing capacity. City of London police will be the lead force, and it is already the lead for the south-east. We want to build on its work and expertise in that important area.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/3">I shall explain the rationale behind the approach since April 2007, particularly because it has been criticised by the hon. Member for Hornchurch. However, I am pleased that the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire has acknowledged that the change to reporting to financial institutions was not necessarily wrong, although, as he has rightly pointed out, perhaps we can continue to make improvements in certain areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/4">A great deal of fraud is carried out by organised criminal gangs and it is important that we develop policies in order to understand how best to deploy resources against them. We hope that the improved reporting mechanisms mean that the level of reporting will go up. In many cases, the lack of reporting has meant dealing only with police figures, which are very low. In 2004-05, some 121,000 cheque and plastic card crimes were reported to police. In 2005-06, that figure fell to 88,000, and it fell to 59,000 in 2006-07. That sounds like a good news story, but the figure from APACS for 2006-07 was nearly 2.3 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.1/5">Clearly, there was a level of under-reporting to police, because most people just want their money back. It is not that people are not interested in passing the information on to the police, but they have busy lives and want to get the real problem sorted, which for them means getting their money back. Clearly, that has an effect on behaviour. I stress that there are very severe sentences for fraud by false representation&mdash;up to 10 years' imprisonment. Severe penalties can follow an investigation, and we want more introduced as a deterrent to people working in that area. The reporting of fraud is important, and we want to make it easier for people. That is why we adopted that approach, which has advantages for all concerned.</p>

Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing stated in his written answer that we are keeping the situation under review, and we continuously assess the effectiveness of the arrangements. The process is continuous, so there will not be a big-bang moment, but this debate has been useful in highlighting some of the issues arising from the new reporting system. I stress that it is still, none the less, an improvement on what went before, and we are trying to streamline reporting and information gathering. With that intelligence and data, the police and the financial institutions will be better able to protect the public, who are the big victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.3/3">My right hon. Friend has a steering group, comprising law enforcement agencies and banks, which meets regularly, and I shall ask him to put the issue on the agenda at his next meeting. I thank the hon. Member for South-West Bedfordshire for raising the issue with me today.</p>

	<p pid="a.22.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you chairing our proceedings today, Miss Begg. This is an important debate about the sentencing options available to our criminal courts, and I am glad that we shall be under your watchful eye as you take care of us with your usual compassion and attention to detail. I am also pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister will listen to today's contributions and respond to the debate. She is conscientious and diligent in carrying out her ministerial duties, and she will want to take close account of what is said. I hope that she will be able to respond positively to some of my points.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/2">About 1.3 million adults are sentenced each year in the courts of England and Wales. In addition, children and young people appear before the courts, and about 120,000 court disposals were reported in 2006-07 involving them. Overall, since 1997, the number of crimes, including violent crime, is down, and last year, the number of deaths that the police reported as homicides was down to an eight-year low. The debate presents us with an opportunity not only to consider what to do for the future, but to pay tribute to those who work so diligently and with such commitment to serve the public through their work in, and for, the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/3">I very much support the police in their work. They play a pivotal role at every stage, from keeping the peace, through detecting crime, apprehending offenders, securing the evidence for convictions, enforcing bail conditions and taking part in the management of offenders subject to restrictions post-sentence, to playing their part to the full in multi-agency work, which includes persistent and prolific-offender programmes, such as the one I have visited four times in Stafford, and assessments of public protection and risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/4">In addition to the police, the Crown Prosecution Service works conscientiously to secure fair trials, convictions of the guilty and advice to courts on appropriate sentences. Working with the police and agencies such as Victim Support, it ensures that victims feel as involved in the process as they want to be and that the system places them and their interests at its heart. At least, that is the ambition. The last time we had Question Time to the Solicitor-General, I asked him whether he was yet satisfied that the CPS consistently achieves that aim. I hope that we will continue to give attention principally to the interests of victims in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/5">To carry on with my praise for those involved in the system, professional and lay judges bear heavy responsibility for decisions on guilt and innocence, bail and sentences, with a barrage of ill-informed criticism awaiting them when a decision is wrong or, with the benefit of hindsight, shown to be inadequate. Prison staff have a tough job keeping dangerous and violent people safely under lock and key and having an eye for vulnerable individuals who are not coping with imprisonment. They work tirelessly to improve the prospects of those leaving prison, so that they leave free from drug or alcohol misuse and with educational skills that they lacked on entry, and which will, we hope, assist them to be supported after release, especially in such crucial matters as housing, work and relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/6">In the community, probation staff do phenomenal work with offenders. The risks are obvious given that there can hardly be 24-hour supervision, which is no doubt why so many probation officers give 110 per cent. effort to their work, routinely going beyond the call of duty, patiently working with offenders when others might feel like giving up on them, and securing benefits for the community at large by reducing offending, supervising payback and educating the public about sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/7">Then there is the Youth Justice Board and the many youth offending teams up and down the country, which perform so valiantly as they seek to divert children and young people from what might otherwise become a life of crime. Given the prolific nature of some offending, they are truly in the forefront of efforts to protect the public. As someone who took part in the many parliamentary debates about the creation of the National Offender Management Service, I know only too well that many other organisations contribute a huge amount to the work that goes on to reduce offending, to give effect to court sentences and to support victims of crime&mdash;organisations such as Victim Support, the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders and Rainer. No doubt there are many other groups and organisations that I have omitted to praise. I acknowledge the fantastic work that they all do, and I mean them no discourtesy by not naming them individually.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/8">I turn to the situation in our prisons and to imprisonment as a sentence. In my view, and I think that of most people, prisons should be reserved for dangerous and violent offenders. The public demand protection from dangerous people and severe punishment for people who commit heinous crimes. Prisons are full, partly because sentences are longer. Indeterminate sentences keep very dangerous offenders in prison longer, and those who breach their licence conditions after early release are much more likely to be returned to prison. That ought to give the public some reassurance that prison provides the right deterrent and punishment for dangerous people.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/9">However, the near doubling of the prison population in the past decade has created enormous pressures&mdash;not just financial cost to the state and the need to build more prisons, but the early release of prisoners and subtle pressure on sentencers. Faced with a case that is borderline but for which prison may be the right sentence, courts are given the message that there are no places in prison. We should consider ways to keep out of prison people who are not dangerous and who should be dealt with by community sentences. For non-violent women, imprisonment should be avoided when possible, for all the reasons that the Corston review recently set out. We should do much more to keep children out of prisons and comply with the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. In addition to working hard to keep women and children out of prison, we should provide alternatives to prison for people who do not pay fines, those with learning difficulties and those with a mental illness. Drugs and alcohol fuel crime, and there should be earlier access to health care outside prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/10">I wish to focus primarily on community sentences and other community solutions. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 helpfully sets out the purposes of sentencing in most cases. They are fivefold: punishment, reduction of crime, reform and rehabilitation of offenders, protection of the public and reparation by offenders to persons affected by their crimes. I enumerate them, but as I recall from the debates on the Act&mdash;I was closely involved in every stage of its parliamentary proceedings&mdash;the five were not intended to be in sequence. Each was to be weighed against the others by the sentencing court.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/11">How are we doing on the five purposes? Lord Woolf was asked that question by the Select Committee on Home Affairs when he gave evidence to it on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-17">17 April 2007</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Perhaps we achieve the punishment of offenders, but when we look at the other four our record is very poor.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/13">He indicated the difficulty of reforming and rehabilitating prisoners when prisons are overcrowded and there is pressure on staff to deliver the courses needed. He believes that reparation solutions are underdeveloped and that we are not protecting the public sufficiently if we do not prevent reoffending effectively. I shall develop his arguments and suggest that there are ways in which we can do better.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/14">The aims of sentencing are best met when the period that elapses between the crime and the disposal is as short as possible. That is true especially when the offender is young, but it holds good for many crimes, irrespective of the offender's age. The public understand that argument and expect the Government, Parliament and the criminal justice system to make criminal cases shorter. Back in 1997, in the heady days of winning my first election to Parliament, I found that that message really resonated with the public. I remember Labour's five pledges on the little pledge card that we used to give out to people. One was to halve the time that it took to bring young offenders to court for their sentences. That resonated with the public because they understood the importance of keeping the distance between offence and sentence as short as possible. When only a little time elapses between the commission of the offence and the offender facing up to the consequences of it, the connection between wrongdoing and payback is strong for both the offender and the victim. That is why, in appropriate cases, fixed penalty notices and restorative justice can be so powerful. The former is self-explanatory, but I shall say more about the latter.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/15">There is now well-defined practice and law for restorative justice in cases involving children and young persons. A restorative justice order can even be made in a court. For adults, the position is less clear and the powerful tool of restorative justice does not play the role that it should in our criminal justice system. In Staffordshire, Chief Inspector Mark Riley has applied restorative justice solutions since 1994, and he is positive about their benefits. He told me:</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/16" class="indent">&quot;The Victim often feels much better about the outcome, for even if they do not get recompense from the Offender, the fact that they have been able to 'Get it off their chest' is very cathartic for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/17" class="indent">The Offender will obviously 'benefit' as they do not get a conviction out of the process, although the emotional trauma that they go through in the RJ process and the fact that they have to apologise for their actions often means that they comment about it not being a soft option.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/18">The upsides of using restorative justice include, first, that it is victim-centred; the needs of victims are addressed and victims have a say in how the process should be carried out, so it empowers them rather than leaving them on the sidelines. Secondly, it is possible to hold group sessions&mdash;for example, in antisocial behaviour cases. Thirdly, it can involve all the interested parties and improve communication between different parts of the community. Fourthly, it can address long-standing complaints within communities as well as specific incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/19">There are downsides, however, some of which we can address. In a police performance culture, restorative justice does not count as detection. The Government have recently begun to get a grip on that problem by releasing the police from over-prescriptive targets on detection. That is welcome, but, as with other community punishments and diversions from court, it is important that the community, the police and the criminal justice system all feel that restorative justice brings as positive a result as a court sentence would have achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/20">A second downside is that it takes the police as long to resolve a restorative justice case as to prepare a full file for court. A third is that too few police officers are trained to facilitate restorative justice, which requires experience and skill to make it work in the victim's favour. However, training is available to those who want to pursue that outlet. Mark Riley referred me to Inspector Tony Walker of Thames Valley police, who trained him, so I sought out Inspector Walker and spoke to him about restorative justice. I am told that Thames Valley police is probably the best police force in the country at developing restorative justice as a solution. When I spoke to Inspector Walker yesterday, he was extremely enthusiastic about it as a general solution that ought to be widely available in criminal cases. He reports that through his use of restorative justice, there have been immense reductions in repeat and serial offending as well as reductions in crime in a problem area.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/21">There should be well-defined practices for offenders to apologise to victims and to hear what effect their crimes have had on their victims, and perhaps to pay compensation or do unpaid work for their victims. However, it should be clear which cases are suitable for that approach, and care should be taken to prevent its use where it would be dangerous or counter-productive. There should also be sufficient training of police officers and other facilitators to remove lack of capacity as an excuse for not using restorative justice. When restorative justice is the right solution, it ought to count as a successful conclusion to a case.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/22">Conditional cautions do not involve going to court to get a sentence. The Government place great store in conditional cautioning as a vehicle to achieve greater use of restorative justice. It will become universally available to the police and the Crown Prosecution Service in April after a period of trialling, including in Staffordshire. Police in Staffordshire who have experience of conditional cautioning speak positively about it. Will the Minister explain the Government's intentions regarding conditional cautioning from April onwards, when it becomes widely available? How much does she anticipate it will be used? Looking back at the pilots and trials, what assessment has been made of its success to date, and what success is predicted for the future?</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/23">I recently asked the Minister about conditional cautioning in a written question. In her reply, she stated that the</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/24" class="indent">&quot;compliance rate is about 6 per cent.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-29.292"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 January 2008; Vol. 471, c. 292W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/25">That sounds quite worrying, and it does not make much sense. If a conditional caution means that the police and the CPS have agreed that if a certain course of action has been taken, a caution will follow, non-compliance does not apply because there will be no caution if the required work is not carried out. I am not sure what the phrase means, so I would be grateful if the Minister will clarify that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/26">Conditional cautioning is quick and cuts out court sentencing altogether. I am content with that as long as the scheme meets other important public policy and sentencing objectives. Crucially, if that method of disposal is used regularly, there must be accountability about how it is used, so that there is no abuse. Statistics must be collected and published to ensure transparency.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/27">Although the debate is about sentencing, I have been talking about ways of keeping sentencing out of the hands of judges, which some people will think is good and others will think is bad. Before I discuss courts' sentencing powers, I shall say a little more about court diversion and other ways of resolving cases. There are methods that meet all the aims of sentencing policy and wider public protection, but which are quick and cut out the need for court proceedings; for example, drivers who are caught exceeding the speed limit may, in defined circumstances, can pay to go on a speed awareness course and avoid fines and points on their driving licences&mdash;as can drivers who are caught driving without due care and attention. Such schemes have led me to consider where similar practices could be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/28">I recently asked some parliamentary questions about military training, which is given both to armed forces personnel and to members of the public by way of outreach work by the military. In reply to one of my written questions, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" name="Derek Twigg">the Member for Halton (Derek Twigg)</phrase>, told me that there is a military corrective training centre at Colchester that</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/29" class="indent">&quot;exists to retrain and rehabilitate service personnel who have offended&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-22.1840"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 January 2008; Vol. 470, c. 1840W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/30">There is also an outreach programme to help vulnerable young people outside the military, and young people could join the cadet forces that operate widely in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/31">I know from my experiences of cadet forces in Staffordshire that they are run on a shoestring. I regularly visit the military base at Stafford, where the Army cadets train, and I am the honorary president of the Penkridge air cadets, so I regularly visit their training centre too. I have seen the brilliant work that is done with youngsters to give them discipline, a sense of purpose, recognised qualifications and Duke of Edinburgh awards. As a result of their training, some young people have the ambition of joining our armed forces, and they are well placed to be recruited because of the skills and qualifications that they have acquired.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/32">Cadet force instructors are incredible people. Some of them volunteer completely, giving all their time for free, while others receive payment for some of their work, but do miles more than they are paid to do. We could not ask our overstretched military forces to do more with their money and pay for the kind of training courses that I am talking about, so we need to consider how we could fund such a solution. I am interested in that as a way of diverting people from a life of crime and certainly from an appearance in court. If by training people and putting them straight, the military gained a new way of recruiting suitable armed forces personnel, that would be an added bonus.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/33">The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1530" name="David Hanson">the Member for Delyn (Mr. Hanson)</phrase> recently told me in a written answer:</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/34" class="indent">&quot;We are consulting with a range of organisations which have an interest in youth justice and the provision of youth justice services as part of the Youth Crime Action Plan which will be published in the summer, and will consider the feasibility of sending young offenders on training programmes by the armed services in light of the response to that consultation.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-01-28.154"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 January 2008; Vol. 471, c. 154W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/35">Therefore, this is not an out-of-field suggestion; it is under consideration. For some non-violent, antisocial offences, offenders could choose to go on training courses run by the military rather than going to court for sentencing. Such a scheme would apply mostly to young offenders, but need not be exclusively for young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/36">Nor need we stop at the military as providers of suitable training courses, such as the one that I just described. In Staffordshire, for example, the fire and rescue service runs a young firefighters training course. Those identified to take the course are young people in danger of social exclusion and those whose behaviour shows them to be in danger of becoming involved in crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/37">Can we not consider whether more providers are ready and willing to take part in schemes that have the backing and recognition of law? Could public sector bodies develop appropriate courses? Might there be private sector offers as well? Third-sector providers such as Rainer and the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders are already involved with similar projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/38">Those are my suggestions for taking the weight of sentencing off the court, but when we come to community sentencing itself, we must look at how we can make the process speedier. Beyond the early disposal of cases without a court hearing at all, existing community sentences ought to be adapted&mdash;adjusted by Parliament&mdash;to make possible a sentence that specifies attendance on training courses, such as the ones that I described, as a whole or a part of the court disposal. That would be in addition to the more than 6 million hours of unpaid work that are already carried out in the community each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/39">On that work, it is time that we settled whether payback is the brand for all reparation work that is ordered by the courts and carried out by offenders for the victims and the community more widely. We ought to ensure that there is much more labelling of the public property that is repaired or paid for by offenders as a result of such orders, and of community projects that have been completed by offenders undertaking unpaid work at the order of a court. In that way, the public would see constant reminders, as they went about their everyday business, that people had been caught, punished through the courts and made to do work to pay back the community for what they did. That would help us to inform and educate the public about crimes being detected and successfully prosecuted, and community sentences being served as a result. The public would then have a sense of the criminal justice system working for them, and punishment would be successfully allied with payback.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/40">One important aim of reducing reoffending is making people pay for what they have done wrong, but I appreciate that the National Offender Management Service has developed seven pathways for reducing reoffending. To remind hon. Members of the full list, NOMS deals with: accommodation; education, training and employment; health; drugs and alcohol; finance, benefits and debt; children and families; and attitudes, thinking and behaviour. All are clearly important, and all require the speedy responses that I mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/41">Alongside thinking about how we can quickly deliver a community sentence at the end of the process, I would like to deal with speeding up the procedures to get to the end of the process. That links up with my argument about keeping to a minimum the period between the offence and the sentence. It is important that we continue to encourage initiatives that are already taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/42">The first and most obvious initiative is to free the police from unnecessary burdens of bureaucracy to allow them more time on the front line to do the work that we need them to do, of reassuring the public, catching criminals and keeping the peace. The Flanagan review, which has just been made public, makes important recommendations about cutting police &quot;blue tape&quot;. I am pleased to say that Staffordshire is actually pushing the Home Office to let it be at the forefront of implementing Flanagan recommendations to cut bureaucracy and free police to do the quality policing that the public want from them. That initiative would speed up the whole process.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/43">The second initiative, which has already begun but needs to be recognised and encouraged, is the excellent practice of co-locating police and prosecutors, thereby getting much earlier and more accurate decisions on the right charges and the right cases to take forward for prosecution. Allied to the successful co-operation between the police and the prosecution has been the development of low-bureaucracy court files for the most straightforward cases. Again, that takes away some of the excuses for unnecessary delays and the resulting adjournments in proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/44">There have been several experiments with specialist courts such as those for drugs and domestic violence cases, and there has even been talk of courts for mental health cases. As long as we assess the effectiveness of each, and as long as they do not divert resources that would be more effectively used for the mainstream business of courts, there is a lot to be said for developing expertise in each of those areas to speed up court proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/45">Another initiative that my friends in the Staffordshire police are enthusiastic about, having now witnessed it, is the virtual court. The police officer and the accused can remain at the police station. They are in touch with the court by a video link, and the whole process is got out of the way and dealt with without moving outside the custody suite in the police station.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/46">Those are procedures that we are already developing and adapting in this country to speed up the process. They should be welcomed and encouraged to take greater hold. If we speed up the process, and ultimately get effective community sentence orders from the court, it is important to ensure that those orders are then carried out effectively. There is no point in Members of Parliament such as me suggesting additional and refined sentencing powers if the existing ones are not already being used, where appropriate. I take that lesson from last month's report by the National Audit Office, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/47" class="indent">&quot;Not all components of community orders are used in all probation areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/48">Why is that? What is wrong? Why are people given powers to operate and then not able to use them? The NAO finds that community orders are effective, that they offer benefits over other court sentences and that they can reduce reconviction rates. Contrary to popular belief, most sentences are completed&mdash;94 per cent., according to the NAO report, although, to be absolutely open and complete, it states that 94 per cent. are completed, breached or revoked.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/49">The report revealed a particular weakness in the use of one component of a community order: alcohol treatment. Given the concerns that members of the public have about how much of today's offending behaviour is fuelled by alcohol consumption, such a weakness is particularly inappropriate. The report says that the availability of the alcohol treatment component varies greatly across the country, and it identifies responsibilities not just in the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office but in the Department of Health and, at the local level, for primary care trusts and the deliverers of health services. NHS involvement means that Justice Ministers need to work conscientiously and as hard as they can across Government to ensure that the funding and facilities are in place to make alcohol treatment available everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/50">The final area that I wish to cover is parenting. I have learned in a lifetime of experiences, and as a lawyer who dealt with divorce cases, family dispute cases and public law cases involving children being taken away from their parents, that the first three years of everybody's life is the most crucial in determining how they will perform and behave throughout the rest of their life. One of the many experts whom I have heard speak said that we learn up to half of all that we ever learn, however long we live, in the first three years of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/51">Many people spout on about how schools and education can solve a lot of the problems of children who might be growing up with identified weaknesses. However, the starting age for school is five, reception classes are offered at four and a child may be able to get into a nursery at three, so nobody is near a school in the vital years from nought to three. Who are the vital educators during those years? The parents. That is so blindingly obvious, yet some parents do not understand how important they are. I want to look at ways of reducing offending behaviour by starting at the right point&mdash;at year zero&mdash;with every new citizen.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/52">Of course, this is a debate about sentencing, and we have an option called a parenting order, but that would be aimed at the parents of a youth&mdash;perhaps a teenager&mdash;who has offended. I am sure that those orders can sometimes be useful at that stage, but there needs to be rigorous enforcement of attendance and participation by parents. It is at that stage that we might find that the absence of parents or their inability to take part is the reason that we have a problem in society. Nevertheless, where parenting orders are used, we need to be as rigorous as possible in getting a whole-family approach to tackling the offending behaviour of the person who has been in trouble with the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.22.1/53">Parenting orders represent an intervention some way down the line, after the offending behaviour by the child has become established. I have been attracted to the work of an international charity called Wave. A report co-written by Professor George Hosking in 2005 draws a number of conclusions about how a public health approach to crime prevention in those first three years of children's lives could lead to a great reduction in violent behaviour and offending in later life.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.1/1">No, not really. Of course, I share all the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned&mdash;that is the point of my mentioning parenting in a debate about court sentencing&mdash;but the use of violence by a parent to reinforce discipline reflects completely the wrong attitude. Violence between a parent and a child is a sign of failure and of pushing the child away from the parent, instead of their being drawn in and loved and cared for. I do not share his analysis of what the right solution to the problem is, although I agree that there is a problem. I should like to expand a little on that to show what I mean.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/2">I have more time than I thought, so I should like to say a little more about the 2005 Wave report, which concluded, among other things, that serious violence in England and Wales is rising and that that trend can be reversed by effective early interventions focusing on the period from pregnancy to the age of three. Another conclusion of the report, which is the result of nine years' research&mdash;this is not something that has been considered lightly&mdash;is that the propensity to violence is developed primarily from wrong treatment before the age of three.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/3">We should explain to every parent how important those first three years are, to equip them with the skills and the outside support that they feel that they need, entirely through their choice. However, the danger is the nanny state, which was the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> was drawing me towards. I understand that it is for each parent to do their job and carry out their responsibilities, but as a society it is our job to make them appreciate what their role is and give them support when they feel that they need it. It is entirely for them to choose whether they need it or not. However, if parents fail in their job, when their children end up in the court system we must hold them to account as well as their children. That is the incentive for them to pay attention when we give them such messages.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/4">In my constituency, I have been promoting for Staffordshire a universal parenting support service that is available to all parents. Universality is important. We should not try to stigmatise bad parents, because that would simply drive them away from us. We need to say that every parent reaches a point when they need somebody to turn to and there is nothing wrong with people turning to help that is already available for them. That is what I would like to achieve. However, that does not mean adding some new agency of the state. In my constituency, health visitors, midwives, general practitioners' practice nurses, churches and organisations such as Home-Start already exist: it is about branding them, drawing them together and offering support. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> is doing similar creative work in Nottingham, trying to make it the early intervention city, precisely on the same reasoning that I am using. That is a very important way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/5">There are some recommendations at the end of the Wave report, based on research and hard evidence from around the world, about some of the responses that we ought to consider applying as a matter of course in this country: a course called &quot;Roots of empathy&quot;, drawn from successful practice in Canada, prepares parents-to-be while they are still schoolchildren; a British charity, Parents in Partnership Parent Infant Network, prepares parents-to-be during the first pregnancy; in the United States of America, the Nurse-Family Partnership supports first-time parents from pregnancy onwards; and there is also an internationally known approach called the &quot;circle of security&quot;, which is a group-based parent intervention programme to increase sensitivity between parents and children. All those ideas already exist. The Wave report says simply:</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/6" class="indent">&quot;Debate is invited on the merits of a focused, national crime prevention agency to co-ordinate, fund and drive effective early prevention strategies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/7">It is calling for a debate about what is the most effective use of our money.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/8">I attended a presentation by Professor George Hosking at which he showed that intervention in a child's life had the greatest effect from nought to three years old. He superimposed on that profile the spending by the state on children's upbringing. The biggest payment that we make as a state is when children are 15, 16 or 17 and the smallest payment is when they are aged from nought to three. Yet the greatest intervention that we could make is at nought to three. We ought to think about whether we should make changes. I say to the Minister that it is important to work across Government to get the right solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/9">I have been speaking for quite a while because I am the only Back Bencher who wants to make a full speech, but I will come to my conclusions now. Another great connection that Labour made with voters in 1997 was through the promise of being &quot;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&quot;. We have certainly been tough on crime in terms of more and longer prison sentences. That seems to be Lord Woolf's conclusion as well. We have been tough on some of the societal causes of crime, for example, cutting worklessness, rough sleeping and poverty. But my connection with my public in my Stafford constituency tells me that other causes of crime have been under-addressed. People often mention a loss of discipline, a decline in standards of behaviour in public and binge drinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/10">For me, discipline starts with good parenting and upbringing. Upholding decent standards of behaviour calls for a genuine zero tolerance of annoying public crimes such as damage to property, graffiti, litter, public disorder and antisocial behaviour. Tackling binge drinking requires determination to stop supermarkets selling alcohol below cost price.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/11">I want accommodation, health care and help getting a job to be available to people at risk of offending before they commit an offence. I want those who wish to face up to their drugs and alcohol misuse helped to overcome their addiction before they embark on a rash of acquisitive crimes to feed their habit. Sometimes, people commit such crimes precisely to access one or more of those supports because they cannot get them soon enough as law-abiding citizens. That is wrong. As I have said, a cross-Government approach is required to achieve such outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.30.1/12">It is the responsibility of Back-Bench and Opposition Members of Parliament, as elected representatives of the British people, to exert pressure on the Government to take the right actions, facilitate the passing of the laws that are needed and scrutinise the resultant use of funding and other resources to make sure that the taxpayer gets best value. Above all, it is our responsibility to bring about safer communities and a safer Britain.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.0/1">Thank you, Miss Begg, it is a pleasure to take part in this debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on securing it. The hon. Gentleman has a long history, in his career in the House, of raising issues of this kind and speaking with a great deal of intelligence and commitment on matters associated with criminal justice. He and I, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase>, are veterans of too many criminal justice Bills for our own good. Nevertheless, we have frequently had the opportunity to debate such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/2">The hon. Member for Stafford is right to look at sentencing in the context of what happens beforehand. I was pleased that he paid tribute to a large number of the participants in the process, including the police. Sentences cannot be imposed until a criminal is before a court, and my view has always been that the greatest deterrent to crime is the expectation of being caught, but sadly that has not been the case for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/3">The hon. Gentleman was also right when he said that we have not paid enough attention&mdash;the Government have certainly not done so&mdash;to the causes of crime, particularly the elements that he described, and parenting is a large component of that. I do not want to be misunderstood in suggesting that there is an hereditary component to crime, and I am certainly not talking about a genetic predisposition; I am talking about a behavioural element, because there is undoubtedly learned behaviour from parents and peer groups. If that disjunction can be cracked, intervention at an early age is more likely to reduce people's potential to find themselves in a life of crime. That is not universally the case, and some parents have done everything that might be expected of them, but still find their children in trouble with the law. I do not want my suggestion to be considered an absolute, but the hon. Gentleman is right in saying that we have not yet sufficiently considered the idea.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.1/1">I certainly welcome that, but I also recognise the practical problems for a single officer or pair of officers on the beat in towns such as Frome in my constituency on a Friday evening. I have been out on patrol with the police, and there are many underage drinkers on the streets in Frome on Friday nights. Dealing with them is a problem, and my question is: why do parents not ask why a 13 or 14-year-old is not at home well past midnight, and why, when they finally return, they are legless? That returns to the point made by the hon. Member for Stafford about parenting and the expected norms in exercising a little parental control. However, that is a slight diversion from what we are discussing: sentencing policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/2">I am pleased that among his bouquets, the hon. Member for Stafford handed one to the lay magistracy, because we often do not recognise its extraordinarily difficult and unpaid job, and the value that it adds to society.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/3">What should we look for in sentencing? My starting point throughout my forays into home affairs and justice matters is to ask whether it is effective in reducing crime. That is the whole point of a criminal justice system. If it does not reduce offending, it is not doing its job effectively. Secondly, we are entitled to expect some consistency throughout the country and in relation to specific crimes, so that there is an underlying feeling about the justice of the outcome for any specific disposal. Thirdly, we must allow discretion. It is not for Parliament or the Government to prescribe in minute detail the outcome of a court case. There is no point in wise people sitting in judgment if they cannot take account of the evidence before them and the circumstances of the crime in question. Such discretion is an important part of the principles of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/4">Fourthly, we should seek more transparency, which returns us to the argument we often have in this place about honesty in sentencing. We should describe sentences in a way that everyone inside and outside the courts understands, so that they are not dismayed by the realisation that when we say someone will serve 20 years in prison, they are released after five or six years, and that a 20-year sentence is not in fact a 20-year sentence, or that a life sentence is not for life. We need honesty in sentencing, and that can be achieved in the way in which we describe sentences, rather than by any major change in the nature of sentences. Finally, we must have centrality in sentencing from the victims' point of view, and their concerns must be put before the court, understood by the court and, if possible, addressed by the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/5">For many years we have concentrated far too much on custodial sentences as the only &quot;proper&quot; sentences that work. Custodial sentences undoubtedly have a part to play, and are the only effective sentence for protecting the public from a dangerous criminal who is likely to reoffend, so it is essential that such sentences play a part in our penal process. However, the hon. Gentleman was right in saying that they are often used when they are not the best disposal, although his argument that because more people are breaking their licences and being returned to prison, the public should be reassured that prison is working was rather difficult to understand in logical terms. I suggest that it may do the opposite.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/6">Why are our prisons so overcrowded? Why do they so often fail in their primary duty of rehabilitation, re-education and the reduction of recidivism? They contain far too many people with mental health problems who should be in secure mental health units. They contain far too many people with drug and alcohol dependency issues that should be treated rather than simply reinforced, as, sadly, they often are in the prison estate. Far too many women are in prison. Baroness Corston's report clearly shows that women who do not represent a danger to the public are often imprisoned inappropriately for lower level offences. There are certainly too many children in our prisons. There are better ways of dealing with children, and there is ample evidence that prison does not work in reducing offending in children. The reverse is the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.1/7">Too many people are serving short-term sentences when all the evidence is that such sentences are almost certain to result in a reoffending individual. Why on earth do we spend enormous amounts of public money on putting people into prison for a very short time when they can have no opportunity for education or rehabilitation, and when they reoffend almost immediately after being released? Some of the figures show that reoffending rates exceed 90 per cent., and that includes only those who are caught. The system simply does not work in its primary purpose, so why do we spend enormous amounts of money on pursuing a policy that does not work?</p>

	<p pid="a.34.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I was just about to mention that issue. There are better possibilities for effective community sentences, but the problem is that until recently the Government have appeared not to believe in such proposals and the public do not believe in them either. We need to establish in the public mind the fact that community sentencing can be rigorous and effective and do the job as well, or better, than a custodial sentence. To do that we need to re-examine the way in which we deal with community sentencing.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/2">There are some high-intensity schemes with prolific offenders that operate in the community. Such schemes cost a lot of money and are not undemanding in terms of resources, but it has been shown that they can reduce offending among a notoriously difficult group of offenders. In Bristol, a scheme has been operating for some time with, interestingly, the police as the prime movers, although they work with other agencies. I used to be the chairman of Avon and Somerset police authority and am impressed by what the force has been doing. I would like to see more such schemes, but I recognise that there needs to be a large resource for them to work effectively. There will, of course, be failures; we are talking about prolific offenders who have been to prison and come out. We should deal with a comparator that makes sense in terms of the general public, but nevertheless such schemes have been shown to be more effective than simply a lock-them-up-and-forget-about-them approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/3">What would make community sentencing more acceptable in terms of public perception? The hon. Gentleman mentioned some points in relation to that. Immediacy is important, as is propinquity to the offence and the community that is affected because that means there is a relationship between the offence and the offended community or individual. Visibility is also important. We must make community sentencing more visible so that the public realise that it is not a soft touch, but a way of directly making amends for the crime in the community in which it has been committed. If we put those factors together, there is likely to be greater public acceptability. The restorative element, whether within a formal community sentence or outside it, is extraordinarily important and we should find ways to incorporate it so the person who is arrested for graffiti is seen to clean up the graffiti that he or she created. The restorative element is important for establishing public confidence and there are many examples of that kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/4">The hon. Gentleman is right: it is often most difficult for the offender to come to terms with the restorative element. When an offender has to come face to face with the victim and say how sorry they are, they realise how much their action has affected that individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/5">The worst argument for community sentencing is simply to say that it is needed because our prisons are full. I am worried about much of what has recently happened because there have been some quite arbitrary measures. Rather than having confidence that community sentencing is a better disposal, people have been saying, &quot;Well, we haven't got enough room in prisons so we will require our magistracy or judges to use community sentencing more&quot;. I hope that will not be the case in future, but it worries me. The Lord Chancellor has set up a review of sentencing, on the basis of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which will consider the relationship between sentencing and penal provision. The Lord Chancellor appears to have pre-empted that review in his speech last week in America&mdash;I think it was at George Washington university&mdash;where he appeared to say, &quot;Well, we want to go the way of the American model where in some states there is a direct relationship between cell availability and sentencing policy&quot;. I question that approach. It may work in Minnesota or Michigan&mdash;it is a state beginning with M, but I cannot remember which one&mdash;but it will not work for us. Such a policy is not right in principle either, because if somebody is a threat to the community, they should be in prison; if they are not a threat, we should consider the alternatives and ensure that they work effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/6">Other disposals are below the level of formal court hearings, such as disposals at neighbourhood courts or at a peer group level. That sort of thing has been experimented with; for example, a restorative justice panel in Chard, Somerset, has worked well. Recidivism levels are well below those of a normal court dealing with the same sort of individual because there is a relationship between the offender, the offended against and the community. We need to consider such proposals, explore their effectiveness and see how far they can be expanded.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/7">A further level below court, to which the hon. Gentleman referred and about which he is slightly more enthusiastic than I am, is that of summary measures taken by a police officer or prosecutor. I am worried about the proliferation of summary disposals that do not have the advantage of a court or judicial input. It is far too easy for a police officer or even a prosecutor to take an injudicious decision for the benefit of his or her records, rather than in the interests of justice. I am not saying that all such disposals are wrong&mdash;we all live in the world of fixed penalty tickets for parking and traffic offences&mdash;but I am worried that they are increasingly being used as an alternative to a proper judicial process. The same applies to processes that pre-empt the actual commission of an offence&mdash;the various forms of civil injunction to reduce criminal offending. I do not wish to sound too pompous, but the more we go down that road, the more we erode the principles of British justice. If such measures are effective, we need to consider them in terms of reducing crime, but we should be aware that we are putting the cart before the horse, or the sentence before the commission of an offence, which is a dubious approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/8">[David Taylor <i>in the Chair</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/9">My last point is about the importance of diversionary availability, to which the hon. Gentleman referred. I am not convinced that Colchester would welcome a lot of civil offenders or that cadet forces are the best place for people who have no interest in the armed forces, but simply need to be kept off the streets&mdash;putting a gun in their hands may not be the best way of teaching them to be better citizens. However, I accept that we should do a lot more in relation to youth provision, of which the cadet forces are an important part, and that we should provide alternative structures and diversions for young people so that they are interested in and engaged by something and are active. They need excellent role models to learn from and, to that extent, the hon. Member for Stafford is right.</p>
	<p pid="a.34.1/10">We have a sentencing and a criminal justice system to protect the public and to reduce crime and re-offending. That is what our sentencing procedures should be about; not simply sounding tough, but being effective.</p>

	<p pid="a.38.1/1">I want the Minister, who has been waiting patiently, to have an opportunity to respond to the points that have been made. In particular, I would like her to respond to the points made by the hon. Member for Stafford, even if she does not have time to respond to those made by the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/2">Since 1997, the criminal justice system has been going through a period of revolution. Unfortunately, we have seen more movement than productivity. That is beginning to manifest itself in the overcrowded prison estate and in the inability of justices of the peace to sentence appropriately. As the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome said at the end of his remarks, sentencers' discretion is being undermined on a daily basis. I am not suggesting that there is a malign motive. I do not believe that the Minister and her colleagues get up in the morning and say, &quot;How can I further erode the judicial and sentencers' discretion?&quot; However, that erosion is the unintended consequence of the mismanagement of our criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/3">The prison and probation services have been victims of the Government's failed experiment in public sector reform through targets and central control. The Government confidently believed that central Government could hold unwieldy Departments to account using top-down targets. Civil servants would be rendered super-efficient, almost stakhanovite, with the aid of efficient modern IT systems. However, their confidence was misplaced. Officials have been burdened with too many targets. Monitoring has forced them to meet intermediate targets, leading to ineffective, demoralising box-ticking instead of productive and fulfilling work. The IT systems that are supposed to make the whole system function have invariably been late and over budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/4">The Government rightly realised that the split between prison and probation is the root cause of failure, but their attempts to fix it have foundered. The first attempt was the National Offender Management Service, which was envisaged by Lord Carter as a new bureaucracy that would co-ordinate the prison and probation services. NOMS assigned a case officer&mdash;an offender manager&mdash;to follow the progress of each criminal from the time that they were sentenced until they were reintegrated into society. The officer was to use a state-of-the-art computer system, C-NOMIS. However, instead of drawing together prisons and probation, as Carter wanted, the Government created an inflated bureaucratic monster that sat above the Prison Service and probation service, did little to facilitate co-ordination, and sucked more than &pound;1.5 billion a year&mdash;more than the budget of the national probation service&mdash;from the resources available for offender management. The computer system, C-NOMIS, was late and over budget, and the Ministry of Justice has now announced that a system that it previously described as</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/5" class="indent">&quot;central to end-to-end offender management&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/6">will not be rolled out to the probation service. As for NOMS, the Government have decided to merge the top management of the Prison Service, probation service and NOMS, effectively subsuming a slimmed-down NOMS into the Prison Service, but without integrating the delivery of the services on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/7">Meanwhile, Ministers have continually interfered in the running of prisons. The former director general of the Prison Service and chief executive of NOMS, Martin Narey, said on Radio 4's &quot;Analysis&quot; programme on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-20">20 July 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Prison Service for some years has been an executive agency in name only. The autonomy, the ability of its director general to get on and manage the organisation has been significantly eroded... I was spending 70 per cent. of my time in my last year at the Home Office managing ministers. For prison and probation services alike, targets have been focused on measurable levels and on throughputs, but not on success at tackling reoffending.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/9">That, as a recent National Audit Office report has found, creates perverse incentives and outcomes, stifles innovation, and ultimately restricts the ability of the Ministry of Justice to deliver on its own service level agreement to reduce reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/10">The Government's approach suffers from two fundamental flaws: the chasm between prison and probation, which they have failed to bridge, and the lack of incentives for people within the system, which they have not attempted to address. In essence, reoffending has not been reduced because it has been nobody's job to reduce it. That is why we have the problems that the hon. Members for Stafford and for Somerton and Frome mentioned in relation to the collapse of the sentencing system.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/11">Time does not allow me to analyse what is going wrong with our prisons. Let me deal with the subject of community punishments, which is creaking in Stafford and Staffordshire, and, increasingly, elsewhere in the country. Magistrates deal with about 90 to 95 per cent. of all criminal cases. Although the Crown court deals with more serious offences, it deals with a smaller proportion of the offences brought to justice. It has often been said that the answer to the state of our prisons is to give up and to advocate the use of community punishments. The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome highlighted the implied policy of the Secretary of State for Justice that, because of the prison overcrowding, the only thing that can be done is to send inappropriate people on community punishments. I do not think that he has gone that far, but he might yet. That would be as wrong as over-filling the prisons in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/12">We reached a ludicrous stage last Thursday, when the Prison Service and the probation service met for a private conference in Leeds, at which the director general of the Prison Service, Mr. Wheatley, was having to advise prison governors during the tea break to go back to their telephones and ring their prisons to ensure that the overcrowded prison estate was emptied into the less crowded open prison estate. &quot;If necessary, use your own transport,&quot; he is alleged to have said. The Government have organised a grossly irresponsible set of affairs whereby the director general of the Prison Service is, as a consequence of prison overcrowding, requiring unsuitable people to be decanted out of the secure estate into the open estate.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/13">I am no spokesman for the Prison Officers Association, but I am not surprised that on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-18">18 February</phrase> it issued a press release that stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/14" class="indent">&quot;POA members were bussing prisoners from establishment to establishment to try and accommodate almost 82,000 prisoners over the weekend. This policy will lead to unrest amongst prisoners and prisoners being placed in unsuitable accommodation and thus endangering the general public. We are aware that the Ministry of Justice have instructed all Governors to send prisoners to open prisons. It is believed that all open prisons will be operating at around 95 per cent. capacity. To the POA that can only mean one thing; open prisons will be dangerous places to work in and the public in surrounding areas will be at risk...The problems of overcrowding are not new; and the problems we face today are as a direct result of the lack of real investment for new prisons over the last 10 years. If things continue as they are we will see more and more unsuitable and dangerous prisoners released early and public safety will be at risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/15">Believe that or not, it is a fact that unsuitable people are now being pushed through to the open prison estate and, as a consequence, are not receiving the proper rehabilitation that they should have received within the closed estate if the sentencing planning system was operating in a correct manner. Just as the resources appear to have been mismanaged in the secure estate, so the resources are now being managed in a detrimental fashion in the community punishment system, particularly in Staffordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/16">The Secretary of State for Justice was invited to address the Howard League for Penal Reform and in a speech to it on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November 2007</phrase>, which I attended, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/17" class="indent">&quot;For people sentenced to under twelve months in prison, reoffending rates have long been too high, and this is the case regardless of exactly how long those prisoners are inside. Community sentences will, in many cases, be a better alternative.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/18">However, robust alternatives to custody have so far evaded the Government. As the National Audit Office observed in a report published in January,</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/19" class="indent">&quot;for unpaid work to be seen to be punishing and implemented properly, it needs to be demanding&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/20">However, probation inspectors found that only 63 per cent. of unpaid work requirements were suitably demanding. The Ministry of Justice concedes that, although the maximum amount of work under such requirements can be up to 300 hours, the average is only 100.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/21">There is a place for community sentences to deal with offenders whose crimes do not warrant imprisonment and where treatment in the community offers a better prospect of rehabilitation than imprisonment. Such punishments can be useful in so far as they allow offenders to remain close to home, family and work, while affording opportunities to receive vital rehabilitation and skills. However, they cannot simply be used as an act of faith, and should not be used simply because the jails are full. The way to use community punishments to reduce the prison population is to make community punishment work to reduce reoffending, and so reduce the supply of criminals who will be sent to prison in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/22">In the past decade, the Government have embraced community sentences as a way to divert criminals away from the ever more overcrowded prison estate. Five years ago, the then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, talked about tough community sentences to</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/23" class="indent">&quot;reduce the prison population at the lower end&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.1/24">Disturbingly, community sentences are now given to more than 40 per cent. of violent offenders, and in the past three years nearly 90 rapists have received community sentences. In addition, a fair few of the 12,000 or 13,000 people who have been released early from custody on licence&mdash;I am referring to the end of custody licence scheme&mdash;since <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June 2007</phrase> have been violent offenders, despite the fact that the Government's rules for the release of people on ECL are supposed to keep violent offenders off ECL. The Secretary of State says, &quot;Oh, don't worry about the 18 days,&quot; but it is in the last 18 days that short-sentence prisoners receive the necessary contacts with the health service, jobs and so on&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Taylor. No doubt <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1615" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Mr. Garnier)</phrase> now regrets suggesting that he be stopped, because he was stopped in full flow, but I am sure that he will have a chance to finish his sentence on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/2">I begin, as all hon. Members have done, by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> on both securing this debate on an important topic, which has provoked a great deal of interest among Front Benchers, and the way in which he has advanced his theses and made his remarks. His speech was excellent and well worth listening to, and I know that it was appreciated on both sides of the Chamber. Some of us perhaps come at the issue from a slightly different perspective, but there is a lot of common ground across the Chamber in respect of much of what he has said.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/3">I echo what my hon. Friend has said about the people who work throughout the criminal justice system, who are not thanked as often as they ought to be by society&mdash;I always do my best to thank them personally&mdash;for their work in tackling tough problems and issues and dealing with people with many difficulties and problems who are not the most sympathetic members of our society. They all do an excellent job. My hon. Friend has mentioned most of them, but, like him, I am happy to thank everybody involved, even though they may not have been mentioned by either him or me. Clearly, what they do is sometimes a thankless task, but it is vital in our society, and we all appreciate it. I want to make that absolutely clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/4">As my hon. Friend has also said&mdash;other hon. Members have echoed this&mdash;custody will always have to be available for serious and dangerous offenders, but a key part of the reform of sentencing policy over the past few years has been to try to limit the use of short custodial sentences for less serious offenders by unlocking the potential of the community order and increasing its flexibility, making it more possible for sentencers, be they magistrates or judges, to deal appropriately with individual cases, as has been emphasised. It is entirely appropriate that they take the decisions in individual cases; it is not for Parliament or Ministers to impose solutions to individual cases in our courts system.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/5">Within a framework of reserving prison for serious and violent offenders, we are doing our utmost to enable the system to reduce reoffending, to protect the public and to give those who have offended a chance to tackle the problems that have perhaps led to their offending behaviour and ensure that they come out as more useful members of society than they were when they entered the criminal justice system. That balance is correct, and I have not heard any hon. Member in this debate or in other debates on the subject suggest that it is wrong. Prison should be used for serious and dangerous offenders in order to protect the public, and we should use other approaches to deal with those who would not benefit from custody or who do not have to be in custody for the public to be protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/6">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 provided an adult sentencing framework that was clearer and more flexible than that which previously pertained. The legislation set out for the first time in statute the purposes of sentencing for adults, which all hon. Members have referred to, namely, punishment, crime reduction, reform and rehabilitation, public protection and reparation. Sentences were reformed in that legislation, but perhaps most significantly the various types of community order for adults were replaced with a single community order with a range of possible requirements, and new sentences for serious and violent offenders were introduced to ensure that they are kept in prison or under supervision for longer than previously to try to manage the risks that they present. The intention is for the court to provide each offender with a sentence that best meets the needs of the case, at any level of seriousness, for sentences to be more effectively managed by the correctional services and for correctional services and the courts to work closely together on delivering the new sentences.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/7">Tough community sentences include a wide range of requirements, as they should, including unpaid work, drug treatment and curfews&mdash;some of those things were mentioned in the debate. They allow offenders to maintain employment, education and family links and ensure that offenders do not get sucked into a cycle of repeat offending that they are less likely to get out of as time goes on. Instead, the sentences deliver interventions to address offending behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/8">The Government are convinced that a well planned and properly supervised community sentence can be tough on the offender and far more valuable than prison in offering the individual opportunities to change their behaviour and constructive possibilities for the future. The overall reoffending rate for community sentences, 51 per cent., is lower than that for short prison sentences&mdash;the overall reoffending rate after a short custodial sentence is more than 70 per cent. Even on the basis of those bare figures, such approaches are more effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/9">We have made substantial progress on both the enforcement and quality of community sentences&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford has referred to that&mdash;and 90 per cent. of breaches are now dealt with. There is no reason why the public and sentencers cannot have confidence that community sentences are tough alternatives to short custodial sentences. Increasing community confidence in the effectiveness of such arrangements is the aim of ensuring rigorous enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/10">I agreed with my hon. Friend when he talked about ensuring that the general public understands how tough community sentences can be and how useful they are. There is a general perception or feeling at the moment, as any Member of Parliament will know, that people who receive community sentences have had some kind of let-off. Of course, they have not&mdash;community sentences can be much tougher than short custodial sentences, and they can make an offender face up to the problems that they have caused and deal with the issues that led them into offending more intensively than if they simply went into custody. As my hon. Friend has said, restorative justice is now embedded in the youth justice system, which is perhaps not that well known among the general public. Victim contact or reparation can be a part of youth disposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/11">My hon. Friend has raised the issue of conditional cautions and made a point about a written answer. The answer should have stated that the non-compliance rate, rather than the compliance rate, was 6 per cent. There was a misspelling in the answer, but we were attempting to make the point that conditional cautions are almost always complied with. They are successful, and the conditions can have an impact. Often, they make a real difference to whether an individual becomes involved in offending behaviour again. Obviously, the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, which the House of Lords is debating, extends the capacity to use conditional cautions on 16 and 17-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/12">I agree with everyone who contributed to the debate, including the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, that diverting young people away from the criminal justice system in the first place is the way to control the increase in the prison population in the medium and longer term. Diverting people away from the criminal justice system must be the best thing for society, and conditional cautions appear to have the potential to do so. They have restorative and reparative features, and they can involve victims. Offenders might be required to write letters of apology to victims, or to deal with or put right the damage done by their graffiti or criminal damage, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/13">Those are visible ways in which to say to a community that the person who committed such offences has been caught, that they are putting things right, that they have had to apologise, and that they have agreed to those things. Quite often, such people are required to pay compensation. That is an effective way in which to deal with the kind of low-level antisocial behaviour that is so corrosive in our communities, as many MPs know. Calling such things &quot;antisocial behaviour&quot; may make them seem minor, and the offences might be at the petty end of the scale, but they can be a real problem in vulnerable communities, and they need to be rigorously tackled. That is why there is a sense in many of our communities that custody is the right answer&mdash;people want such behaviour to stop. Conditional cautioning provides an alternative way to make that point clearly in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.41.1/14">My hon. Friend has referred to problem-solving courts, which have the potential to deal with those issues positively. People involved in the community court pilot in north Liverpool, which I know particularly well, make a great effort and provide great quality work. The district judge in the court, David Fletcher does a superb job with the people who come before him every two weeks, if they have not met the conditions by going through drug rehabilitation or looking for a job. He knows that if those people have not done what he asks them to do, they cannot hide behind the fact that they will next appear before a different judge.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" name="Chris McCafferty">the Member for Calder Valley (Chris McCafferty)</phrase> on securing this important debate, which raises a crucial issue in the area that I represent as well as in hers. The importance of additional, private sector housing money to take forward new schemes around Halifax cannot be underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/2">So far, due to restrictions on finance, investment has been restricted to one or two areas with the most pressing housing needs. However, other parts of Halifax, such as Lee Mount, Boothtown, and Siddal, to name but three, would benefit from similar levels of investment. We need the Government to help secure that investment. Halifax needs not only a fair distribution of resources across different communities, but to be seen to have a fair distribution of money. To enable that to happen, and to support the work of Calderdale council, enough money will be needed over the next three years to take forward that work and to enable the necessary changes. To put it bluntly, more money is needed to help turn dreams into reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Calder Valley has touched upon, Calderdale has diverse housing needs. Halifax also has areas with high house prices, as well as many deprived communities living in poor quality older properties. That situation needs addressing. In recent years, money from central Government has helped to tackle key regeneration schemes in the Park ward area and Illingworth. We now need more of the same to tackle similar problems in other parts of Halifax.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/4">Key pockets of deprivation often lie in more prosperous wards, which are not highlighted in the indices of deprivation. It is not good enough that, as my hon. Friend has stated, almost one fifth of all private sector homes are in serious disrepair, that there is a high level of disrepair and damp and that private sector tenants are more than twice as likely to live in unfit properties as owner-occupiers. It is incredible that, after decades of housing policy, investment and action plans, such a picture can still be painted. We need to start with a fresh canvas and ensure a new picture is created for this generation. That work needs to start in Calderdale today. I urge the Minister to come and see first hand the housing challenges that need addressing in Calderdale. At the risk of repeating a well-used mantra, much has been done, but there is certainly much to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/5">I want to point out the good work being carried out by housing officers in Calderdale. The &quot;links in the chain&quot; concept has recently been developed, and it will build on some of the excellent inward investment in recent years. Exciting plans and regeneration schemes are in place, but in Halifax we do not want to rest on our laurels. As the local MP, I want much more done. The council has plans for post-18 education links between Calderdale council and local universities. However, in order to help build on that success, the council needs to develop further proposals for linked housing and economic investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/6">The main message that I want to bring to this debate is the need to give the council the financial support that it needs and wants, so that the pieces in the jigsaw can be completed. The money will provide the momentum, so that positive work can begin. I urge the Government to listen to the message from me and my hon. Friend and to help kick-start some much needed investment in the borough's housing stock, which will benefit hundreds of my constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-19a.61.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" speakername="Lorely Burt" colnum="61"  time="013:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080219/halltext/80219h0010.htm#08021973000509">
	<p pid="a.61.1/1">In the years between being selected to fight and winning my seat, to earn money in a flexible way that could fit in with campaigning I worked as a part-time, self-employed will writer with a company called, strangely enough, the Will Writing Company, which did what it said on the tin. I was not legally trained, but I was trained by the company and sat exams set by the Institute of Professional Willwriters, which were marked externally.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">Will writing is a good job for a nosey person, because by the time one has left the client, one knows all about them&mdash;their means, family arrangements, property situation and so on. A will writer needs that information to be able to make their client aware of the viability of what they want to do with their will and the most tax-efficient way to do it. Once the instructions were taken, the wills went to our head office to be scrutinised by legal professionals to ensure that I had given the best advice, and to be written up in a watertight legal form.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/3">To give proper advice takes time and training. Until the late 1980s, will writing was the sole province of solicitors, who were the only people who had access to training for the skills required, so they effectively retained the activity within their own regulated environment. That effective monopoly of solicitors was ended in the late 1980s, when Simon Francis Harris, a serial fraudster and undischarged bankrupt, was jailed at Liverpool Crown court. He served part of his sentence with Keith Best, a discredited Member of Parliament&mdash;he served for Anglesey from 1979 to 1987&mdash;and struck-off solicitor, who had written a book on will writing. On his release, Harris founded the Quill Group, a non-solicitor will-writing franchiser. It provided rudimentary training in basic will writing to its franchisees. By 1992 there were more than 400 franchisees, who had paid anything from &pound;6,000 to &pound;15,000 for their franchise areas. Quill Testamentary Services Ltd., the group company that sold the franchises, was wound up by the High Court on <phrase class="date" code="1993-05-05">5 May 1993</phrase> on a petition of the Department of Trade and Industry, as it was then. That came as a devastating blow to the franchisees, many of whom lost their life savings or had borrowed money to buy a franchise, but also left tens of thousands of clients without access to their wills.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/4">The story continued. In the late 1990s, Gerald Barton founded JHD Associates and sold franchises in a manner similar to that of Quill Wills. It mounted a major national advertising campaign offering to write wills</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/5" class="indent">&quot;for a limited period for &pound;19.50 + vat (Usual Fee &pound;59)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/6">Despite that unviable yet permanent price, JHD promised its franchisees minimum incomes in excess of &pound;20,000 per annum. It achieved that seemingly impossible feat by making additional charges for any variations required by clients' circumstances, which resulted in bills for up to &pound;500 for a pair of so-called &pound;19.50 wills.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/7">In February 2001, <i>Which?</i> magazine highlighted the case of a couple who were charged a total of &pound;287 for two wills, lifetime safe storage at</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Somerset House, The Nation's Will Storage Centre, probably the most secure storage system in the UK&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/9">and legal advice for their executor. In 2000, the JHD offices closed and Gerald Barton was eventually traced to Gibraltar. Thereafter, 10,000 wills were discovered in boxes at a storage company in Wincanton, Somerset&mdash;hardly Somerset house. Barton subsequently returned to the UK and started an identical operation called Willmakers Ltd., offering &quot;affordable peace of mind&quot; for &pound;23.44 including VAT. By 2002, Willmakers had become National Legal Services, from the same address and with the same freephone number. It was wound up on a petition of the DTI in late 2007. Evidence showed that, once again, it had been formed for the purpose of selling franchises rather than actually writing wills.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/10">That is the state of the so-called professional will writing industry. Independent financial advisers are regulated and required to be qualified, and solicitors need to be qualified and closely controlled, but someone could be a convicted fraudster, set up as a will writer tomorrow with no qualifications, experience or professional indemnity insurance and proceed to dispense advice on tax, inheritance laws and so on. Most consumers are unable to judge the quality or value of the service that they are getting, so it is no exaggeration to say that will writing has become a happy hunting ground for the incompetent, the dishonest and the fly-by-night operator.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/11">Of course, there are many ethical operators, and there are two professional bodies for will writers. I have mentioned the Institute of Professional Willwriters, and the other main body is the Society of Will Writers. The problem is not with them, or with the vast majority of their members, but with those who operate without proper training, professionalism and insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/12">Writing a will is probably unique, in that a defect will almost certainly not be found until after the person making it has died, by which time it can be too late to do anything about the problem. It is essential to get it right first time, otherwise there will be an ever-increasing number of invalid or ineffective wills. Many of those making wills with untrained writers will not die for another 20 or 30 years, and only then will the problems being created today come to light, when redress will be unavailable. History is littered with problems created by short-term sales of long-term products and services, whether endowments, pensions, equity release or wills.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/13">Many consumers do not appreciate the difference between a will writer and a solicitor. In fact, many assume that a will, being a legal document, can be drafted only by a solicitor. A survey carried out for the Institute of Professional Willwriters by Taylor Nelson Sofres in March 2007 found that 92 per cent. of consumers did not know that someone with no training or regulatory provisions could offer a will-writing service. When asked whether they thought that that was wrong, 77 per cent. said yes. Customers trust the person who turns up to write their will. Those customers are often elderly and easy meat for the unscrupulous will writer.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/14">The citizens advice bureau has provided me with several examples. An elderly couple from Nottinghamshire responded to an offer of will writing for &pound;20 plus VAT. With joint assets below the inheritance tax threshold, they were charged more than &pound;1,000 for services that they discovered that they had bought only when the paperwork arrived in the post. The irony was that they already had wills, which could easily and cheaply have been amended. CAB clients in Lincolnshire, who were receiving benefits, responded to an advertisement offering wills for &pound;23.50. A representative came to their home and charged them &pound;705, including storage costs. Another worrying matter is what happens to wills that clients have paid to have stored when a company goes bust or ceases trading.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/15">What are the Government doing, and what steps should they take? In March 2005, the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Falconer, announced that his Department would</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/16" class="indent">&quot;consider the case for regulation of Will writing and estate administration services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/17">Both the professional bodies that I have mentioned met officials of the then Department for Constitutional Affairs, and a White Paper, &quot;The Future of Legal Services: Putting the Consumer First&quot;, was published in October 2005. It states, on page 79, that</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/18" class="indent">&quot;there does not appear to be a compelling argument for statutory regulation. However, the Government's view is that improvements must be made in the control of quality and standards of will writing and related services in order to protect consumers. This could be most effectively achieved by voluntary regulation, such as codes of conduct and consumer education schemes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/19">For the past 18 months, the IPW and the Society Of Will Writers and Estate Planning Practitioners have been drafting their own codes of practice that meet the requirements of the Office of Fair Trading's consumer codes approval scheme. That is all well and good, but the CCAS requirements do not lend themselves fully to will writing. For example, there is no requirement for competence: the CCAS accepts that failure is inevitable and requires a robust mechanism of redress. But how can consumers complain, given that defects will probably become apparent only after they are dead? I am hardly a great fan of regulation&mdash;indeed, I believe it should be avoided where possible&mdash;but I wonder whether there should be an approved code of practice incorporating a system of redress, professional indemnity insurance and minimum qualification.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/20">Estate agents are bound by the OFT's estate agency guide and the Estate Agents Act 1979. Recently, a measure was introduced requiring them to belong to an independent, approved ombudsman scheme after voluntary regulation similar to that proposed for will writers conspicuously failed. I am a veteran of the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act 2007, and in our debates on the Bill, I argued that a basic professional qualification should be a prerequisite to practise as an estate agent, but I failed to persuade the Government on that occasion. Here, we have an even stronger case for ensuring that services are right from the outset.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/21">If a will is written badly and does not reflect the interests and desires of the person who made it, the fault might not be discovered for 20 or 30 years. Indeed, it might never be discovered by the person who made it, because they will be dead when the problem arises. Learning that a will has been badly drafted is a huge blow to bereaved relatives who are trying to work their way through the complex system of obtaining probate&mdash;if they ever find out. Can a voluntary regime be enforced? If not, the untrained and unethical will still provide will-writing services, and those who are trained and acting ethically will be at a commercial disadvantage as they will be subject to the costs of the regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/22">Consumer awareness of the importance of making a will is incredibly low. Estimates indicate that only 30 per cent. of the population leave a valid will when they die. The Government have stated that their</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/23" class="indent">&quot;overriding aim is that consumers receive a better standard of service, which they have a right to expect and deserve.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/24">I ask the Minister to respond to the following questions. How can we defuse the &quot;ticking time bomb&quot;, as the National Consumer Council describes it, of the 27 million people who do not have a will, particularly given that those who are least likely to have one are those who need one the most? Consumer education will not be effective other than through major, high-profile and continuous promotion&mdash;that means Government promotion.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/25">The will-writing profession is not in a position to fund such activity, given that it consists of only about 700 to 1,000 businesses, employing less than 2,000 practitioners. Indeed, we do not know how many will-writing companies there are, because there is no requirement for them to register. We need something like a CORGI register for will writers. CORGI is a trusted brand that delivers a guaranteed level of service, and someone, somewhere has promoted that brand so that everyone knows and trusts it. Do the Government have the political will to promote the needs of citizens and their loved ones after their death?</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/26">I also want to know how it is possible to bring the cowboys of the industry into line if there is no central register of firms that trade as will writers, and no requirement to adhere to a voluntary code of conduct? The majority of consumers who take the trouble to make wills believe that their wills are being written by someone who is legally qualified. Will writers do not need to be legally qualified as long as they are properly trained, but as things stand, customers are sitting ducks. The industry's reputation is going down the drain, and ethical companies can do nothing but put themselves at a competitive disadvantage by swallowing the additional cost of doing the right thing: providing proper training and continuous professional development, and having full insurance cover and an overriding concern for clients and their interests. The ethical part of the industry needs a helping hand.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> for this opportunity to discuss the will-writing sector. She has described her personal interest in the subject, and I know that she is, rightly, keen that consumers should be protected from unscrupulous will-writing organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/2">The crux of the matter is whether will writing should be a reserved legal activity. That question was debated at length during scrutiny of the Legal Services Bill last year. At that time, the Government's position was that there was insufficient evidence to make a compelling case for regulating will-writing services, and I must disappoint the hon. Lady by telling her that we still do not see a compelling case. I reiterated that position in a recent written answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1519" name="Laura Moffatt">the Member for Crawley (Laura Moffatt)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.0/3">Our position will disappoint some people in will-writing organisations, such as the IPW, as they recently wrote to MPs seeking support for regulation, but we do not rule out future regulation. We will regulate, if there is evidence that regulation is not only necessary, but the most effective way of increasing consumer protection. We are committed to reducing regulatory burdens as far as possible, and we will not introduce regulation unless there is evidence of significant problems.</p>
