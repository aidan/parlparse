</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.425.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" speakername="Graham Stringer" colnum="425"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h01.htm#60315h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.425.3/1">Before I get on to bus deregulation, I want to say I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Minister is retiring from the job. I wish her well in what she does in future. In the surprisingly long time&mdash;22 years&mdash;that I have been dealing with Transport Ministers, I have come across some, from both main parties, who were less than competent, and I am pleased to say that my hon. Friend is not like that. She has done a good job. Although I suspect that we shall not see eye to eye in this morning's debate, I am sorry to see her go and wish her well.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/2">The purpose of the debate is to explore why, in the part of the public transport system provided by buses, which account for 84 or 85 per cent. of journeys in the system, there is effectively an apartheid regime between London and the rest of the country. I should like to use our time to see whether there is any justification for maintaining one system in London, which works, produces good public transport and benefits passengers, and another system in the rest of the country that has the opposite impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/3">We have already convinced the vast majority of Members of Parliament outside London that their constituents would benefit from a regulated system. Last autumn, Communicate Research did a survey of all MPs and found that 84 per cent. of Labour MPs and a majority of Members of Parliament were in favour of extending to the rest of the country the regulated system found in London. The only thing to surprise me about that was that only 84 per cent. of Labour MPs responded in that way. I have never found one who did not want regulation in the passenger transport and shire areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/4">The background is that, in London, bus use is increasing, and in every region in England it is in decline. The most dramatic decline is in south Yorkshire where, since deregulation, bus use has dropped by 62 per cent., which is extraordinary. It is not a matter of an even spread of usage&mdash;the people who use buses are among the poorest in the country. Nine out of 10 people who use buses are in the bottom income bracket, and 60 per cent. of bus users have no access to cars. Therefore, if something goes wrong with the bus system, we are allowing the mechanisms that increase social exclusion to continue to operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/5">I cannot talk about the regulated system in London as being more effective and producing better public transport without talking about the increasing funding gap. I shall mention it only once. Over the past seven years, in the north-west, although similar statistics will be found in every region, capital expenditure&mdash;not the revenue for buses&mdash;has risen from &pound;157 million to &pound;295 million, whereas in London it has risen from &pound;226 million to &pound;667 million. That is another background unfairness.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/6">Before I try to analyse the possible reasons for what has happened, I should like to give some statistics. I suspect that I could spend the whole hour and a half available to us giving out appalling statistics about transport usage, but I want to use the headline figures showing the changes that have happened, and to ask why they have been allowed and how we can stop the process going further.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/7">Fares in the English passenger transport executive areas have gone up 86 per cent. since deregulation. In London, they have gone up 36 per cent. Over the past five years, fares in the PTE areas have gone up 9 per cent. In London, they have gone down 4 per cent. Patronage since deregulation across all the PTE areas has gone down by about half. In London, it has gone up by just over half. In the past five years, patronage in the PTE areas has gone down 8 per cent. whereas it has gone up more than a third in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/8">We need to understand why there has been such a dramatic difference between London and the rest of the country. I do not believe that it is justifiable, but we should consider ministerial responses to the figures and some statements from officials. The Government have three responses to the shocking figures that I have mentioned. One is that we are not going back to pre-1985 days and re-regulation. That is a complete red herring. I have never heard anyone say, in the debate on this matter that has been going on as long as there has been deregulation, that they want buses brought back into public ownership and a return to the exact regulation that existed before 1985. What most of us want is a system similar to London's, or preferably a better one, because when a system is adopted it can be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/9">Secondly, the Secretary of State for Transport regularly points out success stories. His favourites seem to be York, Oxford, Brighton and Cambridge. He asks why, if those towns or small cities can improve patronage on their buses, big areas such as Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool and Newcastle cannot. There is one obvious reason. His examples are much smaller areas, dominated in nearly every case by one operator, with one centre, so that traffic restraint can work&mdash;people do not have much of a choice in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/10">That situation can be compared with what happens in a polycentric urban conurbation such as Manchester. The city of Manchester has the highest percentage bus usage of any of the metropolitan areas, but Bury, which my constituency borders, has one of the lowest in the country. It is necessary to take account of different circumstances when attempting to make like-with-like comparisons. The west midlands and Greater Manchester clearly have much more in common with the London conurbation than with York or Cambridge, which are much smaller.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/11">Do the people in those towns like what is happening? I suspect not. A letter to the York <i>Evening Press</i> from Chris Nelson, complaining bitterly about price increases that he had to pay in York, asked</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/12" class="indent">&quot;are these higher fares just because First is the only bus operator in York, and people such as the elderly, single parents, or others on low incomes have no other choice of transport?</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/13" class="indent">Park and Ride fares in York are simply extortionate&mdash;no other way of putting it. You have to pay the equivalent of a day ticket just for a return fare.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/14">He goes on to say that the system in York does not work. It is, therefore, neither wonderful nor comparable, and it is not a good reason for saying that the same could happen in Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/15">The third ministerial reason is that London is different, and it is&mdash;it is about two and a half times larger than Greater Manchester or the west midlands. In terms of buses, however, it was no different before regulation, and the real change is that there is now a regulated system in London and a deregulated system outside. Before deregulation, 48 per cent. of all public transport journeys were in the PTE areas and about 27   per cent. were in London. That situation has reversed, with nearly half of bus journeys in London and only 27 per cent. in the PTE areas. That is a dramatic switch round. Comparable areas, which had similar penetrations of bus usage, are now completely different. One reason for that is the regulated system, and the other is that there is three times more subsidy per passenger in London than in the rest of the country. Those, then, are the ministerial reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/16">I advise hon. Members who want to understand some of the thinking of the Department for Transport to get hold of a transcript of the Public Accounts Committee's proceedings on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase>. At that sitting, the Committee gently kebabed the permanent secretary at the Department. He is a good civil servant, and I make no criticism of him. Indeed, he is a man of integrity and intelligence, but he was trying to defend what is more or less indefensible. He did not quite plead the fifth amendment, but in many cases he pleaded ignorance of what is happening to transport in our major urban conurbations. Let me go through some of the reasons that he gave.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/17">First, the permanent secretary said that local authorities in PTE and passenger transport authority areas would begin to have a service similar to that in London if they would only restrain car use, but that is not really the case. Greater Manchester is spending about &pound;50 million on quality bus corridors, and other urban conurbations are doing the same. However, because the system is deregulated, the bus companies are moving on to the radial routes to make bigger profits, and the network is contracting. Although passenger usage on the radial routes might increase, therefore, there will be a worse service for some of the poorest people in the country</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/18">Incidentally, the Government are tough in assessing the benefits of investment in public transport systems such as Metrolink, but no real assessment is done of the usefulness of investment in quality bus corridors, or of whether such corridors improve public transport&mdash;the idea that they will bring about improvements is an article of faith in the deregulated, privatised system. In the light of the facts, however, that is not a belief that I share. One justification that Mr. Rowlands, the permanent secretary, uses is that quality bus corridors will help to get rid of congestion, and that is what has happened in London. However, the Department's answers to parliamentary questions show that two thirds of bus delays are caused not by congestion, but by the unreliability of private buses&mdash;they simply do not turn up.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/19">The permanent secretary also says that, although there might be concentrations of bus usage, there are almost guaranteed to be three bids for subsidised routes. However, that is completely wrong. Many of the subsidised routes that PTEs put out to tender are simply not bid for. In Greater Manchester and the other PTE areas, there is only one bidder for many routes. The cost of such tenders has gone up by about 20 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/20">Arriva, which is no different from the four other major bus companies that dominate the industry, makes no secret of what it is doing. In answer to questions at the Public Accounts Committee, the permanent secretary said that those bus companies were &quot;economically rational&quot; and &quot;passenger maximising&quot;, but they are not. They are certainly profit maximising, but that is not the same thing. If they can concentrate their services along routes from which others have been cleared by means of bus priority measures, they will make their profits there and remove their buses from other areas. Although the permanent secretary seemed to be wilfully ignorant of that, Arriva's half-year report stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/21" class="indent">&quot;Outside London our approach, to what is currently a mature market, is to focus on a twin-track strategy of targeting investment to deliver growth and eliminating low margin and loss-making routes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/22">That means that companies will remove routes on which they make a certain amount of money. The 53 route in Manchester, which was there for 80 years and always had good patronage, has just gone. Instead, companies will run routes up and down the main radial routes, which is bad for public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/23">Whichever way we look at the Department's analysis&mdash;that there will be more bids, that there is competition and that quality bus corridors will be the solution&mdash;it does not fit with the facts. Should not the permanent secretary understand that, in a market in which the private sector is exploiting the people I represent, bus companies make 50 per cent. of their profits on only 25 per cent. of their business? That should, at least, be cause for concern. The Department said that it did not understand that and that it was not aware of those figures, and I would be happy to give officials the references for all the sources of information in my speech at the end of the debate if the Department is willing to listen.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/24">On the subject of listening, I have tabled parliamentary questions to ask how many times the Department meets individual bus companies and officials and members of PTAs and PTEs. I have been told that meetings happen regularly, but I am rather interested in how often they take place, because there is evidence that Government policy is biased towards the private bus industry and against public officials from PTEs. I therefore ask the Minister whether officials will meet PTE members and whether detailed figures will be given out.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/25">We have reached an extraordinary situation. I have been in favour of buses all my political life because the people I have represented as a councillor and a Member of Parliament have needed them. However, the system that now operates in metropolitan areas means that being in favour of buses is not the same as being in favour of public transport&mdash;they can be quite different things. Bus priority measures can be introduced, but the public transport system will get worse. That is quite a shocking state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/26">At the same time, the private companies are demanding more public money. Some &pound;2 billion is going into the bus industry and the companies' profits are going up, but the service outside London is getting worse. Brian Souter of Stagecoach attacks all the PTEs because passenger numbers are going down, but, at the same time, he has his begging bowl out. Like most private sector bus company operators, he says, &quot;You're not doing anything, so please build us park-and-ride schemes with your own money.&quot; If the private-sector bus industry were really creative and innovative, it would find those resources itself, instead of making returns on capital in the PTE of more than 50 per cent.&mdash;another fact of which Mr. Rowlands was not aware.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/27">A number of other hon. Members want to speak, so I will finish by asking how we can justify a situation in which the travelling public in areas such as Greater Manchester and South Yorkshire have to face four fare increases a year. In London, they face one increase a year&mdash;or one fare adjustment, because sometimes the fares in London go down. How can it be good for public transport when in the past four years there have been 9,000 service changes in Greater Manchester? I assume that the figures are similar in other areas. Most people who want to increase bus patronage recognise that reliability and stability in the network are important factors. People need to know where the buses are going, but 9,000 service changes is instability of an extraordinary kind, which leads people to invest in cars and not go on buses.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/28">How can we justify not doing anything about a system in which punctuality in virtually all PTE areas is 76 per cent. and reliability is only 92 per cent.? Those shocking figures are mostly down to the companies, not conditions on the road. How can we justify investing &pound;2 billion but not looking at how we target the operators' grant money? We just pay it out, but do not try to use the tiny levers that are left to get a public transport system. The money is paid out without any controls at all. How can we justify having underfunded, under-resourced traffic commissioners, while companies such as FirstGroup have failed and have had to have hearings and investigations into their failures? The system means that traffic commissioners have to take services off, which is not good for the travelling public, even if they were poor services. When services are taken off in the north of England, FirstGroup registers a subsidiary and carries on as before, with its unreliable, unsatisfactory services.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/29">I do not see how any of that is justifiable. Our public transport system is going in the wrong direction. Most of the evidence is that our urban areas compete effectively internationally if they have good public transport systems. The situation is a brake on what they are doing, and I am worried that we are going in the wrong direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/30">Last year, at the request and subsidy of Services Employees International Union, a north American trade union, I went to the States to see how FirstGroup and other bus companies operated, and I was quite shocked. The safety record of the bus companies in this country is not good&mdash;I think that 15 per cent. of buses that are stopped by the commissioners have to be taken off the road immediately for being unsafe&mdash;but what is happening in the United States is worse. I do not want us to go down that route. I have tabled questions and asked for guarantees that, if we go to a yellow bus service, we will not follow the route that FirstGroup has taken in the United States.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.3/31">I know that the Minister has a brief and is in the last days of being a Minister in the Department, but I ask her to accept that the situation is not justified. None of us wants to return to the 1984 system, which was not as responsive as it should have been, but we do want value for the &pound;2 billion that is invested. We want local control, so that we can say to our constituents, &quot;This is a public transport system that will get you to work on time.&quot; Constituents of mine have lost their jobs or not got to hospital for important appointments because FirstGroup did not turn up, at the same time as its profits are increasing. That is simply unacceptable. I hope that the Minister will be as positive as she can be in response to those points.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.430.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="430"  time="009:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h01.htm#60315h01_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.430.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> for raising this crucial issue, which matters a lot to people throughout the PTE areas and beyond. I reiterate his comments about the Minister, because I have always found her to be extraordinarily helpful and a model of courtesy with all hon. Members. She has not let power in any sense turn her head and will, I am sure, remain precisely the same person when she resigns from the ministerial ranks.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/2">There is a quotation, I think from the former Duchess of Westminster, to the effect that anybody on a bus after the age of 30 is a failure. On Monday, coming home after our vote on identity cards, I made use of my Oyster card. It was the first time I had gone home at night on   the bus. The bus&mdash;the 77A&mdash;arrived promptly at 11.15 pm. I got on it, used my Oyster card and found that it was full of a range of people, all of whom were perfectly happy and amicable. I travelled quickly, made a five-minute journey to my destination, got off and was within a few yards of my flat.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/3">I compare that with the experience that I commonly have at home, where I rarely use the bus service. Why? Because throughout Merseyside buses are, by and large, infrequent and expensive, especially for families. The age profile is quite different. The nice thing about getting on a bus in parts of Merseyside is that one never feels old, because almost 80 per cent. of the passengers are pensioners using free travel, which for years the council tax payer has funded. In some ways that is a bracing experience, and quite different from being on a tube in London, where one can sometimes look along a carriage and find oneself the oldest person in it. None the less, the climate is completely different.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/4">Another reason for not using the buses locally is that the routes are often indirect, and my experience with buses in other cities does not encourage me further. For reasons that hon. Members will be able conjecture, a year or so ago I got a bus to Hodge Hill in Birmingham. I was surprised to find myself the only person on a full bus to be wearing a suit, collar and tie. There was a definitely a class element to bus use in that area, which does not exist in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/5">One could argue that there is a big subsidy in London, public control and elements of car restraint, for example. I do not have a car parking place at my flat, which encourages me to use the bus. However, in areas such as Merseyside, we see a dire, depressing and declining picture. Eighty per cent. of the routes in Merseyside are straightforwardly commercial and 20 per cent. are subsidised. Two companies&mdash;Arriva and Stagecoach&mdash;operate 90 per cent. of the routes, with some small companies around the edges.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/6">Over the past 10 years, the number of passengers using supported routes has increased by about 4 million, but the number of people using commercial routes has declined drastically by 37 million. It has gone down by 20 per cent., but there has been no change in mileage. The buses are going round as per usual, but they are going round with greater cost and fewer passengers. Supported mileage has increased dramatically since 2000, by about 2 million miles. The subsidy has tripled and the cost per mile of running a bus has doubled.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/7">That is largely because of the commercial operators pulling out and deciding that they do not want to run routes that are not profitable enough. Often, when Merseyside PTA tries to work round that, it uses circuitous routes to satisfy passengers and the paying public. Contrary to expectations, during local transport plan 1, the bus fleet, commercial and other, on average got older. That is despite substantial publicity for public transport on Merseyside and substantial investment by the PTE in infrastructure. There was substantial innovation in, for example, the use of LPG vehicles and bus lanes proliferated galore. Clearly something is not working. I have no reason to believe that things are working a great deal better in Manchester, Birmingham, Newcastle or Sheffield. That seems to be the general story since privatisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/8">We have gone for and are trying unsuccessfully to thrive with a market model for public transport. The key to improvement, if there is to be improvement, is thought to be competition. The enticement for all Governments is that improvement via competition will negate the need for subsidy, so that subsidies can be reserved for other services&mdash;for example, buses in and through deprived areas and the rural bus grant. Essentially, it is a market-driven model or, to be more precise, a profit-led model. It is not a demand-led model. In many cities and towns such as Southport, which I represent, there is a huge demand for late-night public transport to take people back from clubs, pubs and so on, but it is simply not provided. It does not suit the operators to provide it, or perhaps it is problematic, but it is a real social need and there is a real public demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/9">The model does not work because, in many places, as other hon. Members are likely to say, there is nothing like real competition; it is more like cartels. From time to time, the bus operators have been referred to the rather limp-wristed Office of Fair Trading when there seems to be a local monopoly in a particular area. It points out that another operator, perhaps 20 or 30 miles away, can be used if someone wants to travel 20 or 30 miles to avail themselves of a bus for which they have no real need. The OFT's rather limp-wristed response has not allowed the benign effects of competition to kick in.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/10">That is all against a background of the Government not, strictly speaking, leaving the market alone. They allow subsidies by passenger transport executives; they allow traffic regulations to impose bus lanes; they allow companies to receive profits. They essentially preside over the situation. As the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley pointed out, it is apparent that bus ridership has fallen and the only saving grace for the Government is in London where the situation has been sustained and has improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/11">People have despaired of public transport and have found that travelling by car has not become more expensive. The cost of car ownership relative to bus ridership has fallen. Increasing environmental concern has changed the degree of Government tolerance. Furthermore, in some cities, the use of cars has made congestion intolerable even for car users. I know that the Government are having a rethink; I know from veiled comments by the Secretary of State for Transport recently that he is having a rethink.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/12">What appears to have prompted that rethink as much as anything else is the prospect of rolling out congestion charging throughout the country. People know that congestion charging works in London but it works because there is a tube system, a good, affordable bus system and good public transport infrastructure. That does not exist in other conurbations, so the people who would suffer most from congestion charging would be those with less money. They could not easily afford the congestion charge but they would have to use their cars to go to work if there were no public transport system, and they would pay a substantial premium for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/13">The Government are linking the transport innovation fund&mdash;a big pot of gold that local authorities can try to dip into and that carries with it the requirement of making the right noises on congestion charging&mdash;with some latitude on the development of quality bus contracts and quality bus partnerships. They seem infatuated with the idea that congestion charging is a solution to congestion. They accept that something must be done about buses. I believe that they will do something about that in the not-too-distant future. I hope that this debate helps them to proceed more quickly with the process of rethinking.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/14">I do not believe that congestion charging and quality bus partnerships, or increasing regulation are necessarily the Siamese twins that the Government believe them to be. I think I am right that, before we had congestion charging in London, the figures for London bus use were enviable compared with the rest of the country and rising. All along, with and without congestion charging, it has had greater public control and substantial public subsidy. I think that London might thrive without the current level of subsidy. Things could improve substantially so that it did not need the current level of subsidy. That could be due to increased ridership, with people such as me starting to use buses, increased efficiency with new buses, and increased familiarity. Many people do not use buses because they do not know where they go. They have the unnerving feeling that they will be whisked far away into the distance and have a longer walk than they would have had to start with.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/15">In the House of Commons and among the wider public, everyone says that they believe in public transport. It is a nostrum from which no one demurs. No one, except perhaps the former Duchess of Westminster, says that public transport is a bad thing. I am not sure that we all believe passionately in the public actually using public transport, but there is clearly no point in having it if it does not entice the public out of their cars and encourage what is today called modal shift. There are clear gains for the environment and in terms of congestion. Strangely, there is also a forgotten gain&mdash;some of us are old enough to remember it&mdash;of social cohesion. When one gets on a bus and finds that it is not full of people waiting to attack with knives, one starts to talk to other people. That is not a bad thing for society. We have talked about social exclusion, but social cohesion is a strange and incidental by-product of people using public transport, except on the London underground, where protocol demands that people talk to absolutely no one for fear of being thought to be insane.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/16">It is self-evident that the Government's public transport policy on buses so far has produced a flat zero in modal shift outside London. They already have some regulation and use economic levers, so they must consider how they can use regulation and economic levers better. This is not a plea for nationalisation because buses never were nationalised. It is false to suggest that there was an age when the municipal authority provided the entire pubic transport infrastructure. I was brought up in Liverpool where Ribble, Crossville and Liverpool city council bus companies provided popular services and people did not discriminate between private and public providers. We are talking realism. The situation requires that something be done. It is demonstrable that the current economic and legal levers are insufficient. If that does not change, public transport in general will deteriorate.</p>

	<p pid="b.433.1/1">I add my congratulations to those already been expressed to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing this debate, and I echo the kind comments that have been made about the Minister. Those of us who have been pursuing this matter for some time will probably have to go through the process again with her successor.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/2">I shall try to reduce the length of my speech by missing out some of the statistics that my hon. Friend used. In west Yorkshire where I come from, it is clear that quality and standards have fallen dramatically since deregulation. Fares have risen by almost 50 per cent. in real terms and the number of passengers has fallen by 40 per cent. However, as he said, the position in west Yorkshire is probably far better than in the other passenger transport executive areas, where patronage has fallen overall by 48 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/3">The experience in my constituency, as in so many others, is that companies can pick and choose what services they provide, and that they make escalating profits while providing a poor service. Services are chopped and changed, buses are missing or late, and passengers feel angry and powerless about that, for all the reasons that my hon. Friend and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> analysed quite forensically. Passengers turn to Metro, their MPs or councillors, but find that we are equally powerless in this situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/4">In my constituency, there is effectively a monopoly provider in the shape of FirstBus, which operates all the commercial services. Evening and Sunday services are funded by Metro on a subsidised basis. The local network&mdash;this picture has been described already&mdash;comprises high frequency routes such as service 4 to Pudsey, 16 to Farsley and 42 to Old Farnley, together with a combination of routes on the busy Leeds-Bradford corridor. The remainder of services are attended to largely through Metro.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/5">In the nine years that I have been the MP there, the area has been subjected to successive service changes, all of which were based solely on the generation of profit. As my hon. Friend said, we have moved from a situation in which there were loss-making routes, which were shed by the operators, to one in which the routes are making a profit, but not enough profit in the eyes of First.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/6">Recent changes to services such as the 97, 647 and 651 in the Guiseley and Yeadon areas have resulted in a significant reduction in links with nearby Bradford, which is a major urban centre on the doorstep of my constituency. That has caused tremendous hardship for regular users of those services. Through Farsley, there is a regular service every 10 or 15 minutes, yet half a mile away, older people living in a sheltered housing complex have lost their vital link into the Farfield estate.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/7">There is no obligation&mdash;we know this full well&mdash;on commercial operators to undertake any sort of customer consultation, so links to local facilities such as health centres, post offices and supermarkets are often ignored when operators plan their services. The bus network does not respond to social needs, whether they are long-standing or have emerged over time. It is an indictment of the system that there are no links for, probably, 40 per cent. of the people who use Wharfedale hospital directly from the communities of Horsforth, Yeaden and Guiseley. Recently, a major primary care facility was set up at Eccleshill in Bradford. Its catchment area includes a large proportion of my constituency, but there are no public transport links for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/8">Although Metro provides some of the funding for services in my area, constraints on public finance mean that those funds are limited. In the bad old days, as we might refer to them, before regulation, there was a cross-subsidy, and the surpluses made on profitable routes could be reinvested in routes that were socially desirable. Despite its drive to improve profits locally, First seems to be incredibly slow to reinvest in the renewal of its bus fleet. I understand, from Metro, that about 45 per cent. of First's fleet is low-floor and Disability Discrimination Act compliant, and that the average vehicle age is about seven years. That is not the sort of modern-day service that people should have to cope with.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/9">Limited monitoring is available to the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency, which means that much of the monitoring has to be carried out by Metro using manual observation. I understand that First in Leeds operates 99 per cent. of services. Since October 2005, Metro has been increasing the amount of monitoring that it does, the results of which reinforce my hon. Friend's indictment. First in Leeds is operating 79.7 per cent. of services on time&mdash;not more than one minute early or five minutes late. That sort of service causes passengers to vote with their feet and, as the hon. Member for Southport says, to opt for other forms of transport, including the private car.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/10">Fare levels are controlled by local bus operators, which are therefore in a position to make up for the loss of patronage that they have created by the way in which they have run services, which are also affected by demographic changes, network changes and low-quality service delivery. Between April 2004 and January 2006, in Leeds, First increased off-peak fares by 36 per cent. and peak-time fares by about 11 per cent. Industry cost figures for the period up to June 2005 show a 9 per cent. increase, so we can see that there has been a continued diminution and deterioration of services, but constant profit and growing fares.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/11">As my hon. Friend said, the Government often talk about contestability and value for money, especially in relation to education, schools and the NHS, and the public sector is forced to compete with the private sector. In west Yorkshire&mdash;and, I suspect, in other PTE areas&mdash;we do not have a market that promotes competition and efficiency, and drives down costs. We have a system that promotes inefficiency and drives up costs. Metro PTE is able to influence directly only about 20 per cent. of the services for which it provides a subsidy. There is little competition for tenders, so it is difficult to test value for money. In west Yorkshire, in the 12 months to September 2005, of the 87 contracts for local bus services that Metro offered to companies, 70 were returned with a single bid, although every contract was bid for, unlike in my hon. Friend's area.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/12">Since 2002, lost mileage on tendered services has more than doubled in west Yorkshire. Tendered services usually operate at times of low traffic volume, so congestion is not the reason for lost mileage, although it is often quoted as the reason by operators. That simply is not true in this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/13">In her reply to my Adjournment debate last November, my hon. Friend the Minister talked about successful partnerships in Brighton, Cambridge, Nottingham, Oxford, Telford and York, and about impressive growth in areas such as Bedford, Exeter and Peterborough. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley analysed why those comparisons are not appropriate and never will be. That indicates that the Government still have not got to grips with the sophisticated problems facing bus transport in major conurbations. This might be a belated question, but why is it that the Minister and her colleagues can never add Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield, Newcastle, Liverpool and Manchester to that list? My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley did an admirable job in demonstrating the difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/14">The Minister and her colleagues put their faith in partnership and robust second local transport plans. There seems to be a strong assertion, or at least an implication&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley referred to this&mdash;that PTEs should be doing more and that they are deficient, but I am never quite sure what that extra something is supposed to be. I would certainly welcome some enlightenment on that from the Minister, her successor, or anyone else who cares to shed light on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/15">Partnership can and does work to an extent. It is not as though PTEs such as Metro are not willing to engage in that. In west Yorkshire, we have one of Europe's largest guided busway initiatives, a high occupancy vehicle scheme, and a public transport box in Leeds city centre that has cut journey times on some routes by between 10 and 30 per cent. PTEs are not resistant to partnership, but it simply is not enough. Surveys in west Yorkshire found that one in four frequent bus passengers experienced unacceptable lateness, or the non-showing of vehicles in the previous week, and that 49 per cent. had the same problems in the previous three months. Complaints to Metro about bus operators have doubled since 2000. Between 2003 and 2004 alone, complaints increased by 40 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/16">People often say to MPs about public sector providers such as the NHS, &quot;Eeh, if you ran a business like that, you'd soon be on the rocks.&quot; Yet the bus system is a business, and it is being allowed to run like that. It is still not providing the service that our constituents demand. I was going to say a little more about the hurdles that PTEs have to overcome to get quality contracts. The Minister has heard the argument before. The threshold is set too high. The &quot;only practicable way&quot; requirement will simply not be met without a great deal of difficulty and legal challenge. The threshold must be lowered.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/17">I apologise for the time that I have taken, but we have to find a way to achieve a better and fairer balance between passengers and profit.</p>

	<p pid="b.436.1/1">I will try to be brief. I must start with an apology. I have to go to a meeting with the Lord Chancellor, and he is not a man who likes to be kept waiting. I apologise to the Minister and to the Opposition spokesmen because I will not hear their winding-up speeches, but I will read them with great interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing this important debate. It is true that deregulation has been bad for public transport, and I agree with much of what was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>. I suspect that this is one of those debates where there will be a great deal of agreement across the Chamber, at least below the Gangway. We will get to hear what will be said at the other end.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/3">It is certainly true that bus companies tend to have things their own way these days. I agree that something of a cartel is working. In the Tyne and Wear area, Stagecoach and Go North East seem to dominate all the bus services to the exclusion of anyone else. As a result of deregulation, bus use is in serious decline. As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley pointed out, before deregulation, 48 per cent. of English bus trips took place in PTE areas and 27 per cent. in London. Now that has been reversed, with 27 per cent. of English bus trips in PTE areas and 44 per cent. in London. That has to have something to do with the fact that services in London continue to be regulated.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/4">As a result, costs are rising. The price of new tendered local bus services is rising way ahead of inflation. Between 2003 and 2004, the price rose by 12.1 per cent., three times the rate of inflation. That was a marginal improvement on the 15 per cent. rise between 2002 and 2003. The result is cuts in services. Approximately 35 per cent. of local authorities planned to make cuts to supported bus services by the end of the 2004&ndash;05 financial year in order to stay within budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/5">It is not all bad news: there has been very good news for profits. FirstGroup, made a &pound;103 million operating profit from its UK bus division in 2003&ndash;04. UK bus operations account for 37 per cent. of FirstGroup's revenue and 48 per cent. of its operating profit. Returns of 11 per cent. on an investment are not unusual in the bus industry. My hon. Friend has referred to returns of as much as 50 per cent. It is indeed a profitable business.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/6">Reliability and the provision of services have suffered, not least in Tyne and Wear. Services west of Gateshead have been cut and priority services have had to be introduced at public cost in order to provide a reasonable service to the people in that area. Passenger journeys in Tyne and Wear have gone down by 56 per cent. since the deregulation of buses. PTEs are struggling to continue to provide decent services for people, as opposed to the profitable services that the bus companies seem exclusively to be interested in. Nowhere is the budget being constrained more than in the Tyne and Wear area.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/7">I refer my hon. Friend the Minister to the problems besetting Tyne and Wear PTE because of the Government's free fare system, which will be introduced in only a few weeks and is exclusively related to bus journeys. In Tyne and Wear, we are now &pound;5.5 million short of the money needed to run free bus services next month. That is a serious problem. In order to make up the shortfall, the PTE will have to use &pound;2 million of its reserves. It will have to cut concessionary fares for young people and students. Next week, it will have to announce cuts in services to pay for that Government-inspired scheme. That cannot be right and it is up to the Government to resolve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/8">I congratulate the Department for Transport, which has done everything possible to assist. In fact, it has provided &pound;1.7 million to ensure that the free fare system can be transferred on to the metro. If the free fares had exclusively been for buses, the metro system would have suffered badly. That has resolved a problem, but we still have the shortfall to resolve.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/9">I, too, congratulate the Minister on her term of office and I wish her well for the future. Perhaps she could perform one great last service. Next week the Chancellor will announce this year's Budget. As last year's Budget brought in the free fare system, perhaps he could resolve some of the unintended problems with the scheme in this year's Budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/10">Not only is there a funding shortfall for the scheme in a number of local authorities, and most seriously in Tyne and Wear, but the scheme is related only to local authority boundaries. That is causing some difficulties. In this year's Budget, the Chancellor&mdash;the Minister might have a word with the Treasury&mdash;could introduce a national free fare scheme for pensioners. It could be administered by the Department for Transport. In one of its famous meetings with the bus companies, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley referred, it could negotiate to introduce a national system, so that pensioners could use the free pass wherever they went in the country on local bus services. That would be a great service. If the Minister can do that before she leaves, she will be remembered for ever.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing the debate. Not only has he got me back on the subject of buses, but this is my first Westminster Hall debate, although we are not in Westminster Hall but in Committee Room 10. I am delighted that that is the subject of the debate, because one of my personal projects at the last election was to    work with my passenger transport executive, Merseytravel, to secure a form of re-regulation. If I were to quibble about anything about today's debate, it would be the name. Instead of &quot;Buses (Deregulation)&quot;, it should be &quot;Buses (Re-regulation)&quot;. I would have much preferred a positive slant on the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.0/2">Why is it that three of my constituents from Upton recently contacted me to tell me that the 497 service from Saughall Massie to Birkenhead had been withdrawn by Arriva? That caused severe hardship to one elderly couple who cannot get to their doctor as they did before. They have to get two bus services, neither of which are    particularly reliable. In September last year, constituents from West Kirby were very distressed when the 82 bus service, run by Avon buses, from Heswall to West Kirby was cut in half, making them wait for two hours on that circular route, which is mostly used by the elderly. In October last year, I heard about the number 17 bus service operated by FirstBus, which is regularly late and has led to problems because the gentleman involved cannot get to work properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.0/3">The background as regards Merseytravel and Merseyside has already been given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase>, so I will not go into that. We receive letters regularly. In my naivety, when I first received letters about such matters, I used to write to the PTE to ask whether it could intervene and do something. It got fed up and said, &quot;Look, Stephen, no, we can't. We can't interfere with commercial services. We can't operate or try to operate those services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.438.0/4">So what is to be done? I want to tread a middle course. I understand that there could almost be a revolution, which would unwind what happened in 1985. I do not think that anyone is arguing for that. My PTE tells me that, under the Transport Act 2000, reluctantly but as positively as it can, it wants to consider quality contracts. I shall pick up from where my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> finished. My local PTE tells me that under&mdash;is it section 6? Everyone is looking at me mystified. Are we getting some information?</p>

	<p pid="b.438.2/1">In that case, I shall move on. My local PTE says that under the relevant section a quality contract can be used to bring in a form of re-regulation if that is the only practical way to do so. I am told that it is a cumbersome, bureaucratic process, but I am also told that PTEs, working together, are determined to try to crack that nut. I urge my local PTE to do that; in fact, I urge all PTEs to do it, including those in west Yorkshire, the west midlands and the north-east. As I am dipping my toe in the water of this debate, I also ask my hon. Friend the Minister whether any applications&mdash;from what I am told, they will come in the summer of this year, so that people can try to make progress in 2008&mdash;can be considered sympathetically, rather than bureaucratically.</p>

	<p pid="b.439.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing the debate and on an excellent contribution. I also commend the contributions made by other hon. Members; we have had a very good debate. I, too, send my best wishes to the Minister. I have been in the House only a short time, but I have always found her very courteous. Although we have not always agreed, we have at least had that dialogue, so I wish her well.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/2">The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley represents an urban constituency, as I do. Some of the examples and statistics that he gave show why deregulation has been a disaster and why we need a change of policy. Buses are important, although they are often treated as the Cinderella of public transport. They are frequently the choice of the majority: 85 per cent. of all public transport journeys are, and will continue to be in the near future, made by bus. If we are to do something about congestion in urban areas, we must deal with some of the problems that hon. Members have raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/3">When the Transport Act 1985 was introduced, we saw the privatisation of the National Bus Company and the municipal bus companies&mdash;I am thinking of Greater Manchester Buses North and Greater Manchester Buses South&mdash;and what was then termed the freeing up of the market. We were promised more competition, better bus services and cheaper fares. However, we have had none of those benefits. Instead, there was a brief period of bus wars. I am sure that we all remember when buses were chasing each other for custom along the road&mdash;always along the most profitable routes, not on estates. Those services do not run at times when people without cars need them to run.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/4">That time has gone and what do we have? We have a private monopoly instead of a public monopoly. Although 80 per cent. of all services in PTE areas are commercial services and only 20 per cent. of those are subsidised, 65 per cent. of all bus services in 26 of the 36 metropolitan districts are operated by one bus company. In 17 areas, the figure is 75 per cent. In my constituency of Rochdale, 65 per cent. of all bus services are run by First. In Oldham, the figure is 84 per cent. In Stockport, with Stagecoach, the figure is 81 per cent. In   Sefton, with Arriva, the figure is 78 per cent. In Birmingham, National Express has 86 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/5">A monopoly in itself is not a bad thing, but if we compare the services in PTE areas with what we have in London, we find that they are characterised by four things: frequent fare increases&mdash;four increases last year were mentioned&mdash;frequent changes in bus timetables, often with little notice; poor reliability and service; and services operated for the benefit of shareholders rather than customers. For example, when Arriva recently announced a fall in profits, primarily because it had lost the northern rail franchise, it said that the bus fares would have to go up. That is not improving the service. That is operating bus services, as has been said, as a cash cow.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/6">Many customer service surveys have shown what we all know: the main concerns of bus users are reliability, punctuality, driver attitudes and service stability. A bus does not turn up only once, and a passenger is lost. If there is to be a modal shift and if we are to meet the target of a 10 per cent. increase in bus use in areas outside London, there must be a change of image and in operation. As we know, that is not happening. We have seen a 19 per cent. fall in bus use in PTE areas; the figure was 3 per cent. last year. At the same time, we have seen a huge increase in bus fares: 86 per cent. between 1985 and 2005. That is not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/7">Let us compare the rates of return in PTE areas with that in London. First Manchester's rate of return is 17.8 per cent. Arriva Manchester's is 15.1 per cent. Stagecoach Manchester's is 14.5 per cent. The margin in London is much lower: 8.7 per cent. The situation that I have described cannot continue. We cannot operate a service whereby bus services are changed and fares are increased not to bring about improvements in services but to ensure that profits are protected. If we are to get our city regions operating, we must consider a change in the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/8">The Secretary of State said in an answer to a written question from the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley that we could not return to the 1985 situation. As has been said, none of us here wants that. However, we do want quality bus services reliably operated in areas where people need them and at times that will get people out of their cars. If the current system continues, that will not happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/9">Quality contracts were mentioned. In answers, the Secretary of State has said that that is the route that we have been going down, but, as has been said, those contracts are extremely difficult and time-consuming to operate. It is pertinent that, since the time to introduce those contracts was reduced last November from 24 to six months, not one contract has yet been applied for. That shows some of the difficulties. The contracts are too complicated; there are too many stipulations. We are told that competition will work, but clearly competition is not working. It is not providing regular public transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/10">PTEs need to be able to plan and develop an integrated transport policy. It was said that, with the introduction of congestion charging, that may be possible, but as the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said, we have to consider what is happening. I am a member of the Greater Manchester passenger transport authority. We have not said that we would oppose such a move. However, we have always said that the public transport network has to be in place before charges are introduced. If not, we will not encourage local people back on to the buses.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/11">We need to consider changing the rules relating to quality contracts. Passenger transport authorities are working on the issue and are committed to introducing quality contracts, but operated as they are currently, they will not be a success. Liberal Democrats want more local decision making. We want PTAs to have the powers that they need to introduce the contracts as part of an integrated transport system. That means similar powers to what exists in London. That is not nationalisation. In 1985, the real difference was not about privatisation or nationalisation; it was about regulation, and that is what we do not have at the moment. We need regulation. Yes, there is the issue of cost. As the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley said, the costs and subsidy for London are much higher. I am not arguing with that. However, if we consider the bus operators' grant that is paid directly to those companies, and some of the margins that they achieve&mdash;the profits of companies in the PTE areas are even more excessive than those made in London&mdash;we must be able to find a way of operating a similar service without massive Exchequer input. We must think about that, because we have to have a public transport system if our cities are not to be log-jammed with cars.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/12">The current system is not working. It has failed local people. I hope that, in her last few days in her post, the Minister will set in train a thorough review of the existing situation, which will show her that the private monopolies exist for their own benefit and not that of local people. I hope, too, that the Government will use the information from the review to give us a proper, integrated transport system.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.441.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="441"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h01.htm#60315h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.441.0/1">Like all other hon. Members, I wish the Minister well when she stands down from her Front-Bench role. Today is the first and last time that we shall have the opportunity to debate together. I note that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> has been consistent on this subject throughout his long period in Parliament. Today, he has been a forceful advocate for his side of the story&mdash;indeed, so far we have heard only one side of the story. I should like not only to address that side but to put forward some countervailing points that we need to bear in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said that this is a debate about public transport, and we all support public transport. That is true, but what we are talking about is how it is delivered, and how it might be improved continually. In 2000, having recognised that bus travel numbers decreased in many previous years, the Government produced the 10-year plan, in which they set themselves the target of increasing bus journeys by 10 per cent. by 2010. They also said that they wished to improve the punctuality of the whole service nationally. Against that, they set many years' decline in bus usage, increased prosperity, increasing car ownership, the increasing cost of bus travel and the falling cost of motoring. Clearly, the Government have recognised that the target that they set themselves was unattainable&mdash;it has been revised twice. We now have a target for not only buses but bus and light rail, increasing usage by 12 per cent. and growth in every region.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/3">I listened with interest to the arguments of the hon. Members for Manchester, Blackley and for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell), who quickly dismissed the successes in some other areas, telling us, for instance, why Brighton's success was not applicable to Manchester. I visited the bus company in Brighton two Fridays ago. Just before we dismiss it so readily, let me quote from three paragraphs of a letter from Roger French, the managing director of Brighton and Hove's bus and coach company:</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The key ingredients that we have put into the partnership mixture are frequent services&mdash;80 per cent. of our passenger journeys are taken on a bus&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/5">that runs</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/6" class="indent">&quot;at least every 10 minutes; simple pricing offering value for money; continued, sustained investment in new buses taking advantage of constantly improving technology and comfort and a passion for excellent customer service . . . The Local Authority's ingredients are the installation of effective bus priority measures on the road; a robust parking management and enforcement regime; effective enforcement of traffic regulations associated with bus priority measures . . . accessible bus stops which are pleasant to wait at with real time information . . . As we discussed the private sector is best placed to deal with the first 5 ingredients . . . and . . . local authorities are best placed to deal with the second 5 ingredients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/7">One of the problems in the deregulated market in parts of the country other than London is that bus companies are becoming increasingly frustrated at what they see as the failings of the local authorities, and local authorities are frustrated at what they see as local bus companies failing to invest or to be responsive. As I listened to the arguments of the hon. Members for Manchester, Blackley and for Pudsey, I wondered whether, if they met Mr. French, they might think that a lot of what he said may appertain to their areas. I recognise the frustrations that occur. Although the operators have the freedom to decide when and where to run routes, they are banned from co-ordinating services with other operators. The local authorities can offer subsidised, non-commercial services, but there are restrictions on the deals and on what they can negotiate with regard to service levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/8">There are many frustrations, but is that an argument for ditching the system, or for improving it? I wait to hear the Minister's response, but I expect that she will bear in mind what the Secretary of State said about buses in Edinburgh:</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/9" class="indent">&quot;the route is more extensive and imaginative now than when the local authority ran the service . . . So I would be wary of saying that we should go back to the pre-1986 situation.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2003-07-02.404"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 July 2003; Vol. 408, c. 404</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/10">I am listening to the arguments being advanced today on the advantages of the PTEs, but I am guided by a National Audit Office report published in December 2005, which found that the Government were highly unlikely to meet their revised targets. When one considers the NAO's rationale and the points that it makes, one wonders whether it is saying that we should abandon what is in place at the moment, or modify it.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/11">The NAO touched on better use of concessionary fares. That subject has already been mentioned this morning. As a result of the Government's initiative, at random, I phoned 25 local authorities around the country. None of them told me that the proportion of the money that was being provided under the new national scheme would cover the scheme in its area. I wonder how many authorities the Government have contacted; how the Government can say that the &pound;350 million that they are going to provide will cover the bus concessionary scheme; how many of those authorities are using a subsidy scheme, or a block payment; and how many people, who were able to do so before, are now prevented from travelling across concessionary areas. What has been put in place will cause a levelling down rather than a levelling up of schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/12">The NAO report advised councils that they would do well to consider the way in which they procure services. Had I time, I would quote more extensively from the report, because it is useful to bear that in mind. It says that</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the administration costs of procuring bus services are not high. But . . . if authorities currently tendering for individual routes or small packages of routes adopted a more strategic approach . . . they could achieve average savings equivalent to . . . some &pound;26 million.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/14">I wonder whether, in the context of improving the system, the Minister will talk about the ability of local authorities to relax the rules to allow scope for greater co-operation across PTEs and concessionary areas. That might make for some efficiency of provision. She will be aware that the NAO report was extremely critical of the Government in certain respects, including their failure to consider the transport plans that had been drawn up, the increase in usage and the need for proper monitoring of provisions that were being put in place. Will she comment on that?</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/15">I am a London MP, and I have heard much today about the paragon of virtue that is London. Those of us who live in London do not necessarily recognise those virtues. Bus usage is up, but fares are also up by 35 per cent. and that figure hides the cost of the concessionary scheme that Mr. Livingstone has put in place. Those of us who are local councillors as well as Members of Parliament have noticed that every year we are told how much we have to provide for the extra concessionary scheme, and that that usually comes off our social services budgets. That damages our ability to care for people at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/16">Mention has been made of Oyster cards. Some of the pricing irregularities are worth noting. London has done away, for no good reason, with the family railcard, so it now costs a family of my constituents, two adults and two children, travelling one stop from Wimbledon Park to Wimbledon something like &pound;9.10 rather than the &pound;3.40 that it cost them less than three months ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.0/17">It is also true that our bus services are the most expensive per mile in the UK. Like all other hon. Members, I can quote the routes about whose failings my constituents regularly write to me. Route 200 springs to mind&mdash;it is criticised for poor delivery and poor punctuality and because &quot;it never turns up&quot;. A consultation exercise decisively rejected the number 493, but it was imposed on us. It causes traffic chaos through one of my wards every day and I get at least one letter about it every week.</p>

	<p pid="b.443.1/1">I have a minute left, so I am sorry but I will not.</p>
	<p pid="b.443.1/2">The paragon of virtue that London has been described as must be carefully considered before we go too far in saying that everything in London is wonderful and everything elsewhere in the world is not. The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley said that quality bus corridors would not necessarily ensure greater reliability or quality, but that does not square with the briefing from the transport authority, which states that journey times on completed quality bus corridors are now 10 times faster in peak areas. I would have wished to go into that in more depth, but I note that my time is running out.</p>
	<p pid="b.443.1/3">Turning the clock back to the pre-1984 era is not the answer. The answer is to make the current system work and to improve it, and I look forward to the Minister's remarks about how the Government intend to address that.</p>

	<p pid="b.444.0/1">I begin by thanking all hon. Members for their kind words on this my penultimate day as a Minister. I should resign more often. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing this debate and on initiating a useful set of contributions. I listened to what everyone said with a great deal of interest. I hope that it will be of some reassurance that I do not intend to try to make the case that everything is for the best in this the best of all possible worlds. The Department recognises that there is a case for change, and I shall outline some of the changes that can be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.0/2">I wish to respond to some specific points, particularly those of my hon. Friend. I assure him that this is not the only opportunity that we have had to hear the concerns of passenger transport executive areas. There is regular official dialogue with PTEs and Ministers&mdash;in fact, last week I met bus partnership forum representatives of the authorities as well as the operators&mdash;and meetings take place every couple of months at both the departmental and Government office level. I assure him that we do pick up on these arguments. I am aware from those activities and from the comments of my hon. Friends the Members for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell), for Wirral, West (Stephen Hesford) and for Tyne Bridge (Mr. Clelland) that there is real strength of feeling about these issues and that there are genuine concerns that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.0/3">We all agree on the importance of the bus as a key strand of public transport policy. Buses provide about two thirds of all public transport journeys&mdash;4 billion journeys in England, with about one quarter in PTE areas. They play, and will increasingly play, a vital role in tackling congestion and promoting accessibility and social exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.0/4">Outside London, bus deregulation has been with us for some 20 years. Those years have not been easy for buses because of the growth in car ownership as well as the factors that hon. Members set out today, in particular the increasing cost base, which is a reality for whoever provides bus services on whatever basis. We must respond to the genuine and almost historically inevitable relationship between economic growth and rising car ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.0/5">It is fair to point out that deregulation has brought some benefits as well. It is important to keep some balance in the debate. There has been considerable investment over the years in new and better quality buses that has not been borne by the public purse. The average age of local buses has fallen to 7.2 years, which is comfortably below the target set by the industry earlier in this decade.</p>

	<p pid="b.445.2/1">I accept that new buses have been constructed, but they tend to be put on the most profitable routes. All the old dodgy buses are left on routes that struggle to get passengers, creating a situation in which people are discouraged from using those less profitable routes.</p>

	<p pid="b.445.3/1">I understand that. It is part of the argument that hon. Members have been making. However, we must recognise that investment has been made that is not from the public purse. That provides opportunities for us to invest elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/2">One of the central points that hon. Members made was about the comparison with London. I appreciate and understand, not least as a London MP, that conurbations outside London look enviously at the patronage growth in London under the franchise system. I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" name="Stephen Hammond">the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase>: as a London MP and the proud holder of an Oyster card that I use regularly, I believe that due credit should be given to Transport for London and the Mayor for the governance, supported by Government money, that has brought about the increase in bus patronage.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/3">It is not true that it would be possible to duplicate the London experience elsewhere. There are several reasons for that: the demographics, population density and size of London; the limited availability of workplace parking; the historic use of the rail and tube networks, which are part of the general public transport system; and the brave decision to introduce the world's first major congestion charging scheme, which has been part and parcel of the measures to increase bus patronage by increasing bus speeds in central London. All those factors together mean that car ownership in London is far lower than the national average: 36 per cent. of London households have no car, compared with 25 per cent. across England as a whole, and only 20 per cent. have two or more cars, compared with 31 per cent. nationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/4">Furthermore, although it is true that there is generous Government support for London transport&mdash;rightly so, as it is the capital city&mdash;about half of the &pound;2.8 billion per year investment in public transport comes from other sources such as the congestion charge and the council tax payer.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/5">Hon. Members' comments reflected the fact that experience elsewhere shows that growth can be achieved outside London, particularly if local authorities and bus operators enjoy good relations. I shall not run through the list again because of the risk of irritating hon. Members, but it is not just in historic towns&mdash;Brighton and York among others&mdash;that we have achieved considerable success. Nottingham is also a good example. Last summer, I visited my hon. Friend the Member for Tyne Bridge, who is not in his place, and observed what was then the fastest growing bus route in the whole of England, and the guided bus way in Tyne and Wear, which is a spectacular success and shows what can be done when the challenge of providing new buses and responding to issues around bus reliability is met.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/6">Time precludes my running through many of the issues, but let me say a little about bus priority measures. It is absolutely the case that any investment that is made in bus services must be considered in the context of improving bus priority to ensure that speed and reliability are enhanced. All the bus operators tell us that that is one of the key factors that attracts people to using bus services.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley mentioned quality bus corridors. I believe that they are a good way of improving traffic flow for buses. They can bring in more custom and allow operators to increase frequency and to invest in new buses. That in turn can improve custom on other routes, and address some of the concerns that hon. Members have about radial routes operating to the exclusion of other services. In fact, measures that increase bus use dramatically on some priority routes can be a way of improving the service overall. Operators can use profits to cross-subsidise other marginal services, thus creating a virtuous circle of improved bus services.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/8">There are many successful quality bus corridors in the PTE areas, and they are often underpinned by quality bus partnership agreements, under which the operator undertakes to provide a higher standard of service. Though voluntary, such agreements have proved to be an excellent channel for improving bus services across the area. We monitor the effectiveness of quality bus corridors through the local transport plan policy and do not rely on inspired guesswork.</p>
	<p pid="b.445.3/9">There has not been much use of the statutory quality partnership power in the Transport Act 2000. That is partly because, where there are effective voluntary agreements, local authorities have not seen the need to use that power, but we encourage its use&mdash;</p>

	Genetic Discrimination
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.447.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" speakername="Anne Begg" colnum="447"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h02.htm#60315h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.447.1/1">I am delighted to be here this morning, Mr. Jones. On Second Reading of the Disability Discrimination Bill on 23 March 2005, I said that the Government would at some time in the future have to consider passing legislation making it illegal to discriminate on the grounds of genetics. Although I congratulate them on outlawing most areas of discrimination faced by disabled people, there is still a large hole in the process of ensuring that disabled people have their full civil rights. We must make sure that they do not suffer disproportionately from genetic discrimination in their employment opportunities or in access to services such as insurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/2">I see the issue as one of equality and civil rights. Unfortunately, not everyone does, and I was reminded of that when preparing for this debate. When we were fighting for full civil rights for disabled people, it was difficult to get a relevant Minister to answer because the issue was invariably seen as one of health. One of the first problems the disabled movement had in fighting for civil rights was to get disability away from the Department of Health so that we could begin to challenge the medical model of disability and make the Government realise that it was our civil rights we were fighting for, not just access to health treatment and social care.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/3">When I was granted this debate, I suppose it should not really have come as a surprise that my request was passed to the Department of Health, despite the fact that the Table Office suggested that I should add &quot;in employment&quot; to the title, so that it would be clear that it concerned genetic testing and discrimination in employment, not just genetics, which obviously is a health issue. I had hoped that a Minister from the Department for Work and Pensions would be asked to reply, or the Minister from the Department of Trade and Industry who is responsible for workers' rights. I am glad that, not I, but the system in this place persuaded the relevant Minister to respond today. I suspect that the Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">the Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> has drawn the short straw, but I am glad to see her. Her responsibilities include equality, and I believe that this is an equality issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/4">The subject of genetic discrimination first came to my attention when I realised that those with diagnosed genetic conditions were receiving unfair treatment when applying for insurance. The insurance companies assumed that someone who had a genetic condition would automatically have a shorter life and should, therefore, pay higher premiums for any kind of life cover. That was also true for getting travel insurance, and several people contacted me, concerned either that it was impossible to get travel insurance for someone with a disability or that the premiums were so high that travel was almost impossible.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/5">The assumptions often made by insurance companies regarding people with genetic conditions are that their lives will be shorter and that the quality of their lives will be less. That may be true of some conditions. For instance, if someone has been tested for Huntington's disease, there will be a direct correlation between their having the defective gene and the development of the disease later in life. However, it is impossible to predict when that might be or the severity with which the disease will initially hit, so there is a question of time scales. The situation with regard to the Huntington's gene is not necessarily the case for all genetic conditions. Indeed, a genetic disposition for a particular condition such as cancer or heart disease does not necessarily mean that an individual will develop the condition. A predisposition is purely that: a predisposition, not necessarily a matter of fact.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/6">I know that insurance companies work on risk factors when they are working out the premiums payable, whether for life insurance or travel insurance, so they have to build in those risk factors and have access to all relevant information when making their decisions. I was very pleased when the Association of British Insurers announced in 2001 that it was to adopt a five-year moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurers. At that time, I was about to apply for an Adjournment debate on the subject, but when the moratorium came along I decided to see how it worked, so I did not. If the moratorium did not work, I always intended to call for    legislation to outlaw the practice of genetic discrimination.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/7">I was particularly pleased to learn that from yesterday&mdash;I did not know this when I applied for the debate&mdash;a concordat has been agreed between the insurance industry and the Government, providing that insurers' use of genetic information should be transparent, fair and subject to independent oversight, and that the voluntary moratorium on insurers' use of predictive genetic tests should be extended until <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-01">1 November 2011</phrase>. It has also been agreed that the concordat will be reviewed in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/8">I know that not everyone is happy with everything the insurance industry has done because there are exemptions, such as Huntington's disease, but at least the system is much fairer. I certainly do not have any anecdotal evidence that people with genetic conditions feel they have been unfairly treated by the insurance industry. I believe that a model exists in that the insurance industry has shown the way. It is possible to ensure that those with genetic conditions are not treated unfairly and that there are clear guidelines, particularly for the use of predictive genetic tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/9">The basis of my argument is that I would like a similar understanding to be reached with employers in the United Kingdom so that they do not demand the disclosure of genetic tests by their employees or, indeed, force employees or applicants for jobs to take the tests at all. If it is not possible to reach such an understanding and it becomes clear that genetic discrimination is taking place in the UK, I would look to the Government to legislate to outlaw that practice.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/10">At this point, I should explain what is meant by predictive genetic tests and why it is important that people should be able to take such tests without the fear that it may lead to their being discriminated against. There are two main types of genetic tests. The first test a person's genetic make-up in order to identify, for example, where there may be faults in genes, or whether there are genes that would lead to a particular disease. The second type test for genetic damage that occurs during a person's lifetime.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/11">I speak as a supporter of genetic testing. I was born with a genetic condition and know the good that such tests can do. They play important roles in diagnosis and in treatment. For some, they may diagnose something for which there are presently no symptoms, but where it is useful to know that the genetic condition exists, as it may help determine lifestyle choices or help in early detection so that remedial treatment can prevent the symptoms from occurring. It is an important health issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/12">It is for precisely those reasons that I want to ensure that people who may have genetic conditions feel safe in having a test, secure in the knowledge that the information gained will not be used by anyone to discriminate against them in future. Only with such assurances will people feel at ease in taking a test that may be very important to their future health. Evidence from elsewhere in the world, particularly the United States, which seems the worst example of a country in which people are forced to disclose information gained through genetic tests&mdash;suggests that without assurances that the information will not be used against them, people shy away from having the tests done at all. That has important consequences for their future health plans. I ask the Government to ensure that security measures are in place so that people can take genetic tests in the sure knowledge that the tests will be used for good of the individual and not to discriminate against them.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/13">In years to come, genetic testing will become more sophisticated, and I want to ensure that such tests are a force for good, that they lead to better diagnoses and treatment and that they are not something to be feared. Of course, someone who has symptoms and a disability as a result of a genetic disease is likely to be covered by existing disability discrimination legislation. Someone who is asymptomatic is not covered, and nor is someone who might be affected by a condition later in life. Nor, indeed, is someone who has undergone a predictive genetic test, because it predicts only a propensity, and not that they will get the disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/14">Many people fear predictive genetic tests. For someone who has a family history of breast cancer, it may be right to have a predictive test, but if there are no guidelines and no security against the test's being used to discriminate against the individual, they may not undertake it.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/15">Predictive genetic tests are still crude, and their development has a long way to go, but even today, they are used to predict someone's propensity for developing a particular condition&mdash;perhaps cancer or heart disease. Although such tests may predict a propensity or susceptibility towards a condition, they predict neither that the person will definitely develop that condition, nor any time scales if they should. Therefore, if predictive genetic tests were used by insurance companies or employers to determine that an individual should be treated less favourably than someone else, that would be discrimination, and such practice should be outlawed. The use of those types of tests is causing most concern among organisations such as the Trades Union Congress and GeneWatch.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/16">At a time when the Government are trying to encourage more disabled people into the work force, or to keep those who have developed a disability while in a job, it would be perverse if employers were able to use genetic tests as a recruitment tool to screen out people who were thought to be a greater risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/17">The Human Genetics Commission has found no evidence that employers in the UK are systematically using genetic test results to recruit people, or using such tests as part of workplace health programmes&mdash;yet. However, the HGC has outlined the following general principles:</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/18" class="indent">&quot;that everyone is entitled to privacy and should not have to discuss information about personal genetic characteristics; that private genetic information should not be obtained or held without a person's consent; that private personal genetic information should be treated as confidential and not communicated to others without a person's consent; and that no one should be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of his or her genetic characteristics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/19">A number of countries, such as Austria, Denmark, France, the Netherlands and Norway, have some form of legislation that prohibits or limits employers' rights to ask for genetic information. Before it becomes a serious problem, it may be time for the UK Government to look to follow suit.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/20">It is clear that genetic testing will increase. I want to ensure that those tests are used for good reasons and not to discriminate against an individual. We must ensure that they are used positively, whether it is to help in diagnosis and cure, to help people make more rational life choices, or to help employers ensure that they provide a safe working environment. They should not be used to help employers find an easy way to save money by not employing certain types of people because they may be a higher risk to the employer later in life or incur extra expenses for the employer.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/21">It is time for the Government to consider the issue seriously to encourage employers to follow the lead given by the insurance companies and consider a moratorium on the use of the tests. Ultimately, however, there will probably come a time when the Government have to legislate to outlaw genetic discrimination in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.450.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry"  colnum="450"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h02.htm#60315h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.450.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1956" name="Anne Begg">the Member for Aberdeen, South (Miss Begg)</phrase> on securing the debate, and I pay tribute to the great deal of work that she has done on many occasions to raise disability and genetics issues. I am also grateful to her for the opportunity to debate this issue and to lay out the steps that the Government are taking.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/2">My hon. Friend suggested that I had drawn the short straw, but I am happy to address the issue, because, as she said, my responsibilities cover women and equality. As I have said on many occasions, particularly during the passage of the Equality Bill, which is the legislation that will set up the new commission for equality and human rights, equality affects everybody and should be a concern of everybody. I am delighted that my hon. Friend has raised an issue that is not often referred to but about which we should nevertheless be concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/3">In the 2003 White Paper on genetics, we said that the Government &quot;wholeheartedly endorses&quot; the Human Genetics Commission's view that no one should be unfairly discriminated against on the basis of their genetic characteristics. The White Paper reminds us that universal health care, funded from taxation, which is the basis of the national health service, protects people against discrimination on the basis of genetic information. As genetic testing becomes more widely available, we are concerned to ensure that people should not and will not have to fear losing cover for health care.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/4">All people with a genetic condition will be protected by the Disability Discrimination Act 2005, once their condition results in their becoming a disabled person within the meaning of that Act. My hon. Friend referred to that issue. However, we must not be complacent about the risk to people who, as a result of genetic testing, are shown to have an increased risk or, in limited cases, the certainty of developing a particular condition later in life.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/5">The Government have done much to promote equality and tackle discrimination&mdash;a great deal more than any previous Government in our country. We have offered many people protection under the law for the first time, we are taking action to streamline and modernise the framework of discrimination law, and we are considering areas, such as the one under discussion, in which there are calls for specific new legal protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/6">The Government have outlawed discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sexual orientation and religion and belief, and we plan to do so later this year for age. In 2004, we significantly extended protection for disabled people against disability discrimination in recruitment and employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/7">The Government have also brought in a groundbreaking duty on public authorities to promote race equality, eliminate racial discrimination and promote good relations between different racial groups. The legislation was introduced in 2002. As I am sure my hon. Friend knows, it is being followed by similar duties for disability and gender, which are due to come into force in December 2006 and April 2007 respectively. We legislated to provide legal recognition for same-sex partnerships for the first time through the Civil Partnership Act 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/8">The Equality Act 2006 has made significant steps, and it received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February</phrase>. It has three main purposes. First, it establishes the commission for equality and human rights, whose general duties, set out in statute, include encouraging the development of a society in which people's ability to achieve their potential is not limited by prejudice or discrimination. Secondly, it makes discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief unlawful in the provision of goods, facilities and services, and in the exercise of public functions. Thirdly, it creates a duty on public authorities to promote equality of opportunity between men and women, and to prohibit sex discrimination in the exercise of public functions. It also includes a power to make secondary legislation outlawing discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in the provision of goods, facilities and services. We are currently consulting on the detail of those measures. However, although there are many provisions relating to many areas of discrimination, we recognise that there is still more to do if we are to ensure that everyone's skills and talents can be fully realised and that people are not discriminated against for any reason, such as in the ways that my hon. Friend has described.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/9">The Government are currently undertaking a discrimination law review that is working to develop a clearer and more streamlined framework of equality law. It will lead to a single equality Act later in this Parliament; that is a manifesto commitment. As part of the review, we are, of course, considering the calls made by various people from various organisations to extend discrimination law into new areas, including genetic predisposition. Genetic tests are becoming available that show that a person has an increased risk or a likelihood&mdash;or, in some cases, certainty&mdash;of developing a particular medical condition later in life. As my hon. Friend said, the concern is that the results of such tests might be used by employers to screen out applicants for jobs or promotion, or that insurance companies might screen out applicants for health cover or life insurance, or increase their premiums unreasonably.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/10">I understand the concerns, but the technology is at an early stage, and it is important that nothing is done except on the basis of careful consideration of all the options. Discrimination law is one possibility, but there are clearly others, including legislation about the use of genetic tests, or statutory guidance. I intend to publish a Green Paper this summer, which will set out initial proposals and options for clarifying and streamlining discrimination law, and which will seek the views of all interested parties. We are committed to taking on board the views of all interested people, and we do not want to predict or pre-empt the findings of that consultation. I invite my hon. Friend and all who are concerned about this issue&mdash;I know that other Members involved in all-party groups have discussed it at length&mdash;to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/11">The work of the discrimination law review will run alongside the independent equalities review, which the Government established to investigate the causes of persistent discrimination and inequality in British society. The findings of the equalities review, which is due to report to the Prime Minister later in the year, will inform the work of the discrimination law review and the subsequent single equality Bill&mdash;and, indeed, the work of the new commission for equality and human rights. Let me reassure my hon. Friend that any proposals for reform to equality legislation will take full account both of the need to tackle inequality effectively and of the need to follow better regulation principles to minimise the burden on business and public services.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/12">I will now address the specific concerns that my hon. Friend raised. First, on employment, the Government are not aware of there being any evidence at present of large-scale use of genetic testing by employers. However, we are committed to monitoring developments in genetic testing and have asked the Human Genetics Commission to assess the prevalence of genetic testing in the workplace and to report back later this spring. Given the weather, I am not sure whether we are quite into spring yet, or how soon it will come, but we will get that report in the near future. The HGC is well placed to undertake the work as it has an excellent understanding of the issues, is well respected and&mdash;importantly&mdash;will provide independent advice. In addition, the Information Commissioner's statutory employment code sets out that employers should inform the HGC of any proposals to use genetic testing for employment purposes. The Government have included questions on genetic testing in the 2005 British social attitudes survey to assess public opinion on the issue. The results will be available later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/13">The Government wish to ensure that once genetic testing has advanced to the stage where the use of test results by employers becomes a realistic proposition there are appropriate safeguards to prevent such information from being unfairly used. The Data Protection Act 1998 does not prevent the use of genetic testing, but as this is sensitive information about individuals' health, it is subject to restrictive rules. This demonstrates our commitment to monitoring the use of genetic testing in employment, with a view to ensuring that we will ensure safeguards are in place once genetic testing has reached an advanced stage. My hon. Friend referred to evidence that it is used much more widely in the United States, and she was concerned about whether it would become more of an issue in our country. We will have to keep a close eye on that. However, in the United States much health insurance and much provision of health services are linked to employment, which is one reason why I believe the issue is much greater there than it is likely to be in our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/14">On insurance, as my hon. Friend said, we have a ban until November 2011 on the use by insurers of results from predictive genetic tests, unless a test has been approved by the Government's Genetics and Insurance Committee and relates to a policy over the substantial financial limits of &pound;500,000 for life insurance, &pound;300,000 for critical illness insurance, or &pound;30,000 a year for income protection insurance. The insurance industry recently made it clear that it will not ask for approval to use the results from predictive genetic tests in determining insurance premiums before 2008. The Association of British Insurers wrote to the Department of Health on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-15">15 February 2006</phrase> to say that insurers will not apply to use any predictive genetic test result in determining insurance premiums before 2008. The only test that they may currently use&mdash;they can do so until 2011&mdash;is for Huntington's disease for life insurance policies of more than &pound;500,000. The current agreement with the insurance industry is flexible enough to respond to fast-moving technological and clinical developments in genetic testing. The Government have made it clear that any failure in respect of the agreement will lead to reconsideration of the need for statutory control. The Government stand by the commitment in the 2003 White Paper on genetics that any failure of the agreement will lead to reconsideration of the need for statutory control. If there is evidence of non-compliance with the moratorium by the insurance industry, the Government are prepared to enforce it through legislation. However, there is no such evidence at present.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.0/15">In conclusion, I repeat that the Government are committed to a society in which no one is unfairly discriminated against on the basis of his or her genetic characteristics. The discrimination law review will look into calls for specific legal protections to be introduced in the area of genetic predisposition and other new areas. I cannot predict the outcome of the review, but I look forward to there being a full and productive examination of the issues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.454.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="454"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h03.htm#60315h03_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.454.1/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Mr. Jones. It is also a pleasure, for which I am grateful, to have the opportunity to introduce this debate on broadband in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-08">8 March</phrase> last year the Minister with us today&mdash;then the Minister for Rural Affairs&mdash;and the Minister for Energy and E-Commerce wrote a letter to all parish and town councils, headed &quot;Partnership in rolling out broadband to rural communities&quot;. The letter said, rightly, that broadband can reduce dependence on big population centres and increase investment, employment opportunities and choice without undermining the character of rural Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Broadband Britain is becoming a reality&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/4">it said, and it urged parish and town councils to communicate the benefits of broadband to the communities that they serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/5">The letter was greeted with raised eyebrows by a group of constituents who live in the Hambleden valley area, most of which is within my constituency. I shall not waste words describing the area, other than to say that it is rural and beautiful, and that despite its prosperity it contains pockets of exclusion and isolation. Like other rural areas it is, of course, going through a process of change.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/6">The group was aware that almost 300 households and almost 60 businesses in the area cannot get broadband, so the Ministers' letter would in that sense have been rather wasted. Hambleden Valley Ltd was formed by the group in 2003 to obtain broadband services for the whole area. The company was intended as a procurement vehicle and was set up to meet the South East England Development Agency's requirements for broadband service procurement. Its website address, which is of course available both to those who have broadband and those who unfortunately do not, is <a href="http://www.hambledenvalley.net">www.hambledenvalley.net</a>.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/7">Hambleden Valley Ltd. wrote to SEEDA to ask for assistance in February last year. By August, no response had been forthcoming. Today, there has been no formal response, apart from a phone conversation, which I am told did not address longer-term issues and limitations associated with using anything other than landlines. In October, the group came to see me to discuss the difficulties that some of my constituents were having in getting access to broadband. It soon became evident to me that the local difficulty had a national dimension.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/8">I was told, and British Telecom has confirmed, that 0.2 per cent. of all telephone lines in the country cannot get broadband, but that may not be a definitive figure. Hambleden Valley Ltd referred me to a study in Kent, which the Minister may have seen, and which was carried out by Kent county council. The figure that it produced for such lines was not 0.2 per cent. In fact 2.4 per cent. of businesses and 2.2 per cent. of households in the county could not get broadband, so the figure in rural areas is likely to be higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/9">I should explain to those hon. Members who have difficulty in following the technical details&mdash;I must confess that I am one of them&mdash;that areas that cannot get broadband coverage are sometimes referred to as &quot;not spots&quot;, as opposed, I presume, to &quot;hot spots&quot;. I was intrigued by this matter, so I asked the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in a written question whether he would list each constituency that contains a proportion of the relevant 0.2 per cent. of lines. The answer was that the information was not available in the form requested. I decided to drop the request for constituency information and ask the Secretary of State in another written question where the lines were located. The answer was that the information was not available in the form requested.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/10">At that point I gave up trying to second-guess the form in which the information might be available and decided instead to do a little investigation on a non-party political basis. I duly discovered that approximately 15 parliamentary colleagues reported their constituents to be in the same situation as mine. Since not all parliamentary colleagues from across the House will necessarily respond to inquiries from me, it must be assumed that the definitive figure is higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/11">I had clearly stumbled across a national problem, which is why I balloted for this debate, which I am grateful to have obtained. In the time remaining to me I want to discuss possible solutions to the problem, to describe what appear to be present obstacles to those solutions, and to ask the Minister a few questions, which I hope he will be able to deal with.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there is a dispersed national issue to be dealt with. I look forward to responding to the debate. Does the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that the 0.2 per cent. of lines to which he referred&mdash;or even 2 per cent., if that is the correct figure&mdash;for which there are obstacles is a small proportion, given that only a couple of years ago we thought large swathes of rural Britain would not have access to broadband, yet now they do?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.455.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" speakername="Paul Goodman" colnum="455"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h03.htm#60315h03_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.455.1/1">The Minister anticipates a complimentary remark that I was going to make later about BT. He evidently thought that I might not get there. I cannot, of course, be definitive about the figures and say whether the percentage is 0.2 per cent., 2.0 per cent. or 2.4 per cent. The Minister is more likely than I am to have access to the figures. I want now to discuss possible solutions and present obstacles to them, before asking the Minister a few questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/2">Broadband services are provided by one of three means: through satellite or wireless means, by cable operators using the cable TV network, or by BT and others over BT's phone lines. Hambleden Valley Ltd claims that the problems facing the valley are typical of unserved areas as a whole. It says that satellite broadband will not support new uses of the internet, including cheap video and teleconferencing, telephony and video games, and that in intensely wooded areas such as the valley, where mobile phone reception is poor, the installation of the necessary infrastructure may be neither practical nor effective. The question of cost also arises.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/3">Hambleden Valley Ltd also says that cable companies, as competitive and profit-conscious operators, are unlikely to try to expand their coverage in rural areas because of the potential expense and lack of return. Hambleden Valley Ltd maintains that ultimately a solution from BT is needed&mdash;that, indeed, a solution can come only from BT. The argument falls into two parts, one of which is practical and one moral.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/4">The practical argument is that in the area in question, and elsewhere, BT is technically capable of installing a fibre-optic cable, which in this case would run from the Henley exchange to local distribution points, where equipment would be installed in roadside cabinets. That equipment, in turn, would be able to distribute the broadband service to individual homes and businesses in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/5">The moral argument, if that is the right word, is that no near-monopoly supplier of electricity would readily ignore the need for electricity of 0.2 per cent. of homes and businesses, and that no near-monopoly supplier of water would readily ignore their need for water, just because they were in remote locations. As for electricity and water, the argument runs, so should it be for phones, and therefore for broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/6">Perhaps BT itself is a witness for that point of view. In the brief prepared for the debate BT states:</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/7" class="indent">&quot;BT's ultimate goal is to make broadband available to anyone who wants it but, clearly, this has to be commercially viable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/8">There is the rub, and there are the obstacles to possible solutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/9">I am coming to the part of my remarks that the Minister did not think I would make. Hambleden Valley Ltd. acknowledges that BT has done a good job in rolling out broadband, and that the British record compares well to that of other countries. It acknowledges that it is the very success of the British record that puts the minority of people and businesses without broadband at a significant disadvantage. This is an appearance of an old friend, which used to be cited by Peter Walker when he was active in politics, which is the problem of success. If one has success, it leaves the area or the people not covered by that success at a disadvantage that they feel acutely. BT suggested in its brief for this debate that workable solutions for the 2 per cent. or so of lines in rural areas that cannot get broadband do not yet exist. My constituents argue that BT has not yet proved that case, as it has not disclosed what the cost would be, and would obviously be unwilling to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/10">Furthermore, there is controversy about subsidising loss-making lines. In effect, BT argues that it would be breaching EU competition rules if it subsidised non-profitable broadband services in some rural areas by means of its profitable operations in others. Again, a key question is what BT's costs would be.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/11">Last month, my hon. Friends the Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb), and for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones)&mdash;both of whom are present&mdash;and for Daventry (Mr. Boswell) and for Henley (Mr. Johnson) and I wrote jointly seeking a round-table discussion with Openreach, the service arm of BT that delivers broadband, and Ofcom, at which those issues might be explored. Openreach was happy to have such a round-table meeting; Ofcom suggested that we first meet Openreach to discuss the technology side of the issue, and then meet Ofcom.</p>
	<p pid="b.455.1/12">I concede at once that I am not an expert on the technology side, but the vital problem for those in rural areas, whether in my constituency or elsewhere, is not technological. That is, the problem is not their elected representative's grasp, or lack of grasp, of technology. It is political; it is the difficulty of getting all the parties concerned around one table, and of getting the necessary political impetus.</p>

	<p pid="b.457.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on raising this important issue. In the provision of all utility services, is there not a distinction between the infrastructure&mdash;the lines between the customer and the provider&mdash;and the supplier of a particular function? Surely a difference should be made between laying the fibre-optic cable&mdash;the broadband cable, as it were&mdash;and the provider of the service, who allows use of that line. If the Government were to emphasise the importance of infrastructure, they might be able to persuade BT to get around the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.457.1/1">When the Minister replies, I expect that he will emphasise the importance of infrastructure. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> is right to distinguish between what my hon. Friend the Member for Clwyd, West, refers to as the platform&mdash;that is, the platform on which BT provides the service&mdash;and the lines that might take the services to isolated people and relatively isolated businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.1/2">I want to ask the Minister five questions. First, to pursue the issue that I tried to explore in my written questions, what analysis has the Minister's Department made of where the 0.2 per cent. of lines that cannot get broadband are concentrated? Perhaps that form of words will help; we shall see. Secondly, what part, if any, does he think he can play in getting the main players around one table?</p>
	<p pid="b.457.1/3">Thirdly, what analysis has he made of the role that public bodies, such as his Department, regional development agencies and local authorities, play in supporting publicly funded broadband projects in rural areas, as opposed to non-rural areas? It has been put to me that some RDAs are proving more effective than others. To cite a good example rather than a bad one, I was told that Advantage West Midlands is doing especially well. I ask because there is a perception that in urban areas private-sector providers&mdash;new entrepreneurs&mdash;are jostling for space with publicly funded broadband projects. Hambleden Valley Ltd cites as a recent example a project in Milton Keynes using infrastructure from Pipex. The point is that urban areas are getting the new entrepreneurs and the public money; there is a risk that rural areas will not get the entrepreneurs, as they cannot yet make a profit there, or the exploratory funds from public bodies that might enable those rural areas to get a better service.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.1/4">Fourthly, what part can the Minister play in galvanising his Department, RDAs and local authorities into assisting publicly funded broadband projects in rural areas? My fifth question struck me when I was reading Countryside Alliance's brief for this debate: is it correct to assert that only 3 per cent. of rural businesses connect to the internet via broadband? I wondered whether that figure related to those who cannot get broadband, or to those who have access to it but simply do not use it.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.1/5">I want to step back from the detail and look at the big picture. People in rural areas, especially farmers, are rightly being asked to diversify. Diversification often means business, and business means being e-enabled, to use a jargon word. Being e-enabled surely means getting broadband sooner or later. About 50 businesses in my constituency are affected; that is a lot of businesses. The concern of my constituents is that when, in due course, BT or others roll out super-broadband elsewhere, they will still not even have broadband. This is in a country where, according to Hambleden Valley Ltd, one has to apply for public-service work by e-mail, and in a world that, as we all acknowledge, is moving ever faster.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.1/6">Parts of our rural areas are already isolated and socially excluded in many ways, including through transport, lack of access to health, social services and employment, and lack of access to what this Government, like the Conservative Government that preceded them, describe as opportunity for all. None of us wants to add lack of access to technology to that list. We look to the Minister to point to a way forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.458.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I start by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing time to discuss the matter. He outlined the problems in his usual incisive and succinct way.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/2">In the 10 short months in which I have been a Member, I have received numerous e-mails, phone calls and letters from constituents who have had disappointing and frustrating experiences when trying to access broadband internet in Pembrokeshire. In those 10 months, I have built up a considerable file of cases, which I have been working on with BT. Some concern families or elderly couples. Several small businesses have contacted me, saying that they rely on e-mail and web access to be viable in such a remote, peripheral part of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/3">For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase> I received a rather sad e-mail from a local business man, entitled &quot;Pulling out of Wales&quot;. One reason that he cited for quitting the Principality was the fact that his wife's start-up venture&mdash;an advanced post-production centre for TV and films&mdash;was simply not viable at their home location, because they have been told that they simply cannot get broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/4">I shall not go into too much detail about the cases that I am working on, but a typical scenario is that someone interested in accessing broadband, logs on to BT's website, or that of another internet service provider, and taps in their postcode. They are informed that their local exchange is enabled, and that they can receive broadband. They place an order for the broadband kit, but an engineer comes round later to test the line and tells the customer that they cannot receive broadband after all. It is left to the customer to try to claim a refund on the order and, understandably, they are left feeling rather unhappy. That experience, in which the customer is initially under the impression that they can receive broadband and places an order on that understanding, is leaving a bitter taste in the mouths of many of my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/5">Another local business man wrote me a letter, which I received last May. He said that a large part of his business is net-based. He says:</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Broadband is integral to the success of my business&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/7">He goes on to outline his difficulties in trying to access broadband with a particular internet service provider. He says:</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/8" class="indent">&quot;If they could not supply broadband then they should have told me so when I first applied and given me their reasons . . . Instead all I get is a fog of misinformation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/9">Despite all the attention devoted to local exchange enabling, my constituents have not appreciated that, at the end of the day, it is not a question of whether the local exchange is enabled; it is the quality of the line from the exchange to the household that counts, and that line quality is not good enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/10">I am told that in Pembrokeshire some problems with broadband availability are due to the amount of aluminium wiring used. Apparently, it is not suitable for carrying digital information in the way that copper wiring is. Another reason that I have been given is the distance between a house and the local exchange. However, we have had a scenario where some villagers in a small village can get broadband but their immediate neighbours cannot, so even that reason has been questioned by some of my constituents. In not one of the cases with which I have dealt in the past year has local exchange enabling been the central issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/11">One major cause of frustration and disappointment is that my constituents have heard the public relations line from BT about 99.8 per cent. of households being able to receive broadband, which they believe is now nearly universally available. However, the number of e-mails and letters that I have received in Pembrokeshire alone suggests that nothing like 99.8 per cent. of households can get broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/12">I suspect that the figure of 99.8 per cent. is a rather imprecise estimate based on averaging an estimated number of enabled exchanges across the total UK population. Getting a more definite figure has proved problematic. I have asked BT for an estimate of the number of households in my county or my constituency that cannot access broadband owing to technical constraints, but it has not been able to provide such a figure:</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/13" class="indent">&quot;at present BT cannot accurately estimate the actual number of homes where it is not feasible to provide broadband access.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/14">If BT cannot accurately estimate the number of homes that can access broadband, where on earth does the figure of 99.8 per cent. come from? BT states only that the &quot;vast majority&quot; of households in Pembrokeshire can access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/15">A local telecoms engineer informed me that he believes that only around 40 per cent. of an exchange area in Pembrokeshire can receive good quality broadband, which includes any speeds down to about 256 kilobits&mdash;a very low figure indeed. I have also heard another engineer comment that BT's figure of 99 per cent. should probably be nearer 65 per cent. nationwide. Some clarification is required, and BT needs to be more careful about some of its public relations.</p>
	<p pid="b.458.0/16">Judging from the interest in this afternoon's debate, I suspect that Pembrokeshire is not an isolated example. There are issues to do with broadband access in rural areas throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has articulated very well the concerns of many households and small businesses. Does he share the frustration of the many charities that are affected? For instance, the Royal National Institute for Deaf People Cymru has run an excellent project called &quot;Hear to help&quot;, which covers Ceredigion and Powys but has been severely hampered by its lack of access to broadband. RNID Cymru relies on access to the internet for shared drives among its volunteers but its work has been seriously hampered by the lack of progress on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point. He is a good champion for the charity and voluntary sector in Wales and has illustrated a key concern for that sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.1/2">The Minister will be aware that BT has received substantial sums of public money in recent years to extend broadband availability throughout the UK. In November he informed me in an answer to a written question that since 1997 BT has received approximately &pound;500,000 from the East of England Development Agency, nearly &pound;1 million from the south-west regional development agency, &pound;16.5 million in Scotland and &pound;3.6 million of European structural funding in Wales, which does not include yesterday's announcement. In the north-east region, BT was paid &pound;1.8 million and there have been other, more localised subsidies; for example, &pound;360,000 was awarded to BT through a contract with the Cheshire digital development agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.1/3">All that adds up to more than &pound;23 million of public money that BT has received since 1997. Given the information that the Minister has available, does he think that the taxpayer has received value from those subsidies to BT?</p>

	<p pid="b.460.2/1">The expectation of cost at any earlier stage, before market-based responses started to deliver broadband, was far higher than the figures that the hon. Gentleman has mentioned. Initiatives such as the &quot;Act Now&quot; project in Cornwall have demonstrated that once we get the provision of broadband a market develops and people start to respond and look for broadband outside the area of a direct project. There are an awful lot of lessons to be learned. The sums to which the hon. Gentleman referred assisted in building the broadband market over quite an extended period.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.3/1">I look forward to hearing more detail in the Minister's reply and learning what he thinks the money has bought this country that would not have been provided in the marketplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.3/2">I have heard it said by a very senior BT executive that BT would like to &quot;move on&quot; from discussing broadband access in Wales to discussing what is called next generation technology. I am afraid that BT needs to be pulled back to the discussion about broadband access because, as I hope the evidence that I have provided in the last 10 minutes and the speeches that we shall hear in the remainder of this debate will show, the lack of broadband availability in a lot of rural areas is causing severe problems for businesses, households and charities.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.4/1">I would ask colleagues throughout the Chamber to be careful about one thing. Having spent four years as Minister for Rural Affairs, I know that talking down rural affairs does not help, although I do not think that that is the hon. Gentleman's intention. There are problems in some locations in some rural areas. That is not to say that there problems in all rural areas. If the impression is given that there are problems in all rural areas, the danger is that the rural economy will get talked down. Broadband is accessible and is being used effectively by many businesses in many rural areas throughout the country. The focus of today's debate is the small but important number of gaps in the infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="b.461.0/1">I take the Minister's point on board. I do not think that it is the intention of any of the participants here to talk down their rural areas. During the short time in which I have been a Member of this place, I have come to recognise a number of the hon. Members present as champions for their rural constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.461.1/1">Although the Minister is correct to urge those present not to run down rural areas, as he put it, is it not hard to be sure how many people and businesses in rural areas are not connected to broadband while we do not have a definitive figure? It is therefore hard to be sure of the scale of the problem, and we hope that the Minister can assist us in that respect.</p>

	<p pid="b.461.5/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing this debate. Like others who wish to speak, I represent a rural area where broadband access is a problem, but we are not here to run down such areas&mdash;far from it.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/2">Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase>, I have struggled to reconcile the claim of virtually universal coverage of access to broadband with the experience of many of my constituents. Like him, I have a raft of correspondence&mdash;he will be relieved to hear that I shall not detain the Chamber with it&mdash;with people who have difficulty gaining access to broadband. I am here to argue their cause.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/3">That cause is not only my constituents' but the Government's, as the Minister has been at pains to tell us and as he will, I am sure, tell us again when he winds up. The Government's priority is to provide universal access to broadband, which is a noble and entirely honourable aspiration. As the Minister wrote to me in a letter on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/4" class="indent">&quot;Stimulating broadband availability across the whole of the UK is a Government priority. We want to see all communities, irrespective of location, having access to an affordable broadband service from a competitive market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/5">I should like to dwell on some of the issues raised by that aspiration.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/6">The significance of broadband in Shropshire is enormous. Last year Shropshire was declared to have the highest proportion of home-working of anywhere in the country. Because of even more remote access to the services than one might normally find in a constituency such as Wycombe, my constituents have great distances to travel and few job opportunities. As my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe said, internet access is the one thing that provides the farming community with an opportunity for diversification, and a large proportion of the working age population, plus many who are beyond working age but have not had such opportunities before, with a way in to work. It is of great significance.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/7">Shropshire county council has recognised that, and I commend the work that it has done through Switch on Shropshire, an initiative that has been running for three years in conjunction with Advantage West Midlands to deliver broadband to communities. They have done well. I do not often congratulate my regional development agency in the House, but it has done a good job. Indeed it was highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe as being particularly successful in that regard. It has achieved that with relatively modest resources&mdash;some &pound;4.9 million has been allocated to broadband, about half of which has been spent. A number of initiatives are being taken to bring broadband to communities that currently lack it.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/8">Let me address some challenges of delivering broadband in my constituency. Some are technological, which means that I may stray into areas that are a little beyond my pay grade or competence. It seems that a significant problem arises from the use by BT of digital access carrier systems as the delivery mechanism for telephony. It is clear that DACS cannot be shared with broadband access. Therefore, there is a requirement on BT to replace such systems with a hard wire or wireless system that will allow high-speed broadband delivery. Most of my constituents' problems occur when they apply for broadband modems. They are signed up by their internet service providers or by BT Retail, which takes their money and installs modems but then discovers that BT Wholesale is not able to deliver the service because they are on DACS. The cost of replacing the DACS technology is a commercial decision, not one that the ISP is able to force BT to implement. BT has made that very clear. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January</phrase> it told me that</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/9" class="indent">&quot;whereas BT has a universal service obligation to provide telephony service, the provision of broadband is based on a commercial model.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/10">There is nothing wrong with that, provided that the commercial model can deliver access to broadband. There is an inherent conflict if it is uncommercial for BT to deliver to a remote individual household because of the cost that would be involved in replacing the line. How does the Minister intend to square the circle of dealing with BT's commercial priorities and the Government's priority to deliver universal access?</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/11">The impact of lack of broadband is clear. I should like to use as an example one of my constituents who might be known to racing enthusiasts in the Chamber. He is the racehorse trainer, Henry Daly, who happens to be one of the largest employers on the outskirts of Ludlow, one of the main towns in my constituency. He employs some 65 people and, despite living within three or four miles of a relatively large exchange, does not have access to broadband and has been trying to get it for the past two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/12">All entries and declarations for races are available on the internet, which means that Mr Daly is unable to compete with trainers up and down the country to secure nominations for his horses, because he gets access to that information after everybody else. As a result, his horses do not always get high enough up the list to be able to be entered in the races for which they are best suited. That is a small example, but I think that will strike a chord with those who have an interest in racing. There is a clear competitiveness issue for people who are trying to do business in the countryside. There are also issues for people who wish to undertake adult learning from home. Schools have been connected, but we also need domestic connections.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/13">Finally, I should like to touch on some of the solutions being proposed, particularly by Advantage West Midlands, and to urge the Minister to find one that he favours. There is something called Rabit&mdash;the remote area broadband inclusion trial. I am not sure whether it is peculiar to Advantage West Midlands or a national solution. For businesses only, the regional development agency is funding grants to provide satellite delivery&mdash;up to the 512 kilobyte service&mdash;to qualifying businesses. For faster speeds, the grant has to be matched. In most cases, that means that a small business will have to find &pound;1,000 to secure the speed necessary for a proper, interactive service.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.5/14">I urge the Minister to tell us when he will extend a scheme such as Rabit to cover domestic premises, given the priority that he has given to enabling the entire country to have access to the service.</p>

	<p pid="b.463.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on having secured this important debate. I especially pleased to participate because, as you know, Mr. Jones, I come from a particularly rural area, and one that is known to the Minister as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/2">I have not had the experience that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> has had. Wales has been well served in terms of the extension of broadband&mdash;BT has worked hard with the Welsh Assembly. I was delighted to hear only this morning that the two telephone exchanges in my constituency that are not broadband enabled, Cyfylliog and Llannewydd, will be broadband enabled this year. The Assembly has done a good job in working with BT to extend broadband. I say that as a former member of the Assembly committee that pushed forward the broadband strategy for Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/3">However, my concern, which I think will be shared by many rural Members, is that the broadband that will be enabled in Wales will be first generation broadband. That is broadband at a far lower speed&mdash;from 512   kilobits per second to about 2 megabits per second&mdash;than will be available to the urban parts of the country that are being enabled with second generation broadband. That is the standard that is required if broadband is to have any meaningful application in the rural areas. Home Choice, a well known broadband television provider, has a minimum requirement of 4.3 megabits per second for TV drama, and as much as 5.6 megabits per second for sport, which will be well beyond the reach of those in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/4">The Minister may be able to comment on the matter, but it will be a considerable time before rural areas in Wales and elsewhere will be able to enjoy such speeds. Consequently, rural areas will be victims of the success that my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe mentioned. There will be a disparity between the quality of broadband enjoyed in urban areas and that in country areas; what might be called broadband poverty will be experienced in rural parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/5">Broadband is exciting; its potential is almost limitless. In fact, it is limited only by the imagination of those who seek to use it. However, without second generation access, people in rural areas will not be in a position to enjoy it.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe touched on a further problem: urban areas that are enabled to a higher degree of broadband far earlier, as they will be, and have the critical mass that will attract broadband operators will reap those rewards at the expense of rural areas whose populations are far too sparse to attract the operators of the new technology, which will inevitably be built on the broadband platform.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/7">None of us is talking down rural areas; quite the opposite, in fact. What we are doing&mdash;I think that all hon. Members present represent rural constituencies&mdash;is calling for the Minister and the Government to come up with some imaginative solutions that will ensure that rural areas enjoy the same quality and diversity of broadband that urban areas will shortly enjoy. I am concerned that if that is not done and we do not get second generation broadband sooner, and if something is not done to attract independent operators, rural areas will fall further behind.</p>
	<p pid="b.463.0/8">Broadband could revolutionise life in the countryside: it could provide educational facilities; its use in medical diagnosis could be invaluable; and, of course, its entertainment possibilities are well known. I believe that people in rural areas should be able to enjoy those facilities just as people in urban areas do, and I hope that the Government will come forward with imaginative solutions that will ensure that people in rural areas can enjoy the same degree of broadband that those in urban areas will shortly enjoy.</p>

	<p pid="b.464.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing the debate. Obviously, this is an important issue for a number of us who represent rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.0/2">I shall start on an upbeat note, to please the Minister if I possibly can, by telling hon. Members that the Welsh Assembly announced today that, working with BT, it intends to invest nearly &pound;100 million to ensure that the 35 exchanges in Wales not currently upgraded are upgraded in the near future. Nine of those exchanges&mdash;more than a quarter&mdash;are in my constituency. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> said, the simple fact that an exchange is upgraded does not necessarily mean that any number of the people served by it will benefit from broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.0/3">At the beginning of the IT revolution, the general opinion was that broadband would be a real advantage for rural areas, which could be part of the economic breakthrough, as businesses could be located in the deep countryside and bring strength to those communities. Instead, those areas are now even more disadvantaged than they were in the past. Not only have they had difficulty in getting broadband, or any degree of it, but a new generation of broadband is coming that will further disadvantage them.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.0/4">Can the Minister give us the definition of broadband? Is a minimum speed required to qualify? I think that BT sometimes plays fast and loose on this matter. A constituent of mine, David Barwick in Gladestry, had the mishap of being DACSed, which sounds quite painful. He explained to me that he was able to get broadband at 46 kilobits a second, which does not seem very broad to me, but that as a result of DACS&mdash;the digital access carrier system&mdash;his speed has gone down to 28 kilobits per second, which is almost useless. In that little community several energetic entrepreneurs could, if they had the right facilities, expand their businesses and be able to stay there and continue to operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.0/5">Broadband is only part of the communications problem for rural areas. A number of my constituents&mdash;I am sure that this applies in the constituencies of other hon. Members present&mdash;do not have mobile phone reception, and some do not have television reception. Some did not even have mains electricity until recently and had to use generators. They managed to get it at a cost of &pound;20,000 or &pound;30,000 per household. So, facilities that many people take for granted are not universally available to rural people.</p>
	<p pid="b.464.0/6">I am worried about the commitment of the communications industry, and BT in particular, to keeping up the infrastructure in rural areas. One problem is that copper wires, and in some cases aluminium wires, which are of even less use, are falling into disrepair. BT seems loth to renew them and bring them up to standard.</p>

	<p pid="b.465.0/1">Like the hon. Gentleman, I was given the impression that aluminium is a complete blockage and that it must be stripped out if it is an obstruction, but it is not an inhibitor in itself, although it has different characteristics from copper. There is a degree of confusion, and people need to go into detail where there is a problem with aluminium; it is not the complete problem that we believed it to be a few years ago.</p>

	<p pid="b.465.1/1">I thank the Minister for that. I am no expert on the technical aspects of this issue, but although I lack technical knowledge, even I can understand that it is not a good idea for BT to take its wires down off poles and put them on the tops of hedges. When the farmers come along in the autumn and cut the hedges, they do not do the cables much good. Constituents of mine in certain parts of Wales have been out of order for up to two weeks. For them, broadband seems a luxury beyond all aspiration compared with just having a telephone.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/2">Unless one has a decent line, one cannot get broadband. A number of my constituents who live quite close to upgraded exchanges have had the experience that was described earlier of ordering equipment and finding that they could not use it. Ministers in Wales have given a commitment to a roll-out right across Wales&mdash;I have the press release here&mdash;but even if every exchange were upgraded, that would not mean that broadband would become a universal facility for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/3">I shall conclude with a short account of a couple of my constituents' experiences. James Tenant in Ystradfellte is an able young man who wants to set up as a music producer, but he needs a large broadband capacity to do so. He has had grants from the local authority and the Assembly, but unless the new cable to Ystradfellte is optic fibre, he will have to move out of that community.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/4">Mary Myaya works as a freelance world health consultant in Colva, which is the centre of Radnorshire&mdash;almost the centre of the universe, as far as I am concerned. She cannot get broadband and tells me that she gets better access to it when she is working in Mozambique, which is the sixth poorest country in the world, than she does in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/5">To top things off, I tell hon. Members about Julian Salmon, who is the director of the Country Land and Business Association in Wales. He operates out of his farm in my constituency, and told me, of his attempts to access a service at home last Tuesday:</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/6" class="indent">&quot;After fifty-six minutes and losing the connection three times I abandoned the attempt.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.465.1/7">He then came to London and was able to complete the process in three or four minutes. That is the difference: some people have to try to operate businesses and conduct their lives in rural areas without broadband, and others have that facility.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.466.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1715" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="466"  time="015:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h03.htm#60315h03_spnew19">
	<p pid="b.466.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing this valuable debate. I apologise for missing part of his opening speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/2">I was fascinated by the question asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, which was, &quot;How do we define broadband?&quot; It is a key question, to which I shall return shortly. I realise that when people think of Milton Keynes they think of a city, but I am sure that many hon. Members realise that it is both a city and a rural community. As Milton Keynes expanded sideways, it isolated a large rural tip of what was Buckinghamshire and is now part of the unitary authority of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/3">In the short time available, I want to do three things. First, I want to explain the unique problems that Milton Keynes faces in accessing broadband. Secondly, I want to look at the options and why they seem to be failing to deliver the solution. Finally, I want to consider what is required to deliver broadband throughout Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/4">High-speed internet access and digital TV are two vital aspects of the information age and are directly linked. People who have access to such services will be better informed, better entertained and better employed. People who are left behind by the information age will be left behind, to an increasing extent, in modern life. Broadband is not just about game playing and video downloading; it is vital for the economic growth of Milton Keynes.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/5">Some residents and businesses in Milton Keynes still cannot get broadband at all. Some can get only an entry-level speed of 512 kilobits per second. It is particularly important for Milton Keynes to have an adequate data communications facility, because of the impact that it has on jobs. Both those who work in offices and professionals who work from home in the city and the rural community depend on data speeds that do not seem quaint and primitive to the rest of the country and the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/6">In Milton Keynes, we have a TV cable network that was the envy of the UK when it was built in the '60s and '70s. TV signals received on a big aerial were wired into every new home in the new city and in the rural community, together with some pioneering community TV channels. Although the original local channels were sadly short lived, I am delighted that the situation looks to be resolved when the much-wanted and much-needed MKTV is launched later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/7">The original technology was modern for its time, but not future-proofed. The original cabling is old and incapable of providing internet. BT's telephone lines, the most popular way of accessing the internet, are now either too long or too narrow to support the technology. That problem is made worse by their routing around the grid squares in the city.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/8">A new digital TV distribution network, providing digital TV to every home that receives TV on a communal analogue cable, would also be able to carry high-speed broadband. A digital network does not care what the content is. One member of the household could be watching a documentary on BBC 9, while another could be surfing the web. Another could be buying a video from a streaming video provider to watch over the weekend, or making a video-conference webcast to another head office in another country. Those are all data that can educate, inform, entertain and help Milton Keynes's residents in both the city and the rural community.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/9">When the area was first developed, in recognition of the fact that houses did not need aerials and that aerials are pretty unsightly if they are not necessary, areas of the then rural community were developed with covenants and restrictions so that most homes are not allowed to put an aerial on the roof. The special problem for Milton Keynes is that if home owners are not allowed to put up their own aerials and the TV cabling throughout the city cannot transmit digital TV, local people will have a problem if and when analogue TV stops being transmitted. If the Government are committed to the digital information age being made available to all citizens, not just those with the finances to buy their own solution, that problem could be used to everybody's advantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/10">That is the problem that we face in Milton Keynes. It is appalling for a dynamic, prosperous, high-tech rural and city community. I want now to turn to some of the proposals and explain why, regrettably, there is concern that they may not provide the solution. To its credit, BT has done a good job of getting entry-level broadband to many parts of the unitary authority that two years ago could not get it, although some areas cannot get any broadband. However, most areas cannot get the speed that most people are clamouring for.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/11">BT is focusing on its 21st century network&mdash;21CN&mdash;programme, which replaces the old telephone wire infrastructure with fibre-optic technology. Understandably, BT does not want to invest any more in the old telephone cabling, but 21CN is a long-term programme that will not be rolled out in Milton Keynes until at least 2010. That is where the link to digital TV returns.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/12">If a digital community TV service were to be wired to every home in the city, it would resolve the problems that BT is struggling with, replacing the '60s technology with modern technology. That is much the same for the rural community, which will of course soon become city in Milton Keynes. We have the grid-road cabling ducts and, largely, the right technology in the exchanges. The link into each home seems to be solvable. However, what is missing, from BT's point of view, is any public money to rewire the main trunking networks across the unitary authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/13">Perhaps the residents should look to other providers. One of the frustrations locally is the plethora of advertisements from other companies offering broadband to residents. Seeing a potential solution, residents ring, only to be disappointed. In that process, called local loop unbundling, a third party company takes over a phone line from BT. In practice, they use the same telephone wires that BT used, so we are still stuck with no or slow broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/14">Milton Keynes council has no direct responsibility to provide facilities for broadband, but it has been proactive in trying to find a wireless solution. I commend the council for that. However, the problem is that that technology, WiMAX, is still unproven. It is still being evaluated by the internet service providers. Although it is widely believed that wireless technology would be suited to the rural areas of Milton Keynes, it might not prove to be a Milton Keynes-wide solution and might not be appropriate for servicing large numbers of residents in higher-density areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/15">Before I look to the future, I want to mention Ofcom's involvement. There have been efforts to interest Ofcom in Milton Keynes's problems. However, the telecommunications regulator's remit for internet access is unimpressive. It simply has to ensure that all UK residents can get dial-up access at a speed of 28.8 kilobits per second&mdash;20 times slower than the slowest broadband. It seems incredible in 2006 that BT is not obliged to provide anything faster.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/16">I want to consider what might work in future. There is a strong belief that Milton Keynes's problems with broadband and digital TV can be resolved together. We need a credible, proven and sustainable alternative to BT in the form of a decent cable infrastructure. That would introduce real competition for the first time, spurring BT to raise its game. Such an infrastructure would require investment funding. The technology is nothing horrendous, merely an upgraded cable in an underground duct system that allows for technology changes. If it is replaceable, that will ensure that it is future-proof. If we make the ducts big enough, they can contain digital cable this year, optical fibre for the next 10 years and a future cable system beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="b.466.0/17">I have campaigned long and hard for &quot;I before E&quot;, or infrastructure before expansion, for Milton Keynes. Access to high-speed broadband is absolutely essential for a young, prosperous growing community that is the focus of the Government's sustainable communities project. I ask the Government to reconsider the specific issues faced by the community of Milton Keynes.</p>

	<p pid="b.469.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing the debate and on clearly outlining the problems faced by many rural areas, as well as their possible solutions. I recognise many of the problems that hon. Members have raised. I represent a large rural constituency, and BT has enabled all the exchanges for broadband&mdash;some of the bigger exchanges with its own money, and some of the smaller exchanges with money from the Scottish Executive. However, despite the exchanges being enabled for broadband, many people in the constituency face problems similar to those raised by other hon. Members, mainly because they are too far from the telephone exchange.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.0/2">Broadband opens up tremendous opportunities for those who are fortunate enough to be able to access it. The internet opens up opportunities for businesses, for education and for entertainment. However, many websites these days seem to have been designed on the assumption that most users have access to broadband at a fairly high data transfer rate. That means that users without broadband are often faced with a frustrating wait for websites to appear on their screen, or to download material from the internet. Many functions, such as accessing music or film clips, are simply impossible. The consequence is that many people in businesses who do not have broadband access are put at a tremendous disadvantage.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.0/3">Surveys reveal two big divides. One is between rich and poor; the other is between urban and rural areas. All 10 local authorities with the highest broadband take-up rate are in or just outside Greater London, whereas the authorities with the lowest take-up rate are in rural areas. Take-up rates vary between 25 broadband lines per 100 of population in Wandsworth and fewer than five in Na h-Eileanan an Iar. The discrepancy between urban and rural areas can be seen throughout Britain. Studies show that pupils with internet access tend to perform better than those without, so the discrepancy clearly has worrying implications for the education of children in remote areas who cannot access broadband from their home.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.0/4">The inability to access broadband from remote areas is also building up economic difficulties for rural areas. These days, access to broadband is vital to running a business from a rural area. A few years ago, there was a vision and a hope that, with the internet, it would be just as easy to run a business from a remote rural area as it was from a city centre. Sadly, we have found that that applies only to businesses that are close enough to a telephone exchange to be able to access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.0/5">The European Union and the Government are telling farmers that they must diversify. However, farms are, by their very nature, usually many miles from the nearest telephone exchange, so broadband access via a telephone line is simply not possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.469.1/1">Will the hon. Gentleman acknowledge that there are farming businesses that have been very enterprising and which are now running businesses in rural areas that probably could have been run only in the centre of London as recently as three or four years ago?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.470.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="470"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h03.htm#60315h03_spnew22">
	<p pid="b.470.0/1">The Minister is right that many farmers have been enterprising and have diversified, but I am sure that he would agree that there is a problem if farmers are too far from a telephone exchange to be able to access broadband. Satellite is one option, but it tends to be more expensive to run than working via a terrestrial line. Also, as we have heard, some functions are simply not possible via satellite.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/2">The Government, the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly have, to their credit, invested large amounts of money, and I pay tribute to them for that. The money has mostly been given to BT and has meant that the vast majority of people in the country and the vast majority of businesses are able to access broadband. However, some businesses and people have missed out. As was pointed out, the success for the vast majority of people in the country does mean problems for the small number of people in remote areas who cannot access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/3">According to the official statistics, 99.6 to 99.7 per cent. of households could access broadband using some form of terrestrial technology available on the mass market. However, that leaves some 200,000 people behind and, as we have heard&mdash;I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase> was the first to raise this&mdash;the anecdotal evidence is that far more people than that cannot access broadband. Hon. Members have raised another important question: what exactly is the official definition of broadband? As I said, the anecdotal evidence is that more than 200,000 people have problems when trying to access broadband.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/4">I did some research. In November 2003, a representative of the regulator, which at that time was Oftel, appeared before the Trade and Industry Committee. At that time, Oftel defined broadband as</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/5" class="indent">&quot;an always-on service with a minimum downstream capacity in excess of 128 kbit/s&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/6">Committee members expressed concern, as I am sure hon. Members will today, that 128 kilobits per second was far too low a transfer rate for a sensible definition of broadband. Research on the Ofcom website did not turn up a revision of the 128 definition. I shall therefore ask the Minister a question that other hon. Members have asked. Can he advise us what definition his Department uses to define broadband when it publishes its statistics showing that 99.7 per cent. of households can access broadband?</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/7">People who cannot access broadband because they live too far away from a telephone exchange, whether there are 200,000 such people or more, should not be excluded from the modern digital age. Clearly, the market alone will not provide them with access. Without Government, Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly intervention, there would not be as many enabled telephone exchanges as there are today. I think that, in Scotland, only one telephone exchange has still to be enabled. Despite that, at least 200,000 people do not have access. As I said, the market alone will not provide, so Government intervention is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/8">Previous generations brought roads, public transport, electricity and telephones to remote rural areas. Broadband, because of the education and employment opportunities that it brings, is not a luxury but an essential tool for the 21st century. I therefore look forward to the Minister's reply. I hope that he will say that the Government will sit down with the telecoms industry&mdash;obviously, that is mainly BT, but there are other telecoms providers&mdash;and the regulator to try to come up with a solution that will make broadband available to all in Britain, no matter where they live.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.471.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" speakername="Charles Hendry" colnum="471"  time="015:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h03.htm#60315h03_spnew23">
	<p pid="b.471.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the extremely thoughtful and thorough way in which he introduced it. We would all agree that it has been wide ranging. We have dealt with issues facing some of the most rural parts of these islands and have discussed how similar issues affect even the outskirts of some of our major new cities, such as Milton Keynes. We have even touched on broadband access in Mozambique, so we have covered global matters in a rural affairs debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/2">More importantly, the debate has been well informed. I hope that the Minister will accept that my hon. Friends' comments do not in any way seek to undermine the villages or rural communities in their constituencies. Rather, those comments arise from a passion to ensure that those communities are well represented. I believe that my hon. Friends won their seats&mdash;gained them, in many cases&mdash;because they had shown themselves to be doughty champions of those rural communities, standing up for and promoting them when they were doing good things, but not shying away from issues when they saw things that needed to be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/3">The 2006 UK broadband report, covering April to September 2005, stated that broadband is available to 99.7 per cent. of the UK, covering both residential and business users. That percentage means that one and a half constituencies in this country are not covered at all, which puts the issue in context. Listening to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" name="Stephen Crabb">the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Mr. Crabb)</phrase>, I wondered whether his was the one. Overall, however, we recognise how much has been done, although a quite significant element remains to be covered.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/4">The increase in coverage is largely a result of BT's commitment to increasing coverage to 99.6 per cent. of households by the summer of 2005. We all pay tribute to BT for achieving as much as it has. The comments in the debate should be seen in that context: we all recognise how much has been achieved, but attention needs to be given to what remains to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/5">Partnerships involving local government, the Northern Ireland Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly dealing with British Telecom to enable all exchanges have resulted in improved coverage in sparsely populated areas, and that has been achieved quicker than might have been expected. BT reports that that leaves just 80,000 telephone lines in remote areas without broadband access.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/6">As my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe said, broadband services are provided by one of three means: satellite or wireless; cable operators using the cable television network; and BT over its telephone lines. As he also said, however, there are concerns about whether satellite-based broadband services will be able to support new uses of the internet, specifically teleconferencing, telephony and video games. Perhaps the Minister can confirm the situation in that regard and the long-term picture.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/7">As my hon. Friend also said, cable operators in such a profit-conscious sector of the industry are unlikely to expand their coverage to 100 per cent. of rural areas owing to the lack of return available to them. It is therefore left to BT to complete the 100 per cent. coverage of UK communities, as it has committed to doing. We should recognise that the British record in rolling out broadband is certainly a good one, as the Minister reminded us. It compares extremely well with other nations, and Britain has one of the most developed broadband services anywhere in the world, probably including Mozambique, although it may lag behind some in terms of cost and speed. We have also heard that the very success of the British record puts those without broadband access at a distinct disadvantage. During the quarter ending in September 2005, broadband connections totalled 8.9 million, which marked a 12 per cent. increase in new subscriptions over the previous quarter and a 25 per cent. increase since the end of March 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/8">We all recognise that information communication technology has a vital part to play as part of the Lisbon strategy in making Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. However, for that to happen, we must ensure that rural communities are not left out.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/9">British Telecom states that in my county of East Sussex 99.8 per cent. of households now have access to broadband. Through a public-private partnership, East Sussex county council has promoted the advantages of broadband and achieved 28.1 per cent. take-up in September. It is forecast to achieve 30 per cent. by December, which is ahead of the 28 per cent target for the end of this year. I hope that the Minister will accept that it is no wonder that that Conservative-controlled county council has received national awards for its highly successful programme, especially when the broadband take-up just 18 months ago was a mere 5 per cent. Just as we have been willing to accept what the Government have done, I hope that he will be willing to recognise what a Conservative county council has achieved. However, highly commendable as the figures are, they show that a small minority in my constituency, as in those of other hon. Members, continues to be left out.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/10">Serious concerns have rightly been raised about rural communities that do not have access to good internet services. It is harder for rural communities that lack good internet access to attract and retain jobs. The report following the symposium on remote and rural communications was published in June 2005. The symposium found that because of their location remote and rural areas had a high demand for communications services. It also found that there was a strong perception of the digital divide between urban and rural areas. It questioned how quick the trickle-down effect of the benefits of service innovation would be to rural areas. There was concern that more remote communities would always be in catch-up mode with their urban counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/11">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs looked at broadband in rural areas, and its 2005 report, &quot;ICT in England's Rural Economies&quot; concluded that the</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/12" class="indent">&quot;lack of availability had been the key barrier to adoption for broadband in rural areas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/13">Among businesses with internet access, 60 per cent. use broadband in urban areas, whereas only 41 per cent. do so in rural areas. There is a significant disparity in usage. The report found that rural businesses are playing catch-up now that broadband is more widely available and that the perception of broadband availability appears to be lagging behind the reality in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/14">However, it is clear that broadband connectivity speeds are lower in rural areas, with businesses being more likely to use basic broadband services. Of urban business broadband users, 63 per cent. have connectivity rates faster than 512 kilobits per second, whereas that is the case for only 37 per cent. of rural businesses. When the Minister replies, I should be grateful if he would relate that to compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, which clearly requires people to be given greater access to all services. Last weekend, I viewed the work being done by a company in my constituency. Internet Architects have been doing fantastic work for the National Trust, enabling it to comply with the legislation by providing virtual tours of some of its properties. However, if people do not have access to broadband, they cannot download virtual tours. Perhaps the Minister will explain what has happened about compliance under the disability discrimination laws.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/15">There is clearly a different picture in different parts of the country. Northern Ireland was the first region in Europe to have 100 per cent. broadband coverage. The Northern Ireland experience resulted in tangible results on the economy and on jobs, including teleworking, and there were particular benefits for female and part-time workers and for carers.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/16">Scotland has achieved similar success. As we have heard, the Scottish Executive undertook an open procurement exercise, which aimed to deliver affordable broadband access to every Scottish community by the end of 2005. Only one small area is outstanding. The strategy saw the Scottish population's access to affordable broadband rise from 43 per cent. at the launch to more than 93 per cent. in February 2005. We should recognise that that covers some of the most remote parts of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/17">If Scotland and Northern Ireland have achieved 100 per cent. coverage, the coverage in England must be lower than the 99.7 per cent. achieved throughout the country as a whole. We heard about progress in Wales from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> and from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" name="David Jones">the Member for Clwyd, West (Mr. Jones)</phrase>. We heard about the progress, but my hon. Friend the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire stated clearly that significant improvements are needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/18">I have sympathy with the comments made by my hon. Friends the Members for Preseli Pembrokeshire and for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne) that it is not good enough to apply for broadband with all the headache and heartache that goes with that only to be told later that it will not be possible. People want certainty and to know that when they start on the process, they will be told what the situation really is. We should all try to ensure that people have greater certainty of what is available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/19">Currently, 69 per cent. of UK firms use broadband and 30 per cent. of micro-businesses trade online. Approximately 73 per cent. of businesses provide information about products and services online. That will increase significantly when the Company Law Reform Bill comes into effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/20">My hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe, who opened the debate, identified the key issues. What analysis has the Minister made of where those rural communities without broadband access are concentrated, and what is his Department doing to assist broadband provision in rural areas? What role does he see for the key players&mdash;regional development authorities, Openreach, Ofcom and the Department of Trade and Industry&mdash;in addressing the issues, and what can he do to bring them together to move that forward?</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/21">The Minister will be well aware that our rural communities are going through a period of transition. Old businesses, such as pubs, shops and garages, are closing, but exciting and dynamic new businesses are opening up, including voluntary organisations. That successful transition depends on having access to the most advanced technology available. If those businesses are to compete and operate effectively, they need broadband access quickly. I hope that the Minister will explain how that can happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/22">My hon. Friend the Member for Ludlow quoted from a letter from the Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase> which said:</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/23" class="indent">&quot;Stimulating broadband availability across the whole of the UK is a Government priority. We want to see all communities, irrespective of location, having access to an affordable broadband service from a competitive market.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/24">I hope that the Minister can tell us now how he plans to achieve that goal.</p>

	<p pid="b.474.0/1">It is a particular pleasure to sit under your chairmanship this afternoon, Mr. Jones, but it must be frustrating for you, given your interest in science and technology and the fact that you have passionately and successfully represented a rural area for as long as I have been in Parliament. I am almost as frustrated because while I want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> on raising a subject about which I am a great enthusiast, it is frustrating to find that I would need special, high-speed broadband and a new form of multi-streaming that would probably defeat even the excellence of our <i>Hansard</i> writers to fit in all that I want to say in response to the many points that have been raised on a highly technical issue. I undertake to write to all hon. Members who have taken part in the debate setting out my response in more detail, which may help them in responding to local issues raised by their constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/2">I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> acknowledged our success in delivering rural broadband. It is a new experience for me to be criticised by Conservative Members for being too successful with something, but with the new spirit of honest debate perhaps it will happen more often.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/3">My plea about not talking down rural areas was very much in the same spirit as the response of the hon. Member for Wealden. I did not think that any hon. Members intended to do that, but it is a danger if we focus on difficulties that relate to a very small percentage of those who might want to take up broadband, and give the impression that rural areas are somehow a no-go area. During my four years as Minister for Rural Affairs, I saw an enormous burgeoning of activities carried out in rural areas by small, successful and dynamic businesses taking the initiative and taking the opportunities offered by broadband access. I want us to focus on the difficult areas that hon. Members have mentioned and on talking up the economic capacity provided and the opportunities for rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/4">In other words, we should be ambitious for the success of rural businesses. The hon. Member for Wealden was right when he talked about take-up lagging behind, probably for reasons of perception. There has been a catching-up&mdash;the figures show that there has been an acceleration in the take-up of broadband in rural areas&mdash;but initially the fact that people did not believe it would be provided was an obstacle. Of course, the succession of events must be to allow access by enabling people to take up broadband, to get them to take it up, get them to use it and get them use the whole range of capacity available to them. Many people are using only a small percentage of the capacity of broadband or their computers, and we must expand that usage.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/5">In passing, I have to say I was rather surprised to hear some Opposition Members seeming to call for public handouts to solve some of the problems that are actually being solved by the market and a strong partnership between business and the Government. Indeed, during the past four or five years we have seen an excellent story, which has shown the capacity of business, local communities, small businesses and social enterprises to solve problems that at one stage seemed insurmountable in order to transform totally access to broadband in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/6">As several hon. Members acknowledged, we have a great deal to be proud of in the United Kingdom. The Government set an ambitious target of having the most extensive broadband coverage in the G7 by the end of 2005 and met that target by June 2005, with 99 per cent. of households having access to at least one broadband technology solution, and with more than 50 per cent. having access to more than one. If there is time, I shall return to those figures. In addition, the UK is ranked first on regulatory environment and has one of the most competitive broadband markets in the G7.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/7">I come to the debate with some knowledge of the history because four years ago, when I was Minister for Rural Affairs, most people regarded the likelihood of delivering widespread broadband as an unattainable dream. I am pleased to have the chance to pay tribute to those at Department of Trade and Industry who responded vigorously to the challenge. One of my predecessors, who is now the Minister for Pensions Reform, established a joint DTI and Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs rural broadband unit, running a &pound;30 million broadband fund for the regions, and the DTI team, led by Stephen Speed, devoted significant time to persuading operators to roll out broadband to rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/8">I was pleased when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> said the enabling of exchanges is no longer an issue. It certainly was an issue at that point, and I remember well some local campaigns aimed at getting enough people to sign up for broadband to get the numbers past the threshold for particular exchanges. I acknowledged the success of &quot;Switch on Shropshire&quot;, which built on the example of my then Parliamentary Private Secretary, Peter Bradley, who joined forces with what was then the Country Landowners Association. A combination of a Labour MP and the CLA may not be what people might expect, but it was a successful partnership in getting people to want to sign up, which challenged BT to deliver as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/9">BT also responded to the challenge of providing broadband infrastructure. When I first went to DEFRA, the figures for some exchanges were not being provided, which meant that we did not know what the target was in a particular rural town or village. Fairly early after his arrival, I met Pierre Danone, the head of BT Wholesale, and it became clear very quickly that Ben Verwaayen, in taking over BT, had changed the culture to one that asked, &quot;How do we solve the problems and provide the service?&quot; instead of, &quot;How do we explain to you why we cannot do what you want to do?&quot; That change has led to some of the comments made, quite rightly, by hon. Members about the changed performance of BT in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/10">Comparisons have been made with other services, such as the electricity supply. I have to say that the last remote farmhouse in England received an electricity supply only recently. I remember the excitement 40 years ago with which Taid Mon, my grandfather in Anglesey, received an electricity supply for the first time because, at last, the electricity supply had got close enough to his small cottage for the connection to be affordable and economic.</p>
	<p pid="b.474.0/11">Recent market research shows that there are more than 10 million broadband connections in the UK, which represents a 41 per cent. growth since March 2005, providing the UK with more connections than any other European country.</p>

	<p pid="b.476.1/1">I have said that I will respond to any point, and to supplementary points from individuals, but I want to cover as many of the questions as I can.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.1/2">A question was asked about the breakdown of the 99 per cent. figure. I understand that the BT claim refers to UK households connected to enabled exchanges. A question was raised about public money going to BT. Where that has happened, it has happened as a result of competitive tendering to upgrade facilities that BT considered not to be economically viable. It is also important to acknowledge that many factors, such as home wiring, can affect performance of digital subscriber lines, which provide DSL broadband access.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.1/3">In relation to the questions asked by the hon. Member for Wycombe in his introduction, the problem is that there is no detailed analysis of the 0.2 per cent. figure to which we both referred, except in the region-by-region analysis of what is thought to be the nature of the problem. The matter only comes to light when a request for a DSL is attempted, and it is discovered that the line is one of the few that has a problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.1/4">On the commitment of the DTI, we are leading the broadband debate. We are pursuing solutions with operators and we greatly welcome the sort of interest expressed by hon. Members today. Once we get past the national and regional issues, the matter often amounts drilling down to discover where the specific problems are&mdash;they may be in an individual line or a very small locality&mdash;and finding solutions to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.1/5">Regional development agencies and devolved Administrations have supported a variety of projects such as Fibrespeed in Wales, Cybermoor, Digital Region and &quot;Act Now&quot; in Cornwall, to which I referred earlier. &quot;Act Now&quot; was a particular success story that received objective 1 funding and experienced another of the consequences of success, when villages just outside the defined area for the pilot project got very aerated about the fact that they were not involved and campaigned to be included. In the end, a much bigger area was enabled without additional expenditure and there was a considerable extension of take-up, which is one of the reasons why BT realised there was a bigger market than had been anticipated in some of the low-population rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.1/6">RDA, devolved Administration and local government intervention requires careful consideration of the impact in relation to market failure. We should not invest money if the market is able to supply the service, but on the other hand, it is appropriate to invest where there are clear market failures. Indeed, organisations such as the Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly have identified such places as appropriate ones in which to intervene.</p>
	<p pid="b.476.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">The hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> asked about the figures given by the Countryside Alliance. I am afraid that it is beyond my remit to answer for the Countryside Alliance, an organisation which, as we know from its public opinion surveys, is arithmetically challenged in the extreme. As far as I am aware, there are no figures that provide the answer to the question, so I have no clue where the Countryside&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.478.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" speakername="John Stanley" colnum="478"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h04.htm#60315h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.478.1/1">When I applied for this debate on the acute water scarcity that we in Kent face, I said to myself, &quot;I guarantee from the moment this debate is granted, the heavens are going to open,&quot; which they promptly did. I am glad that the debate has achieved at least one thing, a short period of rainfall in Kent, but I should like to make it clear to the House and to the Minister that the limited amount of rain in the past few days will make no material difference to the serious water supply situation that we face in our county.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/2">The water supply situation in Britain varies enormously from region to region. As we know, the region that is facing much the most serious situation is the south-east, following two exceptionally dry winters. Last month's Environment Agency publication, &quot;Drought prospects 2006&quot;, stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Across south east England, rainfall over the last 16 months has been much lower than for the same period in 1974&ndash;76, and in some places it is the lowest since 1921. Continued dry weather through the spring and into the summer would give us one of the most serious droughts of the last hundred years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/4">Last month, the Environment Agency called on all water companies in the south-east to introduce hosepipe bans. The agency's chief executive, Barbara Young, gave a dire and serious warning on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-24">24 February</phrase>. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/5" class="indent">&quot;If water companies delay introducing hosepipe bans now, extreme steps to manage water supplies over the summer may be needed, such as standpipes and rota cuts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/6">This week, the largest water supply company in the south-east and indeed in Britain, Thames Water, with 8 million customers, announced an indefinite ban on hosepipes and sprinklers from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April</phrase>. It is the first such ban that the company has had to announce for 15 years, indicating the severity of the situation in its area.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/7">If the water supply situation is bad in the south-east in general, it is worst of all in Kent and some areas of Sussex. They are in the worst position in the worst affected region. The briefing note that Southern Water supplied to me for this debate illustrates the position in Kent and at the Bewl reservoir, which is very close to my constituency. The briefing says:</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/8" class="indent">&quot;Bewl Water, the largest reservoir in the South East, which provides water to Southern Water, Mid Kent and indirectly to South East Water is only 53 per cent. full (this is the lowest level it has ever been this time of the year), normally, we would expect it to be 97 per cent. full at this time of year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/9">The largest reservoir in Kent and in the south-east is effectively only half full&mdash;unprecedentedly low.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/10">The aquifer position is no better. Southern Water's briefing says:</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Groundwater levels in the major aquifers in the South East of England, which support approximately 70 per cent. of public water abstraction are all below average. Some are approaching historic minimum levels.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/12">In addition, the position in the eastern part of the county has been well reported. Folkestone and Dover Water Services has had to become the first water company in Britain to apply for and receive &quot;water scarcity status&quot; under the Water Industry Act 1999. The Government have granted it, enabling Folkestone and Dover Water Services to become the first company to introduce to its area compulsory water metering. It clearly demonstrates the severity of the situation that we face in the south-east and, particularly, in Kent.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/13">I should like to raise several issues with the Minister. First, we have had two exceptionally dry winters in succession. During the winter months, the crucial restoration and replenishment of water supply to reservoirs and aquifers is due. There is an important question to pose to the Government and the water companies, to which it is crucial to obtain the right answer&mdash;as can best be foreseen. We have effectively experienced a semi-drought in Kent and parts of the south-east during the past 18 months. Is it freak, one-off climate change, or is it evidence of a long-term and more permanent move to more arid conditions in the south-east and Kent as a result of climate change?</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/14">Day by day, as the evidence is constantly and rightly put before us, we all see that the predictions about the rate of climate change have if anything been understatements. The rate at which, for example, the Greenland ice cap is melting exceeds almost everybody's previous predictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/15">It is demonstrable that, with Kent's existing water resources, we are already at the tipping point of standpipes and rota cuts. That is after just two winters of semi-drought. If that is the position after just two winters, we are wholly inadequately prepared for something that will continue for a much longer period. Its potentially extraordinarily serious consequences may not be too far around the corner for people living in Kent and elsewhere in the south-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/16">From the scientific and meteorological advice that the Minister receives, what is the best judgment about the climate change that Kent has experienced during the past 18 months? Is it a one-off situation that is likely to reverse, or is it evidence of a much more permanent climate situation in the south-east and Kent? There will be serious consequences if it is the latter.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/17">The second issue that I want to raise with the Minister is about the relationship between water supply in Kent and the Government's plans for development, particularly residential development, in the county. The Government want to carry out a major expansion of population in the south-east. It is a controversial decision that a number of us contest strongly. The position as of today is that, at the Government's instigation, the South East England regional assembly has approved in principle 578,000 new homes in Kent, Surrey, Sussex, Berkshire, Hampshire, Oxfordshire and the Thames gateway by 2026. Many questions are being asked in Kent and elsewhere about whether the water supply is adequate to support that huge population influx.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/18">The Minister made a water-focused visit to Essex recently&mdash;on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase>, I think. He visited a new house in Heybridge, which apparently had water-saving fittings. He said that the Government's plans for hundreds of thousands of new properties would still go ahead. Therefore, I must ask him the following question: if with the existing population in Kent and elsewhere in the south-east we are already on the tipping edge of having standpipes and rota cuts, how on earth will the south-east be able to cope with 500,000 more houses&mdash;the figure is of course substantially higher if one adds up the extra adults and children? How are we going to cope in water terms with the huge development expansion that the Government propose? I see no sense at all in concentrating such a huge additional residential development in the driest part of our country, when the water position is already very serious.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/19">The next issue I wish to raise is regional disparities in the United Kingdom. I understand that moving large quantities of water about is an expensive and difficult business; it is much more problematic than moving around electricity and even gas. However, there are great regional disparities in respect of water. What are the Government's policies for gradually removing those disparities, for establishing what would effectively be some sort of national water grid, and for putting in place the infrastructure to enable water to be moved about more freely between different regions? That would create greater equality of treatment and fairness for water customers in the different regions of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/20">I turn now to capacity and, so far as Kent is concerned, to the issue of reservoirs in particular. We need additional capacity in Kent, or additional capacity that is accessible from Kent. For this debate, I went through the ever-growing files in my office on water supply, and I came across a leaflet that was produced 15 years ago&mdash;in December 1991. It is entitled, &quot;Water for the future in Kent; development plans&quot;. It was a summary leaflet for public consumption produced by the consulting engineers to three of the leading water companies in Kent. They were looking into the future of water supply in Kent on behalf of Mid Kent Water, Southern Water and what was then called the Folkestone and District Water Company and is now called Folkestone and Dover Water Services.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/21">In the section referring to the then proposed major new reservoir development at Broad Oak, that 15-year-old leaflet stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/22" class="indent">&quot;The promotion of Broad Oak water will be continued. No other major resource has been identified which will meet the remaining water supply needs in the companies' areas economically for the next 30 years.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/23">It continued, extraordinarily prophetically:</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/24" class="indent">&quot;Water supply from Broad Oak water will be needed between 2000 and 2005&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/25">That was bang on the nail. The reality is that no progress whatever has been made in bringing into being Broad Oak water&mdash;or, indeed, in establishing other major additional reservoir capacity in Kent. What is the Government's position on establishing further reservoir capacity in Kent, on Broad Oak, and on the plans that I believe exist for increasing the capacity of Bewl, which is one of the largest reservoirs we have?</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/26">My next topic is desalination. You might be as amazed as I am, Mr. Jones, that I have to raise that matter. It is extraordinary to me that in our country, which over the years has produced more jokes about rainfall than any other country, we should now be having to talk about desalination plants in the UK. I know from the briefing I had from South East Water that it is now running a trial desalination plant on the Sussex coast. What is the Government's position on going down the desalination route? Is that now thought to be necessary to ensure that we have adequate water supplies? It is costly, but there is huge potential capacity in desalinating the sea to produce fresh water.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/27">On compulsory metering, Folkestone and Dover Water Services now has water scarcity status, which enables it to introduce compulsory water metering. Does the Minister think that all the water companies in Kent and elsewhere in the south-east should be going down that route? Is he positively soliciting applications from the water companies to his Department? Are the Government in favour now of introducing compulsory water metering in the south-east generally? What steps do they propose to take to ensure that those on low incomes&mdash;pensioners and low-income families&mdash;are able to get assistance with the installation of water meters if they are made compulsory as a result of their water company being given water scarcity status?</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/28">We all know that one of the most effective ways of increasing water capacity is by stopping the water leaking into the ground and disappearing for good, but a substantial amount of leakage still takes place. However, there is always a cost-benefit equation in respect of leaks; some leaks are so small that the cost of stemming them is too great for it to make sense to spend the money to do so. How well&mdash;or otherwise&mdash;does the Minister think the water companies in Kent are doing in terms of leaks? Inevitably, when one asks the water companies about their leaks programmes and whether they are doing all they can to stop leaks, they all reply, &quot;Well, we're busting our guts to deal with leaks.&quot; That is of course the company position, and one would expect the company's representatives to repeat it, but does the Minister think that the Kent water companies are doing all they reasonably can to deal with leaks? If not, it would be helpful if he were to identify which of the companies are not doing sufficiently well and could do more.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/29">I also have a few comments to make on changing lifestyles. We all have a responsibility to try to conserve water. I was struck by one amazing statistic from South East Water: if all 19 million customers in south-east England turned off the tap when they brushed their teeth, we would save 380 million litres of water every day. I found that statistic staggering; I trust that South East Water has it right. It illustrates how, with a relatively small change of lifestyle, we could make the water available go much further. I should like to know what support and publicity the Government are prepared to put behind making the lifestyle changes necessary to make water go further.</p>
	<p pid="b.478.1/30">In conclusion, we face a serious situation in Kent. It would be totally unacceptable if later this year we turned on the taps in Kent and found that nothing was coming out, if people were made to go to standpipes to collect water for their homes and if mains water were switched off by rota for several hours. My constituents and many others would think the Government extraordinarily incompetent in allowing such a situation to arise, and I would have every sympathy with that view.</p>

	<p pid="b.481.0/1">It is nice to see you in the Chair this afternoon, Mr. Jones.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/2">I was interested in what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1877" name="John Stanley">the right hon. Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley)</phrase> had to say, and I congratulate him on securing this debate on a very important issue. I also congratulate him on being able to pull information from a file that goes back to 1991&mdash;I wish I could keep files in my office for that long. His archive must be very impressive.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/3">The issues raised by the right hon. Gentleman are clearly important. I agreed with just about everything he said until the very last bit of his speech; it was a bit harsh to suggest that the Government can control the weather. We can control a few things, but periodic droughts are not among them.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/4">Not unreasonably, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether we were seeing a trend, and whether droughts are a long-term issue. It is fair to say that they are not a new phenomenon. There have been a number of them over the years, and it is likely that we shall have them in future. However, we cannot be complacent; we know that climate change is a reality. There may well be issues of water supply in the south-east, and we have to address them in our plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/5">I shall outline the kind of measures that are in place. All water companies, including those that serve the right hon. Gentleman's constituency, are obliged by law to have drought plans. They have to have such provisions as a contingency plan, so that, when there are periods of drought, they are prepared and can ensure that people's water supply is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/6">Although water resources are very low, I would not argue that we were in a crisis. Water reserves need to be maintained carefully and companies are right to apply hosepipe and sprinkler bans. Sprinklers use enormous quantities of water and, in mid-Kent, bans have been in place since last summer&mdash;quite a long time. Hosepipe and sprinkler bans are under the companies' control. It is entirely up to them when they introduce them.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/7">The companies have to apply for drought permits and emergency drought orders as part of their contingency planning and drought plans. They can also make applications for permits to abstract additional water, for example. That is being done in the case of Bewl reservoir; additional water is being abstracted from the River Medway during the winter period to bring up the supply. I appreciate that the reservoir is only about half full, but that is a big improvement on its levels earlier this winter.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/8">The right hon. Gentleman was correct: this winter has been exceptionally dry. He was also right to say that, in some parts of the south-east, recorded rainfall has been at its lowest level since 1921, and that such low levels could develop into one of the most serious droughts of the past 100 years. Whether they do depends on whether there are higher than average rainfalls between now and the summer, and that is difficult to predict. We have to take issues of drought management into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/9">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned the expansion of the number of homes. That issue is often raised with me. Given that there are issues of supply management now, it is not unreasonable of people to ask what will happen in future, when there will have been a big expansion in the number of homes. There is a need for additional homes in his area. As he stated, that has been recognised by the regional assembly. We will, of course, have to ensure that there is the infrastructure for water, among other things, to provide for that expansion. All water companies are obliged to have a 25-year forward plan to anticipate increased demand. They may well have to make additional investment to boost their reserves and to ensure that they can meet that demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/10">There is an issue of managing the demand for water resources. New homes are designed to be much more water efficient. The average new home built now is about 30 per cent. more water efficient than existing ones. There is more that we can do&mdash;we can label products, for example. A lot of dishwashers and washing machines are much more efficient than those of the past. Simple measures can be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/11">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned a house that I visited. As an experiment, each of its rooms were metered as part of looking at the issue of supply management. The company told me that water consumption was cut significantly by such things as low-pressure shower heads, low-pressure taps and dual flush systems in the toilet. The modest additional cost of such water-saving measures was about &pound;50 to &pound;60.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/12">As the right hon. Gentleman said, there are issues to do with not wasting water, and I shall touch on them as well. It is true that there are plans for a new reservoir at Broad Oak, and that is obviously part of the forward look that the companies involved need to take. There are also plans to raise the banks at Bewl; just raising banks can significantly increase capacity. That option is attractive because no planning permission for building a brand new reservoir is required, although it would probably have to go through the planning process, and it is comparatively easy to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/13">There are a number of applications for desalination plants in the south and south-east. The Government view is that such plants have downsides. They are very energy-intensive, and we have to take that into account. However, they are being considered, although not necessarily as a means of providing a constant supply of water. There are peaks of water demand, just as there are peaks of energy demand, and a desalination plant could be switched on for the peak period and then switched off, so that its energy use would be minimised.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/14">We have to consider desalination plants as part of a range of measures, which include man management, supply management and addressing rates of leakage, which was rightly mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman. Such measures also involve considering whether water transfer within regions can be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/15">We have asked the Environment Agency to consider the idea of a national grid, but there are downsides to that. It would be very costly, the water would have to be pumped around, which would be very energy intensive, and there would be lots of environmental issues around building the pipelines. There might well be less environmental impact and it might well be more cost-effective if water supply reserves in a region were improved, rather than putting the money into a national grid. However, we do not rule such things out. It is important to have an open mind on how we address such measures and to weigh up the arguments for and against them.</p>
	<p pid="b.481.0/16">There has been no change to the Government's policy on national compulsory meters. There is not an argument for a national approach. As the right hon. Gentleman said, under the Water Acts, there are provisions for water-scarce areas. Companies have the right to bring forward proposals and we will consider those on their merits. I do not know whether any other proposals are being put forward. Following a manifesto commitment, we recently set up the water saving group, which I chair, as the Minister responsible. That has brought the whole industry together. One of the things that we will consider is how we can raise awareness in the way that the right hon. Gentleman rightly suggested, and how we can get the message over to people that simple steps can be taken to cut water demand. We want to work with the industry on how to address both supply and demand management.</p>

	Rowing Safety
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.485.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1380" speakername="David Heyes" colnum="485"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h05.htm#60315h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="b.485.1/1">I am grateful for having been granted this debate. My purpose in seeking it was to draw to the attention of my right hon. Friend the Minister for Sport and his ministerial colleagues the dismal failure of the Amateur Rowing Association safely to regulate its sport. That failure is putting young lives at risk. I hope to encourage my right hon. Friend to recognise that the time has come for the Government to intervene and, if necessary, to legislate to ensure proper safety standards in the sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/2">I start by outlining the reason for my interest in the matter. My constituents Jane and Stephen Blockley first approached me in August 2002. Their son Leo died in a tragic rowing accident. He drowned in the River Ebro while rowing with the Oxford university lightweight rowing club at its winter training camp in Amposta, Spain, in December 2000. Leo Blockley was 21 years old.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/3">Leo's crew, the crew of another eight from the club, and two launches carrying their coaches ran into adverse weather conditions during a training session. The water was described as only &quot;slightly choppy&quot; at the start of the outing, but the weather changed suddenly. Leo's boat was quickly swamped by 2-ft waves and, lacking inherent buoyancy, it began to sink, forcing the crew into the water. Four of the crew, including Leo, became separated from the boat. After initially trying to swim for the bank, the four realised that the waves and currents would prevent them from reaching the shore. Two were successful in their attempt to return to the partially submerged boat, and another eventually made it to the bank. Little over 50 m from the rowing club from which they had embarked, Leo disappeared as he attempted to swim back to the boat.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/4">The other Oxford university eight rowing on the river at the same time sank twice on its way back to shore, but eventually made it. While all that was happening, the coaches on the two launches were unable to offer the help that they might normally be expected to give. One of the launches got into difficulty when a rope fouled the propeller; it was blown against the bank and became wedged under a branch. The second launch went to help the first, sending the vulnerable eights back upstream alone. As a result of the outing, nine people were treated for exposure and hypothermia and 14 suffered exposure and shock. The significance of staying with the boat and of hypothermia are matters to which I will return.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/5">When I first met Jane and Stephen Blockley, the first inquest into the death of their son had already taken place and a verdict of accidental death due to drowning returned. The facts that I have outlined so far surrounding the accident were all confirmed in the coroner's court. At the time, the Blockleys had begun a high-profile and effective campaign to raise awareness of the need for boat buoyancy. Their simple aim, which was shared by others involved in the campaign, was to do all that they could to prevent anyone else from dying in a similar accident in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/6">At our first meeting, all the Blockleys asked of me was support for their campaign to ensure that all rowing boats be required to have in-built buoyancy. However, as they pursued that goal, they encountered unexpected resistance from the national governing body for the sport, the Amateur Rowing Association. Their attempts to engage the ARA in a debate on buoyancy were consistently blocked. Correspondence between the Minister and the ARA, and from the ARA to my constituents, led to a growing suspicion on the part of the Blockleys that the original investigation and first inquest had not been presented with all the facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/7">The ARA's five-page response to the Minister's inquiries came from Gary Harris, the deputy chairman of the ARA, in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2002-12-24">24 December 2002</phrase>. It would appear that the Minister was satisfied with the version of events presented by Mr. Harris; having seen that letter, I can understand why that might have been so.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/8">In his letter Mr Harris says:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The principal reason Leo Blockley died was that he swam away from the boat.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/10">Mr. Harris did not tell the Minister that the ARA water safety code did not contain any advice about staying with the boat. One of the survivors referred in evidence to being swept away from the boat. It was later established that, in the terrible conditions of unexpectedly high winds, 2-ft waves and strong river currents, becoming separated from the boat was not a matter of choice.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/11">At the first inquest the coroner had been clear about the &quot;stay with the boat&quot; rule, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Hindsight is a wonderful thing, but none of us here can make comment on what people do in sudden terrifying circumstances&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/13">For the Blockleys, the ARA's insistence that its &quot;stay with the boat&quot; safety advice would have prevented Leo's death seemed tantamount to blaming Leo for his own death. The important lesson that seemed to have been missed was that, had his boat been fully buoyant, he would not have been in the water in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/14">Alarmingly, at the time of that correspondence between the Minister, the Blockleys and the ARA, Mr. Harris had new evidence about the incident that he did not disclose to the Minister. Indeed, he did not disclose it to the coroner until June 2005, two and a half years later. Meanwhile, the Blockleys investigated further and discovered significant new evidence, much of it concerning lack of safety training and safety planning. That new evidence was so compelling that the south Manchester coroner, Mr. John Pollard, applied to the administrative court to have his original inquest into the death of Leo Blockley set aside.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/15">A second inquest began on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-07">7 October 2005</phrase>, during which several people gave evidence that the head coach, Leila Hudson, was either drunk or hung-over or both at the time of the accident. The coroner, Mr. Pollard, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/16" class="indent">&quot;the evidence before me clearly shows that there was what might be called a conspiracy, although more accurately should be called an agreement, by a large number of senior officers and senior advisors at the Oxford University lightweight Rowing Club that they would not make publicly known the suggestion that the Head Coach, Leila Hudson, had been suffering from the effects of alcohol at the time of Leo Blockley's death&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/17">The coroner further commented:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/18" class="indent">&quot;it is a matter of great regret that they felt that the reputation of the rowing club was of greater importance than a full and thorough investigation into the death of a young man who had drowned following participation in a club activity&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/19">Mr. Pollard decided that the issues raised by the case could not be adequately covered by a short verdict like accidental death, and he decided to issue a narrative verdict, which gave him more scope for comment. During the second inquest Mr. Pollard identified several contributory safety issues not adequately covered&mdash;or not covered at all&mdash;in the current ARA water safety code. Consequently, he chose to write a rule 43 letter to the ARA. Mr. Pollard explains the significance of a rule 43 letter thus:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/20" class="indent">&quot;A Coroner who believes that action should be taken to prevent the recurrence of fatalities similar to those that in respect of which the Inquest is being held may announce at the Inquest that he is reporting the matter in writing to the person or authority who may have power to take such action and he may report the matter accordingly.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/21">Mr. Pollard's rule 43 letter refers to another rule 43 letter issued by the Berkshire coroner in connection with the inquest into the death of 15-year-old Sikander Farooq, who died in January 2005 when his single sculling boat capsized in the River Thames near his Reading rowing club. Sikander drowned having become overwhelmed by the cold after trying to carry out the ARA capsize drill, which at the time took no account of the fact that in the UK inland water temperatures are always cold enough to put people's lives at risk when they are immersed. The Berkshire coroner's rule 43 letter refers to concerns about the wearing of buoyancy aids in training and to evidence given by a junior coach at Reading rowing club that there was peer pressure on juniors not to wear buoyancy aids.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/22">In his rule 43 letter, Mr. Pollard says:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/23" class="indent">&quot;It would seem that the wearing of personal buoyancy aids could add a degree of safety.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/24">He further addresses the issue of boat buoyancy and refers to considerable evidence about the effect of fitting full buoyancy to racing boats, which he says</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/25" class="indent">&quot;would ensure that in the event of severely adverse weather conditions the boat would not capsize, thus meaning that the crews would not be forced into very cold and dangerous water and thus reducing considerably the likelihood of death from drowning or hypothermia.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/26">Mr. Pollard also agrees with his fellow coroner about the lack of clear guidance to rowing clubs and individual rowers. He states:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/27" class="indent">&quot;I believe that clearer guidance could and should be given by the ARA which would to a large extent cover the present paucity of such information and indeed that those guidelines should be adopted by the ARA as compulsory safety measures.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/28">Mr. Pollard comments on the fact that if international guidelines and protocols are issued by FISA, the international rowing federation, it is still a matter of choice for the ARA as to whether they are adopted for British Rowing. That is a reference to &quot;FISA's Minimum Guidelines for the Safe Practice of Rowing&quot;, which were in draft at the time of the inquest but have since been fully ratified. They state:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/29" class="indent">&quot;Boats should meet minimum flotation requirements: When full of water a boat with the crew seated in the rowing position should float in such a way that the top of the seat is a maximum of 5 cm . . . below the static water line.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/30">The ARA seems to have chosen not to adopt those simple yet effective and practical guidelines. Being immersed in cold water is extremely dangerous. Death can occur almost instantly at any time during immersion, or even after rescue. Lean, lightly clothed rowers, especially juniors, are among those most susceptible to hypothermia.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/31">The Salvage Association report &quot;Regulation of Rowing in the Upper Reaches of the Tidal Thames&quot;, which was commissioned by the Port of London authority, is also relevant. It states that</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/32" class="indent">&quot;Swamping . . . carries the additional risk of hypothermia during most of the main rowing season. In view of the relative frequency with which incidences of swamping or capsize and resultant sinking occur, we believe that it is imperative that all boats are sufficiently buoyant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/33">To summarise, in five years, there have been two incidents involving British rowers that have led to death. In two separate cases in 2005, coroners wrote rule-43 letters calling for the ARA to improve safety measures and drawing attention to the central importance of boat buoyancy. Clearly the coroners in those cases believe that the responsibility for enforcing rowing safety in this country lies with the ARA because they addressed their rule 43 letters to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/34">The ARA response to Mr. Pollard, which was penned by Gary Harris, points to the third edition of the ARA water safety code, which mandates:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/35" class="indent">&quot;Boats constructed after 1st April 2003 must have inherent buoyancy sufficient, together with their oars and sculls, to support a seated crew of the correct design weight in the event of being swamped.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/36">Frankly, that is not good enough. Unlike the FISA buoyancy recommendation, it gives no measurable minimum performance standard and is thus confusing and unenforceable.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/37">In an additional advisory note the ARA suggests that a boat's freeboard might be a useful indicator of buoyancy, but it is not. Gary Harris goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/38" class="indent">&quot;On the option of retro-fitting additional buoyancy to boats built prior to the rule introduced in 2003, this suggested compulsory provision would present clubs with potentially crippling costs that would be disproportionate to the risk involved.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/39">The cost of a new eight boat is between &pound;10,000 and &pound;15,000. The cost of retro-fitting boats is relatively low. I have had example quotes of between &pound;108 and &pound;500 per boat for a &quot;bells and whistles&quot; option. When set against loss of life, I cannot accept the argument that those are crippling costs. Surely there is no more crippling price to pay than the death of one's child.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/40">The ARA is the national governing body of a sport that is increasingly popular, especially with juniors. It is heavily funded by Sport England and lottery money. It is essential that it takes the lead on rowing safety. If it is recognised as the overarching body in all other respects, including the award of Government funding, surely the ARA should take responsibility for safety in the expanding sport of rowing. If that expansion is to continue, it is essential that we change the culture that led to the agreement to keep secret the events in Amposta, which allows the macho defence of peer pressure on people, including the youngest and most inexperienced participants, not to wear personal buoyancy aids.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/41">It is also essential to get away from the insistence that the sport depends on rowers staying with the boat if they find themselves in the water in adverse weather conditions. It is clear from all the evidence that staying in the boat is preferable to staying with the boat almost entirely submerged in cold water, especially in adverse weather conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/42">It is clear to me, and certainly to the Blockleys, that the leading lights at the ARA are set on persisting with their light-touch, amateurish approach to the safe regulation of the sport, even in the face of strong and clear messages from the coroners in their rule 43 letters. The equivocation has to be stopped before we have another tragedy on our hands. It is time to reconsider the legislative route.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/43">There is a precedent for the introduction of legislation after a tragic water sport incident. I remember it well. Then, as now, there were those who claimed that the cost of complying with regulations might prevent participation in the affected sports. Then, as now, there were those who were complacent about the ability of people leading sports clubs and bodies to self-regulate, while others clamoured for safety to be given priority. Then, as now, the affected families mounted a high profile campaign, lobbying their MPs and the then Ministers. That tragedy was the Lyme bay kayaking accident in March 1993, in which four schoolchildren lost their lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/44">In the subsequent court case, the judge voiced a clear opinion that self-regulation was inadequate. Initial Government thinking at that time was that further regulation was unnecessary. Eventually, a private Member's Bill resulted in the establishment of the Adventure Activities Licensing Authority. Some believe that the ARA developed its water safety policy at that time as a direct response, in order to avoid being regulated by the new authority. I suggest strongly to the Minister that the time has now come to oblige the ARA to be regulated by this or a new, appropriate, regulatory authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/45">To conclude, I hope that the Minister will agree to mount an investigation into whether the actions of the ARA in responding to the coroners' rule 43 letters adequately addressed the safety concerns of the coroners that were expressed in those letters. I hope that he will also agree to intervene to ensure that an effective, workable measurable buoyancy standard is adopted for all boats used in the sport of rowing in the UK, as advised by FISA.</p>
	<p pid="b.485.1/46">Finally, I should be most grateful if the Minister would agree, on his own behalf or that of one of his colleagues, to meet me and my constituents Jane and Stephen Blockley. The Blockleys have amassed far more evidence in support of their campaign than I have been able to present in a short time today. I would welcome the chance to share that valuable evidence with the Minister or one of his colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="b.489.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1380" name="David Heyes">the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (David Heyes)</phrase> for having brought this issue to the attention of the House. The Minister for Sport is in Melbourne at the Commonwealth Games and is sorry that he cannot be here.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/2">I know that my hon. Friend will appreciate the fact that few debates in this House are more serious than those that deal with the loss of a young person's life. The death of Leo Blockley in a rowing incident in Spain in December 2000 was a tragedy. The fact that it happened while he was taking part in a sport that he loved, with his whole life ahead of him, made it all the more tragic. I should like to extend the condolences of the House to Leo's family, and to pay tribute to the work they have done in promoting safety in the sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/3">The purpose of the debate, as I see it, is to consider whether more should be done to ensure that everybody involved in rowing does all that can be done to maintain the highest standards of safety. I am sure that my hon. Friend will recognise that many recreational sports carry with them an element of risk to personal safety. However, the Government are clear: safety should not and cannot be compromised. That is why an interdepartmental group, led by the Department for Transport, looked closely into the issue in 2002 and published a report called &quot;Inland Water Safety: Present Roles and Responsibilities&quot;. The report found that the responsibility for inland water safety was spread across a number of Government Departments and organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/4">One key outcome of the report was the development of the National Water Safety Forum. That brings together, among others, Government Departments, the devolved Administrations, public agencies and governing bodies of sports. The forum includes an advisory group on water sports safety. On safe water sports, the report concluded that the responsibility for the management and regulation of individual sports, including safety, sat principally with the sports' governing bodies.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/5">The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is responsible for setting the overarching strategic framework for sport in England. Our relationship with sport's governing bodies is managed through Sport England and UK Sport, the non-departmental public bodies for sport. Public funding for the governing bodies is provided via Sport England and UK Sport according to a range of criteria, including child protection, equity and safety in that sport. Each year an annual audit of corporate governance is completed to determine whether the governing body continues to satisfy the criteria and may continue to receive public funding. That audit applies not only to the Amateur Rowing Association, but to all national governing bodies in receipt of public funds, including those with responsibility for swimming, athletics and sailing.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/6">I have spoken about the Government's relationship to the sport's national governing bodies. It is also important to be clear about the role of the governing bodies. In this country, the governing bodies are responsible for all aspects of amateur sport. They set the rules and standards for their sport, and clubs that meet those standards can become affiliated to the governing body. One advantage of affiliation is the ability to compete in recognised national and international competitions. If a club fails to meet safety standards or does not have child protection or equity polices in place, it runs the risk of losing its status as an affiliated club.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/7">We must recognise that many sports are supported by volunteers, and that the governing bodies themselves often do not have the resources to police all the activities of every club throughout the country. It is therefore important to note that sports clubs themselves are also responsible for ensuring that safety is at the top of their agenda, and that everyone involved is well aware of the risks and how best to manage them.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/8">I now turn to the terrible tragedy of December 2000, when Leo Blockley lost his life in the accident in Spain. First, it is important to note that water sports inevitably carry more risks than many land-based ones. Rowers are dependent on the stability and safety of their boats, their own skill and ability in the water and those rowing alongside them, and the weather can have a devastating impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/9">However, before I turn to the terrible incident that led to the death of Leo Blockley, it is important to recognise that rowing in Britain is, for the vast majority of rowers at amateur and professional level, a very safe sport indeed. I am sure that no one in the House or in the sport would want the terrible events of 2000 to stop young people enjoying rowing or other water sports. Not only do those sports offer great fun for people of all ages, they are sports at which we excel on the international stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/10">I do not want to comment specifically on the events themselves. It is right and proper that they are investigated in an inquest, and it would be inappropriate for me to open up all that today. There have been two coroner's inquests since 2000. The second, in March 2005, overturned the verdict of the initial inquest, and ruled that Leo's death was accidental. The outcome of the second inquest was a rule 43 letter, as explained by my hon. Friend, to the Amateur Rowing Association.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/11">I understand that a rule 43 letter arises when any coroner believes that action should be taken to prevent the recurrence of a fatality in similar circumstances. The coroner can then write to the person or authority that may have the power to take such action. In this case, the rule 43 letter contains 10 suggestions relating to the safety of the sport. Although the coroner has no power to order, instruct or require a recipient to take any action, we would all expect any observations to be taken extremely seriously and to be responded to in full.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/12">From the discussion today and the correspondence that I have read in preparing for the debate, I know that there is some disagreement about the robustness of the Amateur Rowing Association's water safety code. In particular, there is a difference of views about boat buoyancy and the comparative strengths of the water safety code and the guidelines set by FISA, the international governing body for rowing.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/13">On the issue of boat buoyancy, the Amateur Rowing Association believes that its safety standards exceed those of FISA. I know that Mr. and Mrs. Blockley take a different view. I understand that the Amateur Rowing Association wrote to the coroner to say that its water safety code is one of the most comprehensive safety codes in the world. From the papers I have read, I note that the code has been used by other national federations as the basis for developing their water safety policies. I am also aware that the 1994 code was used by FISA as the basis for its first ever safety guidance document.</p>
	<p pid="b.489.0/14">In addition, the Amateur Rowing Association was the first federation in the world to adopt a buoyancy rule, which applies in and out of competition. As I understand it, FISA has set voluntary guidelines for national governing bodies to follow, but they are not mandatory. That appears to be quite different to the Amateur Rowing Association's position.</p>

	<p pid="b.491.0/1">On that specific point, my hon. Friend acknowledges that there is a clear difference of opinion between the ARA and the Blockleys. I have said that the Blockleys have a huge raft of evidence that would warrant consideration by the Minister and his colleagues. I remind the Minister of my request for a meeting at which we can have a much broader discussion than is possible this afternoon.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-15b.491.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="491"  time="016:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060315/halltext/60315h05.htm#60315h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.491.1/1">I take all that my hon. Friend has said very seriously. I note that the Blockley family have disputed the issue; they believe that the FISA guidelines are superior to the Amateur Rowing Association's code, particularly in the areas of heel restraints, cold water rowing, hot weather guidelines and, crucially, boat buoyancy. I totally accept that.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.1/2">I am aware that the Amateur Rowing Association consulted widely when it was developing the code. It took account of the view of organisations such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the National Water Safety Forum. The code is also shared with a wide range of associated organisations, such as the Environment Agency, British Waterways and the Port of London authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.1/3">My hon. Friend will recognise when presented with that information that the Amateur Rowing Association takes safety very seriously and involves a number of stakeholders. However, that said, it does mean perhaps that more could and should be done. We all agree that safety is paramount in any sport. The Amateur Rowing Association must continue to do all it can to promote its rules to all members and to the clubs that are involved. It should do all it can to ensure that safety is at the top of its list when training, competing or simply having fun in the water.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.1/4">I recognise that after any tragic event, serious questions have to be asked of those involved in the accident, including the club that organised the trip. That was the purpose of the coroner's report. I share my hon. Friend's wish to see the matter resolved fairly for the Blockley family and the Amateur Rowing Association. For that reason, the Minister for Sport has agreed to meet my hon. Friend and the family and to hear their concerns. In addition, to attempt to resolve this important issue for all the parties involved, I will ask the Minister for Sport to write to the Amateur Rowing Association to clarify the matter of boat buoyancy and FISA's position. I will also request that he write to FISA to understand better its position and to Sport England to ask it to identify an appropriate organisation to undertake an independent assessment of the issues discussed today that are under dispute, including that of boat buoyancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.1/5">I hope that, in that small way, my Department can help to resolve this very difficult and sad case. Nobody wants such a tragic accident to happen again. Thankfully, as I have said, such cases are rare. I hope that the debate will have reiterated the importance of safety in all sport, not just rowing. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the opportunity to talk through the issues in detail today.</p>
	<p pid="b.491.1/6" class="indent">It being Five o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
