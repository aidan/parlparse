<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.67.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1928" speakername="Mark Oaten" colnum="67"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0001.htm#08061199000477">
	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Even after 11 years, one of the joys of this job is that, every now and then, I come across an issue about which I know nothing. Somebody comes into my surgery, gives me a briefing and I go away thinking, &quot;That's extraordinary. I had no idea that was going on.&quot; Specialist care for seriously injured people is such a subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/2">A few months ago, a couple of my constituents&mdash;Phil Hyde and Ewan McMorris&mdash;briefed me about the work that they did. They said that the subject that they wanted to discuss was pre-hospital care, and I assumed that they would talk about rehabilitation, drugs, therapy or something that would prevent people from going into hospital. However, as the conversation developed, it became clear that they are providing an enormous specialist service, particularly in Hampshire. This morning, I shall go through some of the facts and figures about the service that they provide and consider how the Government can do more to support such work.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/3">In essence, the role of those people is best described as taking the skills of an accident and emergency department out to serious accidents and injuries&mdash;most typically, a road traffic incident. The service they provide is different from that of the ambulance service, paramedics, and first responders, who are now quite commonplace and whom many of us will have in our constituencies. The philosophy behind immediate care is the prevention of the deterioration of a patient in those first critical minutes between the time of an accident and before they are taken to the A and E department.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/4">I had assumed that such a critical service would be part of the NHS, but it is not. I was surprised to discover that the service is provided by volunteers, charities and a couple of organisations that work closely in the field. The British Association for Immediate Care&mdash;BASICS&mdash;and the Mid-Anglia General Practitioner Accident Service, which is an emergency medical charity, are the major players in the service. My amazement at the service they provide, coupled with my astonishment that it was not centrally funded, meant that I decided to probe the matter and do a bit more work on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/5">I am delighted that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> is here because I know that she has met the individuals concerned and has taken up some of the issues on their behalf. In Hampshire, we are lucky to have the service that they provide. On average, they attend an incident between two and eight times a day. In the Hampshire area, there were 1,200 requests a year for basic doctors and, through the work the charity does and the volunteers that it has, it is able to attend 750 of those calls. There is a big demand, but the worrying statistic is that although it is good that we have volunteers, they are not able to meet all the calls made on their watch.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/6">The work involved often relates to traffic incidents, and we know that, on average, some 3,460 traffic fatalities take place each year. We also know that trauma is one of the big causes of death in this country. The latest figures suggest that trauma remains the fourth leading cause of death in western countries, including this country. Clearly, much work needs to be done to try to reduce the number of deaths. For each trauma death that takes place there are two survivors, who often end up with a serious and permanent disability. Anything that we can do to reduce the disabilities and injuries from which such people suffer will have a big impact on their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/7">The model that we have in this country differs from the rest of Europe. For example, Germany takes a different approach to trauma care. There is a nationwide network of helicopters and road vehicles that can, in 95 per cent. of cases, get a skilled doctor to the scene of an incident within 15 minutes. We even trail behind America in relation to trauma care. The UK mortality rate for severely injured trauma patients who are alive when they reach hospital is a staggering 40 per cent. higher than that of the US.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/8">We know that the level of trauma-related deaths is high in this country, and that other European countries and America are able to tackle the problem better. We also know that, despite the various forms of support provided by ambulances, paramedics and first responders, there is still a desperate need to have skilled consultants and doctors who are able to get out to the incident. In Hampshire, although demand for the service is high, it is funded by charities and good will.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/9">Why is it so important to have specialists as part of the service, and what do they do that is different from first responders and paramedics? First responders would be the first to acknowledge that they are not fully medically trained and can in no way replicate the work of a specialist doctor in A and E. It is also the case that, despite the wonderful work that paramedics do, their degree course lasts just three years. Let us compare that with the training required to be a consultant. Typically, a consultant in A and E would get five to six years at medical school and then a structured 12-year training programme before becoming a consultant. That is the level of skill and knowledge required to treat the most severe incidents of trauma.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/10">The particular specialist skill needed relates to the airways and breathing of patients who have had severe head injuries. Paramedics are not trained to clear the airway or use the necessary drugs and anaesthetics in the treatment of those injuries. In many cases, paramedics are legally prevented from doing so because they are unable to administer the drugs. All the evidence that I have seen suggests that the critical area that an individual needs to have treated at an incident is around the airway, and that anaesthetics and drugs need to be issued. None of those who currently attend incidents are able to treat that specialist injury. However, the specialist consultants from A and E departments can do so, and we are trying to ensure that more of them can carry out that particular work, often at the roadside.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/11">A fair bit of work and research has been done on the subject. The most recent report was in 2007 when the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death produced a report entitled, &quot;Trauma: Who Cares?&quot; The report takes a general look at how we handle a situation when there is an accident leading to trauma, and considers what happens in the first few moments after an incident. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/12" class="indent">&quot;The current structure of prehospital management is insufficient to meet the needs of the severely injured patient. There is a high incidence of failed intubation and a high incidence of patients arriving at hospital with a partially or completely obstructed airway. Change is urgently required to provide a system that reliably provides a clear airway with good oxygenation and control of ventilation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/13">The report highlights the particular specialist skills needed at the scene of an accident. In the study, NCEPOD produced an analysis stating that 60 per cent. of patients whom it looked at received a standard of care that was less than good practice. It also states:</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Many of these clinical issues were related to the lack of seniority and experience of the staff involved in the immediate management of these patients.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/15">Again, the critical issue is seniority and people having the skills to tackle breathing and airway problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/16">It is not just NCEPOD that has looked at the issue; the Royal College of Surgeons has also raised concerns in a number of studies. Initially, in 2000, the college called for defined trauma systems comprised of major trauma centres to be established in each region. It describes&mdash;in its words&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/17" class="indent">&quot;the lack of political will&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/18">to tackle the issue. It revisited the subject in 2006 and reported little progress or improvement. Its analysis is that the likelihood of dying from injuries has remained static since 1994 despite great improvements in trauma care, training and education. There are not many areas of the health service in which things have remained static since 1994, certainly under the Labour Government&mdash;I welcome some of their investments. With many of the indicators, one can see that the advancement of knowledge has been matched by improved outcomes, but this area has remained static since 1994.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/19">Last night, the RCS e-mailed me with a further update on the issue, in which it raised more concerns. It welcomes the fact that volunteers and charities are putting provisions in place throughout the country, but says that coverage is patchy. It describes a postcode lottery and says that there is great inequality in access to and provision of pre-hospital critical care. As a consequence, there are preventable pre-hospital and early-hospital deaths that could have been averted had there been access to appropriate services.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/20">It is troubling that the RCS is saying that we could save lives if we had that kind of system in place across the country. In its note, it estimated that a national system of 24-hour access to specialist physicians who could go out to incidents would probably require an additional 200 specialist practitioners, who would need to be funded. I do not have more accurate figures than that estimate, but if those are the kind of figures involved and if it would have a dramatic impact by cutting the number of deaths, as the RCS says and as other evidence suggests, it would be a small price to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/21">Air ambulances are critical to the ability to save lives after a traumatic incident; however, there are contradictions. I understand that, in London, daytime provision of the air ambulance is centrally funded, but that the evening service switches to charitable funding. There was a debate on air ambulances in Westminster Hall in February for which the RCS did a lot of work. It said how important the role of air ambulances is, but it was extremely concerned that it is left to charitable trusts and individual primary care trusts to fund them. The RCS argues strongly that it is excellent value for money to have an air ambulance.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.2/22">Another issue that the RCS has raised is the provision of helipads close to accident and emergency departments. There are many examples&mdash;including one in Southampton, close to the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey&mdash;of the ridiculous situation in which the air ambulance is able to get to the scene of a trauma quickly, but is then unable to land near to the hospital and has to land a six or seven-minute ambulance journey away from it, so an ambulance has to go to the air ambulance and bring the patient to the hospital. After the air ambulance has provided such a quality service, having got to the scene quickly, it is enormously frustrating to the professionals involved that an additional journey is needed at the end.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.70.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1928" speakername="Mark Oaten" colnum="70"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0001.htm#08061199000481">
	<p pid="a.70.3/1">I had a similar conversation with Mark Hackett, who told me that the cost, on its figures, would be about &pound;1 million. He hoped that it might be possible to reduce that cost by putting a helipad on top of a building and incorporating that into ongoing rebuilding at the hospital site. I am no engineer or scientist, but one would think that reasonably easy to achieve. It is breathtaking that such a service should have to depend on charity in today's modern world, particularly as it would cover a region with a radius of about 150 to 200 miles. It would provide a quality service covering theIsle of Man and going through to Dorset, which is an enormous area. One would think, therefore, that it would attract public funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/2">It is not for me to tell any of the three political parties what would be an eye-catching issue at the next general election&mdash;I am not standing at the next election, so I do not mind too much&mdash;but I should think that any party that commits to introducing 10 helipads across the country to ensure that individuals can get straight into an accident and emergency department would have a simple, popular message with a particularly low cost. It is extraordinarily odd that we leave the funding of air ambulances and their work to the good will of volunteers and charities. I hope that the Minister will comment on that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.71.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1928" speakername="Mark Oaten" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0001.htm#08061199000483">
	<p pid="a.71.1/1">Four, five, six or seven&mdash;anyone is entitled to put forward the policy, but it would be wonderful if the Minister prevented other parties from doing so by announcing something today.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/2">Let me address what is the best way forward with funding. I totally understand that there are demands on Government funding and I am reluctant to say to a Minister, &quot;Come on, cough up,&quot; because so many areas have to be funded. I know from parliamentary questions on this issue that the Minister and his colleagues have said, &quot;Look, fantastic work is being done and we totally recognise that this is providing a real benefit to the health service, but it is for local PCTs to decide whether to fund it.&quot; That is a cop-out, because we know the pressures that local PCTs are under. Is it right to say that we are going to leave it to the lottery of whether a PCT is able to support such work? People throughout the country&mdash;certainly my constituents and, I am sure, those of other hon. Members&mdash;want the reassurance that they will get the best-quality support if they are involved in a major trauma anywhere in the country, but that is currently left to good will and chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/3">I hope that the Government will consider this issue further and do more work on it. I am encouraged by some of the statements that have come from Ministers so far, who have at least acknowledged that there is more work to do. Lord Darzi said:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We have taken on board the recommendations of NCEPOD, not necessarily just regarding pre-hospital admission. We also need to have, and define for the first time, dedicated regional trauma centres. It is the one area where there is clear evidence that centralisation of services, with adequate competencies at the site of receiving hospitals, will significantly impact on the quality of care.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2008-01-07.630"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 7 January 2008; Vol. 697, c. 630</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/5">I could not agree more and I hope that the Minister present agrees with his colleague. With that in mind, I ask him to confirm whether he plans to meet the authors of the NCEPOD report. In a written answer in April, he told me that officials were arranging for a further meeting to take place, so I hope that progress has been made with people's diaries; indeed, the meeting may have taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/6">According to a written answer last year from one of the Minister's colleagues, who has moved on to the Home Office, the Government acknowledged the work of the RCS in this area and were hoping to do more work and have meetings with it. It would helpful to know whether that work has been done and whether the Government have made an assessment of the RCS reports on trauma.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.1/7">I was amazed to discover that the whole area of specialist trauma response did not exist as part of the NHS. Having met the surgeons involved, I am convinced that, despite the good work of paramedics, the ambulance service and first responders, there is a very big gap&mdash;the ability of high-quality experts with high levels of training to reach the scene of an incident quickly and provide the drugs, skills and airway support that definitely could, based on studies done so far, save lives. Linked to that is the question of a decent, funded air ambulance service. We need to put the two elements together. If the Government were prepared to move on this and to put some funding in&mdash;not necessarily fund the whole project, but put in some matching funding&mdash;we could make a significant difference to the number of people who are dying unnecessarily in traffic accidents and as a result of other serious injuries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.72.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="72"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0001.htm#08061199000484">
	<p pid="a.72.0/1">I just want to add a footnote to the excellent speech made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1928" name="Mark Oaten">the hon. Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase>&mdash;my parliamentary neighbour. As you may have seen, Dr. McCrea, a high percentage of Hampshire MPs are present.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">I pay tribute to the work of Dr. Phil Hyde and the team in Hampshire for raising the profile of this issue as well as providing the help that the hon. Gentleman described. Like him, I was not aware of the service until my constituent, Dr. Louisa Chan, who lives in Whitchurch, wrote to me. She is one of 19 volunteer doctors and one consultant nurse in the county who act as volunteers working for BASICS&mdash;in her case, after doing 56 hours of full-time work for the NHS. She uses her own car with a blue light in responding to call-outs. As the hon. Gentleman said, at the moment, the team can respond to about half the number of call-outs. Of course, they are not called out every time that an ambulance is summoned; they are called out only to the more serious emergencies where their skills could make the difference between life and death. I pay tribute to those volunteers. They were very active following the train crash at Ufton Nervet a few years ago; they were on the scene very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">I want to put this issue in a slightly broader context. The hon. Gentleman touched on the fact that one could argue that this is not the only service that ought to be mainstream NHS but is slightly at arm's length from it. I suppose that the best example is the hospice movement, which one could argue ought to be mainstream NHS. It started off in this country totally independent, run by voluntary organisations, but it is now moving more towards the mainstream NHS; the hospice movement is receiving more support. In Hampshire, we have fantastic hospices: Naomi House, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, and the Countess of Brecknock hospice and St. Michael's hospice in my own. That is an example of a service that started outside the NHS but is gradually being absorbed into the bloodstream, if I can put it in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/4">The other example, which the hon. Gentleman touched on, is the air ambulance, and it is quite a good parallel with the BASICS service. Until last year, the only local air ambulance service was the one in Thames valley, which I do not think has ever received a penny of public money. We now have our own one in Hampshire&mdash;the Hampshire and Isle of Wight air ambulance&mdash;which, again, I think receives no public money at all. One could say that that is slightly odd. The police have helicopters. No one has ever argued that the police should have a whip-round for police helicopters. They are an integral part of the police service, but specialist trauma response is another emergency service and, for some reason, its helicopters have to be funded in a totally different way. It is not immediately clear why that should be so.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/5">Then we have BASICS, the service to which the hon. Gentleman referred. One could argue that the case for absorption of that service is stronger. With hospices and helicopters, there is something visible for which people can raise money, but for this service, there is nothing visible at all. It is an unseen part of the service. Therefore, one could argue that the case for total absorption and integration is stronger. It is very difficult to say that it is an acceptable risk for patients to rely on off-duty volunteers, possibly to save their lives.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" speakername="George Young" colnum="73"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0002.htm#08061199000486">
	<p pid="a.73.1/1">There probably is no better example, and the hon. Gentleman makes the point very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">Last year, the Hampshire service received the Queen's award for voluntary service. I commend it for that. The hon. Gentleman referred to the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death, which highlighted the inadequacy of out-of-hospital care. It said:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The current structure of pre-hospital management is insufficient to meet the needs of the severely injured patient.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">I agree. It seems to me that the objective should be to integrate the service that the hon. Gentleman has described into a properly funded pre-hospital service, with doctors and paramedics working together as a team.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">The debate calls for a ministerial response, and I am delighted to see the Minister in his place. He can say one of a number of things. First, he could say, &quot;These are wonderful people. I applaud what they do, and I would like to provide this life-saving service as part of the mainstream NHS, but the resources are not there, so we will carry on as we are.&quot; Or he could say, &quot;The case has been made. We recognise that, in most other countries, this service is an integral part of a national health service. We accept the case. We will make this a priority, and either move ahead with earmarked additional resources or ask people to do it within existing budgets.&quot; Or I suppose that he could say that he wants to reach the same destination by another route; he wants progressively to upskill the paramedics, reduce the call-out times, put better equipment in ambulances and implement similar solutions. I am not sure whether that would achieve the same objective. The paramedics are fine. For the average call-out, they have the necessary skills, but as the hon. Gentleman said, they simply are not trained to the level of doctors.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6">The Minister might like to respond to this point. The new GP contract contains a provision for a national enhanced service for immediate care, but as I understand it, almost no primary care trusts have commissioned one, so there is a provision, but it is not being activated. This is what we need to know from the Minister. What is the philosophy? What is the policy? Should the service be a mainstream part of the NHS? If so, how will we get there, and as the hon. Gentleman said, who will pay for it?</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7">I have a final point about the landing site in our area. The paradox at the moment is that, when someone called out under BASICS gets to the scene, there is almost always an ambulance there as well. If an air ambulance is summoned and takes the patient to Southampton, they then have to go by ambulance to the hospital, as the hon. Gentleman explained. The same ambulance that attended the initial incident then goes to the helipad, so there is no gain in time at all from using the helicopter. Given that paradoxical situation, there is an urgent need to make some progress with a more accessible helipad for patients who are taken to Southampton hospital. I am sure that the Minister will respond as sympathetically as he can, and I commend the hon. Member for Winchester again for raising the profile of this important but neglected subject.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.75.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="75"  time="010:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0002.htm#08061199000488">
	<p pid="a.75.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1928" name="Mark Oaten">the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase> on securing this debate. I have been trying to secure a debate on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/2">My hon. Friend mentioned Dr. Phil Hyde. Dr. Hyde has also spoken to me. He is clearly passionate about the subject, and there is a real issue over patient safety. I was taken aback and horrified by what I heard in my conversation with him. Before that meeting, despite shadowing ambulance teams on a number of occasions, I had no inkling that, if I were to be seriously injured in a road traffic accident, my prognosis would be severely affected by whether a voluntary doctor happened to be available. That is scandalous.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/3">The 2007 report by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death entitled &quot;Trauma: Who cares?&quot; has been mentioned. It concluded that the current structure of pre-hospital management is insufficient to meet the needs of the severely injured patient. It said that there is currently a high incidence of failed intubation and of people arriving at hospital with a partially or completely obstructed airway. It went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Change is urgently required to provide a system that reliably provides a clear airway with good oxygenation and control of ventilation. This may be through the provision of personnel with the ability to provide anaesthesia and intubation in the prehospital phase or the use of alternative airway devices.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/5">That was highlighted as something that needed to be addressed by ambulance trusts, but it is clearly not happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/6">Research shows that patients who die from severe injuries often do so within the first hour after the accident. In the United Kingdom, that hour has usually passed by the time the patient reaches hospital. However, sending a BASICS doctor to the scene of an accident is the nearest one can get to sending the hospital to the patient. BASICS doctors will often perform a specialist procedure, known as rapid sequence intubation, to help to stabilise the patient. Once the patient is stabilised, the doctor will be able to judge which is the best hospital for the patient.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> mentioned the specialist trauma centres that are being introduced and said that the outcome for patients will be much improved if they can be stabilised and taken to an appropriate specialist unit. If there is no doctor on the scene, such patients suffer a double whammy. They will not have been stabilised at the scene, so it is often decided to take them to hospital quickly, but the nearest hospital may not be the most appropriate. We all know that some hospitals excel at certain aspects and some at others. Many patients are therefore not given the greatest chance of recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/8">As someone who has probably overdosed on episodes of &quot;Casualty&quot;, I was surprised to learn that accident and emergency consultants are not generally in the business of donning hard hats and bright protective clothing and going to the scene of accidents. I asked, &quot;Isn't that what happens?&quot; I was told that they could not leave the casualty department, although some are BASICS doctors in their spare time. Not everyone who works in the casualty department is suited to working on the road.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/9">In the casualty department, there is plenty of light, the equipment is where it is needed and there is space to operate on the patient. At the scene of a car crash, one has to work with the noise of the machinery and the fire engines in a confined space; it is a completely different environment. I understand that not everyone can operate easily under those conditions. Those who do so are a special breed.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/10">Most of the doctors who provide the BASICS service are fully employed in the NHS&mdash;sometimes in A and E, as I said, but often in other disciplines, such as intensive care or surgery. BASICS doctors are particularly valuable in providing complex airway management procedures and stabilising patients in a critical condition.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/11">BASICS doctors work closely with the ambulance service when a multi-agency response is required locally or when additional skills and qualifications are needed. They are usually called when a paramedic decides that he or she does not have the training to deal with an incident. The paramedic who arrives at the scene will often call the BASICS doctor, although in the case of a fatal crash, the control centre will sometimes call them out.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/12">An industrial accident involving a worker who has become trapped in machinery is a good example of what happens. The ambulance service would work alongside the fire service to co-ordinate the rescue. BASICS could supplement the skill set available at the scene by providing a medical doctor with the necessary extra skills. If necessary, the doctor may use a surgical procedure to extricate the patient, although that is obviously a last resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/13">I know Hampshire best, and it is where I have the best figures from, so I will use it as an example. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1613" name="George Young">the right hon. Member for North-West Hampshire (Sir George Young)</phrase> said, the county has 19 volunteer doctors and one consultant nurse for a population of more than 1 million. Those BASICS staff work on their own time and carry a pager that is activated by the ambulance control in Winchester. Once paged, they must travel to the scene of the accident in their own cars, using blue lights and sirens. BASICS staff must provide not only their own transport, but all their own equipment. It can cost up to &pound;25,000 fully to equip one of those doctors. Frequently, some of the money comes from the doctors' own pockets, although staff do not really have much time for fundraising between doing their day job in the NHS and volunteering in their spare time.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/14">Let me give a few statistics. In Hampshire, BASICS doctors are usually called out between two and eight times a day. There were about 1,200 calls last year, and BASICS doctors managed to attend 750 of them. We can only hazard a guess about what difference they might have made in the 450 cases in which no such response was possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/15">Perhaps I can give a snapshot of what the BASICS staff do. In January, they responded to 58 calls, although I do not know how many they were unable to respond to. Two thirds of the calls that they responded to involved motor vehicle collisions. The others involved falls, burns and machinery accidents. In 16 cases, the doctor was required to give anaesthetic drugs. In 10 cases, they provided advanced wound management and life-saving minor surgery, as well as injecting drugs into the aorta. I mentioned the importance of admitting patients to the most appropriate hospital, and 26 of the 58 patients had their destination altered, because of the knowledge and expertise of the BASICS doctors.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/16">Things vary throughout the country. In Sunderland, which has one of the best survival rates, the death rate for people coming into the unit is 2.9 per cent.&mdash;half the national average. Bosses from City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust say that that is due to high investment in staff and facilities. Interestingly, the trust has also introduced a new trauma response team, and the figures speak for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/17">It might also be worth mentioning London, which seems to have more advanced provision than many areas of the country. Specialist trauma teams are funded by, and travel with, the London air ambulance service. As my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester said, however, the air ambulance stops flying at night for some reason, and some of the provision then becomes voluntary. I am told that there are also only 15 BASICS doctors in London, covering a population of 8 million people. The moral of the story appears to be that, if someone is going to be involved in a serious accident, they should make sure that it happens in London during the day, so that they have the best chance of receiving specialist care.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/18">Clearly, there are many political priorities, and I can understand why there is not a huge patient lobby banging on the door to raise this issue. The Government could therefore quietly ignore the problem or dismiss it with the old chestnut that, &quot;This is nothing to do with us. We're trying to get these decisions taken locally.&quot; However, we need to take a more strategic approach to determining which specialist services are provided and where. People do not have accidents along primary care trust boundaries, and the issue is a real example of a postcode lottery&mdash;I hate using that term, but I have never seen a better example of one.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/19">The fact remains that investment in this volunteer service can save money in the long term, because patients will have better outcomes and be less likely to need intensive post-trauma support packages or access to other benefits. The Government presumably have an interest in keeping their citizens safe and well.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/20">I want now to summarise the national inquiry. The inquiry noted that the standard of care received by 60 per cent. of patients was less than what was judged to be good practice, and deficiencies were identified in organisational and clinical aspects of care. Difficulties were highlighted in identifying patients with an injury severity score of more than 16. Again, if such things are done properly, it will optimise the use of precious resources. Problems were identified not only with immediate pre-hospital care, but with trauma team responses generally and with the seniority of the staff involved once someone actually got into hospital. People were frequently not seen by a consultant within the first 12 hours, even though they were probably among the most injured patients in the country. Problems were also identified with immediate in-hospital care and the provision of suitably qualified staff at all times of day and night.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/21">The report made a number of recommendations. It identified the need for designated trauma centres, and I acknowledge that we have had some movement on that. It also asked for a verification process to be developed to guarantee the quality of care. The report referred to the pre-hospital management of airways, which I have mentioned. It stated that a trauma team should be available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It also noted that a consultant should be the team leader for the management of severely injured patients. The report also made recommendations about the nature of CT scanning once people were in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/22">As has been highlighted, this is not a new problem. One of the most depressing things that I read was that the Royal College of Surgeons had looked at this issue in 1988 and 2006 and said that there had been no progress. It noted:</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/23" class="indent">&quot;most of the improvement in the outcome of these patients occurred prior to 1995, with no further significant change occurring between 1994 and 2000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/24">That is quite a damning indictment of what we are doing&mdash;or not doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/25">Also pertinent to the debate is the NHS emergency planning guidance, which contains principles for effective emergency health planning. The chief executive of each NHS organisation is responsible for ensuring that it has a major incident plan in place. Given what we have heard about trauma response, it is somewhat ironic that that major incident response could apparently also hinge on the availability of volunteer doctors.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/26">The situation that I have outlined is not sustainable in the long term. I hope that the Minister is sufficiently persuaded by what he has heard today to commit to improving services. Put simply, if any of us or our constituents ever need trauma care, we surely deserve the best.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.83.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="83"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0003.htm#08061199000492">
	<p pid="a.83.1/1">The idea that the decision on what is available, and where, should be for central Government diktat is very interesting coming from the hon. Gentleman, and I might bring it up in future debates, if he is suggesting that we are being too dirigiste. However, I shall elaborate on my arguments in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/2">The hon. Member for Winchester has rightly pointed to last year's report on trauma care from the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death, which stated that every year between 3,000 and 4,000 severely injured people are admitted to hospital in the UK, so the majority of hospitals see fewer than one severely injured patient per week. The report found that hospitals that saw more patients had better outcomes, as they were more used to dealing with challenging cases. The NCEPOD report recommended the establishment of regional, specialist units and the development of protocols to ensure, for example, that ambulances take patients to the most suitable centre, bypassing others that are nearer, where it makes clinical sense. It also made recommendations on the care that should be available to patients before arrival at hospital. When it was published, the Government welcomed that report, and we will take forward its recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.1/3">The NHS is already improving services provided by ambulance staff at the scene of such incidents and accidents. As the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead has rightly pointed out, there is an interesting contrast between the improved performance of the military medical services, in the field abroad, where we have seen dramatic improvements in survival and recovery rates among armed service personnel after severe injury, which has not been replicated in civilian trauma treatment. We are very keen to learn the lessons from that. He was also absolutely right to stress the important role of paramedics, who, I am informed, already do a lot of work in unblocking windpipes, for example, which I think that he acknowledged. There could be an issue about the delivery of anaesthetics, which might require doctors being called in from elsewhere. However, we are certainly keen to learn as much as we can from the experience of the armed services, and I have already asked my official to look into that.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.3/1">Absolutely. However, it is also important, when we talk about the respective experiences of the armed forces and the civilian health service&mdash;this touches on a point that the hon. Gentleman has raised about rules and regulations for the use of helicopters&mdash;to acknowledge that different health and safety parameters can apply to armed forces and civilian services</p>

	<p pid="a.83.4/1">The Army point is interesting. I am not an expert, but my understanding is that NHS consultants who work in accident and emergency departments often work in Afghanistan or Iraq. Perhaps one of the reasons for the improvements relates to the lesson about basics. It may be not the trained paramedics, but the consultants working in the field who are making the difference.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.1/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Dr. McCrea. I also welcome the Minister, who is slowly and surely taking his place, and thank him for taking the time to respond to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/2">I intend to conduct this debate in five sections. First, I shall make some introductory remarks about my interest in the case. Secondly, I shall be clear about what we want to achieve this morning. Thirdly, I will sketch out the background to the issue. Fourthly, I will run through the key points that need addressing. Fifthly, I shall wrap up with some concluding remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/3">I have two interests in this case&mdash;a constituency interest and a regimental interest. The constituency interest is that Lance Corporal Compton lives just&mdash;but only just&mdash;outside my Faversham and Mid-Kent constituency, in Staplehurst. His Member of Parliament, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1701" name="Ann Widdecombe">the Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe)</phrase> is, incidentally, full briefed on this case and is fully supportive. Therefore Lance Corporal Compton and I have the county of Kent in common.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/4">The second connection, which is probably more obvious, is regimental, because we both served in the Life Guards. I served in that regiment from 1982 to 1995, and although three of those years were spent at university, I saw active service in Northern Ireland, with the UN in Bosnia and as adjutant of the regiment during the Gulf war. None of that, it is fair to say, bears comparison with the Army of today, particularly given the intensity of the low-level, hand-to-hand fighting seen in Afghanistan. In a week in which the death toll has reached 100, it is hardly surprising that there have been a considerable number of horrific injuries, such as the one that we are debating today.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/5">I should like, in passing, to pay tribute to the Household Cavalry, which has supported Lance Corporal Compton right through his recovery and will, no doubt, continue to support him in the years ahead. I also pay tribute to Alistair Galloway, a young officer who served with the regiment and who, despite leaving the Army, has continued to help and advise Lance Corporal Compton.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/6">What do I hope to achieve with this morning's debate? The answer is simple. For reasons that I will outline, an offer of only 57 per cent. of the maximum compensation payable is inadequate recompense for injuries including third degree burns to 70 per cent. of his body, the loss of his ears and nose and complex injuries to his left arm and right leg that will never fully recover. It is inexcusable&mdash;I suspect the Minister agrees with me&mdash;that Lance Corporal Compton has received no indication whatsoever of the guaranteed income payment, which is effectively his pension, that he will receive for the rest of his life on leaving the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/7">I absolutely do not want to turn this into a party political issue or open up a wider debate about the operation of the armed forces compensation scheme, although that would be a worthwhile outcome. I simply seek to persuade the Minister that he should look again at this case, personally and as quickly as possible, to right what I believe, as a former soldier and current parliamentarian, is a horrible injustice. If the Minister agrees to re-examine this case personally and as quickly as possible, as far as I am concerned that will be a good outcome from this morning's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/8">What is the background to the case? Lance Corporal Compton was injured in southern Afghanistan on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-01">1 August 2006</phrase> while serving with D Squadron of the Household Cavalry Regiment in Helmand province. As the driver of a Spartan armoured reconnaissance vehicle, he suffered third degree burns to 70 per cent. of his body and a gunshot wound to his leg during a Taliban ambush on the vehicle. He was the only survivor of the incident, which resulted in the deaths of three of his colleagues from an improvised explosive device, or IED&mdash;I suspect, Dr. McCrea, that you will be familiar with such devices from your own constituency&mdash;and a direct rocket-propelled grenade attack. He fell from the vehicle while he was on fire and removed his burning body armour and helmet while coming under fire from the Taliban. He then crawled more than 80 m into cover, where he sustained a gunshot wound to his leg. It is a remarkable story. Lance Corporal Compton was rescued by other colleagues and evacuated to Camp Bastion, where he fell into a coma that lasted for three months, during which time he was revived after &quot;dying&quot; on three occasions. He was then flown to the specialist burns unit at Broomfield hospital in Chelmsford, Essex.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/9">As a result of the attack, Lance Corporal Compton has lost both of his ears and his nose, which have been rebuilt. He has undergone multiple operations to repair his face and body, and he is still having rehabilitation treatment at the defence services medical rehabilitation centre at Headley court in Surrey. That has enabled him to walk again and to regain the use of his arms and legs, but he will require further surgery and care in the future. It is an extraordinary tale that has clearly resulted in horrific and lifelong injuries.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/10">The case presents two key issues. First and most importantly, the lump sum award made to Lance Corporal Compton under the armed forces compensation scheme does not reflect the severity of the 10 injuries that he sustained or account for the continued requirement for medical care that he will have for the rest of his life, his loss of future earnings&mdash;he can never be promoted again within the Army&mdash;and the momentous impact that his injuries will necessarily have on his quality of life. In my view, he fully deserves the maximum award, which is capped at &pound;285,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/11">Secondly, Lance Corporal Compton has still not received an indication of the guaranteed income payment to be paid annually for the rest of his life, which he is likely to receive on medical discharge from the armed forces&mdash;I referred to that point earlier. For fairly obvious reasons, it would be of immense benefit to him to calculate his income for the rest of this life, so that he can plan appropriately for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/12">Those are the two key issues, but the case raises a number of other matters, and I would be interested to hear the Minister's comments on them. First, the Veterans Agency appears to have paid out the lowest amount available for each of the specific injuries sustained by Lance Corporal Compton. For example, burns to the face and neck are compensated as a tariff level 7 injury at &pound;34,500. However, if Lance Corporal Compton were compensated for the loss of his nose and ears&mdash;he has clearly lost them&mdash;a considerably higher tariff, which runs up to &pound;86,250, would be used. If the Veterans Agency is going to pick and choose between very different tariffs, surely&mdash;particularly in cases such as this&mdash;it should choose the higher tariff.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/13">Secondly, the revised award to Lance Corporal Compton does not appear to take account of all his various injuries. As a result, injuries to his arms are included in the award, but there is no compensation for the smoke inhalation injuries that he suffered. If the compensation were calculated for all the different injuries that he received&mdash;a lawyer has actually done that calculation&mdash;Lance Corporal Compton would have come out above the maximum compensation figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/14">Thirdly and far more generally, the armed forces compensation scheme is, as the Minister knows, currently undergoing a review. How long will that review take, and will Lance Corporal Compton's compensation be reconsidered as a result? If the scheme is upgraded, I hope that Lance Corporal Compton will be in a position to benefit. Finally, there is the question whether the capped level of &pound;285,000 is appropriate in cases such as this where the injuries are so horrific.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/15">In conclusion, in Lance Corporal Compton we have a wholly extraordinary young man who saw three of his comrades killed and who then crawled 80 yd under fire while still alight. As a result, he sustained horrific injuries, including third degree burns to 70 per cent. of his body, the loss of his ears and nose, and the loss of full use of his arms and legs.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/16">In fairness to the Minister and the Ministry of Defence, I accept that it is difficult to reconcile injuries on that horrific scale with a standard formula. However, there is a clear case for the Minister personally to call for this file and to reconsider the case as quickly as possible, with a view to awarding Lance Corporal Compton maximum compensation. I also hope that the Minister will undertake not only to carry out an independent review of the case but to arrange for Lance Corporal Compton to receive an indication of his likely pension&mdash;the guaranteed income payment&mdash;as a matter of urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.1/17">In a week in which the death toll in Afghanistan has reached 100, it is appropriate this morning to pay tribute to all those who have lost their lives or been injured on operations. It is vital that all our servicemen deployed on active service know that they will be properly, and I hope generously, looked after if they suffer injury, particularly injury of this severity. As I am sure the Minister will agree, they deserve no less.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.91.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1609" speakername="Derek Twigg" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="91"  time="011:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0004.htm#08061199000510">
	<p pid="a.91.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1583" name="Hugh Robertson">the hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase> on securing this debate on this very important subject. He rightly raises a number of issues relating to this case that I hope to address today. First, however, I want to express my deep sympathy to the family, comrades and friends of the three soldiers&mdash;Privates Nathan Cuthbertson, Daniel Gamble and Charles Murray&mdash;who were killed in Afghanistan at the weekend. Of course, my thoughts are also with the loved ones of the other members of the armed forces who have lost their lives, both in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">The amount of compensation awarded to sailors, soldiers and airmen who are injured in the service of this country, and to the families of those who sadly have lost their lives, is a very important issue that matters greatly to individual service personnel and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">I know that, as the hon. Gentleman said, he served in the same regiment as Lance Corporal Martyn Compton and I congratulate him on his distinguished service. I am sure that he will join me and the whole House in recognising and paying tribute to the courage, professionalism and commitment shown by Lance Corporal Compton and all members of the armed forces, and by the families who support them. Of course, I congratulate the Household Cavalry for the support that it has shown for its injured service personnel, particularly Lance Corporal Compton.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">I want to say at the outset that the Government are fully committed to meeting our duty of care to serving personnel, veterans and their families. As has been recognised by many organisations, including the Royal British Legion, we are making improvements, including to service pay, accommodation, health and welfare provisions, force protection and personal equipment. Of course, however, we recognise that there is still scope for further improvements. That is why we are working on a cross-Government Command Paper on personnel, which will examine a range of issues to see what we are doing well, what we could improve on and what it is possible to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">The hon. Gentleman raised the issue of the review of the armed forces compensation scheme, which I announced recently and for which we had asked. I cannot give him a date at this stage as to when we can say something further, but the fact that we are reviewing the scheme is important in itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/6">I of course want to join the hon. Gentleman&mdash;I am sure that all hon. Members do&mdash;in wishing Lance Corporal Compton the speediest possible recovery from his condition and the injuries that he has received. I met him last week to discuss both his experiences of welfare support and the compensation issues. I regularly meet injured personnel; I make a point of meeting them at Selly Oak hospital, Headley Court or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/7">A number of questions have been raised today about the particulars of Lance Corporal Compton's case. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will understand that, while I am happy to discuss such issues with Lance Corporal Compton directly, it is only appropriate that I confine my remarks this morning to the support, compensation and welfare available to the armed forces in general, rather than discussing the particulars of one case, as important as that case is.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/8">There are a couple of issues that I will respond to. Lance Corporal Compton raised the issue of the notification of the guaranteed income payment with me last week, and I assured him that we will get him an assessment of what that payment will be, based of course on his current salary, because the amount will depend on what his final salary is. We will carry out that assessment and such assessments will be made for other injured service personnel in the future, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/9">The hon. Gentleman asked a specific question about medical care and compensation. While Corporal Compton is in the care of the armed forces, that would be provided either directly through the armed forces or through the hospital that we use in his case. Thereafter, responsibility will fall to the national health service, which will be responsible for ensuring that the highest possible standard of medical care is provided. We have been working closely with the Department of Health on these issues over recent months, and, as part of announcements that I made several months ago, a case officer will now be allocated by the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency to work with and help the most seriously injured personnel, certainly in the first two years and thereafter if necessary, if they are discharged. As I said, that is a new initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/10">The armed forces compensation scheme came into effect in April 2005. For the first time, it provides for a lump sum payment to be made to serving members of the armed forces who are injured due to service. I stress that this is the first time that compensation is being paid in-service to injured service personnel. That is an important step forward and an improvement made by this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/11">The lump sum award compensates for pain and suffering and is made under a tariff-based system that is informed by existing established models such as the Judicial Studies Board guidelines for the assessment of general damages in personal injury cases, and the criminal injuries compensation scheme. We review the tariff levels periodically, and, as I announced to the House in April, such a review is under way.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/12">The most seriously injured are also awarded a guaranteed income payment, which we have just discussed. I stress that it is a tax-free, index-linked payment made every month from discharge for the rest of the individual's life; it does not stop at retirement. That important point often gets overlooked&mdash;deliberately so by sections of the press. The guaranteed income payment is part of the whole compensation package.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/13">When we constructed the scheme, we listened to the advice of ex-service organisations to give lifetime financial security, rather than adding to the lump sum in the initial award, as is done in some civil cases. Again, that is an important point. We could have made it all part of a lump sum, but we did not. We thought that income for life was an important aspect of the compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/14">I believe that the guaranteed income payment provides better support for our servicemen and women, but, regrettably, it means that the true value of an armed forces compensation scheme award is not always readily understood. I stress again that the guaranteed income payment is part of the whole package. Between the lump sum and the guaranteed income payment, individuals can receive hundreds of thousands of pounds over a lifetime, and, unlike other compensation schemes such as the criminal injuries compensation scheme, the armed forces compensation scheme has no monetary cap.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/15">To give an example&mdash;I stress that this is an example, but one that is worth tabling&mdash;a 25-year-old soldier earning &pound;22,000 a year who is very seriously injured may receive up to the &pound;285,000 maximum lump sum. He will continue to be paid while in service, including during rehabilitation, which may last for several years. On discharge, he will receive a guaranteed income payment of around &pound;19,000 per year, which will be tax-free and index-linked. That is an example, but it shows the sort of payments that can be made. By the time the individual reaches the age of 45, he will have received &pound;380,000 by way of a guaranteed income payment. By the time of his 65th birthday, he will have received some &pound;760,000 plus the lump sum. I stress that the guaranteed income payment figures are baseline amounts and are, in fact, uplifted year on year to take account of inflation.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/16">As the armed forces compensation scheme is relatively new, we keep it under review in the light of experience. For example, in common with other injury schemes, the armed forces compensation scheme contains a multiple injury discounting rule to prevent those with a large number of relatively minor injuries from receiving more than someone with fewer, more serious injuries.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">Having spent time in Crewe toward the end of the recent by-election campaign, I heard a lot of anecdotal evidence on the doorstep&mdash;no doubt this is so in lots of other towns throughout the country&mdash;that eastern European workers were undercutting in way that breached the national minimum wage legislation. Is it not possible for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs or Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to establish a roadshow, for example, to promote the minimum wage and act as a point of reference in towns from which complaints are received, in order to put the case in the public spotlight?</p>

	<p pid="a.102.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing this very important debate. Many constituencies face issues that reflect his concerns about non-enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/2">I do not want to give three cheers for the minimum wage, because it deserves only one cheer&mdash;possibly two, at a stretch. We know the stories: &pound;1.50 an hour in the security industry and &pound;1.50 an hour in the forestry industry before the minimum wage. I remember my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> telling us about the wage rates in his local industry. The reality is that the wage rate has become a poverty trap for many workers. People are being paid less than they would if we had proper trade union legislation and if we returned to the system of industry wage councils, which worked well before they were collapsed by the Conservative Government to allow massive exploitation and the driving down of wages to the point at which people were getting &pound;1.50 an hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/3">When we introduced the wage in 1999, it was &pound;3.60, which was far too low. We were afraid of the propaganda that was put out by the Conservatives and by many people in British industry who did not want to see any security for workers. They were quite happy to use the exploitative environment in which the Conservatives had left the working people of this country after 18 years of misrule. The rate was too low, and it has not risen quickly enough. The adult rate of &pound;3.60 has risen to &pound;5.52. It will go up again in October. That is a 53 per cent. increase. It has only gone up by half from a very low base since 1999. That is an average of 6 per cent. a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/4">People may say that that is great and that 6 per cent. is a lot more than people are receiving on average. However, it is certainly not comparable with the massive rip-off wages of the people who work in the City or the people who have exploited the oil resources of this country. The finance markets and the domestic markets for fuel are in an unacceptable state, yet the wages returned to those people have gone up by hundreds of per cent., rather than by 6 per cent. per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/5">I want to speak about the development rate. What is a development rate? Where did that phrase come from and what does it mean? The former Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase>, is here and he put it through, but it is a mystery to me what development is supposed to go on between the ages of 18 and 21 that justified us giving people only &pound;3 an hour instead of &pound;3.60, and at this moment only &pound;4.60.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/6">We made one major improvement in 2004; we recognised that those aged below 18 were being ripped off lock, stock and barrel, because they were not covered by the minimum wage until 2004. Therefore, industries such as burger bars and shops would employ young people aged between 16 to 18, because they were not covered by the minimum wage. At least, we have corrected that. Although we have not given them a great deal, we have at least brought them into the structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/7">There is an argument that, at 16 and 17, people should be encouraged to stay in school and not go into employment. Sadly, in my constituency, there are still many people who leave school and end up not in employment, education or training. Eventually, they end up in some low-paid, temporary and pointless job, which pays them a small wage.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/8">What is a development wage? At the age of 18, a young person can fight and die for their country. They can go out on the front line of a battle and die. They can legally drink in a public house and legally purchase alcohol, and by the age of 21, they can do anything that any citizen would wish to do. They can vote at 18, but they cannot get a man's wage. I married when I was 21 and my wife was 19. If we had been that age now, we would be getting paid a development rate if we did not have some other way of finding employment. I used to go out and work on a building site. I did that before I was married; during the holidays I married, and I went back on to that building site. I was paid a man's rate, because I did a man's job.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/9">Today, when a youngster goes on to a building site, someone does not say, &quot;You're getting less of a job and you'll get development.&quot; No, they are given a pick and shovel, or some other implement, and told to get in there and work with the rest of the squad. So what is the development rate about? It is a sop to the rip-off merchants who run many of our industries today.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/10">In the retail industry, which is prevalent in West Lothian, everyone who works in a shop is paid the minimum wage or below&mdash;they are paid the minimum wage, but they are below the age of 21, so they get &pound;4.60. The top rate of pay for the supervisor who runs the shop is &pound;6.40 an hour. That is the environment to which people have been driven, partly because the minimum wage is so low. It is reprehensible, and we should have done what the trade unions suggested at the time and set the wage at half the median income for the country. Until we start thinking about that and about giving every 18 year old and above the same rate of pay as everyone else on the adult minimum wage, we are offending greatly against the principles that I certainly came into the Labour party to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/11">I now want to turn to my pet subject&mdash;the Minister probably anticipates this&mdash;of the minimum wage and the treatment of tips. The famous regulation to which I refer is not in the National Minimum Wage Act 1998. It is so well hidden in National Minimum Wage Regulations 1999 that when I talked to Professor George Bain, who chaired the Low Pay Commission for four years, he said that he did not know that it existed. He did not know that such things went on. Regulation 31(1)(e) says that, if tips are paid through the payroll, it counts towards the minimum wage. For 2 million people working in the hospitality industry, a large number get their wages from their tips. The minimum wage is not a wage with an addition for the tips that we give them; it is made up of those tips.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/12">What is a tip? As defined by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, everything that is a gratuity, tip, service charge or cover charge is a tip. It has defined that quite clearly for the purposes of tax and national insurance. When we enter a restaurant and it says at the bottom of the bill, &quot;A 12.5 per cent. service charge has been added to this bill&quot;&mdash;sometimes it says that that is voluntary and sometimes it does not&mdash;we are paying a tip. If we pay that on our credit card&mdash;this matter has been judged all the way up to the European Court of Justice&mdash;we are paying it to the owner of the restaurant or the hotel premises that we are in. However, if we pay cash and it is paid through a kitty or tronc, which it mainly is, and it goes through the payroll, it still counts towards the minimum wage. So if we give cash, we might not be giving it to the proprietor, but we are still paying the minimum wage with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/13">After I introduced a ten-minute Bill in the House, I discussed the matter with the Minister and officials from the Low Pay Commission. I say pejoratively that I found them to be useless. They said, &quot;If we take that away, and tips are in addition to the minimum wage, we will have to find out how much tips people are getting and enforce the tips.&quot; However, that is not correct. All they have to do is ensure that people get the minimum wage. The law should say that everything that is paid as a tip or gratuity will have to count on top of the minimum wage. That would redress the balance between the customer and the person who is serving them.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/14">The French word for a tip is a &quot;pourboire&quot;, which means &quot;for to drink&quot;. That is what a tip is: an additional sum of money on top of someone's wages that they can have some leisure or pleasure with, but that is not so in this country. In this country, because of the regulation I have referred to, tips are paying the wages&mdash;a minimum wage&mdash;of many people in the hospitality industry. It is time we stopped that. It is also time that we paid a decent minimum wage and the same rate to all adults. People who are above the age of 18 are adults&mdash;they have adult responsibilities, and they usually work an adult shift.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.0/15">If we get rid of the tips anomaly, people who work in the hospitality industry, particularly in this city, would find that they are due what they are given by their customers. If people want proprietors to get more money, put up the cost of the facility or the food. Anything on top of that is what the customer chooses to give as an extra to the staff for the quality of service. That would redress some of the imbalance that occurs at the moment. The issue was recently illustrated by the <i>Daily Mirror </i>and Unite launching the fair tips campaign, which called for a fair tips charter to be displayed by good premises that pay the minimum wage, on top of which tips are paid. I hope that the Government will shortly do something to correct the tips anomaly.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.0/1">Although it was a huge step forward when Labour brought in the minimum wage, which benefited millions of the lowest paid workers, it is appalling that estimates from the Office for National Statistics show that around 300,000 workers are still in jobs that pay below the minimum wage. As we all know, that is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, and I very much agree with the points that he made about strengthening staffing resources and publicising enforcement. I also agree with the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1999" name="Michael Connarty">the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> about 18 being recognised as the age at which the adult entitlement for the minimum rate should apply, and I think that we all found his arguments persuasive in relation to his convincing obsession with tips.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/3">Although progress has been made on the minimum wage, part-time workers, maternity and paternity rights, holiday entitlement, the rights of union representation and the recent agreement on temporary and agency workers, a great deal remains to be done. That was graphically illustrated in the excellent and chilling report, &quot;Hard Work, Hidden Lives&quot;, by the Trades Union Congress commission on vulnerable employment. The report sets a compelling agenda on which the Government must act further to improve workers rights and to ensure that they can access the rights that they are already supposed to have. We must have more debates and campaigns on the wider issues to keep these vital matters at the forefront of people's minds and to secure further progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/4">I shall focus on two particular points about minimum wage enforcement that have been brought to my attention by my trade union&mdash;the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers. My hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk referred to the important role of trade unions in these matters. We all have a responsibility to act to counter such abuses, but we must respect and recognise the role that trade unions can play.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/5">I want to make the case that third parties should be able to take representative or group cases to employment tribunals to enforce the minimum wage. At the moment, underpaid workers request that they get their due by contacting the minimum wage helpline and taking a case against the employer to an employment tribunal. Every worker who believes they have been underpaid needs to be named on the application, otherwise they will not be affected by the case, even if they are underpaid.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/6">As we know, if an employer is underpaying one member of staff, in most cases, others are also being underpaid. Workers who are being paid less than the minimum wage are some of the most vulnerable people, as we have heard. Most fear losing their jobs if they take action against their employers to demand the higher pay to which they are entitled. The system identifies every such worker and leaves them vulnerable to reprisals from the employer, as we heard in the awful case raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/7">There are obvious difficulties related to those circumstances and to persuading workers to put their name on an employment tribunal application&mdash;let alone being the first on the list. Although workers are protected from day one against unfair dismissal for enforcing the minimum wage, as we know, there are all sorts of ways that an employer can make it impossible for a vulnerable worker to continue their job&mdash;for example, unreasonable shifts, denying holiday requests, changing job content, and so on. Many cases of minimum wage underpayment are therefore never brought and that allows unscrupulous employers to think they can get away with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/8">To move forward to a solution, we need to revisit the present restrictions whereby trade unions and other third parties are prevented from any involvement in cases of minimum wage enforcement. If a third party makes a complaint to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs, they are not even allowed feedback on the outcome of the case. I should be grateful if my right hon. Friend the Minister addressed that in her reply. As we know, representative actions and group litigation orders are allowed in the courts in certain circumstances. Therefore, it seems anomalous that employment tribunals cannot hear representative action and that their powers to manage group litigation in a way that would help to defend low-paid workers from exploitation are less extensive than those of the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/9">I shall try to hurry through my comments, because other hon. Members want to contribute. A further point relates to the wider remuneration package and employment issues. I want to put the case for HMRC minimum wage enforcement officers to be given the powers and training to enforce wage-related employment rights, including rights to paid holidays, statutory sick pay, maternity and paternity pay. Presently, if an employer fails to pay the minimum wage, they often also deny their staff other rights, including holiday leave, sick pay and maternity and paternity pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/10">Even if minimum wage enforcement officers find evidence for such underpayments, they do not have enforcement powers. The only option for a worker to enforce their entitlement to those rights is to take an individual case to the employment tribunal. However, there is no protection against unfair dismissal for a worker who has been in employment for less than one year and who is seeking to enforce their legal rights to such payments. As I said, even if an employee has been in the same job for more than 12 months, an employer can find numerous ways to make it difficult for them to stay in their job and complain about their rights. There is little recourse for vulnerable employees who have been denied those payments. That makes the employment rights that we are proud to have carried forward under this Government of limited practical use to the most vulnerable employees, about whom we should be most concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/11">Given that HMRC inspectors have considerable expertise in dealing with wage issues and unscrupulous employers, there is surely a case for extending their role. With additional training, they could seek out and enforce compliance with the other wage-related employment rights issues. They could also ensure that vulnerable workers are protected and that employers have more to lose than they presently do from evading the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.0/12">The introduction of the minimum wage and other employment rights has been a huge step forward. However, if all workers&mdash;particularly the most vulnerable&mdash;are to enjoy the minimum civilised standards for which we surely all ought to be fighting, enforcement needs to be strengthened, including in the ways that I have suggested.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.112.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="112"  time="015:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0008.htm#08061199000540">
	<p pid="a.112.1/1">That is my point, which the right hon. Gentleman has made trenchantly and correctly.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">Compliance is also of importance to the Government because, as the right hon. Member for Oxford, East has hinted, if many companies are not willing to comply with the law, including criminal sanctions on the minimum wage, they are probably not complying on many other matters. He has mentioned health and safety regulation in particular, but that applies to paying tax and complying with immigration rules. I understand that there is now an integrated enforcement system involving the former Department of Trade and Industry, Customs and Inland Revenue, and I should like to know whether there is a systematic way of looking at companies that are flagrantly in breach in terms of their overall compliance with the law. Is information pooled between Government agencies? It would be a much more effective deterrent to companies than a &pound;200 fine, however necessary that is, to know that Government agencies will come down on them like a ton of bricks regarding their other obligations&mdash;in particular, tax. How effectively do agencies co-ordinate regarding companies that do not comply?</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">On enforcement, I want to ask about a particular issue. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase> has obtained information on the number of closed cases in which non-compliant companies had arrears. I think that the number was more than 14,000 cases for the 2006-07, of which only three cases have been prosecuted. No cases have been prosecuted since the new system of inter-agency co-ordination was introduced in 2006. Why have there been only three prosecutions? It could be because the system is so brilliantly successful that the authorities have no need to enforce prosecutions, as everything has been done happily and voluntarily, but I suspect that there is a reluctance to bring prosecutions. Why have so few prosecutions ever been taken to the final stage?</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">The right hon. Member for Makerfield has said that the Government are coming forward with new powers under a Bill. We should discuss some of the ideas in that package, most of which seem very sensible. They include the proposed &pound;200 statutory fine per worker for abuses of the regulation&mdash;that is a civil penalty&mdash;and a proposal, which has not been discussed yet, that workers who have lost their minimum wage entitlement should be compensated at current, and not historical, pay rates, which would make a substantial difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">Another proposal from the right hon. Member for Makerfield, which the Government have not accepted, is that compensation should be paid. There has been some discussion about whether there should be interest payments on arrears, because otherwise employers are effectively obtaining interest-free loans from their workers. The trade union side has proposed that interest should be paid, which seems right in principle, and I am not sure why the Government are reluctant to accept that. I know that we are in a consultation process, but will the Minister say a little more on why the Government are so reluctant to go down that road?</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/6">My final point on enforcement illustrates some of the difficulties. I saw from a table that the Government produced in response to a parliamentary question that the number of enforcement officers in Wales is eight, which is the number in Northern Ireland, whereas the number for the whole of London is nine. There are seven times as many people in London, which also has a concentration of ethnic minority employees and employers, and it is unclear how the allocation of enforcement officers is decided. Is it decided by accident, or as a result of the difficulties of recruiting people in London? Perhaps the Government should focus on how effectively to allocate the scarce resources at their disposal to ensure that people who are deprived of the minimum wage can claim it.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Dr. McCrea. I do recall the occasion on which we were discussing issues close to your heart. I am sure that we will return to those&mdash;perhaps not in an Adjournment debate but certainly in other exchanges.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing the debate; I genuinely mean that. I agree that it is a very important debate. I have been studying with a lot of interest the answers that I have been invited to give to questions, and asking of HMRC many of the questions that have been asked in this Chamber today. Before I give detailed responses to the questions that I have been asked, I just want to say that although my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1871" name="David Wright">the Member for Telford (David Wright)</phrase> sits silently through hours of debate in proceedings on the Finance Bill, he did say that he had had a discussion with our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1553" name="Ian Austin">the Member for Dudley, North (Mr. Austin)</phrase> about low pay and the national minimum wage and they recalled an advert from the <i>Express &amp; Star</i>, which I understand is a newspaper that is widely read in the midlands. The advert, from the early 1990s, was for a security guard and it said:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3" class="indent">&quot;It's &pound;2 an hour and bring your own dog.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/4">I make that point to show how far we have come since employment conditions were of that nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/5">I endorse everything that was said about the role that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1702" name="Ian McCartney">the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> played in taking the National Minimum Wage Bill through the House of Commons. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase> also played a role, as indeed we all did in bringing that introducing legislation. I have been in politics a long time and I recall when I was a member of the National Union of Public Employees and we and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers were in splendid isolation in the TUC in support of a national minimum wage, so from the early 1980s onwards this cause has been dear to my heart. I am delighted that we are here today, asking questions. I am rightly being scrutinised about the implementation and enforcement of this very important measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/6">The national minimum wage benefits millions of workers, as has been said. The increase in the rates every year benefits more than 1 million people, who see their pay increase as a direct result of the increase in the national minimum wage. I am pleased, but not surprised, that despite the dire predictions of 10 years ago, the minimum wage has become an accepted feature of our labour market and is supported by the majority of employers. That is a welcome sea change in attitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/7">Of course, the success of the minimum wage is not just about the fact of it or its level; it depends largely on effective enforcement, as non-compliance undermines its objective&mdash;a point that the hon. Members for Twickenham (Dr. Cable) and for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke) reinforced. The objective of the minimum wage is to enable workers to see real benefits from their labour in their wage packets. That is why we introduced it, and it is important, therefore, that compliance be policed effectively and non-compliance dealt with rigorously.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/8">Since the national minimum wage was introduced in 1999, HMRC has identified more than 4,000 employers, and compliance teams found compliance in only 1,649 of those cases. I beg your pardon, Dr. McCrea, that was wrong; I shall put it right for the record. HMRC has identified more than &pound;30 million in wage arrears since 1999. Last year alone, more than 4,000 employers were looked at. I am glad that I spotted my mistake; it was a major understatement of HMRC's work. HMRC found non-compliance in 1,649 of those cases, which represents nearly &pound;3.9 million in arrears for more than 19,000 workers. HMRC is identifying non-compliance and punishing it, but I realise that there is more to do. That is why the funding available for enforcement has been increased. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who is not in his place&mdash;I see that he is speaking in the main Chamber&mdash;spoke of the 50 per cent. increase in resources over four years.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/9">It is important that I outline HMRC's approach to enforcement and respond to a number of issues raised during the debate. We have heard that enforcement is based on 16 regional compliance teams. There is also a helpline, based in the north-east, that workers or third parties can call. Employers who might not be paying the minimum wage are generally identified through complaints to the helpline or through risk assessments. Last year, the helpline received more than 46,000 calls, of which more than 2,800 were complaints about possible underpayment.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/10">The compliance teams have a range of strategies for dealing with enforcement. They also use an approach of targeted enforcement, focusing on sectors in which non-compliance is likely. I was asked to illustrate what sectors they might be. It is not only migrant workers who are exploited; other sectors, too, are at a high risk. In recent years, they have included hairdressing&mdash;we keep returning to that&mdash;child care and the hotel sector. HMRC will raise awareness in those sectors by providing information to workers and ensuring that employers know what they should do to comply. HMRC also investigates a number of employers from the chosen sector in order to check that the risk assessment remains appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/11">My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith asked why it takes so long to pursue cases and whether that is caused by a lack of resources. I asked HMRC whether the resources that it applies to enforcement are sufficient, and I was advised that they are. The way in which HMRC allocates resources for national minimum wage enforcement is constantly kept under review.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.120.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1450" speakername="Madeleine Moon" colnum="120"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0009.htm#08061199000549">
	<p pid="a.120.1/1">The number of people undertaking a tattoo or body piercing is increasing year on year. Ears, tongues, lips, eyebrows, navels and sexual organs are now routinely pierced. More extreme body modifications, such as the creation of patterned scars and the insertion of items such as ball bearings under skin, are also taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/2">High standards of cleanliness and disease control are of the utmost importance in piercing and tattooing. One mistake can have consequences both severe and permanent. Blood-borne infections such as HIV and the more dangerous hepatitis B and C, pain, severe scarring and even death can result. Many working in the industry are increasingly concerned that legislation and regulation have not evolved to cover the ethical and medical problems that need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/3">In preparation for this debate, discussions have taken place with a range of local authorities in England and Wales, with professional tattooists and piercers and with Professor Noah at the department of epidemiology and population health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, all of whom want the industry to be better regulated to protect the public as well as the livelihoods and reputations of professional tattooists and body pierces. I was asked initially to look into the need for improved regulation and standards in the field by the union GMB, whose members include a small group of tattooists and piercers. I was joined in carrying out research among local authorities by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" name="Sally Keeble">the Member for Northampton, North (Ms Keeble)</phrase>, whose support and interest in the issue I wish to put on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/4">Local authorities outside London have powers to regulate acupuncturists and businesses providing tattooing, semi-permanent skin colouring, cosmetic piercing and electrolysis under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 as amended by the Local Government Act 2003. The legislation provides for the registration of practitioners and premises and the observance of byelaws relating to the hygiene and cleanliness of the practitioner, premises and equipment used.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/5">In September 2007, the Department of Health issued a combined set of model byelaws for local authorities covering cosmetic piercing and semi-permanent skin colouring businesses. However, the speed at which changes take place in the industry means that as soon as I began my research, the vast majority of local authorities to which I spoke called for greater strength and scope in the model byelaws. Although local authorities acknowledge that they can develop individual interpretations of the model byelaws and their own unique way of doing things, and although I found some truly excellent practice with very high standards, in other areas such standards were not in place. The result is a postcode lottery of public protection. Similar comments were made about byelaws issued by the devolved Administrations.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/6">Most local authorities have some system of registering tattooing and piercing businesses. The exact nature of that system varies from area to area. There is no nationally agreed standard for inspection. Consequently, some authorities carry out tougher inspection and licensing regimes than others. For example, Cardiff city council's licensing system involves prior operating approval before a licence is granted. Then, depending on their assessed risk rating, premises receive a proactive inspection under the provisions of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. Premises receive an annual re-licensing and health and safety visit, but other authorities have much simpler registration systems with no conditions attached other than compliance with byelaws.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/7">Common consensus agrees that the guidance in the model byelaws is not detailed enough. More precise guidance was called for to cover types and storage of equipment, the use of disinfectants and anaesthetics, age limits, consent forms and aftercare advice. Those involved in piercing sexual organs are unable to provide anaesthetics. I am advised by Professor Noah that surface applied anaesthetics that freeze the area are more likely to cause pain than to prevent it. The risk of infection after piercing increases with moisture, friction or lower levels of cleanliness, all of which apply to intimate body parts.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/8">There are calls for clarity about sterilisation equipment and which chemicals should be used to clean premises. Many call for needles to be single use only and for autoclaves to be made compulsory. I was advised by Professor Noah that, despite the wide range of chemicals available, using bleach to clean studios and 70 per cent. alcohol to clean piercings or tattoos, as well as basic hand washing by practitioners, should be standard requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/9">Given the popularity of tattooing and piercing, there is a worrying lack of public awareness of the potential risks involved in those procedures. Practitioners have no legal obligation to advise people of possible risks or side effects, check medical histories or give appropriate advice on aftercare. Scarring after infection of a pierced area can be dramatic.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" name="Meg Munn">The hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn)</phrase> has worked with Dan Aid on the issue of checking medical histories. Christina Anderson, an inspiring woman, set up Dan Aid after her son Daniel died of septicaemia after having a lip piercing at age 17. Daniel had a severe heart condition that put him at increased risk of developing complications. He was not told of the risks and therefore denied the opportunity for informed consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/11">To protect both practitioners and clients, before every tattoo or piercing, the piercer or tattoo artist should take the time to sit down with the client and run through a detailed checklist covering medical history and potential infection risks. The client should be required to sign confirmation that they have been given advice and a leaflet with advice about aftercare. The process would help to protect clients and practitioners because, when a piercing becomes infected, people often complain but do not remember being given aftercare advice. Records should be kept of the procedures carried out and the advice provided. Aftercare advice is important to avoid bacterial infection, especially in the cartilage in the ear, which is difficult to treat with antibiotics. Simple advice about not removing scabs or using 5 per cent. alcohol solutions as disinfectant is needed, as wetting wounds with 5 per cent. alcohol increases the chances of infection.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/12">We do not ask our doctors and nurses for their qualifications when they treat us; we take it for granted that they cannot practice without the qualifications and skills needed. Yet those who carry out tattooing and body piercing to do so without needing a minimum qualification. When a tattooing or piercing business is registered, inspections are made of the equipment and the standard of the premises, but there is no way to assess practitioners' competence. That is worrying, because the growth in popularity of tattooing and piercing and the more extreme piercings and so-called body modifications means that more untrained and inexperienced people are entering a trade where high profits can be made, especially from more extreme piercing and body modifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/13">At the inquest for her son Daniel, Christina Anderson was informed that in having his lip pierced, he had had a minor operation. People are unknowingly submitting themselves to minor operations, sometimes in back rooms, and local authorities have no idea whether a practitioner is competent to carry out such procedures. All piercings are regulated in the same way; at the moment, there is no gradation of piercing. Anyone who pierces ears can pierce anywhere else on the body.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/14">Opinions vary as to the best method of ensuring that people are adequately qualified. Consultation is needed, but options include a recognised college course of one or two years or apprenticeship for a similar period. Both those methods of training would need to include aspects of anatomy, hygiene, disease control, the operation of equipment, health care and significant practical components.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/15">There is no statutory age limit for piercing, and intimate piercings can be carried out at any age. Under sexual offences legislation, genital, navel or nipple piercings on someone under 16 might be regarded as indecent assault, but I found no evidence of prosecutions. We know that such piercings have taken place without parental consent or involvement, some of which have become infected and needed serious medical intervention to protect the life of the young person. I fear, therefore, that there is a lack of protection for minors. Local authorities have complained that, in reality, the most that they can do is revoke the licence of a person who has carried out such a piercing. Tattooing a butterfly on to the arm of a 13-year-old is illegal, but piercing the same person in a genital area is not. That cannot be right. It is time for us to set legally enforceable age limits on any piercing other than of the earlobe.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/16">So far, I have talked about tattooing and piercing parlours, but home-based piercing and tattooing is an emerging problem. The sale of equipment over the internet to unregistered persons and premises is fuelling this problem, as increasing profits are to be made. I am advised that social networking sites carry contacts for unregistered tattooists and piercers selling their services, and legislation is needed to bring such home-based practitioners into the registration system. It is incredible to think so, but home-based piercing parties take place in some communities involving people with no training, qualifications or skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/17">Both practitioners and regulators have called for stronger, clearer, more detailed and more precise guidance and byelaws, and many experts and professionals would be more than happy to engage with the process. I understand that Graham Martin and the Tattooing and Piercing Industry Union's working group have already done much of the necessary work and produced their own model byelaws based on modifications of the Scottish Parliament's model. That would enable best practice to be rolled out across the UK and provide valuable support to environmental health departments that already do so much good work ensuring public safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/18">A national system of licensing is required. Byelaws should specify which type of equipment is acceptable for use and give advice on chemicals and local anaesthetics. They should also include an obligation to ascertain the age, medical history, a consent form and information on the potential risks associated with any procedures and accurate aftercare advice. As already stated, such changes could be potentially life saving.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/19">I have commented already on the need for qualifications for those carrying out such interventions. An age limit must be introduced for body piercing with the more intimate and extreme piercings reserved for over-18s, which would give local authorities greater power to protect minors. Everyone would benefit from tightening regulation in this area. The public would be protected as would the excellent and reputable tattoo artists and body piercers who want to see their industry and their livelihoods protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.120.1/20">I am aware that Professor Noah, and some of his colleagues from the Health Protection Agency, have produced a paper on the hazards of body piercing, based on a survey, which will be published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> very soon. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that that is read and considered by the Department of Health so that we can begin to move forward and provide the level of protection so urgently required for those individuals. Many of us in this House might not understand the motivation for wanting some of the more extreme body piercings and tattoos, but in undertaking such practices, people should be protected by the law as are those going into hospital for minor surgery.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.126.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="126"  time="016:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0010.htm#08061199000552">
	<p pid="a.126.1/1">We are aware of the concerns, and although there are currently no formally recognised qualifications or training courses for body piercing, that is partly because the Government-funded project to develop such standards, of which she may be aware, ended prematurely because of opposition from the industry. We believe that it could have led to the development of formal qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/2">We believe that progress can most quickly and effectively be made by practitioners, their organisations, industry bodies, training bodies and enforcement authorities working together to agree on suitable standards of good practice and competency. That is the best way forward, rather than our imposing statutory training requirements on the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.1/3">As I have explained, we recognise that there is concern about the lack of a statutory age of consent for cosmetic piercing, about some of the training standards and about how some local authorities are using our new model byelaws. We keep those matters under careful review and consideration, but we are not persuaded that a statutory age of consent would help. Our concern is that it might have the opposite effect.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.127.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="127"  time="016:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0010.htm#08061199000553">
	<p pid="a.127.1/1">I am delighted to introduce the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/2">I have a vivid memory of one of the first economics lectures that I attended during my time at the London School of Economics. The lecturer, the excellent Morris Perlman, who is sadly no longer with us, made clear to the undergraduates right at the beginning the distinction between money and wealth. &quot;Money is pieces of paper or numbers&quot;, he said, &quot;but the wealth that you have is the sum of all the things that you value&mdash;both the things with a monetary value attached, like your home and possessions, and the things without a price tag, such as relationships, a feeling of security and your health.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/3">It is not just economists. Philosophers, too, contribute to the debate about what we really value. Earlier this year, A. C. Grayling said:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Happiness is the measure of true wealth&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/5">I shall explore how we can measure that wider definition of the nation's wealth and the implications that it has for policy making. I shall argue that levels of happiness are important, useful and integral to the concept of quality of life, as other Governments around the world, and even Departments other than the Treasury, acknowledge. I shall argue that happiness can be measured reliably and robustly and that the Treasury can and should do practical things to improve the nation's happiness and quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/6">The Treasury's stated aim is:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/7" class="indent">&quot;To raise the rate of sustainable growth, and achieve rising prosperity and a better quality of life, with economic and employment opportunities for all.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/8">I commend the Treasury for including a better quality of life in its aim, but I question whether that is taken as seriously as the growth and prosperity aims. Without quality of life being taken into consideration, growth is meaningless. Gross domestic product grows after natural disasters or oil spills, as the clean-up operation is costly, but it obviously does not follow that such events are desirable. If GDP growth comes as a result of our working longer hours, we may find our quality of life negatively affected. A Department of Trade and Industry study in 2004 found that 87 per cent. of employees said that they would like to spend more time with friends and family. If some of those employees were to cut their working hours to see their family more, GDP would fall. Would that be bad thing, if that decision enhanced their quality of life?</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/9">Research clearly shows that our quality of life is not getting better. The world values survey tells us that, if anything, we as a nation are less happy now than we were in the early 1980s. We can go back further using polling evidence from Gallup, which shows that despite increases in GDP, we are less happy even than in the 1950s. Back in 1968, the late Robert Kennedy said in a famous speech:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/10" class="indent">&quot;There is more to life than GDP.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/11">The debate about the best way for societies to measure progress has continued ever since. The blinkered pursuit of GDP growth on its own can lead to perverse decisions. We should recognise the limitations of pursuing GDP growth and introduce other measures to capture quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/12">This idea is gaining momentum. Last week, Ipsos MORI dedicated its summer conference to the subject, under the title, &quot;Who's Happy Now?&quot; Governments around the world are looking seriously at going beyond GDP, and not just the Government in Bhutan. Earlier this year the French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, commissioned two eminent economists, Joseph Stiglitz and Amartya Sen, to develop alternative measures of progress to GDP that would better reflect people's well-being. Forty-eight Members from both sides of the House have signed my early-day motion 731, acknowledging static levels of happiness and the need for the Government to measure and address that. The British public agree. In 2006, a BBC-commissioned GfK NOP poll found that 81 per cent. of the British public think that the Government's prime objective should be happiness and not wealth.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/13">As I have mentioned, other Departments are also addressing this issue. In 2002, the Cabinet Office commissioned a paper on the subject, &quot;Life Satisfaction: the state of knowledge and implications for government&quot;. Although it was not a statement of policy, the paper declared that:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/14" class="indent">&quot;There is a case for state intervention to boost life satisfaction due mainly to evidence of direct impacts on life satisfaction of government activities, together with strong evidence of the dependence of individuals' wellbeing on the actions of others.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/15">The paper suggested a range of actions that the Government could take, including at the top of the list:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/16" class="indent">&quot;the use of life satisfaction data to construct quality of life indices&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/17">Following the 2007 UNICEF study of 20 developed nations, in which children in the UK ranked lowest in terms of happiness and well-being, the Department of Children, Schools and Families has introduced &quot;SEAL classes&quot;, or so-called &quot;happiness lessons&quot;, in schools. The Department of Communities and Local Government has included subjective well-being measures in its new 2008 national indicators set, which will be used by local authorities to keep track of progress. It is also supporting the Local Wellbeing Project, which is being conducted by the Young Foundation to test practical interventions to improve people's happiness in three local authority areas in the UK. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has started to measure &quot;life satisfaction&quot; as part of its sustainable development indicators, and it has commissioned a sizeable body of research that highlights ways in which Government action could impact on happiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/18">I very much welcome these moves. Many Departments are beginning to take the issue seriously. However, to bring all those activities together and co-ordinate what will otherwise be piecemeal efforts, the Treasury needs to take a lead. Sadly, when I raised this subject with the Chancellor in November 2007, while he waxed lyrical about growth and prosperity, he seemed less than serious when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/19" class="indent">&quot;I am willing to consider a Liberal Democrat happiness index&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2007-11-29.428"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 November 2007; Vol. 468, c. 428</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/20">I hope that I am wrong, and that the Treasury has an open mind about creating robust measures of quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/21">If the Treasury is to consider measuring quality of life, quality of life obviously needs to be defined. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-22">22 February</phrase>, I asked the Chancellor what definition the Treasury is using, and I received this answer from the Financial Secretary to the Treasury:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Productivity and employment are the key determinants of growth and therefore of living standards. However, a large volume of other data are also important indicators for a broader measure of quality of life, such as those on crime, working hours, social capital, social demography and health.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-02-22.1117"><i>Official Report</i>, 22 February 2008; Vol. 472, c. 1117W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/23">That answer rightly recognises that living standards are not the same as quality of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/24">Living standards have certainly increased in recent decades but, as I have said already, quality of life has not. The factors that were listed&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/25" class="indent">&quot;crime, working hours, social capital...health&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/26">and so on are all important to quality of life, but with such a vague definition, it is not clear how the Treasury can measure overall progress towards its aim of a better quality of life. The answer also misses out how quality of life should be defined&mdash;the answer is by asking people. Measuring the subjective well-being of individuals is essential, if we are to know how the quality of life is changing. Asserting that quality of life has increased on a range of sterile indicators is not much use if people do not feel any happier or more satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/27">Some would argue that happiness cannot be studied or measured accurately. However, science tells us otherwise. Lord Layard, the well respected Labour peer, goes over the evidence that it can be measured at some length in his 2005 book, &quot;Happiness: Lessons from a New Science&quot;. He is clear that the answers that an individual gives to subjective well-being questions not only match the answers that friends or independent observers would give about their well-being, but also correlate with scans indicating activity in corresponding parts of the brain.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/28">Furthermore, the Government's own sources suggest that a life satisfaction question is both robust and useful. A DEFRA paper published last year, &quot;Sustainable development indicators in your pocket&quot;, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/29" class="indent">&quot;The independent research commissioned by DEFRA concluded that life satisfaction measures should provide reliable information about wellbeing in a policy context.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/30">Of course, just asking people how satisfied or happy they are may be interesting, but it will not help the Government to understand how to enhance quality of life. That is why a range of indicators needs to be developed and correlated over time with the subjective well-being question, so that trends can be established and policies changed accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/31">There is already a large body of research into the determinants of happiness. A paper commissioned by DEFRA, &quot;Review of research on the influences on personal well-being and application to policy making&quot;, which was written by Professor Paul Dolan and others in 2006, gives a comprehensive review of the research that has been conducted so far. In particular, the findings on income and work are interesting. The paper states:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/32" class="indent">&quot;The majority of individual level studies find a positive association between absolute income and well-being&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/33">We might assume that to be the case, given that most people tend to try hard to increase their income. However, the paper goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/34" class="indent">&quot;The results generally suggest that there are diminishing returns to income i.e. the well-being hit of income falls as income rises.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/35">Beyond a certain point, therefore, policies that prioritise making us richer will not necessarily yield large pay-offs in terms of our happiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/36">The Treasury is right to identify employment as a key driver for quality of life, although that is not just about the growth as a result of higher employment, as might be thought. Instead, the same DEFRA paper found that</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/37" class="indent">&quot;being unemployed has severe and long lasting negative consequences for life satisfaction and happiness, which cannot be explained only in terms of the loss in income.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/38">The conclusion to be drawn from that is that even when someone who has been unemployed returns to work, they are unhappier than they were before, because the experience of being unemployed increases their feeling of insecurity even while they are in work. I know that, as a Labour Member, the Minister will welcome that finding, which suggests that there should be an even greater focus on ensuring that everyone has a genuine opportunity to work.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/39">Regardless of the level of income, inequality negatively impacts on quality of life. People would rather earn &pound;50,000 in a society where everyone else earns &pound;25,000 than earn &pound;100,000 in a society where everyone else earns &pound;250,000. Therefore, the issue of income inequality is important, so it is especially worrying that according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies the gap between the rich and the poor has widened under this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/40">On income and work, it is also important to bear in mind the current personal debt crisis. The evidence shows that while secured debts, such as a mortgage, do not negatively impact on someone's quality of life, large amounts of unsecured debt cause a great deal of worry and unhappiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/41">Interestingly, the DEFRA paper also points out that, according to the research, commuting is:</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/42" class="indent">&quot;generally associated with lower levels of life satisfaction and mood.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/43">However, it is rare that Ministers make proud declarations about efforts to cut the average commute of the British citizen. The issue of commuting is not just about congestion; it is about adopting a different approach to how and where we work. Taken in hand with people saying that they want more time with friends and family, the case for moving to more flexible working practices is overwhelming. We need to tackle the culture of presenteeism and use technology to cut out unnecessary commutes, which would also have environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/44">Research points to many other factors that have an impact on happiness. Health is a major one, especially and unsurprisingly as we get older. Locus of control is also a common influencer of life satisfaction; when people feel that decisions are made for them and that they have little influence over the events in their lives, they tend to be unhappier.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/45">All that information should be shaping Government policy, which brings me to the action that the Treasury should take. An Ipsos Mori poll found that 85 per cent. of people in the UK agree that</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/46" class="indent">&quot;Policies should put less emphasis on consumption, and more emphasis on other aspects of the quality of life&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/47">In order to prioritise improving quality of life, it is essential to measure it and research what affects it, so the first and most obvious thing to do is to create an index of the nation's happiness. The old adage that &quot;what gets measured gets done&quot; has a ring of truth about it here. No one bothered about GDP 100 years ago, because we did not have the tools to measure it; now it seems to be the obsession of most Governments around the world, although, as I have mentioned, that situation is changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/48">A happiness index, including subjective well-being measures and a range of quality of life indicators, would complement GDP as a general measure of progress. It would provide a tangible way of monitoring the Treasury's goal of creating a better quality of life, and it would help to identify the policy levers to enhance happiness in the future. Importantly, it would also provide greater clarity within Government; many Departments now refer to the concepts of &quot;quality of life&quot; or &quot;well-being&quot; in their mission statements, but there is no common measurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/49">In developing such an index, the Government should stick to five key principles: the index should be well grounded in the science; it should be conducted at regular intervals; it should have a large sample size; it should be robust and proof against manipulation; and, ideally, it should be part of an international effort to enable comparisons across nations&mdash;hence my early-day motion calling for the Government to work closely with the French as the French develop their index.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/50">Even before such an index is created, the Treasury could integrate existing happiness research into its work. The supporting evidence on well-being should be consulted in allocating resources, assessing new policies and deciding priorities. Much as the environmental or budgetary impact of a policy is looked at, the well-being impact should also be considered.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-11a.134.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1899" speakername="Angela Eagle" colnum="134"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080611/halltext/80611h0011.htm#08061199000558">
	<p pid="a.134.1/1">We are interested in a more sophisticated understanding of the effects of economic and other human activity. Including the 50 per cent. of people whose work is often not counted&mdash;the unpaid area of the economy is a case in point&mdash;sustainability, the pricing and use of finite resources, and other externalities such as pollution when we measure and account for what we do, is clearly important as we enter an era in which we must re-engineer our economies to ensure sustainable economic activity that does not do more damage than good to the planet. To understand, for example, how carbon footprints are affected by activity, we must measure the whole-life carbon costs of those activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/2">The science and this area of economics is in need of rapid development, if I may put it that way. In the past, it has not been mainstream; in fact, it has been defined out of the mainstream, as have unpaid work, happiness and welfare economics. The hon. Lady is right to say that all the way through the development of classical economic theory, other strands of study have been pursued by welfare economists. For example, as she said, Nicolas Sarkozy has contacted the Nobel prize-winning economist Amartya Sen, who has done some extremely important work in that field, and I can assure the hon. Lady that the Treasury is well aware of such theoretical developments.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/3">Clearly, we need to see what we can do to ensure that the insights given to us by different ways of measuring and interpreting human activity are incorporated into what we do. Does that mean that we will abandon the measurement of GDP? Of course not. Does it mean that we need quickly to develop internationally agreed methods of measuring the carbon costs of activity? Yes. Does it mean that we could begin to consider whether we can develop the capacity both nationally and internationally to produce what she referred to as a happiness index or some form of quality-of-life measurement that takes on board a wider range of considerations than narrow GDP? Yes. Are we close to developing such an index this instant? No, we are not, and nor are we in a position from which to go forth confidently into international statistical conferences and hope for agreement on such measurement.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/4">It is important, especially when measuring the national account, to use definitions that are agreed internationally, which makes them useful for cross-country comparisons. There are many strands to the work that the hon. Lady described in this fascinating but all-too-brief debate. I do not want to slam the door in any way on the ideas that she has introduced, but a great deal of work needs to be done, nationally and internationally, to get agreement on standards before we can hope to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/5">I thank the hon. Lady for pursuing these issues, which are important in widening our general understanding of how human economic activity impacts on the societies to which it relates and beyond, to the sustainability of the planet, fairness between genders and fairness between countries. I aspire, like her, to see in the 21st century the narrower view of economics succeeded by a more holistic view that enables us to go forward with analytical tools and measurements, so that we can more appropriately assess the effects of our society's activity. That way, we could make policy decisions in a more sophisticated way than the current narrow economic measurements enable us to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/6">The hon. Lady should not throw the baby out with the bath water. I am sure that she recognises that GDP and some of the pure economic ways of measuring things have their place in our society. After all, even neo-classical economics developed the concept of neo-classical endogenous growth theory, which is a clever way of saying that if people are happy at work, they tend to be more productive.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/7" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.1/8" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at five minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
