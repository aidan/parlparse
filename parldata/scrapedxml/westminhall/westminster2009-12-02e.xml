<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-02e.86.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1693" speakername="Gregory Campbell" colnum="86"  time="010:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091202/halltext/91202h0002.htm#09120233000240">
	<p pid="e.86.0/1">I also commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is very worth while given the 70th anniversary that we are acknowledging. Each hon. Member who preceded me indicated the value and worth of the citizens advice bureaux in their localities and I will be no different. I have found them to be tremendously helpful, particularly in times of economic decline, when I am sure that every constituency suffers.</p>
	<p pid="e.86.0/2">In Northern Ireland we have had a particularly difficult time. Factories have closed. One closed in East Londonderry and more than 1,000 people were made unemployed in the space of a few short months. The CAB arrived and set up an advice clinic to assist, and it has done so regularly. Because it does that, it is able to provide a safety net to people to ensure that they make the transition back to work. It is a somewhat longer transition, but it none the less provides them with help and assistance that they otherwise would not get.</p>
	<p pid="e.86.0/3">I will be brief, but I want to dwell for a few moments on the requirement to ensure that, beyond <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March</phrase>, as has been outlined, bureaux across the United Kingdom will be able to continue their excellent work. I fully endorse the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> in an earlier intervention. Some of the problems are not about the quality of the service that bureaux provide, but about the fact that they are inundated with clients and so overwhelmed with problems that, on occasion, staff do not answer the phones simply because they are under such pressure and there are queues of people physically trying to get in.</p>
	<p pid="e.86.0/4">In and of itself, that necessitates further funding. Over the next 12 to 18 months, the economic situation will probably be as bad as it is at the moment, so it is essential that we all support the CAB across the United Kingdom, although different funding arrangements will apply in the different devolved regions.</p>
	<p pid="e.86.0/5">I have an excellent referral service in my area and I would hope that other hon. Members do too. The CAB does a remarkable job of trying to assist the people who come through its doors. However, it is one thing to offer the CAB advice, help and support, but it wants something more tangible: a continuation of the funding regime and, where possible, an increase in funding to deal with the consequences of the underlying economic problems facing the entire nation.</p>
	<p pid="e.86.0/6">I close by endorsing what the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands has done in raising this subject and I hope that the Minister will be able to respond positively.</p>

	<p pid="e.88.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is a privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2022" name="Dai Davies">the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies)</phrase>-I think that I can call him my hon. Friend-and I congratulate him on his contribution. He speaks with great passion, and we all empathise with what he said. This is a timely debate. It is a celebration of 70 years of diligence and hard work, but it is also tinged with the hope that the Minister will be able to help us in a few moments.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/2">My constituency is served by two citizens advice bureaux, one in Cardigan and one in Aberystwyth. I have worked with them on numerous occasions on not only projects and general issues, but specific individual cases, and I can testify to the expertise of their volunteers and paid workers. Cardigan CAB has told me that it has experienced a 29 per cent. increase in inquiries during the recession. As we heard earlier, that is the experience of many bureaux across the country.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/3">Citizens Advice Cymru dealt with 298,000 individual problems in Wales in 2008-09, which is a huge figure. Some 37 per cent. of those problems were debt related and 33 per cent. were benefit related, with an 11 per cent. overall increase in client issues on the previous year. In Aberystwyth, there were 1,300 new clients and 4,100 new cases in one year. Those clients represent about 5 per cent. of the population of the town-a significant figure. The volume of cases is increasing all the time.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/4">Citizens Advice Cymru has calculated that it has put at least &#163;25 million back into the pockets of its clients and that it has raised the income of at least a quarter of them. According to the New Economics Foundation, that would put &#163;75 million back into the Welsh economy. Bureaux in Wales have also assisted with &#163;169 million of personal debt. They have negotiated with creditors, assisted clients and ensured that people can manage their debts. We can all think of the countless individuals who have come to us. Sometimes, we may not have had the expertise or specialism to deal with them, so we have forwarded them to advisers at the CAB.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/5">The message from the debate will be that we need to continue the &#163;10 million increased-hours funding-that is a core message. The Cardigan bureau has received that funding, which has allowed it to see an additional 470 clients by opening for longer hours five days a week. Again, that is a significant number for a small market town. However, staff at the bureau are concerned that the funding will end on <phrase class="date" code="2009-03-31">31 March</phrase> and they hope that it will be renewed so that they can meet the 29 per cent. increase in demand that they have experienced. That is the point that I hope the Minister will be able to address today.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/6">The Cardigan bureau's funding has come from a variety of sources. The bureau is scrabbling around for funding from different sources for different projects. Sources include the Ceredigion and Pembrokeshire county councils, the Legal Services Commission, the financial inclusion fund, the National Assembly for Wales and town and community councils. The core funding from the two local authorities has amounted to &#163;35,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/7">Local authority funding for bureaux in Wales amounts to about 37 per cent. of the total, compared with a laudable 8 per cent. from the National Assembly Government. However, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> and others have said, the pressures on local authority budgets mean that just as more people are trying to get through the CAB's doors, budgets are being squeezed. I had the strange experience of a constituent asking me to complain to the CAB about not being able to get an appointment to see an adviser-that is the bizarre nature of the problem. My constituent was told in no uncertain terms that there was a much broader political funding issue, but we were able to help him none the less.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/8">Ceredigion has had a better funding settlement this year from the Assembly Government, but it still does not match the demand on services. Ceredigion is continuing to provide funding to Aberystwyth, as it did before, despite the fact that the transfer of our housing stock to a new housing association has meant that that housing association has decided not to buy the services of Citizens Advice. It is entitled to make that decision but it is not without implications. However, the reliance on local government funding in Wales has certainly been a problem, and that is true throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/9">There was until quite recently some uncertainty about the Aberystwyth bureau, and among other things there was a huge wave of feeling in the community. People were collecting signatures on petitions in the street, and there were letters and e-mails urging the county council to make some transitional funding available so that a bureau could carry on in a university town of 20,000 people. Mercifully it now can, as some additional funding has been made available for the next year. I could not countenance a town of that size being without a citizens advice bureau.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/10">The issue goes beyond debt relief, although that is critical in this time of recession. The citizens advice bureau has been co-ordinating a financial education project in the community, looking beyond the immediacy of a crisis into more general service provision. It has also allocated some funding-I think it is Assembly funding- to appoint a worker to look into benefits for children with disabilities. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1710" name="Elfyn Llwyd">The hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd)</phrase> alluded to those issues. Perhaps we do not always associate such detailed project work with citizens advice bureaux, but it takes place, and that reminds us of the innovation and expertise of the staff and volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/11">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Dan Rogerson">the Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> intervened on the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands early in the debate, and mentioned the critical issue of rurality and inadequate public transport. It is an illusion to think that people in Ceredigion, or much of rural Wales, can even get to a citizens advice bureau in one of the principal towns, but our bureaux have worked hard to develop outreach facilities in other towns, so that older people, young mums and others can get to the services more readily. That is a huge issue. Departments sometimes find it difficult to develop models of service provision in rural areas, and it is also a big challenge for the third sector.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/12">Citizens Advice Cymru has given advice from 260 locations in Wales, 47 in main offices and 161 in outreach locations. We should recognise that Citizens Advice is taking its services to people, particularly in rural settings, and not necessarily expecting them to get to the services. Citizens Advice Cymru, as the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy mentioned, is developing a single national advice line, to cover the whole of Wales by October 2010. That is important because of the nature of devolution, and the different schemes provided by the Welsh Assembly Government. It is also important linguistically that a service should be provided in both languages in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="e.88.2/13">The message of the debate should be to celebrate the work of the excellent volunteers who give their time in a spirit of public service. I hope that the Minister can respond to them positively-and the wider community, too.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-02e.90.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" speakername="Diane Abbott" colnum="90"  time="010:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091202/halltext/91202h0003.htm#09120233000245">
	<p pid="e.90.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I am glad of the opportunity to speak. We have heard from hon. Members who represent Welsh and rural constituencies, and constituencies in all parts of the country, and I want to speak for inner-city constituencies, which have their own particular needs, for which Citizens Advice is vital.</p>
	<p pid="e.90.0/2">I have, in 22 years as the Member of Parliament for Hackney, worked closely with the citizens advice bureau, and I and my constituents have had reason to be grateful for its dedication and the high quality of its legal advice. Such a constituency, with a very diverse community, is often prey-I say this with all due respect to the solicitor among us-to shoddy legal advice from so-called immigration advisers and legal advisers. The citizens advice bureau is the one place where my constituents, some of whom are from highly marginalised communities, and whose first language is not English, can go to get disinterested and high quality legal advice; that is not always possible on inner-city streets.</p>
	<p pid="e.90.0/3">The bureau is a particularly valuable resource in Hackney, which is one of the poorest constituencies in the country. We are ranked as the most deprived area in England, according to the indices of deprivation 2007. The demand for the service is always high, and queues or inability to get appointments are an issue. However, that is not caused by the citizens advice bureau. It is a funding problem. The Hackney bureau has done its best to maintain its services. As other hon. Members have said, good advice can change people's lives. My constituency's citizens advice bureau gives more than 10,000 Hackney residents a year help that they might not be able to get anywhere else. It has prevented evictions and worked to increase local people's income through benefit checks. It has helped with claiming benefits and challenging decisions. Clients can also feed back into the service advice that helps with health and well-being, as well as helping to resolve problems and tackle poverty.</p>
	<p pid="e.90.0/4">Other hon. Members have talked about the importance of the volunteers. Seventy-eight per cent. of workers in citizens advice bureaux are volunteers, and they give more than &#163;85 million of free time a year between them. In a highly materialistic and atomised society, the spirit of volunteering and helping each other, without looking for pay, is one of the most important things about the citizens advice bureaux. It runs counter to the social trends of the past 20 years, in many ways.</p>
	<p pid="e.90.0/5">Hackney is a very deprived constituency, so one might think it would be the least likely place in which to find people with time to volunteer, but at any one time there are more than 50 local people who volunteer to help the community at the citizens advice bureau; we have a core of 50 volunteers. The bureau has won local victories. It was able to increase the school uniform grant in Hackney from &#163;60 to &#163;100, after surveying local schools and parents and finding out how much it cost to get a uniform. It had that positive input to policy as well as helping individuals.</p>
	<p pid="e.90.0/6">There are nevertheless funding issues, and systemic issues about some of the problems that citizens advice bureaux are asked to take up. In the few minutes remaining to me I want to flag up the issue of old tax credit overpayment debts. Citizens Advice continues to be concerned nationally about the continuing hardship and stress of people who are still repaying tax credits that were overpaid during the first two years of the system's operation. Next year's pre-Budget report will be an opportunity for the Government to deal with the problem of tax credit overpayment. We all know the problems with the system. People who are entitled to tax credits are frightened off from claiming them because they have heard of people who are harassed and burdened with a debt that is not really of their making.</p>
	<p pid="e.90.0/7">Members of Parliament and Citizens Advice know that the standard of administration of tax credits was very poor in the first two years of the system-a fact that the Government have acknowledged. In addition, the level of support that is now available to help people with their claims was not available in the first two years. It is wrong that claimants with overpayment debts dating back to 2003-04 or 2004-05 should still be struggling to establish the extent of and reason for their debt, and to repay the balance, which forces them further into debt.</p>
	<p pid="e.90.0/8">The efforts of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to write off more old tax credit overpayment debt are welcome, but more needs to be done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-02e.92.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1823" speakername="Lorely Burt" colnum="92"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091202/halltext/91202h0003.htm#09120233000248">
	<p pid="e.92.2/1">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1834" name="Charlotte Atkins">the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins)</phrase>. I also congratulate the CAB on achieving 70 years of the most fantastic service.</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/2">Several hon. Members have talked about the volunteers who make CAB-their team spirit, expertise and training, and everything done on a shoestring, of course. I can probably top the examples of care and dedication that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2022" name="Dai Davies">the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Mr. Davies)</phrase> in particular raised. I went to see one of my constituents, who had an industrial injury problem. His CAB adviser, who had been advising him for years, brought the papers to the guy's home in a holdall. The number of hours of care and dedication that that volunteer had put in was astounding.</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/3">Citizens advice bureaux, a little like MPs, aim to give free advice on any issue to anyone. I work closely with the two bureaux in my constituency, in Solihull and Shirley. We often swap clients-I send them people who need the technical expertise and they often send people to me when they cannot help them any more, saying, &quot;The last-ditch attempt is to go and see your MP.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/4">I would also like to pick up on the national aspect of the work of Citizens Advice, on consumer and benefits issues in particular. I secured a Westminster Hall debate on will writing and the need for regulation, for which I used Citizens Advice and the expertise of its advisers with their clients to determine their level of concern over unregulated people writing wills.</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/5">Dealing with the recession preoccupies everyone at the moment, and the citizens advice bureaux are certainly getting their fair share of the problem. The average debt of a person going to see the CAB has risen from &#163;10,600 to &#163;17,000-worth of unsecured debt. Every day, bureaux deal with 9,300 new debt problems; debt alone constitutes a 27 per cent. increase in case load. Eight thousand new benefit problems are received every day. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> talked most eloquently about tax credits, which are a huge problem, with inquiries up by 22 per cent. Overall, inquiries and clients are up by 17 per cent. in April to June '09, compared with the same period last year.</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/6">I hate to be the harbinger of doom, but my reading is that, even though the Chancellor says that we shall reach the turning point of the recession at the turn of the year, that will not necessarily mean that things get better. As companies restructure, there will still be increasing job losses, so the problems are not suddenly going to get better and the need for support for people from the CAB and for funding from the Government and other bodies will be even greater.</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/7">I am very concerned about the threats to funding. We have heard about local authorities having to deal with a greater increase in demand for their services, such as housing benefit and school meals, yet having less income-from planning applications or any reserves not attracting interest because of low interest rates-to meet that demand. A council tax rise of 3.5 per cent. is suggested as the average to enable local authorities to fund all the additional demands.</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/8">My first question to the Minister concerns the &#163;10 million-worth of additional hours funding. Can he confirm that it will be extended when the one-year period expires?</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/9">I also want to ask about the new Government legal advice centres. If funding is taken away from Citizens Advice to fund that new service, which I am sure is welcome, the bureaux could lose 70 per cent. of their Government funding. Can the Minister confirm that Citizens Advice funding will be preserved?</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/10">I want to ask about the procurement process. Procurement tenders seem to be getting bigger and bigger and less and less local, and they are more complex for small charities to fill in. We have heard the story about Hull CAB, which lost out to A4E, a private contractor. That seems to justify the whole spirit of CAB and other charities. I know that the Government do not want to interfere in the procurement process that is done by local authorities, for example, but I think that guidelines should be issued about procurement, because as we have heard from so many hon. Members this morning, citizens advice bureaux have to worry year to year and live hand to mouth to preserve their funding. They have so many better things to do instead of worrying about whether they will have funding.</p>
	<p pid="e.92.2/11">I want to echo comments, particularly those of the hon. Member for Staffordshire, Moorlands, about core funding. Will the Minister please look at the possibility of an increase in core funding and some certainty for the future for an organisation that, for the past 70 years-and I am sure for the next 70 years-is doing a fine job for the country?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-02e.101.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1716" speakername="Phyllis Starkey" colnum="101"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091202/halltext/91202h0005.htm#09120233000257">
	<p pid="e.101.1/1">Indeed, I was just getting to that point. As I know that a number of hon. Members have come to the debate to express their support, and given that I have a detailed argument and do not intend to give way to anybody else, it might be helpful if I list for the record the Members who are present. Apart from my right hon. Friend, there are my hon. Friends the Members for Brighton, Pavilion (David Lepper), for Battersea (Martin Linton), for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden), and for Staffordshire, Moorlands (Charlotte Atkins), and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/2">To return to the debate, the reasons for not buying the produce are multiple. As my right hon. Friend said, the settlements are illegal under international law and many consumers do not wish to collude in illegality by buying the produce, but there are other reasons. Evidence from a number of Israeli human rights groups, including Worker's Hotline-Kav LaOved-and the Coalition of Women for Peace, shows that workers within the settlements, whether Palestinians or Asian migrant workers, are not paid the Israeli national minimum wage, nor do the employers apply Israeli health and safety regulations. Although the international community does not believe that Israel has sovereignty, Israel obviously takes a different view, and in 2007 the Israeli courts established that for them Israeli standards should apply within the settlements. Israeli law is therefore being flouted by the minimum wage and proper health and safety regulations not being applied to the workers within the settlements. Settlement goods are therefore not only illegal but rely on an exploited, underpaid and under-protected work force.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/3">I am pleased to say that some UK retailers-the Co-operative Group and Marks and Spencer, for example-have stopped sourcing goods from settlements, but some retailers continue to import settlement goods and for them accurate labelling is absolutely crucial. The lack of clarity in the labelling of settlement goods and the consequent confusion for consumers led DEFRA to put guidance for retailers on its website that suggested the description &quot;West Bank&quot;, but that guidance was removed in 2008 without explanation. In March 2009, DEFRA convened a meeting with, among others, various members of the British Retail Consortium. The BRC tells me that its members-more than 90 per cent. of the UK grocery industry-want to give their customers,</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/4" class="indent">&quot;the clearest information on the origin of West Bank produce.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/5">The BRC says:</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/6" class="indent">&quot;We believe clear labelling is essential in letting customers know where products are from, allowing them to make an informed decision whether or not to purchase that product&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/7">The BRC hoped and expected that the meeting in March would lead to renewed guidance from Government to ensure that labelling was accurate, but despite continued requests from BRC and lobbying by a number of hon. Members, including me, no revised guidance has appeared.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/8">Given that the Foreign and Commonwealth Office made it clear in a letter in April to Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights that it was</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/9" class="indent">&quot;looking at what practical steps&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/10">it could take</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/11" class="indent">&quot;to discourage settlement expansion such as ensuring that goods in illegal settlements do not benefit from EU trading agreements with Israel&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/12">and that the FCO conceded that labelling &quot;West Bank&quot; may not,</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/13" class="indent">&quot;in the unique circumstances of the West Bank...provide customers with as much information as they would like on who has produced or grown the goods concerned&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/14">the continued delays in finalising the revised guidance are inexplicable, and the various explanations given by DEFRA and others in Government have been unusually coy. A written parliamentary answer from DEFRA on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-16">16 July</phrase>-three or four months after the March meeting-said that a consultation would be carried out shortly, but no consultation was carried out. A letter from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-05">5 November</phrase> simply said that it had been decided that it was best not to consult over the summer, but it did not explain why the officials had not got on with it once the summer was over.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/15">Another written parliamentary answer from DEFRA on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-23">23 November</phrase> said that the Department</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/16" class="indent">&quot;fully appreciate the strong opinions that people have about this issue. It is because of the sensitive and complex nature of this case that the Government are still carefully considering possible next steps.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-11-26.257"><i>Official Report</i>, 26 November 2009; Vol. 501, c. 257W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/17">It is not clear what the Department means by &quot;strong opinions&quot;. People have strong opinions about GM foods, but that was never used as an argument to not label clearly the GM conduct-quite the reverse. There is a suspicion that the delay is due to lobbying by the Israeli Government, and Israeli press reports suggest that that is the case. That leads one to wonder whether it is normal for our Government to listen more to foreign Governments with a track record of flouting EU labelling regulations than to UK retailers and consumers.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/18">It is not clear what next steps the Government are considering. There is nothing complex about the fact that the settlements are illegal and that consumers need clear and unambiguous information to exercise choice. The FCO does not think that the matter is complex and since November 2008, it has actively been working at European level to ensure that, across the EU, all member states accurately label settlement goods. BIS also seems not to admit to any problem: it knows that retailers would welcome an end to the confusion, because they do not wish to mislead their customers. Is it DEFRA that is dragging its feet, or does the pressure come from elsewhere?</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/19">In the end, this is an issue of compliance with consumer legislation. In March 2009, in an attempt to address the current situation, Palestinian human rights lawyers submitted to the Government legal advice from Kieron Beal, which sets out the possible legal liability of retailers. The advice points out that the label &quot;West Bank&quot; is something that could clearly influence a reasonable consumer-obviously, a legal concept-in the context of his or her transactional decisions. It suggested that retailers may at present be at risk of prosecution under the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 and/or the General Food Regulations 2004. If the product in question is subject to regulation 5(f), retailers run the risk of criminal prosecution if the country of origin designation is either wrong or sufficiently ambiguous that it might mislead a purchaser to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the food.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/20">The lawyers further highlighted the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008, which is apparently derived from the unfair commercial practices directive 2005. The advice states:</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Certain retailers may also be at risk of finding themselves in breach of Regulations 5 and 6 of the CPUTR 2008. The CPUTR 2008 should be construed in the light of the UCPD on which it is based. Article 6 of that Directive targets a commercial practice which contains false information and which is therefore untruthful...It also covers commercial practices which through their overall presentation are likely to deceive the average consumer, even if the information provided is factually correct. That appears to be apt to cover the situation in which produce is labelled as originating in the West Bank without further clarification being given.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/22">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/23" class="indent">&quot;It follows that if: a)the presentation of material is accurate in itself; b)but is otherwise misleading either in context or through omission of particulars of clarification; c)an average consumer would be likely to be deceived or misled; d)that average consumer would, as a result, have likely entered into a transaction which he or she otherwise would not have done, had he or she known the full facts; then e)there will probably be an infringement of either Articles 6 or 7 of the UCPD.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/24">Given that the retailers want clarification from DEFRA to ensure that they are compliant with consumer protection legislation, DEFRA must explain clearly why no guidance is being offered. I have the following questions for the Minister, of which I gave him notice beforehand.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/25">First, why was the voluntary labelling guidance suggesting &quot;West Bank&quot; removed from the DEFRA website in 2008? Is it because the Government accept legal advice that &quot;West Bank&quot; is misleading and ambiguous and therefore unlawful? Secondly, what is the real reason for the endless delays in finalising new guidance? Is it pressure from Israel, and if so, why does that outweigh international law, obligations to UK consumers and the wishes of UK retailers? Are there technical problems, and if so, what are they? Will the Minister confirm that his prime responsibility is consumer protection in the UK and that that must take precedence over the opinions of foreign Governments? Fourthly, if the question of labelling is so complex, how many officials are currently working on sorting out the matter and coming to a conclusion?</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/26">Fifthly, has the draft guidance gone to Ministers? If it has, to which Ministers has it gone and which Ministers have approved the guidelines so far? Finally, is the Minister aware of labelling guidance in other EU member states? I draw his attention to the example of wine from the Golan heights, which is apparently sold in Swedish Government stores-they control all alcohol sales in Sweden-labelled as &quot;Made in Occupied Syrian land&quot;. That seems to be an extremely good precedent. It is not ambiguous or misleading and it does not recognise the Israeli settlements in Syrian Golan heights.</p>
	<p pid="e.101.1/27">The delays in enforcing clear and unambiguous labelling of settlement goods is yet another example of the Government's pusillanimous approach in matters relating to the Israeli occupation. It is not enough to make declaratory statements, as the Foreign Office frequently does, recognising that the occupation is illegal. Those declaratory statement must be backed up by practical policies to give force to that recognition of illegality. Clear labelling of settlement goods is one way in which the Government could do that and, at the same time, fulfil their legal obligations to UK consumers on clarity.</p>

	<p pid="e.109.0/1">I am enjoying the hon. Gentleman's contribution. Does he think that there is a great untold story in this recession? The reason why unemployment is not higher is that, unlike in previous recessions, management and trade unions, through partnership working, have negotiated short-time working, pay freezes or, in many cases, even temporary pay cuts? That is a tribute to management leadership and to modern trade unionism, which have both played their part in trying to help us get through the recession.</p>

	<p pid="e.111.3/1">That subtlety had eluded me and justifies my opening remark that I will learn as much from the debate as I assert, so I thank the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="e.111.3/2">If Members will bear with me, I want to argue that the Government must do more strategically, meaning that they must do more in the way of having an industrial policy. After all, there must be some explanation why our manufacturing industry has shrunk faster than in other nations, which have all faced the same threat from the Chinas and Indias of the world, and why we may currently be making smaller inroads in the new export markets, such as China. I do not want to argue that the Government must do that, but they are inescapably bound to play a strategic role and cannot avoid doing so. It is inescapable. They must do that either skilfully, or in a ham-fisted fashion.</p>
	<p pid="e.111.3/3">There are three reasons. The first is that the Government are the sole provider of pubic infrastructure, which can make a vast contribution to prosperity. Consider the multi-billion pound contribution the Government are currently doomed to make to Crossrail, partly to serve the financial services industry. Consider the protracted delays in projects of a similar ilk in the industrial north and midlands-Members from the north and the midlands present will appreciate that point. I could cite the Olive Mount chord in Liverpool as an example of a small engineering project that, had it been in any other city, would long since have been completed, and I dare say that other Members could cite similar instances from their constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="e.111.3/4">When dealing with the current public deficit, we should consider the dangers of dramatic and ill-planned reductions in capital spending where that spending actually engineers development and economic growth. Some people believe it does not do that, but there is good empirical evidence to indicate that is exactly what it customarily does.</p>
	<p pid="e.111.3/5">One has to tie in our poor manufacturing performance-or our relatively poor manufacturing performance, as there are also success stories-with our very poor record on public infrastructure when compared with other European nations. I am not sure where we are in the European league table, but we are certainly far lower than we ought to be. That is the first reason why the Government are doomed to play a strategic role and they just need to play it smarter.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-02e.128.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1483" speakername="Kevin Brennan" colnum="128"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091202/halltext/91202h0009.htm#09120234000301">
	<p pid="e.128.3/1">We now know that the hon. Gentleman has an image of himself in an Aston Martin. Perhaps he is thinking of a position in the security services, rather than a position as Minister. I had better move on before you stop me, Mrs. Walley.</p>
	<p pid="e.128.3/2">I congratulate the hon. Member for Southport on securing the debate and on his thoughtful-might I say Socratic?-contribution. He laid out his arguments in a dialogue, rather than in the standard partisan fashion that we have heard in other parts of the debate. It was a very thoughtful contribution.</p>
	<p pid="e.128.3/3">The hon. Gentleman admitted, very honestly, that he had had to do research to acquaint himself more deeply with the particular subject. The only thing that I would say to him is that he might have missed some of the more recent developments in Government to do with the industrial activism that he called for in his contribution. We have to find a happy medium between the free marketeers on the one hand-we are not all marketeers now-given the damage that going too far in that direction has done to our manufacturing economy, and, on the other hand, the kind of command economy that we do not want, which would simply produce all left shoes from the same factory. If he looks at the &quot;New Industry, New Jobs&quot; White Paper and the skills strategy, which the Government recently issued, he will see that the philosophical approach to manufacturing industry that he advocated is quite central to Government thinking.</p>
	<p pid="e.128.3/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1569" name="Andrew Miller">the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase> made an extremely informed contribution to the debate, as ever. He displayed his deep understanding of industry, particularly the motor industry, and also called on the Government to maintain pressure on the banking sector. The Government are still doing a lot to ensure that that sector comes up to the mark. He said that it is not all doom and gloom, and I think that he is right. Confidence is important at this point in the economic cycle. We should have confidence; there are signs that we are moving in the right direction and there is certainly a bright future for British manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="e.128.3/5">When we last debated the subject, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> slapped a preservation notice on me because I was in a British car. Thanks to his efforts, I am still here. I thank him for that. He was right to point out the renaissance in Government of the idea of industrial activism and of a positive manufacturing strategy. He made some powerful points about Rolls-Royce, the obligations of companies and the need to take the longer view. We are learning that lesson in Government. The rush to divest ourselves of assets in the '80s and '90s may have left the Government without the levers that they need to be able to pursue the industrial activism that we have been discussing. We rue that selling of the family silver, as a former Conservative Prime Minister once put it. I note my hon. Friend's call for a national jobs summit, and his call for a jobs subsidy; he made such a call last time, too. I cannot currently guarantee that, but I heard his observations.</p>
	<p pid="e.128.3/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1966" name="John Thurso">The hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> made an extremely perceptive and thoughtful contribution. He has a great deal of business experience. He made perceptive observations about world-leading British manufacturing, the importance of the green economy and the importance of the sort of proactive decisions that have to be taken-the sort that we have taken through our skills strategy. If he looks at the skills strategy, he will find that he is able to support the development of the new technician class, which the Government seek to develop through that strategy.</p>
	<p pid="e.128.3/7">I should like to refer to the other hon. Members who contributed to the debate, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase>. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" name="Tom Watson">the Member for West Bromwich, East (Mr. Watson)</phrase>, informed us of some of the reasons why, statistically, we should not be so pessimistic about jobs in manufacturing. Some of the jobs that have been outsourced might previously have been counted as manufacturing jobs, but although they were important, they were, in fact, ancillary to the direct activity of manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="e.128.3/8">I should give the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford credit for recognising the importance of apprenticeships, which his party left to wither on the vine, so that they were almost at the point of extinction by 1997. Rather than apprenticeships declining, as he suggested, they have been rescued by the Government. Only 75,000 apprenticeships were in place in 1997, and two thirds of them were not even completed. The completion rate for apprenticeships was a third. There are now three times that many apprenticeships, and there is a two-thirds completion rate. On top of that, we have also invested very heavily in skills training in the workplace through policies such as unionlearn, which the hon. Gentleman's party vigorously opposed, and Train to Gain. I think that he wants to abolish Train to Gain to fund his party's policies, so he is not talking about any new investment in skills.</p>

	<p pid="e.131.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue, which is really about what we think prisons are for. In an answer to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1687" name="Maria Eagle">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Garston (Maria Eagle)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The National Offender Management Service is undertaking a budget review process... to determine the budget for prisons in 2010-11.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/3">She added that</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/4" class="indent">&quot;prisons are using indicative guidelines of a 5 per cent. budget reduction but their final budgets will not be determined until the review process is complete, later this year.&quot;-[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2009-11-30.448"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 November 2009; Vol. 501, c. 448W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/5">Let me make it clear to the House that I readily acknowledge that, given both main parties have said that they will ring-fence spending on health and international development, consequential spending reductions in other Departments are inevitable whoever wins the general election next year. We all have to be sufficiently grown up to acknowledge that. We certainly need to acknowledge it in the presence of my colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1755" name="Andrew Smith">the right hon. Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith)</phrase>, who is a former Chief Secretary to the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/6">The thrust of what I want to get across to the House this afternoon is that cutting prison budgets per se is the wrong approach. We send people to prison because society believes it an appropriate punishment and to deter others from committing similar offences. However, the punishment is the deprivation of liberty for a period of time. We should be using prison and the time that people spend there to ensure that when they leave they have the skills, competences and qualifications to ensure that they do not reoffend.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/7">There are two truly depressing things in this. First, when I visit HM prison Bullingdon, which is a local prison for Oxfordshire and the Thames valley, I meet a large number of men-a huge proportion-who are involved in some form of substance abuse, which means alcohol, drugs or both, as well as a huge number who are functionally illiterate. That is fundamentally depressing. The second depressing thing is the number of people in prison who have reoffended. Reducing reoffending rates would be not only be beneficial for society, because there would be fewer victims of crime, but cost-effective, as there would be fewer people in prison.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/8">The official parliamentary answer is that the 5 per cent. cut is just for this coming year and one does not know what will happen in future, but it presents governors with the prospect of 5 per cent. year-on-year reductions in prison budgets. I understand that most governors are working on the basis that they will have rolling cuts of 5 per cent. a year for the next three years. Where in a prison does one make those cuts? There seem to be only two areas: one cuts either opportunities for training, education or access to substance and drug abuse programmes, or the number of prison officers.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/9">A 5 per cent. reduction in Bullingdon's budget is about &#163;1.3 million on a budget of &#163;17 million. Some &#163;1.3 million is the equivalent of having to make 120 prison officers at Bullingdon redundant. As prison officers have explained, all they will be able to do is keep prisoners locked up longer-for more hours-because officers will not be available to escort prisoners or supervise them in education and training. They will be warehousing men and doing little else.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/10">Bullingdon has been built since I have been the Member of Parliament for north Oxfordshire. Before that, the local prison was Oxford jail in the heart of Oxford. That status came to Bullingdon in the early 1990s. I hope the Prison Officers Association will excuse my saying so, but at that time it was a pretty neanderthal trade union. On one occasion way back in the 1990s-some 15 or so years ago-it refused to allow me to attend a meeting because I might influence what its members thought, and that was that.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/11">Over the past 15 years, from my perspective the POA has moved phenomenally from being truculent and difficult to wanting to engage in training programmes and education programmes and wanting to help with substance abuse programmes. The POA branch at Bullingdon has built a training facility outside the prison walls for prison officers, which it is sharing with the rest of the community because the officers want to encourage the community to engage more with them and their work at Bullingdon.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/12">The prison officers now find fundamentally depressing the thought that they will simply be engaged in keeping people under lock and key for longer periods. That would be a great pity, given that we have started to get a culture moving in the prison with people involved in the Prison Service. We are seeing that officers have a role in ensuring that people who leave prison are better equipped to deal with the outside world and have more skills than when they came in, but things might just go back to the rather Victorian notion of prison.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/13">I hear it said on the grapevine that the Secretary of State for Justice believes that layers of middle management in the Prison Service can be stripped out and that the 5 per cent. can be achieved there. If he genuinely believes that prisons are over-managed or that there are too many layers of management, I suggest that he make that clear. I am sure that, if he believes prisons are over-managed in some way, he can strip out the over-management. However, even if we took out all the managers, apart from the governor, I doubt whether we could meet the 5 per cent. target at Bullingdon.</p>
	<p pid="e.131.1/14">A lot of work is being done in Oxfordshire with charities such as SMART and in trying to get people who leave prison to integrate into the community more speedily and ensure that they do not go back on drugs, all of which requires work being done inside and outside the prison.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-02e.134.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1911" speakername="Claire Ward" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice"  colnum="134"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091202/halltext/91202h0010.htm#09120234000307">
	<p pid="e.134.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> for securing the debate and for his sustained interest in Bullingdon prison. I suspect that it would be of some interest if he were to send a copy of his speech to his party's Front-Bench team. He takes a rather more refreshing look at policy on this issue, and what he says clearly does not chime very well with his party's views.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/2">It is always good to explore and clarify issues relating to the National Offender Management Service in general and to prisons in particular. Parliamentary scrutiny is especially important because of the closed nature of the prison system. The opportunity to achieve much greater accountability to the public for the work that goes on in prisons on behalf of the public and the taxpayer is also important. The Government are acutely aware that imprisonment involves two stories: that of the offender in custody, with his or her experiences and opportunities for reform, and that of the victim or potential victim of crime, whose safety must be paramount.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/3">In recent years, Bullingdon has become renowned as a prison that provides decent conditions and care for prisoners. It offers an exceptional range of programmes to help reduce the risk of reoffending and therefore also the risk of harm being done to victims and communities after people are released. I am sure that prison officers and other staff at Bullingdon will be pleased to hear the hon. Gentleman's kind comments about their work. That progress has not, however, happened in a vacuum. Bullingdon has received close managerial attention from NOMS and has benefited from sizeable investment in activities, programmes and treatment services.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/4">One of the most rewarding aspects of my role as a Minister has been to see the passion and determination of prison and probation professionals at every level in protecting the public and helping offenders to lead decent and law-abiding lives after release. When prison officers go home after work, they return to the communities in which they live, and they certainly want to be able to protect their families, friends and neighbours from the risk of becoming victims of crime. In every prison that I have visited, I have been struck by the desire of staff to see offenders change their lives, to leave prison with hope and opportunity, to go on to a much better life in the community and to do things that ensure that they do not return to prison life.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/5">I acknowledge that the hon. Gentleman shares those views on behalf of his constituents. I am also aware of his enthusiasm for rehabilitation and the work that Bullingdon does; as a Minister, I share that enthusiasm. If we do not take that view, the alternative for individuals is a life of continuing offending that will continue to damage communities. That will affect victims and offenders' families and ensure that the fear of crime continues, ruining the quality of so many of our constituents' lives.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/6">As successive Governments have found, there is no quick fix to cut crime or reoffending; individual prisons or probation teams working in isolation have not managed to have the beneficial impact that they would all have hoped for. For that reason, the Government created NOMS, which brings together the probation service and the Prison Service for England and Wales. The primary purpose of NOMS is to reduce reoffending, making the public safer and earning greater confidence in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/7">Most crime takes place in local communities, and the forces that shape offending are best understood at a local level. Patterns of deprivation, the poor educational attainment that the hon. Gentleman mentioned, housing shortages, substance misuse, which he also mentioned, and unemployment will vary from place to place and will contribute to a greater or lesser extent to social exclusion and criminality. For that reason, local and regional solutions are likely to be much more effective in targeting support, challenge and intervention where they are most needed.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/8">NOMS is formed of 10 regions for England and Wales, each with a single director of offender management who is responsible for both prisons and probation and whose primary task is to reduce reoffending in his or her region. By developing regional structures and understanding the realities of real people in real communities, directors of offender management can, for the first time, target resources where they are needed most. At a practical level, that could mean understanding, for example, that for an individual prison, unemployment is likely to be a more critical factor than availability of settled accommodation and investing proportionately more in work skills and job seeking than in housing services.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/9">When money is tight, it is more important than ever to spend wisely. Region by region, NOMS is undertaking needs analyses of local communities, identifying which localities generate the most crime and analysing the underlying causes. By commissioning the right interventions for offenders in the right places and co-commissioning the right support in the community for ex-offenders, directors of offender management are in a position to make a difference to rates of offending.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/10">NOMS, like other public sector bodies, will be required to make savings over the coming years, reflecting the reality of the circumstances in which we have all operated since the global economic crisis, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Bullingdon prison, as part of NOMS, will have to play its role in finding savings, but that does not necessarily mean cutting services. On the contrary, it is more about identifying how it can operate more efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/11">Major organisational change is not achieved overnight. NOMS has been supporting projects to release resources across the prison estate, and the results will be used to reduce the need for local regime reductions. For example, all prison establishments in England and Wales have been working to identify flatter management structures to reduce management overheads and optimise resources for front-line staff. NOMS central and regional headquarters have been reduced significantly in size and head count to ensure that the maximum possible proportion of resource is devoted to prison establishments and probation teams in the community.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/12">In his report &quot;Securing the Future&quot;, published in December 2007 and accepted by the Government, my noble Friend Lord Carter of Coles recommended that an operational specification that adequately reflects the characteristics of individual prisons should be produced for each category of prison. He also recommended that such specifications should be costed and operated through a framework of service-level agreements.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/13">In response, NOMS has undertaken a programme of specifications, benchmarking and costing that will ensure that the recommendations are met for all prisons in England and Wales by 2011-12. To achieve that goal, NOMS is undertaking a major programme of benchmarking and costing its processes in public sector prisons to identify the most efficient practices and establish those &quot;best in class&quot; examples for wider adoption. Significant savings have already been released, and it is anticipated that over the next three years, every aspect of imprisonment and offender management will be subjected to the same rigorous approach, to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary processes without affecting the quality of experience or rehabilitative opportunities for offenders.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/14">Good financial planning is every bit as important at times of resource reduction as it is when additional money is available. NOMS regions in particular are closely involved not only in monitoring current spending but in planning how resources should be allocated for future years. In the NOMS south-east region, in which Bullingdon is a key prison establishment, governors have been asked to make savings plans to meet a range of possible planning assumptions.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/15">Because prison governors are best placed to form judgments about where resources can be saved as well as what the impacts are likely to be, the governor of Bullingdon prison, along with his colleagues elsewhere, was asked to identify a financial planning exercise showing how he would make savings at 5 per cent. of his 2009-10 budget. The plans were to include an assessment of difficulty, impact and risk for each item proposed. They were collated and considered by the regional custodial manager, herself an experienced former prison governor, and the regional manager for finance and performance.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/16">The actual savings planned for Bullingdon are significantly less severe than the full range of savings proposals; they are nearer to the average reduction of 3.5 per cent. across the region and contain no requirement to make savings that have been assessed as having significant impact, negative impact or high risk.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/17">In contrast to some of the very high figures that have been cited-indeed, the hon. Gentleman cited some of them in this debate-we anticipate that the likely reduction in staff posts at Bullingdon as a result of the required savings in 2010-11 will involve just 16 uniformed staff and a further two managers. Equally importantly, the prison is not being asked to make savings that run counter to the commissioning priorities of NOMS for the south-east region.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/18">Specifically, the hon. Gentleman will be very glad to know that at Bullingdon prison there will be no reduction in education provision, drug treatment services, sex offender treatment programmes, accredited offending behaviour programmes, health services for prisoners, offender management provision or public protection provision. That underlines the importance that we place upon those services, even in difficult financial times.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/19">Our spending reductions are inevitable in Bullingdon prison and across the NOMS. In making their choices, it is apparent that the governor and director of offender management at the prison are actively seeking to ensure that they do not adversely affect the quality of life or the quality of rehabilitation services for prisoners. That approach is mirrored across the south-east region, of which Bullingdon is a part, and across the wider NOMS estate.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/20">The hon. Gentleman went on to talk a little more widely about the purpose of prison and sentencing policy. A number of interested groups argue that the prison population is too high. I am not sure that that view is shared by the main political parties; it is certainly not shared by the hon. Gentleman's Conservative colleagues, who suggest that we should have even greater capacity in the prison estate than that being provided at the moment by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/21">We imprison a relatively high proportion of offenders. Clearly, Governments can choose to operate cheap criminal justice by declining to imprison even those people who pose a real danger to the public. However, it is the right of each democratic country to determine for itself what is and what is not acceptable behaviour on the part of its citizens, and the penalties that will be exacted for crime.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/22">The Government have a very clear sentencing framework. We promote community-based penalties for low-risk offenders, and we have done that through the extension of out-of-court disposals. Those disposals are not only for those over the age of 18. Indeed, we have launched a new range of out-of-court disposals-some were even launched this week-with the youth rehabilitation orders and the opportunities for greater use by the courts, in some circumstances, of methods to move young people away from imprisonment. There are also other forms of disposals, whereby people are not hitting the courts at all.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/23">We have imposed tougher custodial sentences for higher-risk and dangerous criminals. Furthermore, the Government have consistently taken the view that, for some offenders, community punishment can deliver better outcomes than short custodial sentences. To support that, we have made available to the courts a wide range of tough non-custodial sentences and we encourage the use of those sentences whenever possible. Community-based penalties are a core part of the criminal justice service. In 2007, 196,400 such penalties were imposed, which was 40 per cent. more than in 1997. That shows the importance of having a tough sentencing policy that is also fair and deals with the range of criminality.</p>
	<p pid="e.134.0/24">In conclusion, I remain grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his interest in Bullingdon prison, both as a single establishment and as part of the wider prison estate. Like other parts of the public sector, Bullingdon will face financial challenges and must find ways to work at lowering its costs without putting public safety at risk. I believe that the prison, working together with NOMS, will be able to do that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-12-02e.142.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1911" speakername="Claire Ward" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice"  colnum="142"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm091202/halltext/91202h0011.htm#09120234000316">
	<p pid="e.142.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> on securing this important debate. The fact that this is the fifth debate that we have had on pleural plaques demonstrates the importance of the issue, not just to hon. Members across the political parties but, more importantly, to their constituents and those whose lives are impacted by this state of affairs. We recognise that pleural plaques are a major issue for many people, particularly those who have worked in traditional manufacturing industries where exposure to asbestos was an all too common danger.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.1/2">As my hon. Friend mentioned, our consultation on pleural plaques closed at the beginning of October last year. I understand hon. Members' concerns about the time that it has taken to reach conclusions in the light of the consultation. The decision by the House of Lords raised extremely complex and difficult issues that have required careful consideration within Government. It has also been important to look beyond the issue of pleural plaques to consider how people who have been exposed to asbestos can be supported more widely. We have made it clear throughout that it is important to ensure that any decisions taken are reached on the basis of the best available medical evidence on the nature of pleural plaques. For that reason, we have commissioned and published reviews of the medical evidence carried out on behalf of the chief medical officer for England and Wales and by the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council to help to inform consideration of the issue. The reports indicate that consensus appears to exist on a range of key points relating to the medical nature of pleural plaques.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.1/3">However, in response to representations from asbestos campaigners and a request by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase>, the Secretary of State for Justice undertook to facilitate a final meeting between key medical experts in the field to consider the medical reports together with new evidence that has emerged since the reports were published. That was to make sure that any areas of disagreement over the evidence and conclusions in the reports could be identified and fully considered. The meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-15">15 October</phrase> and was extremely helpful and informative. The Government are giving careful consideration to the outcome of the discussion and the views expressed before publishing their response on pleural plaques.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.1/4">The Government have been consistent in their commitment to give those suffering from mesothelioma and other serious asbestos-related diseases the help and support that they deserve. With that in mind, the Secretary of State for Justice confirmed that the Government are actively considering measures to make the UK a global leader in research for the alleviation, prevention and cure of asbestos-related diseases, and also to help speed up compensation claims for those who develop serious asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma. That includes examination of the process for tracking and tracing employment and insurance records, as my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport mentioned, as well as looking into the support given to individuals who are unable to trace such records. We fully accept that the current arrangements for tracing employers' liability and insurance policies are not satisfactory. Too many individuals are not able to access the compensation that they deserve. The situation is not acceptable and we are determined to do more. We are looking seriously at options such as setting up a mandatory tracing database and whether we might establish an employers' liability insurance bureau as a fund of last resort, as recommended by several hon. Members. Further details of the Government's plans on these extremely important issues will be announced shortly.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.1/5">Provisions in the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 were brought into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2009-10-01">1 October</phrase> last year by colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions. They provide up-front financial support to mesothelioma sufferers who were previously not eligible for help from the Government, including those, such as the constituent of my hon. Friend, who were exposed to asbestos as the result of contact with a relative. Someone's exposure could have taken place, for example, by washing the work clothes of their father or husband. Where sufferers have not been able to make a claim during their lifetime, a payment under the scheme can be made to their dependents.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.1/6">The provisions demonstrate the Government's commitment to help people who suffer from the effects of this terrible disease, which includes many people in my hon. Friend's constituency. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1540" name="Gary Streeter">The hon. Member for South-West Devon (Mr. Streeter)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase> have raised this issue, not just on this occasion, but on many occasions, with Government Ministers. The latest available analysis by local and unitary area of mesothelioma deaths in Britain shows that there were 373 male mesothelioma deaths in Plymouth during the 25-year period from 1981 to 2005, which is more than three times the average death rate for the whole of Britain. Based on that analysis, Plymouth has the third highest rate in Britain. Most of the areas with the highest mortality rates in the analysis are associated with the shipbuilding industry, in which asbestos was widely used for insulation in the past. Female mesothelioma deaths in Plymouth over the period were in line with expected numbers based on the average rate for Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="e.142.1/7">We have continued to raise awareness of the risks of asbestos through the Health and Safety Executive's campaign, &quot;Asbestos the Hidden Killer&quot;, which was relaunched on <phrase class="date" code="2009-11-02">2 November 2009</phrase>. It aims to raise awareness among tradesmen, pointing out that they are more at risk than they think from asbestos and prompting them to find out more about asbestos and the precautions they should take. National press and radio adverts will run for four weeks, supported by public relations activity. Partner organisations, including the TUC, unions, trade associations, trade stores and charities have distributed about half a million campaign packs to trade and maintenance workers. It is extremely important that we raise awareness among a group who, proportionally, face a much higher risk than the greater population.</p>
