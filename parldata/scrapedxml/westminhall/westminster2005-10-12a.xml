<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-12a.74.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051012/halltext/51012h01.htm#51012h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.74.1/1">I do indeed. Mitsui Babcock is a leader in that field; I shall suggest later one or two mechanisms by which that sort of technology could be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2">The current increases in gas prices could be the start of a trend. If we diversify the energy mix, including clean coal, we would improve the security of supply and decrease the risks of rapid price rises in a totally dominant energy sector destabilising the economy in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/3">Moreover, coal-fired power stations offer something that no other energy source can match: flexibility to meet demand. Coal can be stockpiled at power stations and used to provide base load, but its supply also has the capability of being turned up and down to meet peaks in demand. Electricity generated from nuclear and gas-fired power stations is not flexible enough to deal with severe fluctuations in demand during winter months. For example, during summer, about 350 GWh of electricity is produced by gas-fired plant and a little more than 250 GWh by coal-fired plant. That position is reversed come the winter, when gas remains at about 350 GWh and coal increases to 390 GWh, with a maximum provision of 420 GWh.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/4">Having established the overriding principle of diversity, we have to make coal fit for purpose environmentally. The Minister is now the seventh holder of the position of Minister for Energy since 1997. Each of his predecessors reaffirmed the Government's commitment to invest in clean coal to produce results. Indeed, the energy White Paper makes it clear that in a low carbon economy, the future for coal must lie in cleaner coal technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/5">However, it is no longer enough just to back research. In a former life, the Minister was a distinguished academic at the university of York in my constituency. In time, I want to be able to recommend him for a honorary degree from York on the basis that he was the one of the magnificent seven Energy Ministers who, in the end, persuaded the Treasury, No. 10, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&mdash;whoever it was who had to be persuaded&mdash;to commit resources to invest in clean coal as opposed to only research. My hon. Friend will be aware that the &pound;40 million funding offered in the recently published carbon abatement technology strategy, which concentrated on carbon capture and storage research&mdash;a welcome measure&mdash;is somewhat dwarfed by the $1 billion that President Bush has assigned to the FutureGen initiative. Among other things, its aim is to develop the world's first coal-based, zero-emissions electricity power plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/6">If we in the United Kingdom are really serious about developing workable technologies, that ambition has to be matched at some stage by serious funding. Time does not permit me to talk about the details of clean coal technology; it may be covered by other speakers or in tonight's debate. I want instead to make a couple of suggestions about how the Minister could act to provide regulatory certainty for clean coal producers and give incentives for clean coal production.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/7">In the short term, the quickest way for coal-fired power stations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions is to co-fire with biomass. For example, Drax Power Ltd., the owner of the largest coal-fired power station in the United Kingdom, has ambitions to increase biomass to 20 per cent. of total coal burn. To be able to sell such coal-fired electricity to suppliers under the renewables obligation, stations have first to acquire renewables obligation certificates. The Government currently cap the share of the ROC market that can be accounted for by co-firing to 25 per cent. Next year, the cap will be cut drastically to 10 per cent. The expansion of co-firing that would result from the simple action of maintaining the cap at 25 per cent. would save 2.5 million equivalent tonnes of carbon dioxide a year and maintain much more coal burn.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/8">Will the Minister deal with an anomaly that could threaten the successful operation of phase 2 of the European Union emissions trading scheme, proposals for which will have to be submitted to the European Commission by June 2006? At present, a perverse advantage is being offered to those coal-fired power stations that are not equipped with flue gas desulphurisation units. The carbon allocations distributed under phase 1 of the scheme are calculated using historical output on the basis that that provided a reliable prediction of future carbon production.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/9">As for coal-fired power stations, the lifetime of several plants in the United Kingdom will be limited under the terms of the large combustion plant directive. However, the plants without FGD units are in receipt of the same carbon allocations as those afforded to FGD-equipped stations. The FGD stations will be put at a disadvantage even though Drax, West Burton, Cottam, Eggborough and other power stations have invested millions of pounds in the equipment. It could be a start if carbon allocations were increased at those power stations that have made an investment in cleaning up their act, as opposed to, what is in effect, rewarding them for making no such effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/10">A number of the mechanisms that could be adopted as incentives for clean coal would provide some financial inducement. For example, we could mirror the renewables obligation with a clean coal technology obligation, encouraging electricity suppliers to source specified percentages of the electricity that they supply from stations fitted with both FDG and carbon abatement technologies. Alternatively, the Government could offer long-term carbon contracts to clean coal producers, perhaps under the auspices of the EU emissions trading scheme. Under that proposal, the Government would guarantee prices for the purchase of carbon allocations left unutilised by plant employing specified carbon abatement technology. That would provide a revenue stream to underpin the investment made in the equipment. Every producer would have an incentive to save carbon using clean coal technology in order to cash in on the guaranteed prices for unused carbon allocations. The Government could then sell on those unused allocations to other industrial sectors&mdash;according to studies that I have seen, they might even make a profit on the deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/11">However, even if we create a future for clean coal generation, what is the future for British coal production? Of the 25.1 million tonnes produced in Britain last year, around 12.5 million tonnes came from deep-mined production with some 12 million tonnes from open-cast. The open-cast sector is still a substantial and important contributor to UK coal production, but the extent to which that continues to be true will depend on planning policy and on the outcome of various planning applications&mdash;my hon. Friends want to refer to some of those later.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/12">Only eight deep mines are still operating: Daw Mill, Thoresby, Welbeck, Maltby, Tower, Kellingley in my constituency, Harworth and Rossington&mdash;although the last two are due to be placed in care and maintenance from next spring by their owner, UK Coal. For UK coal production to survive beyond this Parliament in a meaningful way, and for reasons of diversity and security, it is imperative that the Government top up the &pound;60 million of investment aid. To ask for bids for the third term of the scheme when &pound;57.53 million of the original allocation has already been allocated makes little sense; the presumption is that more money will be assigned. At Kellingley pit, to which many former Selby miners have moved, a bid for &pound;13 million of investment aid is part of a &pound;48 million plan to provide access to over 17 million tonnes of reserves at the site. Without that investment aid, the future of the remaining pits will be under greater threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/13">I understand that the Government are considering not paying investment aid for schemes at Harworth and Rossington because the pits are to be mothballed. That is superficially an attractive idea, but it is worth remembering that no money is handed over to UK Coal until work has been completed. So long as that has been done in those cases, I fear that if the Government go down the route of claiming money back, the extra transfer of risk will mean that no private company will claim investment aid. Unless nationalisation is to be announced&mdash;I do not expect my hon. Friend the Minister to advocate that today&mdash;such reclamation of aid will only hasten the demise of UK coal production.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/14">There is a strong case for making UK Coal more accountable in return for aid, and I would advocate transferring the administration of the investment aid scheme from the Department of Trade and Industry directly to the Coal Authority, which has a great knowledge of the industry, and which can better insist that if UK Coal claims public money for coal production it must demonstrate that it is interested in more than property development.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/15">Germany's domestic coal industry is similar in size to that of the UK, and it has recently received approval from the European Commission for an aid package totalling &euro;12 billion to assist it until 2010. I do not suggest anything on such a scale, but given the sums that are going to renewables and nuclear, I think that we can afford between &pound;30 million and &pound;50 million in investment aid for the next five years. If announcements could be made well in advance, that would help the industry to plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/16">In my view, large-scale private investment in future coal production is likely only if the generators of coal power can offer long-term contracts to the producers. That could be a quid pro quo for the Government's offering the generators the sort of long-term carbon contracts that I discussed Earlier. I note that the investment aid scheme is up for review in Europe in 2006. I hope that the Government will contribute to that review, and that we can extend the scheme until 2010, as is allowed under EU rules, and consider expanding its scope.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/17">I want to put on record my thanks to the Labour Government for all their work in regenerating former coalfield areas and helping former miners. To give but one example of what they have done, I can tell the Chamber that in Selby, just one year after closure, fewer than 60 of the 2,000 miners who were employed at the Selby mine complex are out of work. That did not happen by accident; it happened because of investment, political will and retraining. The experience in Selby was very different to that in neighbouring coalfield areas in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/18">Real partnership is possible in the industry between miners and management. For example, at Kellingley in my constituency, a determined but fair manager, Bill Tinsley, has won the respect of all the unions. Change has been achieved. Kellingley is not unique, but it provides a good template.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/19">I ask the Government to intervene in the market with a five or 10-year plan for clean coal that gives some regulatory and price certainty to coal generators and ensures long-term coal contracts for a clean, modern coal industry. I think that we will win the case for clean coal in the forthcoming energy review, but unless the Government act quickly on investment aid, there may well be little British coal production left by then. I want the Minister to be remembered as the man who, in the interests of energy diversity, gave a kick start to clean coal, and not as the man who finally buried &quot;King Coal&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-12a.93.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1579" speakername="Bernard Jenkin" colnum="93"  time="010:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051012/halltext/51012h01.htm#51012h01_spnew20">
	<p pid="a.93.0/1">I join others in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> on having secured the debate. It has been interesting and passionate, and I do not envy the Minister having to reply to it. I suspect that he can say little that is constructive because everything is hanging fire pending an energy review.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/2">An energy policy has to provide three basic outcomes in order to be a success. It has to provide fair pricing to domestic and industrial consumers; it has to comply with our environmental objectives; and it has to provide security of supply. The Minister's difficulty is that the energy policy that the Government have pursued for the past eight years has resulted in the achievement of none of those objectives. Our industrial consumers are paying the highest prices in Europe, and that is going to hit our domestic consumers too; we are failing to achieve our environmental targets; and the security of supply situation is extremely precarious, as Minister knows, given that he has to deal with it daily.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/3">Everything that we have heard today confirms that coal could be an important component in our strategy to tackle the security of supply. How is the Minister going to address that question if he is not allowed consider it until next year, because the Prime Minister does not want to have a review of energy policy until next year? The issue is more urgent than the Prime Minister and the Minister seem to understand. I agree that it is important for our country to develop clean coal technology, not least, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1740" name="Edward Balls">the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls)</phrase> said, because it will be highly exportable technology and there is little point in our achieving our environmental targets on our own. We need to come up with ideas and technologies that we can export to the rest of the world so that the whole world will be bound into environmental technologies. Coal will outlast oil as a source of global energy by a long way, possibly by hundreds of years. If we are at the forefront of the technology for clean coal, we will put Britain in a strategically strong position, and if we provide a market for our coal, we will also provide improved security of supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/4">Will the Minister, simply and briefly, address the issue of intervention in energy markets? The renewables obligation certificate is a massive intervention in our domestic energy market. How can he justify putting up to &pound;1 billion of subsidy into one form of renewable energy without making an assessment as to whether it provides good value for money compared with other possible destinations for such intervention in the market? I agree with those who have suggested that we should consider a non-carbon obligation certificate rather than just a renewables obligation certificate, because the former would target the carbon abatement and carbon sequestration technologies in a way that the existing regime does not.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.0/5">Finally, what will happen to the emissions trading scheme? There are no plans for it beyond 2012. How is an industry that has to make very long-term investment decisions meant to make them when there is now uncertainty on the part of other countries&mdash;especially those that are breaching the Kyoto targets by a long way&mdash;about whether they want to continue with the emissions trading scheme at all? What is the scheme's future? Is that not yet another issue that needs to be tipped into a proper policy review of energy issues so that we come up with a comprehensive energy policy instead of bolting this and that on to the regime that the Government inherited from the Conservatives eight and a half years ago? Things move on, but I do not think that the Government's policy has.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-12a.99.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister"  colnum="99"  time="011:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051012/halltext/51012h02.htm#51012h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.99.0/1">Mr. Cook, it is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">The hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> makes a strong case on the supply and use of smoke alarms, and I welcome this opportunity for the House to consider this important subject. I should say, and I hope that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges the fact, that I am not unsympathetic to the position that he has advanced. I will come to the points that he raised later.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/3">I take this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences to the families mentioned earlier by the hon. Gentleman. As he says, it is clear that there is, sadly, every reason to think that many of those deaths were, in principle, avoidable. Indeed, as the hon. Gentleman said, the house in Rochdale had a smoke alarm fitted, but it was not working on the day of the fire. That is one of the key issues to which I will return in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/4">I assure the House that the Government agree about the importance of a working smoke alarm, which is crucial to give occupants early warning in case of fire and precious time to escape. Smoke alarms are cheap, easy to get hold of and easy to fit, whether they are hard-wired in building construction, contain 10-year lithium batteries, or are even ordinary battery operated alarms.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/5">As it has been mentioned, the Government have, since the mid-1980s, promoted the life-saving benefits of smoke alarms through high-profile media campaigns, most of which have been focused on raising awareness among householders of the need to install and maintain smoke alarms. Those campaigns included &quot;Excuses kill. Get a smoke alarm&quot; and &quot;Push the Button, Not Your Luck&quot;. The strategy has been highly successful and has raised smoke alarm ownership in households in England and Wales, as the hon. Gentleman quoted, from 9 per cent. in 1987 to the current level of about 80 per cent. We estimate that the strategy is saving about 50 lives per year as a direct result.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/6">The Government are determined to increase smoke alarm ownership further. Last October we announced a major fire-prevention programme to target the 1.25 million most vulnerable households, to whom the hon. Gentleman referred. The home fire risk check initiative is a four-year, &pound;25 million funded programme. All English fire and rescue authorities will be funded to help them establish a dedicated programme of home fire risk checks. Moreover, free 10-year battery-operated smoke alarms and, where deemed necessary, automated fire-suppression systems for high-risk households that can be protected in no other way will be installed. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman realises that there is no use in putting smoke detectors in homes where people with disabilities are living independently&mdash;they may alert them to the fact that there is a fire, but they may not be able to move. Therefore, fire-suppression systems for people with disabilities who live in such dwellings may be the only way to protect them.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/7">Fire and rescue services have widely welcomed the initiative, and all are implementing programmes. I am pleased to announce that, since the initiative was established, almost 170,000 home fire risk checks have been undertaken, which has resulted in the installation of almost 190,000 smoke alarms. We are on course to meet our target of reaching 1.25 million vulnerable households by 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/8">Greater Manchester fire and rescue service has received more than &pound;250,000 per annum through the initiative. It has undertaken more than 6,000 home fire risk checks, which have resulted in about 10,000 smoke alarms being installed. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that that is an excellent start.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/9">Moreover, following the tragic fire in Rochdale, Greater Manchester fire and rescue service, working with various agencies, has mounted a media campaign on the importance of fitting smoke alarms in all rented properties. It has pledged to ensure that, within five years, each household will have a working smoke alarm in place. I wholeheartedly support that initiative to help reach those most at risk from fire.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/10">The debate so far has focused, albeit not exclusively, on fire safety in private rented accommodation. As has been mentioned, no statutory requirement is placed on landlords to install and maintain smoke alarms. They are, however, encouraged to do so as a matter of good fire-safety management. That includes ensuring that all exits are kept free from obstruction and that fire apparatus is kept in good condition. Since 1992, building regulations have required that mains-operated smoke alarms be provided in all new dwellings. Government guidance that was issued in 2001 also encourages local authorities and housing associations to provide hard-wired smoke alarms in their dwellings. In addition, local authorities will, from this month, have a power, under the Housing Act 2004, to introduce a licensing scheme for privately owned properties. It is a mandatory condition of any licensing scheme that smoke alarms be provided and maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/11">I am delighted to say that Rochdale metropolitan borough council, with which the hon. Gentleman has a close association, is already acting to raise standards in the private rented sector. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman has been part of that project. In 2004, the council introduced a landlord accreditation scheme that focused on housing-market renewal areas. It now has a landlords' forum with 1,700 members, who, three times a year, receive fire-safety information and details of free home fire safety checks by the local fire and rescue service, which also provides speakers for landlord forum meetings.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/12">All properties offered for accreditation are inspected independently, and smoke alarms are provided and installed for free. Interlinked alarms are provided for vulnerable households. Other free services available to accredited landlords include gas and electrical safety checks and the cost of installation. Asian landlords have been specifically targeted through the local Asian press and radio and through mosques and shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/13">I am also aware of calls for greater use of domestic sprinklers to reduce the risk of fire. We have provided funding through the home fire risk check initiative for sprinkler installation in high-risk households, with a view to assessing their effectiveness in a UK context. We are also tackling another barrier to the use of domestic sprinklers, and that is their high cost. We have funded research into the design and effectiveness of domestic low-cost sprinkler systems, based on work undertaken in other countries. The objective is to examine what can be achieved by way of life-protection from a low-cost domestic sprinkler system using different operating conditions, such as water pressures. The project includes preparation of a cost-benefit analysis for all dwellings and for targeted installation aimed at vulnerable groups, as well as a practical study of sprinkler effectiveness in reducing casualties. Initial findings, I am pleased to say, suggest that a low-cost sprinkler system can be put into a new build house and work effectively, given adequate mains water pressure, at a cost that will be acceptable, I am sure, to the industry and to purchasers.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/14">The Government's overriding objective is to support the fire and rescue service in saving lives, reducing injuries and preventing fires. We have a national target to reduce the number of accidental fire-related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. by 2010, with no local fire and rescue authority having a fatality rate from accidental fires in the home of more than 1.25 times the national average. The Government have put in place the framework to achieve those targets. The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 has put prevention at the heart of the Government's agenda for improving the fire and rescue service and has created a statutory duty to promote fire safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/15">Too many people continue to die needlessly in house fires. Our goal must be no more preventable fire deaths. We have set the direction for the fire and rescue service through the 2004 Act and provided local authorities with new powers to regulate private rented accommodation in the Housing Act 2004. In partnership with landlords and the local community, local authorities and fire and rescue services are already showing what can be achieved, but we must not relax our efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/16">Our aim is not only to have smoke detectors fitted in every home; the Rochdale home had one. Our aim is much more ambitious. It is to educate people about their personal safety and how best to look after themselves and their loved ones. We have made real progress, which is accepted. The increase in the number of smoke detectors installed shows that easily. We have yet to win the constant struggle to persuade people that not only can they look after themselves, but they must.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/17">I hear the hon. Gentleman's request to include in the gas engineer's visit the examination of smoke alarms. I will look into that and write to him in due course. He also raised the question of smoke alarms for the deaf, which, incidentally, reminded me that I had not put my hearing aid in this morning, so I thank him for that. Specialist alarms are already provided under the smoke alarm initiative. They exist and many are being fitted throughout the country. The National Community Fire Safety Centre supports the fire and rescue service's involvement in deaf awareness week, which is another dimension of their activity. Fire services should consider local needs and prioritisation within their integrated risk management plans and strongly encourage all forms of additional protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/18">I hear also the points that have been made about schools. The Department for Education and Skills has been considering sprinkler systems in schools and other building protections, and we are keen to see the outcome of that. I hear the points raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase>, and we will consider them and write to him if appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/19">One of the key issues raised by both hon. Gentlemen is that there is much good practice. I am keen for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to help the existing structures: to work with fire and rescue services, the Chief and Assistant Chief Fire Officers Association and the structures within which fire and rescue services are organised in order to make sure that best practice, which is being developed in local brigades, is brought to the attention of the national fire service and rolled out if appropriate. One of the key elements of the 2004 Act is that we have delegated much more responsibility for the design and deployment of the local safety plan and the number of fire stations, appliances, fire fighters and other staff to local chief fire officers and local councillors.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/20">No community is the same as any other. The dangers for each community must be addressed by the people who understand them: the local elected councillors, the principal chief fire officers and other fire staff. We need to make sure that they are aware of progress across the country in a variety of different ways, so that they do not have to reinvent for every area what works best. If an initiative suits a local community, neighbourhood or fire authority area, they should be able to follow it. I can see that that patchwork effect is happening. An imaginative campaign was run in Northern Ireland, in which the slogan &quot;Thumbs up, it's Friday&quot; was used on buses and billboards to encourage people to check their smoke detectors on Fridays.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/21">The hon. Gentleman spoke about gas engineers making annual inspections. Smoke detectors need to be checked weekly, especially the one-year battery operated ones. In too many of the give-away schemes that we have run, smoke detectors have ended up being exchanged in the local pub for a variety of other favours. Too often, their batteries are taken out for television remote controls or children's toys, particularly at Christmas, which is an especially dangerous time. A weekly check that the smoke alarm battery is functioning is most important, but an annual check is also critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.0/22">In England, we have run the national &quot;Push the Button! Not Your Luck&quot; campaign. We need to keep reinforcing that message to educate people that there are systems to protect them and their families. We want to provide that protection collectively. A key message in my many visits to fire brigades in the past few months is that fire is not a party political issue; there is genuine consensus across all parties. We are there to support the service and to protect the public. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for securing the debate and allowing us to play our part in reinforcing the message.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss a subject that emerged during the summer recess as one of the dominant issues facing us. I have tailored my comments in anticipation of a Department of Trade and Industry Minister responding to the debate, but clearly there are other aspects to the subject, which relate most notably to the Treasury. A set of important issues relate to the DTI, and I shall touch on some of them briefly. They include the question of Government intervention in the oil markets, upstream investment in the North sea, the shortage of gas, if there is such a thing, competitiveness, the conservation agenda and the implications for alternative energy, and fuel poverty. At best, I shall simply tick some of them and ask questions about others.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/2">To put the subject into a personal and an historical context, I first became aware of the potential for oil shocks 30 years ago, when I worked in government as an official, not as a Minister. I was responsible for British foreign policy on Latin America, and on Venezuela in particular. Mr. Perez Alfonso, the Venezuelan Oil Minister and father of OPEC, had coined the term &quot;the Devil's excrement&quot; to describe oil. The point that he was trying to make was that oil was a necessary part of the functioning of society and economies, but that it had all sorts of unpleasant environmental, economic and social side effects.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/3">In the past year, we have encountered some of the predominantly negative effects of an oil shock. It is not of the scale that we endured in the mid-1970s and early 1980s&mdash;at least not yet&mdash;but it has the potential to be. Oil prices more than doubled between 1998 and 2003, increasing from an average of $13 to $31. They doubled again in the following two years: Brent crude is now just under $60, and at one point it was close to $70. Wholesale gas prices have roughly doubled in the past two years, and they increased very substantially in the two years before that.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/4">I shall start by identifying some of the consequences that we have already experienced. Overall, the consequences might be less severe and dramatic than they were a generation ago, because our economy and that of most other western countries is now less dependent on oil and on energy in general as a share of GDP. That is partly because western societies, including our own, have made an effort to conserve, but mainly it is because of deindustrialisation. None the less, there have been some substantial impacts, as we saw yesterday in the published figures for inflation, which is now more than 3 per cent. annually compared with 1.1 per cent. in September last year. Not all of that is because of energy issues, but a substantial part of it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/5">According to the energy watchdog, family gas bills have risen from &pound;327 to &pound;445 in the past two years&mdash;an increase of 40 per cent. Inevitably, that has had an impact on fuel poverty. Until quite recently, the reduction in fuel poverty was a great success story: from 1996 to 2001, the number of people defined as fuel poor fell from 4.3 million to 1.7 million&mdash;a massive reduction. Two years ago, however, the Minister's predecessor warned that that reduction would not be sustained because of the upward movement in gas prices in particular. Basing its estimate on existing price increases the energy watchdog suggests that the number of fuel poor could increase to about 3.5 million in the coming months. There could therefore be a great deal of regression in what was a major social advance. The energy watchdog warns that, even on the basis of current prices, the coming winter could see a big increase in personal debt and, linked to that, fuel poverty and disconnection.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/6">That is how the oil and gas shocks have been experienced at the personal level. However, it is not just households that are affected; we already have figures for the additional cost to the public sector. Public expenditure last year was an estimated &pound;100 million more than it otherwise would have been because of increased fuel consumption bills: hospitals alone spent an extra &pound;40 million and we expect significantly greater increases this year. The figures that have begun to emerge from the industrial federations suggest an increase in energy costs for the chemicals industry of about 70 per cent. over two years and close to 60 per cent. for the plastics industry; those are big industries, each employing about 200,000 people. The paper, glass and construction industries have had similar experiences, with major knock-on effects that will have an impact on their international competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/7">Is that all, or is there more to come? I do not know. I was once professionally engaged in the business of forecasting in the energy industry and my experience taught me never to attempt forecasts. Indeed&mdash;I may have told this anecdote before&mdash;when I was installed in my office at the oil and gas company for which I worked, I was given an Arabic saying, which I pinned to my wall. Roughly translated, it said, &quot;Those who claim to forecast the future are all lying, even if by chance they are later proved right.&quot; Forecasting is a dangerous business, but I have looked at some of the consensus forecasts that are currently being made about crude oil prices, and it is worth reviewing the range. Barclays Capital is working with a figure of $50 for the next year, Merrill Lynch with $45, the Deutsche Bank with $40, and BP, which presumably knows a thing or two about the matter, expects roughly $40 over the next three years. In other words, the figures are somewhat down on current levels, but substantially higher than we were used to in the late 1980s and for most of the 1990s. However, some outliers&mdash;knowledgeable and well-informed people&mdash;are talking about the possibility of something of the order of $100 over the winter if adverse circumstances arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/8">I will not ask the Minister to give a Government view about what prices should be&mdash;it would be foolish to do so. However, it would be useful to know how the Government approach the big controversy on the future of energy prices, particularly oil prices. There are essentially two views. The optimistic view, which I acquired in the industry, is that oil reserves are always underestimated&mdash;there has always been an expectation of a 20-year life&mdash;and that over time, prices increase, which increases exploration, and technology advances and all kinds of basins and fields are discovered that we did not know existed. However, there is another plausible view, which I do not discount, which is that there is an oil mountain, the summit of which we have reached, and that we face a long-term future of depletion. It is important for the Government to take a view on that controversy, because it affects the way in which one perceives the future of the North sea. It will be interesting to know, for example, what kind of analysis the Government's chief scientific adviser has made of the competing views.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/9">In the time remaining to me today, I shall identify some specific areas on which it would be useful to hear the Minister's views. The first is whether there is anything that the Government could or should do to stabilise oil prices that they have not done. They were right to avoid subsidies and oil caps and some of the other panic measures that have been introduced in other European countries. However, the one major intervention that the Government have made, along with other International Energy Agency countries, has been the use of the strategic stocks. That has probably been a factor in the moderation of prices in the weeks since the hurricane. It would therefore be useful to know whether the Government believein the domestic market. We should also consider the fact that if the oil companies are left to make a commercial decision, they might run their stocks down to avoid the associated overheads. It can be argued that we should look afresh at the size of our strategic reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.1/10">In respect of the oil markets, the Government have set out six points at international gatherings such as G7 and the European Council of Ministers that are effectively a series of demands on the OPEC countries. A Conservative spokesman captured the tone rather well by saying it was &quot;a little colonial&quot; to demand that OPEC countries produce more oil. What is the Government's current assessment of the spare capacity of the OPEC countries? I am not terribly close to such matters nowadays, but my impression is that there is very little or even none. The underlying problem over the past few years is that, despite rapidly growing demand from China, India and the United States&mdash;all strongly growing countries&mdash;OPEC capacity has been pretty fixed. That is understandable, because for a long time low oil prices resulted in there being little investment. The OPEC countries have simply run out of capacity. Urging those countries to produce more is at best rather pointless, and at worst a distraction. Will the Minister tell us the Government's professional assessment of OPEC's current spare capacity?</p>

	<p pid="a.107.1/1">The last point is a good one and the hon. Gentleman expressed it better and more fully than I did. Essentially, there is not a properly functioning market and because of that there is a tendency for speculation to bid up prices very quickly. I asked how the lack of transparency and liquidity in the markets that gives rise to the relevant criticism can be rectified. The hon. Gentleman is also right to point out the frustration about how slowly the storage is forthcoming&mdash;although the other side of the argument is that it is on the way, so that there will be substantially enhanced storage capacity within a year. The problem is this coming winter, which leads back to the question I posed about what the minimum should be and who should determine it.</p>
	<p pid="a.107.1/2">One of the implications of that question follows from the problem that the hon. Gentleman has just raised. How much of the problem is due to the lack of liberalisation of EU energy markets? Because the British have liberalised their gas markets and, by and large, most EU countries have not, we are now net importers&mdash;we are importing gas, the price of which price is arbitrarily linked to the price of oil rather than to supply and demand on a short and medium-term basis. As a result, we are importing substantial extra costs. The question for the Minister to answer, which is at the top of his agenda, I am sure, is how high the issue sits among the Government's priorities for decision-making in the European Union, now that we hold the EU presidency. What is the prospect of achieving any significant improvement in the liberalisation objectives of the Union? It is, as the Minister knows, a long-standing problem. I was involved the energy industry 10 years ago when liberalisation was discussed as an imminent breakthrough, but it never happened.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Cook. I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for granting me this debate. I am grateful also that the Minister is here to listen to&mdash;and, I hope, respond positively to&mdash;the debate. For the record, I should state that I serve as a councillor on Kettering borough council and am also a member of the Campaign to Protect Rural England.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/2">I shall start, if I may, with my conclusion and then attempt to lead the debate through the process of how I arrived at it. My conclusion is that despite Government promises that housing expansion plans for Northamptonshire would be infrastructure and jobs-led, that is increasingly proving not to be the case. Unless the Minister and his Department seize proper ownership of the delivery of their growth-area agenda and bring other Government Departments and their related agencies&mdash;primarily the Highways Agency&mdash;into line with their own ambitions, then as far as Northamptonshire is concerned, either the target number of houses envisaged for 2021&ndash;31 will not be met, or, if that is pushed through, it will be accompanied by poorer quality new housing than need be the case and a local transport network and local public services that are so overstretched and inadequate as to imperil seriously the quality of life for all who live in the county at the moment and make those new communities unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/3">As a matter of urgency, the Minister and his Department need to undertake a major strategic reassessment of the ability of the A14&mdash;the A1-M1 link road&mdash;and the roads off it to cope with the housing that is required to be built along it, and in particular of the need for an urgent solution to the traffic congestion around Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/4">How have I arrived at that conclusion? A good place to start is at the beginning. As a result of the Government-led Milton Keynes and south midlands sub-regional spatial strategy, the final version of which was published in March this year, issues on development and its repercussions on local infrastructure and public services will be the dominant political issue in the Kettering constituency for the next 25 years. Under that strategy, north Northamptonshire, which comprises the boroughs of Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough and the district of East Northants, is expected to deliver about 52,000 new homes and 43,800 new jobs over the period 2001&ndash;2021 and a further 28,000 new houses in the following decade. The 52,000 new houses to be built by 2021 will be equivalent to a city the size of Worcester and there will be more of them than in any other part of the Milton Keynes and south midlands growth area.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/5">The borough of Kettering is due to see 13,100 new houses built during that period, with further thousands of houses thereafter. That will increase the number of houses and people in the borough by more than a third by 2021 and even more thereafter. Other parts of the Kettering constituency outside the borough will also see housing expansion, although not on as great a scale. Given the housing expansion elsewhere in Northamptonshire, the county will see at least 145,000 new houses constructed by 2031, increasing its population by half. That will be a major step change for the local area and will change life for ever for all those who live there now and will live there in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/6">I have to tell the Minister that expansion on this scale is not what local people would have chosen themselves for their area. The rate of expansion is far more rapid than that set out in the 1996 Northamptonshire county council structure plan, which was democratically arrived at, and which has effectively been consigned to the dustbin of history. Expansion on such a scale is widely opposed in Kettering as being too great and too rapid.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/7">There is clearly strong local support for the economic redevelopment of historically underperforming parts of the county&mdash;not least Corby, as well as parts of Northampton and Kettering borough&mdash;and support for the provision of more affordable housing in general. However, there are real concerns about the loss of valued local countryside and the creation of new and elongated conurbations, leading to the coalescence of separate, distinctive and historic small towns, with the subsequent loss of their identity. It is extremely disappointing that in the sub-regional strategy the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has abandoned its national minimum target for 60 per cent. of new residential development to take place on brownfield sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/8">There is also genuine concern about the fact that local road network and public services are already overstretched; they will be stretched to breaking point unless urgent steps are taken to co-ordinate and provide the necessary funding for their improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/9">Having said all that, we are where we are. Like it or not, the sub-regional strategy is Government policy, and changes made by the ODPM last Parliament mean that the planning system is now driven by the top-down approach desired by the Government. The result is that local councils and planning authorities in the county are given far less latitude to resist major development plans than under the previous system. As that is the case, local authorities and other agencies in the county that are responsible for the delivery of these development plans and the provision of expanded public services want to work with the new system to ensure that the plans are delivered in the best possible way, so that the local population can make the best of future expansion for the county.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/10">The West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, North Northants Together&mdash;the north Northamptonshire local delivery vehicle&mdash;Catalyst Corby, the North Northamptonshire joint planning unit and the local councils are all set to help deliver the growth that the Government require. These councils and other agencies have not been overly precious about their powers and have pooled their efforts in order to be more effective. Indeed, the districts of Corby, Kettering, Wellingborough and East Northants, together with Northamptonshire county council, are the first in the country to use the new planning system to create a joint committee for strategic planning, which is supported by a joint planning unit staffed by planning officers from the five authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/11">All the local agencies that I have seen in the county are of the view that, as a Northamptonshire County Council memorandum says,</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/12" class="indent">&quot;we in Northamptonshire have a solutions-based approach to problems, are committed to delivery and to sort out problems amongst ourselves. We need continuing support from government to inject the growth policy into mainstream thinking for the main government departments and their agencies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/13">Will the Minister confirm that he is committed to ensuring that the delivery vehicle for North Northamptonshire&mdash;North Northants Together&mdash;will succeed as a strong co-ordinator, and that it is properly financed out of public funds? There is widespread recognition that up-front investment in jobs, infrastructure and services is essential if we are not to repeat the mistakes of failed development opportunities that Northamptonshire has endured in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/14">There is also recognition locally that more resources need to be provided to the delivery agencies if progress is to be made. Sir Patrick Walker, chairman of North Northants Together, said that</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/15" class="indent">&quot;we need additional resources if the pace of our efforts is to be maintained. We are urging the ODPM to give greater recognition to the challenges faced by Growth Area authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/16">Given that NNT has not even been granted sufficient funds to maintain a full-time chief executive and is having to borrow a deputy chief executive from Kettering borough council for one and a half days a week to fulfil this role, Sir Patrick's comments would appear to be spot on. Sir Patrick also highlights that</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/17" class="indent">&quot;there are still major infrastructure issues to address, such as improvement of the A.14 road around Kettering and provision of a passenger rail service to Corby.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/18">The message that the Minister needs to hear today is that although Northamptonshire wants to make the best of the housing expansion plans for the county, it is now being hindered from achieving what needs to be achieved by a lack of co-ordination and drive by central Government with regard to development-related funding and initiatives. That is not just my view: it is also, without exception, that of all the major local authorities and agencies that I met during the recess to discuss my preparation for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/19">To put it bluntly, unless the Minister and his Department seize proper ownership of this growth-area agenda and bring other Government agencies&mdash;primarily the Highways Agency&mdash;into line with their own ambitions, these development plans will fail. The Government are saying, &quot;Deliver this growth&quot; at the same time as the Highways Agency is saying not to do so while the local roads are at their current level of congestion. That is clearly a failure of joined-up government of considerable proportions. The agency is looking at solutions 10 years or more hence, but local district councils are statutorily bound now to provide tens of thousands of new houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/20">The same county council memorandum to which I referred earlier goes on to say that</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/21" class="indent">&quot;the main constraints to growth, especially in the north of the county&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/22">which is where the Kettering constituency is located&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/23" class="indent">&quot;are major and need the pro-active engagement of the Highways Agency, the Environment Agency and others. They have to stop simply being gatekeepers and narrowly focused on their own immediate interests, and become actively involved in pro-active planning solutions. The Highways Agency have issued seven Article 14 Directions in Corby, effectively slowing down the growth and much needed investment there, and there are significant risks that more will follow in Kettering and Corby. This will reduce growth to a trickle.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/24">Article 14 directions are issued under the Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995, which limit or stop developments on the basis of inadequate transport infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/25">I have even been provided with evidence that a firm wishing to invest in high-quality jobs in Kettering&mdash;and itself located near the A14&mdash;is being told by the Highways Agency not to invest in the local area. It wants to locate on an existing industrial estate, and the agency has said that it is minded to issue a direction to prevent the council giving permission on already allocated land.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/26">The A14 around Kettering is already operating over its design capacity; it is used by upwards of 70,000 vehicles a day. I understand&mdash;perhaps the Minister will want to confirm this this afternoon&mdash;that the Government are introducing congestion targets later this year. If necessary, that will mean that the Highways Agency will seek to control access on to the A14 at peak times, which will push congestion back on to the local road network. There are particular concerns over junction 7, located to the north-west of Kettering, which is now acting as a constraint on housing growth in Corby, and in due course will do the same for Kettering, when major planning applications come forward. Highways Agency assessments for major planning applications in Corby also appear to assume only background traffic growth outside Corby. That approach is patently wrong given the growth required from elsewhere, including Kettering.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/27">A memorandum from one of the local planners involved in the development of the area makes it clear that</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/28" class="indent">&quot;unless the Government and the Highways Agency take a different view of the level of congestion that is acceptable on the A14, levels of growth in North Northamptonshire will be constrained below those set out in the Subregional Strategy until the Kettering By-pass is constructed. This is currently planned for 2017&ndash;21.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/29">Indeed, in the final version of the sub-regional strategy published in March, this was the new timetable agreed by the Minister's Department, taking the expansion of this road back from 2012 to 2016. The Minister and his Department need to undertake as a matter of urgency major strategic reassessment of the ability of the A14 and the roads off it to cope with the housing expansion plans for the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/30">It is true that a number of initiatives have been announced by the ODPM to encourage development and regeneration in parts of the county. However, the sums already announced fall well below the eventual hundreds of millions of pounds that my area will require. An increase in the population of 50 per cent. means a need for 50 per cent. more GPs, 50 per cent. more dentists, 50 per cent. more schools, 50 per cent. more hospital beds, 50 per cent. more police and so on. Far from being forward looking, most of the funding formulae for future revenue streams for major Departments look backwards to 2001 census data and not forwards to take into account the step change in local population that Northamptonshire is set to experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/31">The Milton Keynes and South Midlands health and social care sub-group estimates that relative to the local population there are one fifth fewer nurses and one third fewer hospital based doctors in the Milton Keynes and south midlands area than in the country as a whole. It also anticipates that the sub-region is expected to see a 44 per cent. growth in population but an 80 per cent. growth in the demand for acute care. What is the Minister's Department's assessment of the total amount of infrastructure investment that will be required for the county up to 2021? I want to see the Government guarantee that that sum will be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.1/32">I thank you, Mr. Cook, for the opportunity to debate this subject this afternoon and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.1/1">I shall be brief. First, I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is of enormous importance to all who live in Northamptonshire, and particularly on his points on the funding formulae. I hope that the Minister will take those points on board. The formulae are retrospective; they should be forward looking. That is the cause of many of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/2">Where are the plans for the increase in infrastructure needed for that rapidly expanding county? My constituency does not have enough of an infrastructure to support the people living there at the moment. In Wellingborough, people are unable to register directly with a GP. They have to travel outside the county to get an NHS dentist. Northamptonshire roads are the sixth worst in the country. A secondary school has been closed down and demolished, leaving many children without any education. Our police stations have now become part time. The chief constable states that he is 200 officers short.</p>
	<p pid="a.131.1/3">My constituents have to travel a long way to get to the nearest hospital. The waiting times are long; operations are cancelled at the last minute. If someone is lucky enough to get an appointment, they can spend an hour looking for a car parking space at the hospital. We need a community hospital in Wellingborough with minor accident and emergency facilities. We used to have one but that went as well. With the huge increase in population, which my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering has so eloquently described, it is about time that the Government delivered the proper infrastructure that my constituents and the people of Northamptonshire deserve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-12a.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="135"  time="016:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051012/halltext/51012h05.htm#51012h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.135.1/1">I dedicate this debate on theme park safety to the memory of Megan Wilcox, aged seven, from the Broxtowe estate in my constituency. She died after an accidental fall at the Wonderland pleasure park in Farnsfield and the coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">I have a petition with 6,000 signatures of local people, urging the Government to ensure that adequate medical assistance is provided at theme parks, which I take to include all commercially operated attractions open to the general public where children have access to play equipment. That will include amusement parks and locations similar to the one where Megan's tragedy occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">Megan's family believe that there were not enough first aiders on hand at Wonderland when she died, near a slide, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-05">5 September 2003</phrase>. It is still unclear whether she tripped on a mat at the foot of the slide or fell after colliding with another child. My constituents, Megan's mother Kerry and stepfather Wayne, believe, as I do, that first aiders should be compulsory at attractions such as fun parks, leisure parks and the like. It came as a surprise to me, and may do to you, Mr. Cook, and to anyone listening to the debate, that that was not already the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">Megan's parents cannot understand why what is compulsory at football grounds cannot be so at places such as Wonderland, which cater for children. As regulations stand, employers are obliged to provide first aid at work for their employees, but not for those visiting the site. Yet as I understand it, under primary legislation employers are obliged to ensure that those who visit their site or are affected by their work are not at risk. Similarly,</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/5" class="indent">&quot;the common law duty of care would require provision of first aid for the public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/6">That is a quotation from paragraph 150 of the health and safety guidance HSG 175. A contradiction is evident in that to lay people, if not to those who understand the nuances of legislation and regulation in this context. There is a contradiction between regulation, primary legislation and common law. To keep our children safe, that confusion must be resolved and clarified. I am glad to give the Minister a chance to do so today.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/7">I know that the Minister has taken an interest in the matter. She answered questions in the House recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase>, and I have spoken to her on the matter. I have also spoken to the Minister in the Department who is responsible for health and safety, Lord Hunt. I know that the Department takes the issue seriously, and as it has been raised over quite some time I am sure that today we shall hear the results of Government thought and activity on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/8">I do not pretend to understand the ins and outs of the legislation, and there may be several ways of proceeding. I am sure that the Minister will have considered those. One approach is to include the public with employees. The guidance from the Health and Safety Executive on safe practice at fairgrounds and amusement parks&mdash;HSG 175, to which I referred&mdash;is currently being reviewed and revised in conjunction with the industry associations, through a working party of the fairgrounds joint advisory committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/9">I hope that the House will bear with me with this quite technical information which is none the less important for youngsters in the relevant parks. The revised document is currently with the HSE, in draft form, and is expected to be published in 2006. Revisions to that document address the continuing efforts of the industry, together with the HSE, to make amusement parks and fairgrounds as safe as possible. I urge the Minister to make it a priority to publish a revised HSG 175 as soon as humanly possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/10">I am not clear about the status of the guidance, and I would be grateful for more information. First, does it apply to all fairgrounds and attractions, including those outside the associations represented on the joint advisory committee? In other words, it can be monitored by the professional bodies, but whom outside those associations&mdash;those who do not join the industry's organisations&mdash;will monitor it? Secondly, is the guidance to be used to determine whether attractions have met their duty of care toward the public?</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/11">I appreciate that only last year the HSE carried out a review of a separate item&mdash;the health and safety first aid regulations. That review was wide-ranging; among other things, it considered extending the provision of first aid to members of the public. Following the review, the guidance relating to the regulations remain unamended. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/12" class="indent">&quot;These regulations do not oblige employers to provide first aid for anyone other than their employees. Indeed, Regulations requiring first aid provision for members of the public cannot be made under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. But many undertakings, for example educational establishments, places of entertainment . . . fairgrounds provide a service for others, and employers may wish to include them in their assessment of needs and make provision for them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/13">&quot;May wish&quot; is not strong enough, given the possibility of tragedies such as that which befell Megan.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/14">The Minister and the Department may wish to reconsider the result of that review. Will the Minister make clear whether the provision of first aid for the public is part of the common law duty of care for a fairground, bearing in mind that the nature of fairground business is to admit the public, especially children, who are a vulnerable group? No change was made to the guidance after last year's review, but I hope that Megan's sad death will demand that it is reconsidered and that proper provision for the public at all entertainment parks is introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/15">Work could be done also to apply the same standards to all attractions. Local authority environmental health officers enforce health and safety law under the general direction of the Health and Safety Commission, not by the granting or revoking of licenses. The system for deciding on a suitable first aid provision is by use of risk assessments alone. There is currently no requirement for theme parks to be licensed by the HSE or local authorities. Such legislation, were it to be introduced, could assist in specifying conditions with respect to public safety, including the provision of trained first aiders. I do not know whether the Minister wishes to go down that road&mdash;it may not be practicable&mdash;but I hope that it will be on the agenda should the Minister feel that she is not getting full co-operation from all the parties involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/16">The current risk assessment system is meant to identify whether safety of the public and of employees is an issue, and it requires suitable action to reduce the level of risk. The system is meant to ensure that the level of first aid cover reflects the size and type of operation, and consequently the number of visitors. Mr. Colin Dawson, the chief executive of the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions told me that</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/17" class="indent">&quot;the level and qualifications of those providing first aid cover at BALPPA members' sites is of course dependent on the size of the attraction, number of visitors etc. Larger BALPPA member attractions such as Blackpool Pleasure Beach and Alton Towers operate significant medical centres way above the level of first aid. In other cases a suitable external agency is on duty, such as St John Ambulance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/18">He says that in all cases:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/19" class="indent">&quot;BALPPA members provide suitable first aid cover, as identified by their Risk Assessments.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/20">The trade organisation, therefore, takes a very responsible view, which is also the view of most people that operate in the field. I am pleased to say that Mr. Dawson continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/21" class="indent">&quot;However, we would support any proposal that ensured that all attractions provided suitable cover when open to the public. A four day first aid qualification would be the level we consider as the most appropriate minimum standard.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/22">I hope that the Minister, or Lord Hunt, will grab that offer from the industry and build upon it, so that our children can play in such places with greater security and greater safety. I understand that BALPPA is due to meet Lord Hunt to discuss the matter further.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/23">Voluntary level working, while helpful, will always mean that non-BALPPA attractions can slip through the net. The reference that I made earlier encourages such attractions to join a recognised trade association, which can then&mdash;hopefully&mdash;ensure that they comply with required standards by monitoring their effective enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/24">I hope that the Minister will bear in mind that the size of an attraction is not necessarily an indicator of its risk. A large site that is well managed and maintained may well be safer than a smaller one that is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/25">I believe that a further opportunity will arise to make progress on this issue when the HSE meets the industry on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-30">30 November</phrase> at its annual meeting to discuss health and safety in the fairground industry. Membership of that body includes representatives from all quarters of the industry such as the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions, the Showman's Guild of Great Britain, the Society of Independent Roundabout Proprietors, the Association of Independent Showmen, the British Amusement Catering Trade Association and the Amusement Catering Equipment Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/26">I trust that the Minister will be able to tell us today that she will ensure that the issues arising from Megan's death and from this Adjournment debate will be raised at that meeting, including a review of the advice on first-aid provision for members of the public in HSG 175&mdash;the fairgrounds and amusement parks guidance. I also take this opportunity to ask the Minister if she will broaden the membership of the fairgrounds and amusement parks joint advisory committee and take action to enforce the recommendation that attractions that are not members of industry associations should join one.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/27">I shall also make a brief point about fixed sites being treated differently from the temporary sites. I understand that for fixed sites, the current arrangements do not cover the public, whereas they do cover the temporary sites. That may sound rather strange to a layman such as me, but apparently that is the current situation. These issues and their remedies may sound technical but they are literally the difference between life and death in relation to possible accidents at fun parks and other attractions.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/28">May I make it clear that neither I, nor Megan's parents, to whom I have spoken in the past few days, are pursuing anyone. We are not trying to name people or attribute blame. On the contrary, our only concern is to improve safety and medical standards so that children in future&mdash;I have an eight-year-old daughter&mdash;can enjoy leisure attractions with the peace of mind that if an accident were to happen, adequate first aid would be available. That would be a lasting and fitting tribute, which the family would appreciate, to mark the bright, but all too brief, light of Megan's life.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-10-12a.138.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2013" speakername="Anne McGuire" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="138"  time="016:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051012/halltext/51012h05.htm#51012h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.138.0/1">Congratulations seems an inappropriate word to use in the circumstances that have provoked the debate. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1747" name="Graham Allen">the Member for Nottingham, North (Mr. Allen)</phrase> has raised the issue and secured the debate in his usual courteous and committed way. By doing so he has raised an important issue and one on which I hope we can move forward together. I should also like to thank him for the opportunity presented today to consider the ways in which safety at fun parks can be improved. Obviously the case of Megan Wilcox is core to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">As my hon. Friend mentioned, Megan Wilcox was a young child who died on <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-05">5 September</phrase> last year. Before I go into some of what my hon. Friend has identified as fairly technical issues in terms of health and safety, I should like to extend my sympathy to her family and friends for their tragic loss. I am sure that other Members will join me in this. Nothing that we say here today can take away the pain that Megan's family and friends will feel, but we can look closely at the events and learn from them to build something better for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3">First, by way of background, it may be helpful to review the accident rate in fairgrounds and amusement parks. The Health and Safety Executive's published statistics from 1996 to 2003 show a welcome downward trend in major accidents to members of the public at fairgrounds and amusement parks. In 1996&ndash;97, 432 people were injured. That fell to 100 in 2003&ndash;04, and one estimate suggests that the risk of death from a fairground ride is now one in 83 million. While that trend has to be looked on as encouraging, I know that we all expect that everyone involved in the industry will work together to ensure that it continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/4">Let me now say something about the legal position. Fun park owners and operators, like any other responsible employer, have to provide healthy and safe working conditions for their employees under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. They also have a responsibility to protect members of the public from their work activities. The provision of welfare facilities for members of the public, such as first aid, is not addressed by the Act, and the Act specifically limits welfare regulations to employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/5">The Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulation require employers, including fun park operators, to provide first aid for their employees, but those provisions do not extend to members of the public. However, guidance on good practice that accompanies the regulations encourages employers to make such provision where there are significant dealings with the public. I will come back to this in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/6">Although it will be of little comfort to Megan's family, the question my hon. Friend raises about extending provision of first aid to the public was thoroughly considered by the HSE over the past few years. In September 2003, the HSE issued a discussion document on the first aid regulations. That was the first full review and evaluation since they were introduced in 1981, although there had been changes to the accompanying approved code of practice and guidance. The HSE was encouraged by the response to the discussion document; more than 500 responses were received.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/7">The review explored views on the current legislation and what changes could or should be introduced. There was a specific question on whether first aid for the public should continue to be provided by employers within a non-statutory framework or made compulsory through new legislation. I will return to that. The review was informed by prior research that also included the consideration of first aid for members of the public. It found that employers dealing with the public in large numbers, such as entertainment venues, generally make first aid provision for them, not least because of businesses' perception of the positive public viewpoint that this creates in enhancing their reputation. Conversely, where businesses do not make such provision, that was perceived as having a negative impact, especially if the treatment was neither timely nor effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/8">The discussion document sought views on including a statutory obligation on employers to extend the provision of first aid to members of the public. The arguments were finely balanced, but the proposal was rejected by the majority of those who responded to it. The HSE concluded that there was already a good non-statutory response, especially in sectors that deal with large volumes of the public. Arguments that were weighed in the balance included the practicality raised by employers of having to cater for the public at large. First aiders were concerned about possible litigation, and said that they would reconsider volunteering if they were obliged by the law to offer first aid to the public. That is an indication of the sort of litigation society in which we live. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-07">7 September 2004</phrase>, the Health and Safety Commission agreed with the HSE's recommendations. Faced with that body of evidence, I do not believe that new legislation on first-aid provision is the way forward. I appreciate that that may be a disappointment to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/9">It is important to note that the HSC has said that it does not necessarily see new regulation as the solution to all problems, particularly where there are other means of achieving the same end. Guidance, especially that developed in partnership with stakeholders, to which my hon. Friend alluded, may on occasion be a more appropriate solution. As he said, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-18">18 July</phrase> I said that I would ask the HSC to explore whether local authorities could be encouraged to use their licensing powers to make provision of first- aid facilities a condition of licensing of theme parks and funfairs. The HSE has concluded that the scope for first aid provision to be attached as a condition to licences under the Licensing Act 2003 is extremely limited. That is because the Act does not apply to categories of entertainment such as fairgrounds; rather, it applies to certain activities, such as dancing, the sale of alcohol, performances of plays or films, and musical entertainment. In practice, it would make little real difference to the provision of first aid in the vast majority of fun parks in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/10">The HSE therefore draws attention to the need to consider the provision of first aid to the public where organisations provide a service for others, such as places of entertainment, educational establishments and fairgrounds. That is set out in the guidance to the first aid regulations. The HSE has also issued authoritative guidance on fairgrounds and amusement parks, in collaboration with the fairgrounds industry, and advises on the provision of first aid to members of the public in fairgrounds and theme parks. Trained first aiders for the public can be seen as an important part, for example, of emergency planning arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/11">In line with the HSC's strategy for workplace health and safety, the Government would like the industry to take ownership of and deliver solutions to such issues. A sensible approach to safety is to manage risk as far as possible, not to try to eliminate it entirely. As my hon. Friend also mentioned, the industry is best placed to ensure that risks are sensibly managed and that the public are protected from harm. That is the key to stopping accidents happening. The HSE and the Government are committed to doing all that we can to be good partners in achieving those aims. I have already mentioned that the HSE encourages employers, particularly those that have large numbers of the public using their facilities, such as fairgrounds and fun parks, to take account of the public and other visitors when conducting risk assessments and considering first aid provision. However, more can be done to encourage the fairground industry to ensure that current arrangements work as well as possible. The HSE's guidance is drafted so that it applies to all fairgrounds, not just those that are members of the trade association.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/12">The way forward lies in promoting the non-statutory adoption of good practice tailored to particular circumstances. The majority of fairgrounds and theme parks already have a high standard of first aid provision, as my hon. Friend said. Indeed, in some cases, those standards are exemplary. But I would also like to challenge the industry to see what more it can reasonably do to raise awareness and spread good practice more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/13">The HSE has already raised this matter with some of the main stakeholders whose members make up the majority of theme and fun parks in Great Britain. The response, I am delighted to say, has been encouragingly positive. There have been more recent developments, too: my noble Friend Lord Hunt, the Minister responsible for health and safety in the Department, has recently had representations from the British Association of Leisure Parks, Piers and Attractions to discuss health and safety guidance for fairgrounds. I know that Lord Hunt will be raising the issue of first aid for members of the public when the meeting goes ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/14">I have also asked the HSE to put the matters raised in this debate to the next meeting of the Fairgrounds and Amusement Parks Joint Advisory Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-30">30 November</phrase>. The committee is chaired by the HSE and is attended by all the major trade associations involved in the industry, including BALPPA. It is the main vehicle for agreeing standards of health and safety in the sector. There is also specific guidance that is currently being revised with the industry's participation.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/15">I would like the HSE to do two things. First, it should consider whether the information about first aid provision to the public that is already in the industry-specific guidance could be revisited in light of Megan's case. Secondly, it should provide further information to highlight the first aid issues raised by this case on the HSE website, which is the HSE's principal means of communicating with all stakeholders. The comments of Colin Dawson of BALPPA were interesting in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/16">Sadly, given the severity of Megan's injuries, it may well be that there would have been very little that any first aider could have done to save her, however quickly he or she arrived. However, I also recognise that Megan's parents, understandably, may never be entirely confident that that was the case. We have to understand their views. However, we should focus for a moment on the cause of the injuries and their prevention. Megan slipped and tripped over. That is the commonest cause of all injuries in the United Kingdom, both at work and outside work. Clearly, we have to look at how we highlight the issue of tripping. In this context, I welcome the initiative that the HSE is running this month called &quot;Watch your Step&quot; to highlight the issue to employers and the general public.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/17">Finally, we should bear in mind that accident rates at fun parks remain low. That is due in no small part to the professional nature of the industry and the importance that it attaches to rider and visitor safety. We should never cease to learn from the lessons of tragedies such as these. Although we can never entirely remove risk from society, we can strive to ensure that people, especially children, live in a society that values and fully provides for their safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/18">I once again thank my hon. Friend for raising these issues with me and with Lord Hunt. I hope that, together, we can use the lessons of Megan's sad death to build a safer environment in which children&mdash;and, in fact, all people&mdash;can safely enjoy entertainment.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/19" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/20" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at eight minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
