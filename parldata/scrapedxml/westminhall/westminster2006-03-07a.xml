	<p pid="a.193.3/1">I am fortunate to be selected to have this debate. As a Labour and Co-operative MP, I believe that it is important for employees in an enterprise to have a stake in the business in which they work, for a variety of reasons. First, a stake incentivises them, because they are likely to be more motivated to ensure that the enterprise is a success. Secondly, a stake tends to give the employee more influence in the running and operation of the enterprise than an employee with no stake whatever in the company. To some extent that gives the employee a voice and allows various democratic influences to be brought to bear on the enterprise. Co-operative businesses have played a role in achieving those outcomes, but employee-owned and trust-owned businesses generally have also operated to some degree on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.3/2">I shall propose a number of ways of improving the tax and legal regimes that affect the environment in which employee share schemes operate. Following that, I intend to suggest the setting up of a support unit working alongside the Inland Revenue to deal with the non-financial aspects of employee share ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.3/3">The Employee Share Schemes Act 2002 was carried through <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the House by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase>. It received strong support from the Co-operative party, and its passage was also assisted by the advice and guidance of Job Ownership Ltd, which, for those who are unacquainted with it, is an association of employee-owned and trust-owned businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.193.3/4">There are a number of key points to be made about employee share ownership schemes. First, employee financial participation is welcomed by the Government and has grown significantly, owing to favourable tax treatment, in particular my right hon. Friend the Chancellor's tax advantaged share incentive plan and his enterprise management incentives share option plan, both of which were introduced in 2000. However, research shows generally that employee financial participation alone does not transform employee commitment or greatly boost productivity.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.194.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07b.194.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.194.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" speakername="Mark Hendrick" colnum="194"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h01.htm#60307h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.194.0/1">I totally agree. Indeed, I will propose that share ownership plans that provide facilities for wider participation, involving not just the big boys at the top in management, should receive tax advantages that other employee-owned trusts should not.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2">Research generally shows that employee financial participation on its own does not transform employee commitment or boost productivity. Improved commitment and productivity require three components from employers: financial participation, to which I have referred, a serious commitment to employee involvement, and some form of collective voice for employees. The significance of achieving a collective voice cannot be overemphasised. The current tax treatment of employee share schemes needs to be reformed to remove the barriers, so that some key means can be used for that collective voice, namely in the employee trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">Before I go into more detail, it is important to distinguish between the various types of share ownership that are available. First, there is direct share ownership, whereby workers own their shares individually. Secondly, there is indirect ownership, whereby shares are held by or for employees collectively in some form of trust. Direct or individual share ownership can give employees a real sense of owning a piece of the business. Indirect or collective ownership through a trust is, some would argue, even more important, as it provides the collective voice that is vital to the mix of the three components.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">A trust may often offer the only affordable vehicle for achieving employee ownership in the first place and provides a secure block of shares that cannot be traded, which protects the business against instability or predators. Individual shareholdings, with uninfluential voting rights, do not in themselves create a strong basis for employee involvement. An employee trust with a significant shareholding adds that extra dimension. Trustees have to take into account the interests of beneficiaries. An employee trust provides a means of rewarding employees financially, and can deliver the necessary employee involvement and collective voice to ensure that the three key components boost productivity. An employee trust designed to benefit all employees in that way is less likely to be abused by the few.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/5">However, various problems still loom. First, the employee trust structure is at a tax disadvantage as compared with the treatment of direct shareholdings. Most of the relevant tax incentives focus on direct&mdash;that is, individual&mdash;employee share ownership, which is only one of the components and the least likely to produce stable employee ownership. There is no corporation tax deduction for a company contributing to an employee trust if the trust retains those shares for the long-term benefit of staff. A previous deduction was removed in the Finance Act 2003, because Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs was trying to stop trusts being used for tax avoidance. It is important to make a distinction between trusts that are set up to benefit all employees in a company and those that are set up to benefit just one or two people&mdash;the fat cats.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/6">There are no tax breaks at all for employee trusts with long-term shareholdings. There is also some complexity in the system, in that companies must have one trust to hold shares for any period and a SIP trust to distribute shares tax efficiently to employees. That is costly in both fees and time.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/7">The SIP tax breaks are given if an employee agrees to keep his shares in a SIP trust for five years. That is considered by some to be too long to make employees wait before they can sell shares that they have bought as part of a SIP scheme, and it might be regarded as a reason not to buy shares in the first place. However, it can also be argued that if the period were to be less than five years, the investment might not be considered to be long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/8">Returning to the benefits of tax breaks, existing law has various ways of trying to prevent abuse and target tax benefits. The SIP, for example, requires all employees to be offered participation, and to participate on similar terms. The EMI plan, for example, is available only to companies in certain qualifying trades with gross assets of &pound;30 million or less. Any change must be carefully focused to avoid abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/9">What changes are needed? My right hon. Friend the Paymaster General should consider the likely impact of shortening the SIP waiting time, before which employees who have bought shares under the scheme can sell them, to less than five years. That might encourage share ownership generally. I would not like the five-year rule to be abolished if the result is that things do not work so well in terms of wider share ownership and the SIP scheme, which has been a considerable success.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/10">Consideration should also be given to the statutory recognition of an acceptable&mdash;in tax avoidance terms&mdash;form of employee trust, contributions to which are tax deductible even if shares are held indefinitely in the trust. That is to say that there would be no corporation tax on money that an employer put into that trust. The trust structure could be simplified so that a single trust could hold shares for a long period, and easily and efficiently distribute shares to employees. There is a way to achieve both those aims in a manner that focuses on the tax break and avoids abuse, by building on the tax break introduced by the 2002 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/11">The Government accept that if a stake of at least 10 per cent. is bought by a SIP trust from individual shareholders, the company financing the purchase can get a tax deduction, and the SIP trust can take up to 10 years to distribute the shares to employees. There is also a suggestion from JOL that the 10-year requirement be removed for a defined class of eligible companies. The defined class could be based on the EMI qualifying company tests in order to show its availability. In that way, eligible companies would get a tax deduction for shares bought and held permanently in the SIP trust. The SIP is an approved plan and so is subject to Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs scrutiny, again to prevent abuse. Many would argue that if such tax breaks were created within the SIP legislation a company would need only one employee trust&mdash;a SIP trust&mdash;to hold shares for a long period and to distribute them to employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/12">I propose setting up what I would call an employees direct unit to deliver and promote the productivity benefits of employee share ownership. It would raise the Government's profile in relation to employee ownership, through both the number of companies that introduce the SIP and the way in which they operate it. Companies that follow Government guidelines and what I would call best practice, and introduce employee ownership alongside true participation, will be more likely to achieve enhanced productivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/13">Government support for the introduction of the SIP, through the offices of the Inland Revenue, is based only on the financial aspects of the scheme in the form of tax relief. The problem with that is that companies will continue to regard tax relief as the main purpose of the scheme and will pass that message on to their employees. Only enlightened and committed companies will seek to introduce complementary participation schemes; hence the need for the employees direct unit, which would deliver and promote the productivity benefits of employee share ownership schemes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.196.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" speakername="Mark Hendrick" colnum="196"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h01.htm#60307h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.196.5/1">I am being asked to tread on some controversial ground. I would not want to comment on any specific business. All that I would say is that if that culture were to permeate business, the biggest benefit would be to private business and publicly owned companies. While there is scope for that, it would need to be considered in a different light.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/2">The Government cannot hope to reap the maximum reward of improved productivity if they do not provide clear, constructive advice to companies and organisations on what we regard as best practice in the implementation and operation of employee ownership schemes. They are being too optimistic if they believe that a scheme can be introduced on a purely financial basis, and succeed. The introduction and operation of such schemes in any company is a complex process, which depends for its success on effective communication, ongoing provision of information and a clear commitment to the concept of partnership across the organisation. We cannot assume that companies will automatically understand that without the information, clear guidance and examples of best practice that the Government could give. If companies are left to learn by experience, their enjoyment of the benefits of employee ownership might be delayed or not fully realised.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/3">If the Government wish to reap the greatest productivity rewards from employee ownership, they should be proactive and should, from the outset, provide advice and assistance to companies on human resource-based policies that will enhance the introduction of the SIP and establish a participation audit for the operation of such schemes. Therefore, I request that a new dedicated unit be established to work alongside the Revenue on the non-financial aspects of employee ownership: collating research, information and case studies on best practice, providing training for employee trustees, and, if thought fit, establishing a code of conduct for all companies that wish to participate in the SIP.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/4">The Government should consider giving statutory recognition to an acceptable form of employee trust, contributions to which would be tax deductible even if shares were retained indefinitely in that trust. Such a trust could benefit from other tax advantages to promote employee ownership, such as an exemption from the loans to the participators' provisions and other measures to remove the barriers that I mentioned and even to encourage such trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.196.5/5">I acknowledge the positive steps taken by the Government to foster employee share ownership, and the need to prevent and address tax avoidance, but my proposals merit serious consideration. I respectfully ask the Paymaster General to let Treasury officials consider them to see whether they could supplement and enhance the Government's approach to the wider encouragement of employee share ownership schemes.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.197.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="197"  time="009:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h01.htm#60307h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.197.0/1">I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1769" name="Mark Hendrick">the hon. Member for Preston (Mr. Hendrick)</phrase> to the Chamber and thank him for securing a debate on this important subject, which perhaps does not get the discussion and analysis it deserves. It is useful to point out at the outset that although worker share ownership has been described in a generic way, we are talking about different philosophies and approaches. On one hand, we have worker, co-operative type structures that are all-inclusive, equitable and have one philosophy. On <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the other hand, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> reminded us, there are share option schemes of the kind that are common in the United States, which are designed to remunerate highly-paid management employees and are highly exclusive. Such schemes have a completely different philosophy and different consequences. When we talk about worker share ownership, we need to be clear that there is a wide continuum of different kinds of animals.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.0/2">There is a long history behind such schemes. The idea is not new and has been through many changes over the years. I was born and grew up in the city of York, and my parents worked in the Rowntrees and Terry's factories, where the idea of worker share ownership has been around for generations&mdash;when the divvy came was always a talking point in the family. The concept has been embedded for a long time. Whatever their other consequences, such schemes created much better labour relationships. There were rarely any industrial disputes at Rowntrees or Terry's, as there was a sense of involvement. However, it shaded into paternalism; that is one aspect of the schemes about which the trade union movement has been nervous over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.0/3">The development of worker share ownership had a burst of life with the intellectual debate in the 1960s, when people were looking for middle ways between socialism and raw capitalism. Certainly, people in the liberal tradition argued strongly for that model. However, it was criticised by at least sections of the trade union movement on two grounds, the first of which was that it blunted what were, in many cases, clear divisions of interest between owners of capital and workers&mdash;although that may not have been right, politically. The more serious and practical objection, which is relevant to this day, was that it increased the risks to workers. They are always at risk of losing their jobs, and occupational pension schemes if they are tied to a particular employer. It was thought that those who owned shares were exposed to an additional, highly concentrated risk. That downside has been widely understood over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.0/4">The next stage at which worker share ownership had a new lease of life was in the early 1980s, when people were looking for alternatives to the incomes policy of trying to get the work force to appreciate the problems associated with the profitability of companies, and to moderate pay claims. There was a strong stream of thinking led, I think, by Sam Brittan of the <i>Financial Times</i>, which Nigel Lawson, or Lord Lawson as he now is, took up when he was Chancellor, to encourage worker share ownership, with one of the objectives being to moderate pay claims. There was a different element in the argument. I make those points to stress that different people have come at this subject for different reasons over quite a long period.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.0/5">The hon. Member for Preston rightly wanted to concentrate on the advances made in the period of Labour Government. He rightly said that there has been a big step forward in enlarging worker share ownership. There is also the separate system of share save, which is about taking options rather than taking shares. It reduces the risk but might be less remunerative. There are different models even within the current arrangement that the Government have introduced. A large number of companies are now involved. Some 6,400 have a form of employee share ownership, and the total business is about &pound;20 billion a year. We are talking about substantial amounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.0/6">I shall trespass on the rather sensitive question of how we take this matter forward, as raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the hon. Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>. The Government could use their few remaining publicly owned assets to develop share ownership. The sensitive subject of the Post Office has been touched on, and I shall touch on it again, because we raised it at our party conference this weekend.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.0/7">We have adopted a model for the Post Office that would involve selling 49 per cent. of Post Office shares to employees and small investors, and dividing the remaining 51 per cent. equally between a state golden share and a John Lewis-type partnership. We argued for that because previous attempts to use privatisation as a way of developing worker share ownership foundered in the case of the National Freight Corporation, in which the people who were given shares quickly disposed of them in the secondary market. It simply became another private company and any sense of employee involvement was lost. The way to get around that would be to have a John Lewis trust model, whereby the shares are kept within a trust structure that is not diluted. That is the best way of keeping the motivation.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that relations are notoriously fractious. My experience is that there is a particular problem in the large postal sorting offices in London, but that in some of the smaller operations, such as the one in south-west London, where I am the local MP, relations are very good. I have always found the representatives of the work force there with whom I have dealt constructive, although they have rejected the option that we suggest because they think that it would open the way to what they see as the wrong kind of privatisation. That is a legitimate point of view, but we think that if it were done in the right way, it would do exactly what he wants: increase motivation and involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/2">The other way in which the Government could advance the situation is through the tax regime. We need to consider seriously two proposals made by the hon. Gentleman. The first is the suggestion that we restrict tax privileges in certain areas to schemes with which there is a genuine model of participation and involvement, rather than share option schemes of the QinetiQ type model, with which there are elements of serious abuse. I have secured a debate to discuss that in an hour or so. If such privileges can be narrowed to areas of genuine participation, that would be more appropriate and less costly to the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/3">The hon. Gentleman's other proposal went in the opposite direction: that we should enlarge tax privileges to be sympathetic to trust arrangements. That is a good suggestion. I do not know what it would cost&mdash;perhaps the Paymaster General will tell us&mdash;but the concept seems right. It is unfortunate that because of measures to prevent tax evasion or avoidance by unscrupulous operators, good schemes such as those provided by John Lewis, Ove Arup and the Bader Foundation have found themselves at a disadvantage. It would be helpful to find a way around that.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.1/4">The final point that I want to make is that not only a lot of anecdotes but a lot of research have come out of the United States, among other places, where there are good and well conceived worker share ownership schemes linked to participation. Empirical evidence shows that that does a lot to improve productivity and motivation. Common sense would suggest that that would be the outcome.</p>

	<p pid="a.200.1/1">There are risks with such schemes. As the hon. Gentleman well knows, much of the airline industry in the United States is bankrupt and there are risks as well as benefits associated with worker share ownership. That is why people putting all their eggs in one basket, with workers having almost all their asset wealth in shares in their own company, is not sensible. However, it is almost certainly sensible for them to have some involvement. As I suggested, research shows that the outcome is generally positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.200.1/2">My final point repeats one made by the hon. Gentleman. In order for worker share ownership to be broadly accepted and to gather wide political support, it has to be seen to be genuine and not simply an excuse for the kind of share option schemes that we have seen in some companies which have involved serious abuse.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.205.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1457" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" colnum="205"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h01.htm#60307h01_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.205.1/1">I was coming to SIPs, but I would make one point to my hon. Friend, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Twickenham. Share ownership schemes, by themselves, might not be enough to achieve all the objectives that my hon. Friend identified. I think that everyone who has spoken would agree on that. We need to consider other changes in the workplace, as well as attitudes to partnership and involvement in the workplace. That will need to involve not only employees, but management, which takes me back to his point.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/2">SIPs are the largest schemes; they are all-employee and very successful, and a lot of taxpayer's money is invested in the SIP principle through reliefs. A review of SIPs is under way, and internal research contractors have been engaged to carry out detailed research into employees' and employers' use of SIPs and to evaluate the policy's impact. On the financial side, we know from the sheer numbers that take-up is very high, but we need to look at the wider issues. That research will be published in due course, although I do not have a date for that. Like today's debate, that would be an appropriate time for anybody with ideas for improving schemes, and particularly SIPs, which have been the major issue this morning, to put those ideas forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/3">Specifically on SIPs and trusts, the Government are not against including mutual or trust-owned businesses in a SIP if the right way of doing so can be found. My officials and I will continue to consider proposals from trusts, employee-owned companies and mutually owned organisations, but any arrangement would need to meet the Government's aim of linking employees' effort and commitment with outcomes such as productivity, a voice, participation and performance, as my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/4">Regrettably, there are those who, regardless of Parliament's intent, seek to use tax reliefs, including even those that apply in this area, in ways that were not intended. Given that experience, there is always a precautionary principle. As a Minister, therefore, I am somewhat reluctant to go beyond what is offered now until the case for doing so is absolutely established. However, where companies allow their employees to hold a real stake through direct shareholdings, and that is done in conjunction with wider, good employee participation measures, there is evidence that the company's productivity and performance will improve. The Government's tax advantage schemes are a good basis on which to align treatment of such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/5">My hon. Friend also mentioned trusts, which involve complex issues. Companies have a choice about which structure to use. When the Government offer a complete scheme, we cannot go into all the vagaries, reflecting what every company might like: we offer a general scheme, and companies have a choice about which structure to use. Some use SIPs with tax breaks, and others use a trust, including a SIP trust that involves tax breaks. I agree that that is more complicated. If we add two trusts to a financial and legal chain, it is bound to be more complicated, but that is the company's choice. Perhaps we need to consider that.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/6">As I said, however, it is a sad fact of life that employee benefit trusts can be used to enable employers and employees to avoid paying their proper share of tax and national insurance on employment reward. The problem takes many forms. An employer might offer an employee a way of apparently earning less, but in fact getting more. It might reduce the employee's tax and national insurance liability, and the individual will go for it because it makes economic sense. When everything is unwound through the system, and the mechanisms that are used are identified, particularly by the tax authorities, it is then suggested that that was not actually the intention.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/7">My hon. Friend referred to the changes in 2003, which ensure that companies get corporation tax relief where the employee reward is in share-based form and is properly subject to tax and national insurance. I am sorry to say that any change must still fit in with those changes. There have been repeated discussions across the board, including with established and good companies, such as the John Lewis Partnership and its advisers, which have sought a proposal allowing them to put in place new arrangements. However, there have been difficulties at every stage, and the tax authorities immediately felt uncomfortable, not about the intention of those who made the proposals, but about the possibility that others outside that circle would be able to use the relief in ways that we could not allow.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/8">The five-year rule for SIPs was part of the consultation that took place before they were set up. All the advice was that five years was a reasonable period for which to give employees a stake in a business and for employees to have a voice in the choices that influenced that business, as opposed to having a tax-reduced way of receiving employment income. That is why we have five years. We should wait to see what the research says, but I have seen nothing advocating that five years is an unreasonable period. Of course, the shares can be removed between three and five years, but a different regime applies in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/9">I referred to Job Ownership Ltd., as did my hon. Friend. He will know that the Chancellor spoke at its conference last year and that representatives from that organisation have met officials to discuss share ownership through a trust structure. I have said that we are committed to listening to such ideas and that if we can find a way, and if proposals come forward that meet with his agreement&mdash;it depends on whether they cost a lot of money or not and there might be other priorities&mdash;we are prepared to take them forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/10">On the Royal Mail, I have only two things to say on Government policy. First, other people can say what their policy is, but the Government have no plans to privatise or part-privatise the Royal Mail. Secondly, however, as the hon. Member for Fareham said, it does not need to be privatised or part-privatised for those within the organisation to favour some form of employee share scheme. I understand that some are in favour and that the Department of Trade and Industry is willing to consider such a scheme. Again, that depends on the proposals. Let us not suggest that the Royal Mail has to be privatised to get share ownership. That is, rightly, a commitment that can be achieved, as others have said.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/11">I again congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. I am heartened, and I hope that he will be, that this might just be the first debate on employee share ownership in which all three political parties present&mdash;the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and Labour&mdash;have talked about making a commitment to it. We are clearly saying that it must be done in a structured and not overly complex way that protects the taxpayer from it being used inappropriately. It should enhance employee participation and voice, create improvements in productivity and give them an important stake.</p>
	<p pid="a.205.1/12">Leaving aside the fact that my hon. Friend now has my agreement to go away to examine a number of things, he should be congratulated on, and heartened by, the fact that at last we have reached the point at which the political parties are agreed that this is the way forward. That must surely lead to a blossoming in the future development of employee share ownership.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.208.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" speakername="David Simpson" colnum="208"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h02.htm#60307h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.208.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to debate an issue that is crucial to the future of Northern Ireland. I thank the Under-Secretary of State for Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" name="Angela Smith">thern Ireland, the hon. Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith)</phrase>, for attending today. She is a very busy lady and I appreciate her giving her time to be here. She is one of the direct rule Ministers who pays a lot of attention to Northern Ireland and is dedicated to it&mdash;so she tells me.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/2">The economic competitiveness of any region is of immense importance to its people, their standards of living, their ability to care for the weakest members of society, the upbringing of their children and their ability to provide for their own retirement. Northern Ireland is a small regional economy within the UK economy, similar to, but smaller than Wales, north-east and north-west England. It accounts for 2.9 per cent. of the people of the United Kingdom and just 2.6 per cent. of its expenditure. Northern Ireland's economy has experienced severe strains over recent decades, not through any lack of inventiveness on the part of its citizens or any lack of ambition on the part of its business community, but because it was directly and systematically targeted by terrorists, who calculated that, by planting bombs, setting fires, threatening business men and extorting money from them, they could not only terrorise the community, but destabilise the economy, make Northern Ireland less attractive to potential investors and thereby cripple the entire society.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/3">Undoubtedly, inward investment and business growth were hindered during the years of intense terrorist campaigns. The provincial towns, as I am sure the Minister would agree, were more badly hit than other areas. They were attacked by the bombs, fires or whatever. It has been difficult. None was more affected than my own constituency. Lurgan town was badly affected by bombs, little money was put into the infrastructure and it needs a lot of investment. I would appreciate it if the Minister used her influence with the other Ministers involved, so that some money was poured in to help the regeneration company, Lurgan Forward, which has done tremendous work over the past 10 years but needs Government help and funding to push it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/4">The Government's response has been to prioritise inward investment, and help to keep society stable and the economy moving by enlarging the public sector. Consequently, and for understandable reasons, our public sector has significantly outgrown the private sector. In recent months, the competitiveness of our economy has come under more subtle pressure, thanks in no small part to the comments of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who, while in America, said that the Northern Ireland economy was unsustainable, despite the fact that the single biggest factor in deciding whether a potential investor comes to Northern Ireland, or locates in the Irish Republic, is not in the control of anyone in Northern Ireland, but is the Secretary of State's responsibility. I refer to the level of corporation tax, which is entirely in the remit of Government and which, in comparison with that of our nearest competitor to the south, has a detrimental impact on our economy. I have raised that matter in the House and we shall return to it later in this debate. However, for the moment, I make it clear that, if any chief executive of any commercial enterprise said the things about its products or the company that the Secretary of State said about the Northern Ireland economy&mdash;especially if it related to a matter pertaining exclusively to his own responsibilities in his post&mdash;he would very quickly find himself on gardening leave. Business people, politicians and civic leaders were busy trying to promote Northern Ireland, but our Government were busy chipping away with a pick axe at our economic bedrock.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/5">For the Secretary of State to say what he did in America, of all places&mdash;the biggest source of foreign direct investment in Northern Ireland&mdash;was particularly ill judged and damaging. It was carelessness of a kind that no community should have to experience and it also ignored certain key facts. Northern Ireland gross domestic product growth has equalled or outperformed the UK average since the mid to late 1990s and manufacturing output has outperformed the UK average since the late 1990s. Output grew by 2.3 per cent. between quarter four of 2003 and quarter four of 2004, compared with 0.6 per cent. on the mainland, with proportionately fewer job losses than in the UK. Employment is at a record high, with 10,830 jobs created in the last 12 months. Unemployment is at a 26-year low and has been below 5 per cent. for 43 consecutive months. Northern Ireland is currently the fourth best performing of the 12 UK regions.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/6">Despite all the turmoil, violence and death visited upon the Province by terrorist organisations, Northern Ireland's people continued year on year to prove the lie of a former Prime Minister, who described them as &quot;spongers&quot;. The resilience, inventiveness, and dogged iron will of her people not to let adversity overcome them convinces me that, given the proper opportunity, business in Northern Ireland can prove to be as good, if not better, than anywhere in the British Isles. But it must be given a fair opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/7">Despite the Secretary of State's comments on these matters, he has identified certain things that are relevant to today's debate. Northern Ireland's apparent strong performance conceals underlying structural weaknesses, which are well documented. Although we do not have the time to go into those in full detail today, they can be summarised as follows: an underdeveloped private sector; an over-dependence on the public sector; low levels of business formation and research and development spend; low participation in the labour market; high long-term unemployment; uneven sub-regional growth; and the &pound;5 billion annual subvention from GB, which I agree is not sustainable. To that could be added the demographic time bomb of 40,400 people going into the work force in the next decade. On that measure alone, Northern Ireland needs 4,400 new jobs annually just to stand still. If we add to that the Government targets on civil service reductions and the indications in relation to the economically inactive, we shall need 141,000 new jobs by 2015 just to stand still.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/8">As can be seen from all of that, we are still facing major economic challenges. The Secretary of State has drawn attention to the need to transform Northern Ireland from a public sector-reliant economy to a highly efficient and competitive private sector-led economy. We in my party agree and are keen to discover what steps he has taken to date, what he proposes to do to facilitate that transformation, over what time scale and what the annual targets are for that transformation. Perhaps the Minister will outline some of those things for us today.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/9">Government cannot do the job of business, but must create the conditions in which business can compete and win. It should be clear, from the challenges Northern Ireland faces that I have outlined, that only a managed transition from the current public sector domination to a private sector-led economy will work. I place on record my request that that managed approach be the Government's approach to that crucial task. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/10">Steep tax increases with sharp reductions in public expenditure will stall the economy, already overwhelmingly dependent on historic levels of Government support, and may impact on political and security stability. Managed transition requires steady private sector expansion, continued growth in foreign direct investment, growth in indigenous businesses and increased levels of entrepreneurship.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/11">It should be clear to all that the Government must commit to a privatisation programme, including significant transfers of both service and estate from the public sector. However, they must also pledge that any revenues accrued through such a programme will remain in Northern Ireland by way of investment in our infrastructure, help for new private sector initiatives and assistance for research and development. Again, will the Minister deal with that?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/12">Increasing Northern Ireland's competitiveness will demand the following: a world-class infrastructure, which could be partly funded by a radical programme of privatisation; ring-fencing and reinvesting the proceeds of privatisation to fund new investment and to alleviate excessive long-term debt; and transparent funding of the &pound;14.7 billion investment strategy for Northern Ireland to prevent the Government mortgaging future generations in Northern Ireland. Will the Minister commit to those essentials today?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/13">I turn to corporation tax. Northern Ireland is the only part of the United Kingdom with a land border with another European state. That brings significant challenges. Not only are we neighbours to another European country, but that country continues to invest massively in infrastructure and, even more importantly, it has a corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent. According to the former chief executive of the Irish Development Agency,</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/14" class="indent">&quot;In the battle to attract overseas investment to Ireland, no financial weapon has been more important than tax in convincing new industry to locate here. It remains the IDA's unique selling point, giving Ireland a critical advantage in winning new investment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/15">The most basic economic analysis indicates what a massive advantage such a low corporation tax rate brings. The number of international businesses with European headquarters in the Republic of Ireland is a testament to that. Almost no matter what else we do in Northern Ireland, while the corporation tax rate differential remains at the present rate, it will be virtually impossible to compete with the Republic of Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/16">Through parliamentary questions, I have sought repeatedly to get the Government even to acknowledge that corporation tax is a factor, but all to no avail. It is clear from my earlier quote that the Irish Treasury, which has been the biggest beneficiary of the different rates of corporation tax, is aware of the significance of that difference, even if the Treasury in the UK, which has been the loser, claims not to recognise it.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/17">The stark reality remains, and it is known by the Government, even if thus far there has been a steadfast refusal to say so openly. Corporation tax has been, if I might coin a phrase, the tax that dare not speak its name. Over the years, pleas for a lower corporation tax rate for Northern Ireland have been made by all parties and dismissed by the Treasury. Those of us who are familiar with the issue are aware of the arguments routinely employed as to why a different corporation tax rate is not possible for Northern Ireland, and we may hear some of them repeated by the Minister today. However, such a change is possible. It is a only matter of will.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/18">It cannot be that the Government are concerned by the loss of a portion of the very modest corporation tax currently generated in Northern Ireland. The loss of revenue from the kind of reduction in corporation tax that we propose would amount to approximately &pound;350 million, which would be more than offset by increased revenues from new jobs. Indeed, as part of any reduction, the Chancellor of the Exchequer could put in place new job targets for the first and second year. That would wipe out any loss of revenue.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/19">If the Government are serious about improving Northern Ireland's economic competitiveness, the single most significant step that they could take would be to lower corporation tax for Northern Ireland to below the prevailing rate in the Republic of Ireland. In doing so, let the Treasury set annual targets for business growth and new investment, to test my belief and that of the business community in Northern Ireland that, far from reducing tax revenues, such a step would, over time, significantly increase them. I repeat that call again today and ask the Minister to address the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/20">What I ask for could be done in a manner that directly altered the rate for companies already in operation in Northern Ireland, or new foreign investors in the UK. Such a move would prevent companies already in place in mainland Great Britain from upping sticks and setting up a shadow company in Northern Ireland solely to milk the benefits of the lower corporation tax. Perhaps the Minister could give a commitment to give the matter serious consideration. The simple, easily monitored alteration I have suggested would allay the Chancellor's fears that such a system could be massively abused, and would at a stroke ensure that Northern Ireland was able to compete with her neighbour the Republic.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/21">What objections could central Government, or for that matter the Treasury, have if the result were increased revenue from new, skilled jobs and reduced benefit claims? The only remaining objection would be the old chestnut that we cannot treat Northern Ireland differently for fear of having to do the same for other regions of the UK. The answer to that is simple&mdash;when during the past 30 years has Northern Ireland not been treated differently when it suited the Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/22">Indeed, there have been examples of time-limited fiscal variations&mdash;for example, in relation to the climate change levy and its non-implementation, to assist the development of the natural gas industry. Corporation tax variation is a further measure that could have a dramatic influence for good in the Province, not just for one industry, but all industry. Instead of casting around for reasons not to vary the tax, surely the Government should think of the contribution that they could make to the future of the most disadvantaged part of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/23">As I have stated, corporation tax could be changed directly with very little trouble, and that is our goal. If the Government remain timid about such things, perhaps the Minister, who I know is certainly not timid, could consult with the Chancellor about alternative ways of getting to the same place. For example, the Government are aware of the proposal that approved and allowable expenditure for research and development and training and marketing included in the corporation tax computation could be multiplied by a factor of three and allowed as a deduction in arriving at the taxable profits for businesses based in Northern Ireland. Might the Minister and the Chancellor get together on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/24">Corporation tax may be the most significant issue for economic competitiveness in Northern Ireland, but it is not the only one. A number of significant problems face various sectors of our economy at present and they must be addressed. I should like to move on to aggregates tax. The disparity between aggregates tax levels in Northern Ireland and those across the border is both a drain on the Northern Ireland economy and an incentive for illegal smuggling. Given the present level of evasion and avoidance, special arrangements for Northern Ireland could increase the economic competitiveness of the Province without having a significant impact on the taxes raised. Can we have an assurance today that that issue will be taken up? Without that, business will continue to drain away across the border, and no benefit will accrue to the Treasury or to businesses in the Province.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/25">Another matter that I would like to spend some time on is industrial derating. The decision to remove that has the potential to cause the most damage to the manufacturing industry in Northern Ireland in a generation. The decision has had a serious impact on manufacturing across the Province. It is clear that the measure will particularly affect the profitability and viability of a number of businesses, so it is vital that the phasing in of the policy is frozen and that a detailed analysis of its impact is carried out. Unless the proposals are halted, or other assistance is given, many crucial jobs will be lost to the economy. Surely that is not something that the Minister is prepared to contemplate. Perhaps we might hear the Government's view today.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/26">The ending of industrial derating could devastate the economy of Northern Ireland. The competitive advantage in business has tilted dramatically in favour of the south. That decision has no saving graces: our economy will lose jobs, tax revenues and entrepreneurial talent. At a time when Invest Northern Ireland is working to promote the economy, industrial derating will completely undermine any modest advances. Any good work in other areas could be entirely wiped out by that measure, and economic progress could be set back years. I ask the Minister why the Government would act against their own jobs promotion agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/27">All that comes at a time when many traditional manufacturing jobs are being lost because of lower costs abroad. There is concern that industrial derating will be very damaging to businesses that are presently in existence and those that may be considering coming to the Province. Industrial derating was once a selling point and advantage that Northern Ireland offered, but now even that has gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/28">Large companies in Northern Ireland operate in extremely competitive international markets on extremely tight margins and cannot increase prices to absorb such cost increases. Industrial derating will hit hardest the bigger companies, particularly those with large premises. By implication, they employ the most people, or deal in commodities with tight margins. This state of affairs was brought about not by international competition or by internal terrorism in this instance but by a stroke of a Government pen. Like Nicodemus of old, I ask, &quot;How can these things be?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/29">I would like to take a few moments to consider the landfill tax. In the 2003 Budget, which I have raised with the Minister before, the Chancellor promised that any increase in landfill tax would be implemented in a revenue neutral manner. He promised that additional revenue would be ploughed back by way of grants. However, I have had it confirmed by Stephen Peover of the Department of the Environment, in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-17">17 February</phrase>, that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has used his ministerial discretion to ensure that the Chancellor's promise will not be honoured in Northern Ireland, thus placing Northern Ireland businesses at a direct and severe disadvantage compared with the rest of the UK. I ask the Minister to find out how the Secretary of State is using his discretion to ensure that the negative effect of his reneging on the Chancellor's promise will be offset.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/30">There are several other issues that I would like briefly to highlight. Northern Ireland is already at a disadvantage because of higher electricity, insurance and transport costs and waste disposal charges. Even our education system, which traditionally has been one of our strongest selling points, is under threat because of the Government's dogmatic approach. All those disadvantages, which have been made far worse by the Government's policies, must be addressed properly, not to ensure the maintenance of political dogma but for the good of the Province. What comfort can the Minister give us today?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/31">Far too many of Northern Ireland's potential work force are not economically active. More than 530,000 people&mdash;41 per cent. of the working-age population&mdash;fall into that category, and there are worrying underlying trends. Since 1978, unemployment has fallen by 45 per cent. and employment has risen by 33 per cent., yet the number of incapacity benefit claimants has risen by 156 per cent. The rise in incapacity claimants is three times the total fall in unemployment. Northern Ireland has the highest level of long-term and youth unemployment among the 12 UK regions. It is obvious that it needs a vigorous programme to encourage people into the workplace. How does the Minister propose to address the problem? What action will she take? What targets will she set each year to reduce the number of people who are economically inactive?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/32">I would like to mention public sector reform in Northern Ireland again briefly. It is undoubtedly needed. We need less government and better and faster planning procedures. There is no political, social or economic argument for the vast array of Government Departments and quangos that have been inflicted on Northern Ireland. They have had a stifling effect on the Province and would be neither missed nor mourned. Is the Minister prepared to be as brave as the problem requires, and can we have clear assurances to that effect today?</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/33">Northern Ireland does not have a good reputation for being able to deliver quick planning decisions. It is not my purpose to apportion blame for that, but it is important to get it right. No doubt it will take a combination of additional resources, more streamlined procedures and a willingness to take decisions rather than sit on them. Quick decisions are vital to attracting investment and securing jobs. Planning delay discourages private sector involvement and sends out a signal that Northern Ireland is not geared up to do business at the highest level. When opportunities arise, we must be in a position to take advantage of them. We cannot do anything about our geographical location at the edge of Europe, but there is no reason why we cannot have a planning process to rival any in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/34">What commitments can the Minister give us on that matter? For example, having consulted on the investment strategy, is further time-consuming planning consultation necessary for each project or each part of its implementation? Perhaps the Minister might care to tackle that as well in her response.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/35">In conclusion&mdash;I am sure that my colleagues and the Minister are glad to hear those words&mdash;we have focused thus far on what the Government can do, but it is important to put on the record that, if the Government do what they should, it will be up to the people of Northern Ireland to respond and to take advantage of the opportunities. I believe that the whole of the UK will benefit in the long run by helping Northern Ireland now. Northern Ireland has the potential to transform its economy into one that is more balanced between the public and private sector, but that will not happen unless it has the opportunity to prosper. Simply wishing it to happen will not deliver it. The Government must put in place the proper environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.1/36">Today, I have touched on just a few of the many areas that need to be addressed, and I am sure that my hon. Friends will pick up any slack that I have missed. Although many of these matters will ultimately fall to a devolved Administration, others will need the assistance of the Treasury. Either way, Northern Ireland cannot afford to wait for devolution before it makes the changes that are needed to equip our economy for the years and decades to come. The Government have the opportunity to make a difference and to create a Northern Ireland that has not only put violence behind it, but has a secure economic future. I call upon the Government to rise to those challenges.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.214.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="214"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h02.htm#60307h02_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.214.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" name="David Simpson">my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase> on securing the debate. The competitiveness of the Northern Ireland economy has been well highlighted by recent pronouncements not only by the Secretary of State but by others in Northern Ireland who increasingly realise that we are dependent on the public sector. That is not what people in Northern Ireland want and it is not sustainable in the long run anyhow. However, when it comes to public pronouncements, it is important that public representatives, including the Secretary of State, should talk up our economy rather than talk it down. We all want to work towards the goal of reducing the public sector, but we can only do that if we engender confidence in the private sector to attract outside investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/2">I want to make a couple of general points and then move on to specific points relating to my constituency of East Antrim. My hon. Friend made many references to the tax regime in Northern Ireland, especially the differences between corporation tax in the Republic and in Northern Ireland, which create disadvantages when trying to attract outside investment. There is no doubt about that. The complaints from other European countries indicate that one of the Irish Republic's biggest advantages in attracting outside investment has been the low level of corporation tax it has imposed on manufacturing companies that export a large percentage of their output.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/3">I know that there has been resistance but, in the long run, reducing the level of corporation tax would not be a cost to the Exchequer. One only has to examine the figures in the Republic. Although its corporation tax is lower than corporation tax in the United Kingdom, it comprises a substantially higher percentage of total tax revenue than corporation tax in the UK. To use the economists' term, the elasticity of demand is such that the lower the tax rate, the higher the total revenue obtained.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/4">If the Minister is concerned that that would lead to unequal treatment for Northern Ireland, it can be offset through the amount of other support given to industry. We should examine the record of Invest Northern Ireland and the number of times that it has been brought before the Public Accounts Committee in this House, where it has been found wanting regarding the way in which public money has been administered and, indeed, the amount of public money that has been spent on companies simply to bolster failure rather than reward success.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/5">Attacking the problem by rewarding successful companies by taking less off them in tax is more sustainable than simply propping up companies through the various incentives and grants given by Invest Northern Ireland. Such a policy would also help to reduce some of the bureaucracy that exists in the grant regime. The approach should be given serious consideration. It does not have to have negative revenue consequences for the Exchequer. It needs more serious exploration. It has been dealt with in a dismissive way in the past. We do not have a unified grant regime, so why do we need a unified tax regime for the promotion of industry?</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann pointed out that, if we are to have a competitive economy, we must reduce the high levels of low economic activity&mdash;if that is not a contradiction. In Northern Ireland, three times more people claim sickness and disability benefit than in the Irish Republic and twice as many claim it as in the rest of the United Kingdom. I do not believe that that reflects the state of the working population. There are structural problems. I know that the Government intend to introduce proposals to deal with those on long-term benefits and it is important that that aspect is tackled.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/7">At the moment, competitiveness in Northern Ireland is bolstered by the fact that large numbers of people have come from eastern Europe to provide labour for many industries. They have made a valuable contribution to the economy of Northern Ireland and it is sad that in recent times there have been attacks on some of those people in the areas where they live. There have been those who see them as outsiders and, for racist reasons or whatever, they have attacked them. In Galen, in my constituency of East Antrim, a large number of immigrants are employed and they make up a valuable part of the work force. That is true in many manufacturing plants and agricultural establishments in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.214.0/8">I shall use a couple of examples from my constituency of East Antrim to show ways in which public bodies could help to increase competitiveness. One of the issues has been raised in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1400" name="Peter Robinson">the past by my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> and mentioned by my colleague the Member for&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Upper Bann.&quot;]&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.216.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1374" speakername="Sammy Wilson" colnum="216"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h02.htm#60307h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.216.3/1">We will never forget.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/2">My hon. Friends raised the issue of the planning regime. Planning has had a detrimental impact on the development of the economy in Northern Ireland. I have mentioned the slowness of the planning regime to the Minister before. In my constituency, the quarry at Glenarm is looking for an extension. It provides not just stone for building roads, but limestone for many industrial products in Northern Ireland that are essential to local industry. However, the issue of whether there can be an extension has been going on for nearly two years. The product will still be needed and, ironically, if the planning permission is not given, limestone will have to be imported from areas of natural beauty and special scientific interest in other parts of the UK, adding to the costs, but not improving the environment in any way. The planning regime has gone tortuously through investigating whether there should be an extension, leaving uncertainty even though there has been huge public as well as private investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/3">The port of Larne in East Antrim is now the major roll-on, roll-off port for the whole island of Ireland. It is a valuable gateway for exporting goods and importing raw materials to Northern Ireland. Its infrastructure has been improved recently, thanks to the efforts of my hon. Friend the Member for Belfast, East when he was Regional Development Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly. However, he fell short of improving the whole. We have a major port, and half the road to it either way is served by single rather than dual lanes. It is detrimental to the movement of goods in and out of the port. Larne will need expansion, and I trust that it will get the sort of help that has been afforded to ports such as Dublin in the Irish Republic and Warren Point in Northern Ireland. The port is an important element in retaining competitiveness in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/4">Furthermore, we must have an energy source that keeps us competitive. There is diversity, and East Antrim is one of the main suppliers of power. We use gas, oil and coal. B9 Energy, a firm based in East Antrim, is a leading provider of renewable energy through wave power and, more recently, through capturing the power of underwater currents. A test has been undertaken at Strangford to see how effective it will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/5">It is important that we have not only a diversity of energy sources, but a competitive energy market. Despite what some environmentalists say, it is important that we do not put all our eggs in one basket and that Northern Ireland has a range of energy sources.</p>
	<p pid="a.216.3/6">I again congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann on securing the debate. I look forward to the Minister's answers, and I hope that this debate will be the start of an exploration of how we can improve the competitiveness of the Northern Ireland economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.222.0/1">I should also like to thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" name="David Simpson">the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase> for introducing this debate, which is the first opportunity that we have had to discuss Northern Ireland's economy since the Secretary of State's speech at the Fabian Society in January.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/2">The Secretary of State was right to highlight Northern Ireland's reliance on the public sector, although the manner in which he commented on Northern Ireland's sustainability was&mdash;to be euphemistic&mdash;suboptimal, as has rightly been mentioned. It was not a great advert for getting money into the Province. None the less, although progress has been made in recent years in encouraging private business enterprises, the public sector still provides about one third of all jobs in Northern Ireland, as compared with one fifth of jobs in the rest of the UK. It is abundantly clear that, ideally, we would shift that balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/3">The hon. Gentleman and others were right to discuss enhanced co-operation between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and, more specifically, to compare the levels of corporation tax, which causes a serious problem for Northern Ireland. I need not repeat that. We have heard what the issues are. Although I can understand why the Treasury might be reluctant to make a special case for Northern Ireland, it seems appropriate to consider a change, perhaps for a fixed period&mdash;10 years, for example&mdash;to give the private sector a kick-start, for all the reasons that we have heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/4">I shall be interested to hear what the Minister thinks or, I fear, what she has been told to say by the Treasury on that point. She is a free-thinking spirit and a shining light of independent thought, but we shall see whether she is given latitude to do the right thing and to agree with Opposition Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/5">I was disappointed that the Secretary of State did not take the opportunity to discuss paramilitary crime and extortion in Northern Ireland when he discussed the state of the economy as a whole. When the Federation of Small Businesses gave evidence to the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at the beginning of February, it reported that 6 per cent. of businesses in Northern Ireland are affected by perceived illegal donations, which equates to some 4,000 businesses. Further, the Organised Crime Task Force has reported that extortion rackets earn millions of pounds for paramilitary groups every year, particularly, it must be said, for loyalist groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/6">However, the Government do not seem to be making a serious attempt to solve the problem or even begin to understand the extent of it. Although the OCTF has done a lot of excellent work, the Government must take action to tackle extortion, because we do not feel that they have done enough. Indeed, the FSB has called for the commissioning of research into the cost and impact of racketeering and extortion on small businesses and the wider economy. In fact, the OCTF feels strongly that there should be an independent free phone line to encourage victims of extortion to seek help and advice. Will the Minister give a commitment to do those three things?</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/7">I was also disappointed that the Government were not willing to discuss the cost to Northern Ireland's economy of sectarianism. I have made the point before, but I shall say it again: a huge amount of money is wasted every year in Northern Ireland by the duplication that has resulted from the difficulties that we had before. For example, there are three leisure centres where there should be one, nine health centres where there should be two, and money is spent on school buildings instead of on schoolchildren. Last year, the Secretary of State said that in the education sector there is</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/8" class="indent">&quot;an urgent need for action to address the problems of overcapacity and duplication that exist across the system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/9">All that costs money, and that has an indirect effect on the amount that is available to be spent in the economy. A simple solution has been presented to the Government many times. That is integrated education. I will not dwell on it because that is not what we are here to discuss, but I rhetorically ask the Minister again to consider the benefits of integrated education to resolve that problem and, thereby, to release more money that can be invested in the economy of the Province.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/10">While it is useful for us to have a debate such as this on the economy, it is the political parties in Northern Ireland that are discussing the issue and taking responsibility for driving forward Northern Ireland's economy. When the Assembly was functioning, a lot of good work was done by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Sir Reg Empey, to encourage inward investment into Northern Ireland. We should add to the Assembly's ability to act in the field of economics by devolving tax-varying powers to it. I am sure that, when the Assembly is restarted, there will be an interesting debate on whether that power can be devolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/11">Finally, even though there is no Assembly at present, we should still be encouraging Northern Ireland politicians to come together to think and to talk about economic regeneration. Members have displayed a depth of wisdom and almost infinite knowledge today&mdash;[Hon. Members: &quot;Hear, hear.&quot;]. Unsurprisingly, they agree with me, and I thank them for praising my perceptiveness. Unfortunately, we do not benefit fully from that wisdom, because the Assembly has not been reconstituted. When it is, as suggested by the Alliance party, we should have an economic forum to work alongside the talks process&mdash;in fact, some such a forum should operate even now.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/12">There is discussion now about Northern Ireland's political future, but discussions on its economic future are long overdue&mdash;as an addition to the political process, not a substitution for it. What is needed is a clear economic package to encourage business and investment alongside a functioning legislative Assembly, with local Ministers who can be held responsible for implementing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/13">Hon. Members have made some interesting points, not least about the under-utilised international airport, which should mean speedier, and perhaps more environmentally friendly, links with Belfast. We have the opportunity for high-value investments. Bombardier has proved that, if jobs are given to Northern Ireland, staff will live up to expectations and provide a high-quality service.</p>
	<p pid="a.222.0/14">I look forward, after <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> has spoken, to hearing the Minister's dutiful consideration of the points that have been made. If she feels that she has insufficient time, all that she has to say is, &quot;I agree with all the points that hon. Members have made, and I give a commitment to implementing their suggestions sooner rather than later.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.224.1/1">I add my congratulations to those of o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" name="David Simpson">ther hon. Members to the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase> on having secured the debate. A lot has been said recently about the sustainability of the economy in Northern Ireland, so I welcome this timely opportunity to discuss <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1400" name="Peter Robinson">the issues with him. As the hon. Member for Belfast, East (Mr. Robinson)</phrase> said, my first duty is always to the House, and I am pleased to be here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/2">The engagement that I am missing is a meeting of the Economic Development Forum of Nor<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">thern Ireland. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> said that there should be a forum. There is one, and it is meeting at this moment. Some of the issues that we have touched on today are under consideration there. I give an assurance to hon. Members&mdash;I think that it will be accepted in the spirit in which it is given&mdash;that, for the Government, the economy is the top issue in Northern Ireland. We need economic prosperity because it provides the basis for living standards and improves public services, but it also aids political and social stability. Those of us who have seen the impact of unemployment in communities across the United Kingdom recognise the damage that it does socially and politically in Northern Ireland, so we are committed to ensuring that the economy is bolstered and improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">The hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> might have been rather brief in his comments because, the last time that he spoke on the economy, I chastised him afterwards, and we had a discussion on the matter. Let us consider the economic issues in Northern Ireland. There has been sustained economic growth for the past 15 years. Its economy is now growing faster than those of many regions of the UK and unemployment has dropped to the lowest that it has been. For the cynics among us, let me add that employment has increased to the highest level ever. Those facts together represent a significant change in employment and unemployment issues. In addition, if we consider productivity, the manufacturing industry is performing well, although there have been some job losses in that sector, which I deeply regret. There is tremendous improvement in many areas, and we need to build on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/4">In one sense, we can say that Northern Ireland's manufacturing output is holding its own across the board. However, we recognise that this is a period of uncertainty and distress for individuals who have lost their jobs. We predict that employment will grow, particularly in the tradeable services sector, which is forecast to produce some 54,000 jobs over the next decade. The hon. Member for Upper Bann mentioned comments made by the Secretary of State about unsustainability in Northern Ireland's economy. The Secretary of State was referring to the unsustainability of a public sector that has grown to an extent that has been detrimental to the private sector. He made it clear that he is committed to expanding the private sector in Northern Ireland for the long-term prosperity of Northern Ireland. That is what he said, and he has made such comments on many occasions since. Far from talking the economy down, he was talking it up; he was talking about expanding the private sector and encouraging investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/5">The Secretary of State is shortly to lead a delegation to India, and I have led an Invest Northern Ireland trade delegation to China. The efforts that the Government are making to bring inward investment to Northern Ireland should not be underestimated. The comments of the Secretary of State should be considered in the context in which they were made, and in light of the action that he and his ministerial team have taken to improve the economy. The hon. Member for Upper Bann rightly said that public spending in Northern Ireland is at 60 per cent. of gross domestic product, nearly a third higher than the UK average. Despite more jobs and low registered unemployment, the level of economic inactivity is higher than the UK average.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/6">A comment was made about the number of public bodies, and the extent of their work in Northern Ireland. The review of public administration that was undertaken in November showed that the number of public sector bodies has been reduced from 67 to 20, and there will shortly be an announcement about the responsibilities that will be transferred from central to local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/7">On the economic side, GDP for Northern Ireland is currently 19 per cent. below the UK average. If we are to have the prosperous economy that we want and to attract inward investment and additional jobs, there needs to be increased focus on the development of the private sector. One third of all employment is in the public sector. We want the balance to change and increased employment in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/8">We must look increasingly at the global economy. We have talked about the Republic of Ireland today, but we will increasingly face challenges not only from there, but from across <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1376" name="William McCrea">the world. As the hon. Member for South Antrim (Dr. McCrea)</phrase> said, we will combat that by competing not on low wages, but on skills and high value. That is our approach. The amazing economic growth in countries such as China and India can be seen as a threat, or as an opportunity for trade, investment and partnership. Invest Northern Ireland recently opened an office in Shanghai&mdash;indeed, I opened it&mdash;and, as I mentioned, the Secretary of State is going to India. Those things will assist us with inward investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/9">It is worth repeating the comment of the hon. Member for Upper Bann that the Government cannot do the work of business, but can create conditions for a managed approach. He said that they are an enabler and supporter of business. Now we are seeing a role for political parties with real engagement on economic issues. As I am not at the meeting that I mentioned and we were unable to have that debate today, I have offered all political parties the opportunity to meet me to discuss economic issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/10">With the publication of the economic vision last year, the importance of the debate was never more evident. The Economic Development Forum and economic spokespersons from the five main parties have considered the regional economic strategy, which will help us to deliver the vision. That can start to make a difference. If we do not address the challenges that we face now and ensure that we get investment into the private sector and infrastructure&mdash;issues that have been raised this morning&mdash;we will not be able to compete. That means ensuring that we have a highly skilled work force, addressing research and development for business and promoting innovation, so that Northern Ireland can compete.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/11">I shall address some of the specific issues that were raised. Several hon. Gentlemen talked about planning delays. The devolved Assembly took an active role on that matter. It brought in strict planning regulations and rules in the interests of the environment and for other reasons. One problem has been that the rules and regulations are quite strict and build in some delay because of consultation. There has been a vast increase in the number of planning applications, but the modernising planning processes plan that I launched as Minister and the actions taken by my noble Friend Lord Rooker to speed up the planning process were important changes. The Assembly made it clear that we need to maintain the integrity of the planning system, but we also need to ensure that economic issues are not hampered by delays in the Planning Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/12">The phasing out of industrial derating was brought up. Unlike the position with domestic rating, businesses in Northern Ireland pay similar rates to those in the rest of the UK. Manufacturing firms have been informed of the decision to phase out industrial derating. They will have had over eight years to adjust and to plan for paying full rates. In the UK, that cost had to be included in budgets for several years. It is estimated, based on just 15 per cent. of the rates liability, that in the first year, 2005&ndash;06, around &pound;10 million will be collected. That is the other side of the coin. Money that is collected from industrial derating can be invested in infrastructure, the development of skills, and the public sector work that is needed for businesses to grow. It is important to recognise that there are two sides to this coin, and that the money can be used to benefit Northern Ireland&mdash;it stays in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/13">The economic vision and economic strategy focus mainly on the key drivers of economic change, bringing economic prosperity and investment to Northern Ireland, and what will provide jobs. They are innovation, enterprise, skills and infrastructure. The key target&mdash;the hon. Member for Upper Bann asked for targets on a number of issues&mdash;is to reduce the imbalance between the rest of the UK and Northern Ireland through productivity and investment. The way in which to do that is to expand the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/14">Several comments have been made about corporation tax, on which there has been a lot of debate. It is one of the matters being dealt with today at the Economic Development Forum in my absence. That issue was raised by the hon. Members for Upper Bann, for Belfast, East and for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson). I recognise that there have been calls, in relation to a wide range of interests, for a reduction in the rate of corporation tax. We are competing for inward investment with the Republic of Ireland, which has a corporation tax rate of 12.5 per cent. In this country, the rate is 30 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/15">However, we need to take account of a number of arguments. Simply comparing headline rates does not give a complete picture. If we take into account other variables, such as the costs of labour, premises and business in Northern Ireland, we are talking about a comparison of about 22 per cent. with 14 per cent., rather than of 30 per cent. with 12.5 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/16">When businesses are asked about the drivers to investing in Northern Ireland, they tell me that one of them is costs, but that the quality of the work force and support from Invest Northern Ireland also make a difference. To me, the key is investment in skills. We need further debate on these issues. We will welcome suggestions in the debate that I will have with other political parties, which would have been today, as to how the overall fiscal system might be developed to benefit the Northern Ireland economy and how we can make more of the fiscal measures already at our disposal. We are not attracting the level of interest in research and development tax credits that I would like to see. There could be an increase that would directly benefit firms in Northern Ireland. I will be happy to give any support that I can on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/17">The hon. Member for Upper Bann said that we should look at alternative ways of getting to the same place. I agree. We need to consider ways of giving additional support to businesses to encourage them to grow, invest and develop in Northern Ireland. I will say one thing that he said: companies could uproot from elsewhere to relocate to Northern Ireland, which would not help the UK economy as a whole. That needs to be considered, and there are related European Union issues. There is currently a case before the Commission concerning Portugal and the Azores. There are European issues as well as local and national issues, but let us look at ways in which we can expand and support businesses investing in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/18">The hon. Member for South Antrim spoke about sustainability and incapacity benefit. I visited the jobs and benefits office in Antrim and spoke to the staff there. They are conscious of not trying to force people into work who are incapable of work, but recognise that it is crucial that people who can work and want to do so are given the necessary support, so they target support at individuals. On that ground, the hon. Gentleman should be reassured regarding economic inactivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/19">The hon. Member for East Antrim spoke of concern about Invest Northern Ireland and where it is investing. I am sure that he would not have wanted Invest Northern Ireland not to invest &pound;9.8 million in a project in Canyon Europe in his constituency. That investment is crucial. We can talk about propping up companies, but recently all four political parties approached the Government about support for Trivirix in Belfast to prop up that company for another month while a buyer was sought in order to maintain jobs in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/20">The issue of energy was also raised. Bringing new competition into the energy market&mdash;I recently made an announcement on that&mdash;makes a difference. We are mindful of the costs, but the introduction of privatisation to Northern Ireland brought us a very bad deal, which led to increased energy costs. The Secretary of State's environment and renewable energy fund will assist sustainability of supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.224.1/21">The real issue with economic activity is to do with skills. I will send hon. Members more information on that. If we can be sure that we have the right skills for our work force so that the jobs of the future can be filled by people in Northern Ireland, we can start to address the bigger and wider issues. Despite our best efforts, there was not enough time for me to address all the issues raised by hon. Members, but I will write to them with my responses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.230.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1961" speakername="Sandra Osborne" colnum="230"  time="012:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h03.htm#60307h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.230.3/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for that intervention. It is gratifying to have the support of the Chairman of the Treasury Committee, that august and powerful body, and for him to be behind the campaign. I thank him for his efforts to date an look forward to working with him on the issue in future if necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/2">The bottom line is that if the policy was sold by a bank or a building society, the complaint should first be made to them. If that is not satisfactory, the matter can be taken to the financial services ombudsman. If the ombudsman upholds a complaint of mis-selling, he has a legal power to order a bank or building society to pay compensation for a shortfall. As I understand it, about 60 per cent. of cases heard by the FSA are upheld and full compensation is awarded.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/3">If an endowment policy was mis-sold by an adviser regulated by the FSA, compensation is based on comparing the current financial position, taking the endowment policy into account, with what the position would be now if the client had taken out a repayment mortgage at the outset. Many people have told me that if the risk had been made clear to them they would have opted for a repayment mortgage. That is a clear and fair criterion for awarding compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/4">On the other hand, if the endowment mortgage was bought from a solicitor in Scotland before 2001, a complaint cannot be made to the financial services ombudsman. Mortgage policies sold by Scottish solicitors in the 1990s are regulated by the Law Society of Scotland, which has no legal powers to order compensation for a shortfall in a mis-sold policy. It can only deal with a complaint that claims inadequate professional services, and latterly for stress and inconvenience, with a maximum award of &pound;1,000 in cases dating from 1991 until April 2005. On that date, the compensation threshold was increased to &pound;5,000 for new business. In cases where policies were purchased before 1991, the Law Society will not even hear the complaint. Obviously, where cases are upheld, the &pound;1,000 limit is significantly less than the shortfalls of thousands of pounds that people face.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/5">The chances of a case being upheld are slim. The Law Society received 113 complaints about alleged endowment mis-selling in the first nine months of 2004. Just one case was upheld, triggering a compensation payout of &pound;240, and 46 cases were abandoned because of the strenuous legal process that complainants must follow. In contrast to the FSA system, people are subjected to the rigorous legal process that is applied by the Law Society, in which the burden is on the complainant to prove that they were mis-sold a policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/6">I am aware of only two cases that were upheld by the Law Society in 2005, one of which was that of Gail McEwan. She received a payment of &pound;500. I should like to pay tribute to her; she has been instrumental in setting up a group in Scotland to campaign for justice for those who were mis-sold endowments. I and other hon. Members with similarly affected constituents fully support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/7">Many people have taken their case to the Scottish legal services ombudsman, but her role is limited to investigating how the Law Society has handled complaints made by legal services consumers about solicitors. In the case of Gail McEwan, the ombudsman published a 30-page report upholding her complaint about the way in which the Law Society managed her original complaint. I believe that the office is now inundated with similar complaints.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/8">I thank the Minister for his response to me in a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase>. He stated that consumers who purchased through a solicitor in Scotland prior to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 retain their legal right to pursue misrepresentation through the courts. That is indeed so, but only cases up to the value of &pound;1,500 can be heard in the small claims court without the services of a solicitor.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/9">Gail McEwan and her group have looked at the possibility of bringing a test case, but the pursuers panel, which is, of course, made up of solicitors, has advised that the costs of doing that could potentially be up to &pound;50,000&mdash;an unrealistic sum for people already caught in the endowment trap. In any case, why should one set of consumers be left out on a limb because they made their purchase from one vendor rather than another? That cannot be fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/10">This state of affairs is a good example of why the law on financial regulation was changed. The old arrangements left many gaps that meant that consumers did not have the level of protection that they have now, but there are still thousands of people in Scotland who face financial ruin as a result of the current legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/11">People were encouraged, in the 1980s and 1990s, to take out endowment mortgages as a method of paying for their homes. Those who sold the policies received generous commission at that time. Some people have as many as five endowment policies, as they were encouraged to top up existing policies if they moved house. As a result of that anomaly, people are having to sell their properties because they cannot afford to convert to a repayment method so late in their mortgage arrangements. Others must extend their retirement plans. For many it is now an uphill struggle to find additional money every month to meet their mortgage payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/12">I have examples of the situation that people are in as a result of the anomaly. The first account states:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/13" class="indent">&quot;I am a single working woman of a certain age who is now stuck with a sizeable repayment mortgage&mdash;the endowment has cost me thousands of pounds and it seems most unjust that because I was offered (I did not seek it) advice at the time of concluding missives on a house purchase I now find I have no right to redress or consumer protection.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/14">Here is another case:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/15" class="indent">&quot;I am told that there will be a shortfall of as much as &pound;6000. It would appear that my wife would be better off financially if I were to die before the termination of the policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/16">A third explains:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/17" class="indent">&quot;We took this endowment on in completely good faith according to the advice of our lawyer. If he would have given any indication of the slightest risk of shortfall we would have taken a different style of mortgage. These policies were strongly recommended then&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/18">A further example reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/19" class="indent">&quot;It took me a year to realise the situation vis &agrave; vis mortgage selling via a solicitor and why we did not qualify for compensation. During this time I now feel that to add insult to injury rather than helping me understand the legal position the Law Society was playing silly games.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/20">The final example comes from someone who says:</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/21" class="indent">&quot;As a naive 20 year old in a new city buying his flat I was sold an endowment by my then solicitor. This I was informed was the only option for a skint first time buyer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/22">The Law Society of Scotland says that it has the greatest sympathy with people who are suffering a shortfall in relation to endowments they have bought. It has taken extensive advice on what it can do to help and says that it is legally unable to order more compensation. However, as I understand it the Law Society of England and Wales already advises its member firms to adopt exactly the same approach to its members as the Financial Services Authority does to its members: it should establish the background nature of the complaint and, if that is upheld, the client should be awarded compensation to address the mortgage shortfall in full. Compensation payments should be obtained via the relevant firm's professional indemnity insurer.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/23">That seems to have happened in certain cases in Scotland, but the Law Society does not have precise figures on how often it happens. I am not aware of any such instance, and given the number of complaints that are being made it has certainly not been the standard response. That places the Law Society of Scotland in a unique position within the UK marketplace as the only regulatory body not able, or perhaps not willing, to require enforcement so that its members make good in full any financial loss sustained by their clients as a result of inappropriate advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/24">There is a school of thought that argues that the reason so few cases have been upheld is that Scottish lawyers are so good and do not make many mistakes. The evidence of a fourfold increase in complaints since 2001 would suggest the contrary. I do not accept that argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/25">I note the announcement made in the past few days of Scottish Executive plans to introduce the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill. Scots who receive poor service from their lawyers will soon be able to claim up to &pound;20,000 in compensation. The current system of self-regulation will be abolished and regulation will be passed to a new commission&mdash;an independent body with an inbuilt majority of lay members. That will be funded by a levy on lawyers and an additional charge on the firms that attract the most complaints. I am not sure how, if at all, that will affect people who have been mis-sold endowment mortgages. However, it will be interesting to pursue that aspect of the matter, and I should be grateful if the Minister could give me some information about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/26">The Minister said in his letter that consumers who have taken financial advice in Scotland subsequent to <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December 2005</phrase> will all benefit from the framework of protection set out in the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Presumably the new Scottish legislation will not be relevant to them, as financial services are reserved to Westminster and consumers throughout the UK have enjoyed the same rights since 2005. Clearly, that is how it should have been all along and it was a mistake to exclude solicitors from regulation by the FSA when the legislation was introduced. In any case, many Scottish solicitors were registered with the FSA in the 1990s prior to December 2001 when the Act came into effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/27">I have been asked to explain why in those circumstances people cannot have access to the FSA complaints system, including the ability to apply to the Financial Ombudsman Service for an adjudication on an endowment mis-selling case. Also, many solicitors acted as agents for bodies, such as building societies, that come under FSA regulation. What are the implications of that? Has the Minister looked into whether there is any scope for the financial services ombudsman to consider those cases as appropriate?</p>
	<p pid="a.230.3/28">That brings me to the thorny subject of retrospection. I am aware that the Government regard it as a problem, but in the light of what I have explained it is essential to consider what could be done to help the group in question, by any means available. I know that discussions have taken place between the Treasury and the Scottish Executive, and I hope that my hon. Friend can shed some light on a possible way forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-03-07a.237.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="237"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060307/halltext/60307h04.htm#60307h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.237.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to introduce a debate on the controversial issue of QinetiQ. It will centre on recent events, from the public-private partnership that took effect at the end of 2002 through to the privatisation&mdash;or the public offering of shares&mdash;during the past couple of months. The issue is controversial not simply because I say so; two of the Minister's predecessors in the Department have made similar comments. Lord Moonie, whom I remember as a balanced, calm Minister, said that he was extremely &quot;unhappy&quot; about this process, while Lord Gilbert said it was no less than &quot;a scandal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/2">Some of the issues involved will be dealt with in the context of a National Audit Office investigation, which I sought and which has now been agreed. The matter is sufficiently serious to have it raised early and on the Floor of the House. As the Ministry of Defence has rushed to tell us, the NAO inquiry is routine. The time scale involved&mdash;by the end of this year&mdash;is fairly leisurely, but the issue is more important than that, which is why I sought this debate. It is important not just in itself, but because of the extent to which it may set a precedent for how privatisations of comparable organisations take place. The United Kingdom Hydrographic Office is due to be floated in a similar way and a similar approach is under discussion in relation to the Forensic Science Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/3">I want to make it clear that I have no ideological, dogmatic problem with PPPs or with privatisation of this type of enterprise. As it happens, my Twickenham constituency is home to the National Physical Laboratory and the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, which was privatised through a management buy-out. The National Physical Laboratory remains in public ownership, but there is a management agreement with Serco and also a private finance initiative. Both those organisations are successful, and I am all for encouraging such collaboration, but serious problems and questions have arisen in the case of QinetiQ.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/4">I will start by discussing a few background elements. QinetiQ emerged from the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency. We are talking about half a century of scientific research done in our national security interests. It produced, among other things, radar during the war, microwave radar, carbon fibre, liquid crystal displays, flat-panel systems, 4,000 patents and 8,000 or more highly qualified scientists. It is a considerable national asset. There has been a sensible move to put it on a more commercial footing: splitting off DERA from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory&mdash;the Government-owned side of the laboratories; the decision in 2001 to create a limited company, and therefore commercial freedom; the subsequent move to a PPP; and the flotation.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/5">Before I put my questions to the Minister, some of which I have tabled in writing, it might be useful to summarise, without comment, the key facts at the centre of this matter. There are issues concerning the PPP at the end of 2002. The first relates to the sale of 34 per cent.&mdash;later reduced to 31 per cent.&mdash;of the company's equity to the Carlyle group. That was purchased in the form of &pound;40 million of equity backed up by a loan of &pound;150 million&mdash;an interest-bearing note.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/6">Secondly, there was substantial employee share participation, notably by senior management. I believe that Sir John Chisholm had a 2 per cent. share and Mr. Graham Love, then the company's finance officer, 1.6 per cent. A 50 per cent. stake remained with the Government. The other key element of the PPP package was the long-term partnering agreement that was reached and announced on the same day as the Carlyle group's strategic acquisition. It involved a 25-year contract, &pound;223 million a year in revenue and a cost of more than &pound;5.6 billion. We are talking about a major Government contract for QinetiQ in support of that project.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/7">At the beginning of this year, the public offering took place and 49 per cent. of the company was sold. It would appear that about &pound;1.25 billion was raised. What is the problem? The accusation that has been made&mdash;I put this as a question rather than an assertion, because there are many unresolved issues&mdash;is that for a modest sum the Government effectively gave away a substantial part of a public asset to a company and to senior executives who took on virtually no risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/8">The balance of risk and reward is at the heart of PPPs and the argument is that the balance was seriously disturbed on this occasion. The Carlyle group made about 10 times its original investment&mdash;the relevant figures are &pound;40 million and &pound;400 million&mdash;in three years. To single out the largest example, Sir John Chisholm increased his stake from about &pound;129,000 to &pound;26 million, which represents a multiple of almost 200. In the trade, that process is called ratcheting. The people I have talked to in the trade are shocked by the extent to which the gains were ratcheted.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/9">It is accepted that a privatisation&mdash;a floatation of this kind&mdash;will produce substantial returns to the people involved. A factor of 10 was regarded as probably reasonable for somebody such as a chief executive in this context. However, a multiple of 200 was regarded as wildly extreme&mdash;not to mention obscene&mdash;and has caused great concern within the company and outside. The other aspect of the criticism involves whether the Government got value for money. Of course, they realised a substantial amount of cash and retain an equity stake, but the question whether they got value for money is different.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/10">In the time remaining, I want to pose a series of specific questions to the Minister. He will know where I am coming from because I have already put some of them to him in writing. First, what exactly was the process by which Carlyle acquired its strategic 34 per cent. stake in the company with relatively little money&mdash;&pound;40 million in equity&mdash;and virtually no risk? Indeed, some more thoughtful commentators, such as Patience Wheatcroft in <i>The Times</i>, have suggested that the money at risk as a result of the financial deals involved came to as little as &pound;14 million. Be the sum &pound;14 million or &pound;40 million, how it multiplied to &pound;400 million remains an issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/11">The Government, in explaining their role, claimed on a webpage called &quot;Combating 'Urban Myths'&quot; that the way the Carlyle PPP operated was as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Best value for money was secured through an open and competitive auction between about 40 serious potential investors.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/13">I have talked to some of those potential investors and they have no recollection of any such process having taken place in the way the Government described. Indeed, I received an e-mail from one of them. Such people are reluctant to be named because they do other Government business, and I hope that we can take things at their worth.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/14">That person's company was trying to put together a competing bid. He said that he was firmly told that at least &pound;200 million would be required and that his company should be prepared to go considerably higher. At no stage was it ever suggested that his company could get away with putting up &pound;40 million backed by a loan. There might have been a misunderstanding, but any such misunderstanding would be serious because it led to a substantial number of potential bidders not participating.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/15">That leads to the question of what were the criteria by which Carlyle was selected. They clearly revolved around the amount of money and the amount of money in the form of equity, but other criteria were involved. Another potential bidder told me that when they talked to the Ministry of Defence it was made clear to them that they should not put in a bid that did not include retaining the services of Sir John Chisholm, who was then chief executive. I do not know whether that is true&mdash;this may or may not be a good point to make; the man may be a genius for all I know&mdash;but he clearly made a personal fortune out of this transaction. There is an issue about whether that was a key criteria. Was there an issue about the stake to be acquired by the strategic partner?</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/16">What was the connection with the rifle range contract&mdash;a massive Ministry of Defence contract of over 25 years giving a complete monopoly in respect of MOD rifle ranges? That is what made the Carlyle deal so attractive; it could acquire loans from the banks on the back of the income stream that would come from the QinetiQ deal on the rifle ranges. Again, the Government's view is that this was done through an entirely competitive process, but I have spoken to someone in one of the leading British companies involved in this area of business, who says:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Although QinetiQ claims to have won this contract, it was in fact awarded without competition, presumably because it would fatten up QinetiQ before sale. A number of other contractors&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/18">he mentions his own&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/19" class="indent">&quot;would dearly love to have bid for it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/20">There is clearly an enormous misunderstanding&mdash;or worse&mdash;about the basis on which the competition took place. The best way to deal with that would be for the Government to set out how the competition took place, what the ground rules were and how the decision was made.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/21">The next question is, why was QinetiQ sold when it was? It was sold two years after the dotcom bubble, at which point prices in hi-tech markets had seriously collapsed, and before the recovery, which has led to substantial appreciation in such share values. That is the issue on which Lord Moonie has focused his attention:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/22" class="indent">&quot;We should not have sold it at the bottom of the market . . . They could have held off for a couple of years. Geoff was neutral&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/23">he was talking about the former Secretary of State for Defence, who is now Leader of the House&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/24" class="indent">&quot;but eventually he accepted the argument we must sell it. The Treasury was pushing that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/25">That is recorded in the national press. Therefore, there is an issue about why the decision was made to sell at that time, with the obvious implication that the company, and therefore the Government and the taxpayer, thereby realised substantially less than they could and should have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/26">The next question is a business question, but it relates to the Government because they were the principal shareholder: how much of the increase in the value of the PPP was due to the strategic partners and the chief executive? How much did they contribute to the adding of value and was that sufficient to justify the ratcheting of their returns? As far as I can piece together, the company roughly doubled in value after the PPP&mdash;its value rose by about &pound;600 million to &pound;1.25 million. There are doubts about what the base was; I have a parliamentary answer saying that the company was valued at &pound;312 million at that time. I guess that there was a difference in the basis of the valuation.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/27">Let us say for the moment that the company doubled in value, because that appears to be what happened. It doubled in value for several reasons that were completely unconnected with the strategic partner or the activities of the top management. First, the stock market appreciated in value by 45 per cent. Therefore, there was serendipity. Also, the Government agreed to guarantee the pension fund, which was in deficit by over &pound;100 million. The Government provided working capital, too; that was repaid of course, so there was no cost to the taxpayer, but an opportunity cost was involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/28">Furthermore, substantial sums of money were raised not through the strategic activities of the new partner, but simply by selling property. Approximately &pound;150 million was raised by selling property, and the annexes to the flotation, which I have before me, suggest that QinetiQ is a very wealthy property company. It has property assets of well over &pound;300 million in net book value, let alone market value, and a great deal of the value of the company is vested in property. There was also the contribution of the rifle range contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/29">If we put all that together, we have a conclusion that is best summarised not in my words, but in those of Lord Gilbert. He said, echoing my view entirely, that while he has</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/30" class="indent">&quot;no objections to the workings of a capitalist system where a man takes big risks and makes big rewards, in this case the people at the top of the tree took virtually no risks.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/31" class="indent">All the value was built up by public servants using public money. I consider it a complete outrage . . . a scandal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/32">One could be pragmatic and say, &quot;Well, okay, maybe they did make too much money, but it has all worked out well because the taxpayer has also made a lot of money.&quot; That may well be true&mdash;it is for the NAO inquiry to establish&mdash;but I would simply say that that is difficult to establish, because we need to establish the counter-factual case: what would have happened if the PPP had not gone ahead, or if it had gone ahead with a different partner?</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/33">We cannot answer that question, but what we do know is that although the Government have realised a lot of cash, they have also made major guarantees and commitments, and public assets have been sold that could have been sold in any event. It is very clear to me and to many other people who have looked into this matter that the Government did not realise anything remotely like the value for money that this project could have realised. Ultimately, however, it is for the NAO to assess that.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/34">To move on to another matter, how and why were the senior managers, non-executive directors and others able to establish the formula from which they have made such great personal fortunes out of this privatisation? I have referred to the case of Sir John Chisholm; I could have referred to several other people. It is important to establish this: despite their claims to the contrary, this was virtually a risk-free commitment. They have argued in the press that if the shares they bought&mdash;in Sir John Chisholm's case worth &pound;129,000&mdash;had dropped in value after the PPP, they would have lost money. Of course, technically there was a risk. However, it is inconceivable in view of the Government's commitment to this company, plus the rifle range contract and the guarantees, that it could have lost value.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/35">There is also an issue in respect of why the chief executive&mdash;and then the chairman, as he became&mdash;was allowed to lock in an arrangement whereby he could multiply his investment by a factor of 200. That is absolutely extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/36">Lord Gilbert is clearly very exercised by this matter; he has tabled questions in the other place that are designed to get to the bottom of it. For example, he asked who appointed this man as chairman. We must remember that he is a chairman who is presiding over public assets. The answer was that he was appointed by Carlyle, the American company that had acquired the strategic stake. Lord Gilbert also asked about who determined the terms under which the chairman and other senior executives acquired their shares. Apparently, that was not the Government; it was the company, because it had been incorporated since 2001. Those are very serious issues. Lord Gilbert is doing us a service by raising these questions, and I want to pursue them in this place, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/37">There are other issues to do with the way senior executives of this company profited from the privatisation. About 7 per cent. of the shares were allocated to the top 250 to 300 managers and 6 per cent. to the rest of the work force. There is enormous disgruntlement in the work force, and particularly in the trade union, because company managers have, down to a fairly lowly level, been allowed privileged access to stock options from which they have benefited enormously, but the scientists, including the most senior ones, have not had access to that scheme. They have had a free offer of &pound;500 of shares, which has of course produced some money for them, but the terms of this arrangement are highly inequitable, and I believe that it was approved by the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/38">To give the Minister time to reply, I shall raise only one further set of questions, although there are a great many others I could raise. This final question aroused considerable interest in the financial pages of the newspapers: why was this offering not made available to the ordinary public&mdash;the Sids? The Minister has not had oversight of this matter, but the Minister with responsibility for it, Lord Drayson, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/39" class="indent">&quot;This is a very complex business and providing an explanation to the public was going to be too complicated and expensive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/40">Therefore, the offer was to be made to institutions rather than to the public. However, the availability of the offering was changed and the public were allowed to buy into it through stockbrokers, but on a rather belated and disadvantageous basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/41">A lot of analysis has been done that suggests that the reason for this&mdash;a cost of &pound;20 million&mdash;was wildly overstated. For example, there was no need to give a shareholder discount, and the use of the internet would have greatly reduced the cost. There were many mechanisms by which the Government could have insisted, had they wished to do so, that shares be made available to the general public, so that they could have profited along with Carlyle and the senior executives. However, the Government did not choose to take that route and the magic circle of institutional investors has effectively scooped the pool.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.1/42">There are many other questions, but I will not go on any longer. I will pursue the answers to them through freedom of information requests and parliamentary questions, as I want to give the Minister time to reply to at least some of my questions.</p>
