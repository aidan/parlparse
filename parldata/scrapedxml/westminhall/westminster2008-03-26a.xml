<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.71.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" speakername="Richard Younger-Ross" colnum="71"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0001.htm#08032678000483">
	<p pid="a.71.3/1">Indeed, although I am not sure that I would necessarily go along with that description, because it implies intent, and I am not sure that in Mr. Small's case there was intent. In some cases, he has shown careless disregard for residents, but he has not deliberately tried to force them off the site. However, that does not mean that the hon. Gentleman is not right in saying that some park home owners have a policy of trying to force people off. I heard evidence yesterday about a site in southern England being stripped of park homes, one by one, with what appears to be a clear view on the part of the owner to constructing a bricks and blocks development when all the park homes have been removed.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/2">I shall leave Mr. Small for a moment and read out a letter sent to me by a park homes residents' association that does excellent work. I shall keep the location and the person anonymous, because I do not have their consent, but I can name the site owner. The person writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/3" class="indent">&quot;My distress centres around a visit from Mr Asa Hartley at approximately 10.30 on Friday...informing me that the ground rent I pay must be increased from &pound;84 to &pound;105 per month and that my contract, which has been in place since 1990, must be changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/4" class="indent">I would stress that Mr Hartley was the epitome of politeness, and was in no way abrasive, however he was very persuasive. I am afraid that my advanced years and lack of understanding in legislative matters caused me to panic and I signed a document agreeing to comply with the new proposed arrangements. Mr Hartley took away my old agreement, saying it would be shredded and I would receive a new replacement.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/5" class="indent">Various people are now telling me that the Park Owner is not in order in making demands and that I took the wrong course of action.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.3/6">That is, of course, entirely true. Many park home owners rely on the fact that most people who move to park homes do so after retirement and that some of them are quite elderly, frail and easily intimidated by a persuasive, polite gentleman, who says things such as, &quot;I am going to put up your park home pitch fee; if you disagree, I shall take you to court.&quot; For many people, the mere threat of being taken to court is enough to make them comply and sign.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.74.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" speakername="Richard Younger-Ross" colnum="74"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0002.htm#08032678000493">
	<p pid="a.74.1/1">That is very much the case, which is why I am arguing for new regulations that would require licence owners to be fit and proper people, ensuring that if they did not comply with the site licence, it would be removed from them and they would be forced to sell up.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned that Mr. Small owns a couple of park home sites in his constituency, and the National Association of Park Home Residents advises me that Mr. Small and his family have a number of sites. I shall read the names into the record. They are Battisford Park homes at Plympton, Beauford Park at Norton Fitzwarren in Taunton, Beechdown Park, Totnes road in Paignton, in the hon. Gentleman's constituency, Bickington Park in Barnstaple, Brimley Gardens in Bovey Tracey in my constituency, and Brookmeadow Park, High street, Wroughton, in Swindon. I remember the former Member for Swindon, Julia Drown, complaining about Mr. Small and the difficulties experienced in tracking him down. We had some conversations then about the difficulties that the Smalls were causing on the site in her constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/3">Mr. Small also owns Broughton Park, Shoreditch, in Taunton, Buckingham Orchard, which I have already mentioned, in Chudleigh Knighton, Byways Park, Strode road, in Clevedon, north Somerset, Green Lane Park Homes at Breinton in Hereford, Hillside Park, Totnes road in Paignton&mdash;his other site in the constituency of the hon. Member for Totnes&mdash;Kingsway Park, Tower Lane, Tower road north, Warmley in Bristol, Manleaze Park at Cannards Grave, Shepton Mallet, Somerset, Moorland Park on Old Moorland road, Bovey Tracey, again in my constituency, Newlands Park on Sidmouth road, Aylesbeare, Ringswell Park, Middlemoor in Exeter and Woodlands Park in Tedburn St. Mary, also in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/4">I have never had any complaints from my constituents about Woodlands Park, but I know that Members have had problems with many of the other parks, so if the media pick up any of this story, I recommend that they have a look at those parks, talk to the residents and find out whether there is a problem with the management in their area. I am not saying that all those parks are badly managed, but in my experience and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for Totnes, my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase>, who sadly cannot be present, and others, Mr. Small has caused problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/5">Mr. Small is not the only one, however. In relation to sales and commission, there are difficulties not only with the percentage fee, but with the requirement of the park home owner to determine who can buy, and move on to, the pitch. The Government amended the legislation, and they were wise to do so, because it had been recommended. However, they have not got rid of all the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/6">For example, Mrs. Hughes, a resident of the United States of America contacted me. Her mother, who lived at Buckingham Orchard but has since sadly died, had her park home valued by an estate agent at &pound;60,000. She eventually sold it to Mr. Small for &pound;10,000 and, to add insult to injury, I think he may have been entitled to take 10 per cent. commission on top. He did so, I believe, on the ground that the home was in breach of regulations&mdash;regulations that, to my knowledge, the local authorities had been telling him and the previous site owner to comply with for the past 15 years. Now, when someone wishes to sell, they are told, &quot;You can't sell, you're in breach of regulation, therefore I am not permitting the sale.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/7">Mrs. Hughes was, I believe, defrauded of &pound;50,000, if the valuation was &pound;60,000. In my view, she was certainly defrauded of some money, but she is not the only one. I apologise for not having mentioned the next case to the Member in whose constituency it occurred, but I could not find the hon. Member concerned. I have a letter here from residents of a park home in Radcliffe on Trent. It says that Wyldecrest Properties Ltd is:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/8" class="indent">&quot;repeatedly putting obstacles in the way to prevent her&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/9">a person living there&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/10" class="indent">&quot;from selling, as she is aware that legally she can assign a home to a new purchaser at the same rent as it is at present&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/11">In other words, Wyldecrest Properties Ltd is trying to put up the rent and the pitch fees&mdash;a point I shall come on to. The person was also told that her property could not be sold because</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/12" class="indent">&quot;It's too close to other properties.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/13">Another park home in another part of the country is using exactly the same excuse to block a sale. In that instance, I do not know whether the park home owner could buy the park home at a knock-down price or not, but I suspect that might be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/14">I would like to reveal the other problems that people on these sites may face. I come back to Mr. Small again, because earlier I mentioned the site at Bickington Park, near Barnstaple, North Devon. In that case, the installation of a new home that had been sold was moved. One might think that if someone bought a new home, it would be fault-free. However, in this case the son of the people who moved there alleged that there had been incorrect installation of the home. I shall read from his letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/15" class="indent">&quot;This is...the most serious issue of them all. Upon visiting the home, it was pointed out to a representative from Homeseeker&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/16">who provided the home&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/17" class="indent">&quot;that some of the interior doors were not closing properly. Upon further inspection, he discovered a bulge in the floor. The Homeseeker representative was of the opinion that the axle stands on which the home stands were not placed correctly, and in addition there did not appear to be enough of them. He emphasised that it was the responsibility of the site owners to rectify this fault, but unsurprisingly the site owners are insisting that Homeseeker are culpable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/18">Even when a new property is moved, which one would expect to be fairly straightforward and achieved in a competent matter, homes are badly installed.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/19">I return to Mr. Small. A &quot;Park Profile&quot; for Somerset&mdash;I am not sure of its date&mdash;said that &quot;Jeff&quot;&mdash;that is, Jeff Small&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/20" class="indent">&quot;was determined that his residents should settle into their new homes in peace and quiet and not feel as if they were living in the middle of a building site&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/21">Well, I hate to say it, but although that might make for good reading in a magazine about park homes, the reality for people in Buckingham Orchard is that they have been living on a building site for the last five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/22">During that time, the local authority chief executive in the area and some of the other local authority officers have changed and the new officers are far more robust than their predecessors. However, the original local authority chief executive wrote to me to say that it would take several years for the work at Buckingham Orchard to be completed. That is not acceptable. It is not acceptable that we allow elderly people who have retired to what they hope will be comfort and quiet decent living to be subjected to life on a tip, and Buckingham Orchard at times was a tip, with wrecked park homes left piled up and rubbish strewn over empty pitches. That is not the quality of life that the residents expected; it is not the quality of life that they deserve, and it is not the quality of life that we should allow them to endure just because we are unable to come up with the right legislation to correct some of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/23">I have a final point about pitch fees. Again, the Government wisely listened to the working group and introduced legislation on the issue. I must say that the Government were loth to introduce changes to the legislation in the first place and they said that they did not want to introduce them in the Housing Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/24">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, who was at the time the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, stated at a meeting of the all-party group on park home owners that she would not introduce those changes. She was confronted by me and a Conservative shadow spokesman on housing&mdash;not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase>&mdash;but we persuaded the Under-Secretary, as she was then, that we would not oppose the Bill and we would support it if the Government accepted the changes that we suggested. As they did not take up extra time, the Government introduced the changes. They are to be congratulated on that. It also shows that all-party working on some issues can be effective.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/25">I can tell the Minister that there are other issues on which we need some all-party work and I hope that we can make some of the other changes that we need. He will find that there is common cause among Members in Westminster Hall today on some of those changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/26">Pitch fees were changed so that the Government could allow other regulatory changes to be factored in. I believe that there is a site somewhere in Hampshire&mdash;I do not have a note of the name on my file&mdash;where the pitch fee review took inflation into consideration. There was an appendix of some of the additional costs. I shall list some of them:</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/27" class="indent">&quot;Costs of letters advising owners of C&amp;LG fact sheet&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/28">the Communities and Local Government fact sheet&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/29" class="indent">&quot;&pound;0.28 / annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/30" class="indent">'One off' costs training / revision of M H acts...&pound;0.22 / annum</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/31" class="indent">Ongoing costs administration &mdash; 14 day notices...&pound;1.25 / annum</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/32" class="indent">Park home base fund...&pound;21.74 / annum</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/33" class="indent">Fire regulations...&pound;1.77 / annum&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/34">I know that a lot of those costs may appear feasible, if perhaps a little petty&mdash;&quot;&pound;0.22 /annum&quot;&mdash;but over a large number of sites in an area they add up. In addition, one would think that such cost for fact sheets would be part of the general administrative cost included in people's pitch fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/35">However, for the life of me, I do not know how the park home owners came up with the idea that they would charge &quot;&pound;15.76/annum&quot; for &quot;Additional maternity entitlement&quot; regulations. I am at a loss to understand how someone can justify making that charge on people, in addition to their pitch fee, so that they can place their park home on a site.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/36">I know that the Minister has an interest in this subject. He responded to the debate on Second Reading of the Housing and Regeneration Bill. I have also heard what he has said informally, as well as what he has said in Committee. I hope that he will respond positively when he is given the opportunity. There is cross-party consensus that something more needs to be done to protect park home residents, certainly on ensuring that fit and proper people run the sites. I hope that we can make progress and I look forward to hearing from him later.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.79.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" speakername="Mark Simmonds" colnum="79"  time="010:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0002.htm#08032678000497">
	<p pid="a.79.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on his consistent campaigning on behalf of park home residents across the country. I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>; I was born in his constituency, and well know many of the issues that he has raised. I, too, shall attempt to be brief, so I hope that hon. Members will forgive me if I rattle through the key points. Park homes play a significant role in providing low-cost accommodation, and the hon. Member for Teignbridge is right to highlight the prevalence of retired people who live in park homes. There are a significant number on the east Lincolnshire coast, particularly around Skegness and Ingoldmells in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/2">There are four key issues that I want the Minister and his civil servants to consider, the first of which is the pitch fee. Despite the relevant changes to the Mobile Homes Act 1983, a landlord in my constituency is trying to raise the pitch fee by 25 per cent., with absolutely no consultation with residents and certainly with no agreement. In another park, the landlord is attempting to impose a pitch fee increase that is above the retail price index, again without consultation. When residents resist, through the residents association, the landlord issues letters, via a solicitor, threatening not only to evict individuals but to shut down the whole park, by taking it to court, thereby evicting everyone. The Minister and hon. Members will understand that that causes great concern and consternation. The problem gets worse. An elderly couple is in dispute with that site owner, who used to be a residents association chairman. They have managed to obtain grants for a lift to help the wife get into her home, but the landlord refused to give permission for the works to be carried out while they were in dispute about the pitch fee. Those are the sorts of people with whom we are dealing, and that issue should be considered closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/3">The second issue, which the hon. Member for Teignbridge has also mentioned, is the wheeze that some landlords use of adding costs for the provision of services such as road improvements, water and sewerage. In one park in my constituency, the sewerage system does not work properly and the landlord will not put it right.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/4">The third issue, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" name="Mark Francois">the Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase> and other hon. Members raised, is the commission rate of properties that are bought and sold. I understand that good park home owners sometimes invest the vast majority of that 10 per cent. figure into the park to provide or better facilities and services to residents. More often than not, however, that is not the case. There needs to be much greater transparency, so that residents and residents associations, as the representatives of people who live on the park, can see how that money is being spent and whether it is going straight into the landlord's pocket or is being reinvested into the park. It is important that residents understand what they are getting into when they buy on to a park, but that is not the case in my constituency&mdash;other hon. Members are nodding&mdash;where there is not a fundamental understanding. The point about legal advice that was made earlier is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/5">The fourth area that the Minister should consider is the role of the local authority. There is no duty on the local authority to enforce when there is a breach of site licence conditions. However, I understand that, to some extent, because, ultimately, a local authority's only sanction is to remove a site's licence, in which case the residents would no longer be allowed to stay there and the local authority would have a duty to house them. Clearly, no local authority is going to do that, because of the additional cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/6">Further changes to the 1983 Act are needed, but there are things that the Minister could do now, without changing the current law or introducing primary legislation. At the meeting of the all-party parliamentary group for the welfare of park home owners that the Minister kindly attended, he mentioned that he was considering a tribunal system. It would help if he were to update us regarding the implementation of a tribunal system by which disputes between landlords and residents may be resolved. It would also be helpful if his Department provided a simplistic guide for residents about their legal rights, so that they understand exactly where the law stands on protecting their rights. His Department should also put more pressure on local authorities to implement existing law and should ensure that they enforce site licences, because that clearly is not happening across the country. Will he compile a list of park homes and owners for the public, so that people can see which park owners are doing their job properly and which are not? That would effectively be a name and shame operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.79.0/7">In conclusion, it is clear that the current legislative structure is not working. It still allows inappropriate behaviour by many landlords to the detriment of park home residents, many of whom bought their homes in good faith but are not being allowed quiet enjoyment of them. I believe that the Minister is serious about looking into this issue, and he needs to look carefully at the issues that I have raised.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow eloquent and decent MPs, such as those who have spoken today. I mention in particular <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>, who is a great campaigner. He always works assiduously for his constituents and always brings common sense and decency to this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">I want to bring an alternative view and balance to the debate, because it is right to have balance in our debates. I have in my constituency Britannia Parks, which now owns Kings Park, perhaps the biggest and certainly one of the best park homes in the country. People who live there feel that it is as close to an idyllic community as they could possibly get, given their circumstances. A wonderful set of more than 1,000 residents live on the site. There are great staff who are caring and who work assiduously for the residents. The site is attractive: there are trees and a huge lake with fish in it, and there is a pond on the village green with ducks and geese on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/3">It is a superb community, and residents take fantastic pride in their park homes, which are new. They are modern and extremely well insulated, and they are extremely well kept. The site facilities are all superb&mdash;better than most new housing estates, actually. The site is fenced with security on the gate, and people take great pride in their homes, gardens and environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/4">I put that balancing view on the record, although I admit that there are rogue operators. I congratulate the Government on their recent legislation, which tackled many of the issues. I have met the Minister on several occasions, and I have taken the Kings Park owner to discuss the regulations with him. What we really need now is stricter enforcement of the existing regulations, and, of course, we also need the tribunal system. However, we should not be seduced into rushing towards 10 per cent. commission, which may be an error. Many people may take the view that they prefer to have smaller pitch fees and to pay the money at the end, when it is easier for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/5">Park homes offer an alternative and a choice. I believe in offering people choice, but it must be informed choice. Several points have been made about ensuring that people are forced to get sound legal advice on exactly what they are entering into with a park home, but, provided that they get that advice, giving them a choice is a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/6">Park homes provide affordable, low-cost housing, and offer a viable option for some people. They allow people to avoid rip-off bank and building society equity release schemes. Some of my constituents received &pound;25,000, &pound;30,000 or &pound;40,000 from such schemes, but now they must pay back &pound;160,000 or &pound;180,000 they feel totally ripped off. Park homes give people a choice of avoiding that, even though there is a 10 per cent. commission when and if they sell.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/7">Park homes create secure, close communities in which people know and care for each other. There are clubs and activities, and people, particularly those who become frail and vulnerable as they get older, can feel secure. Where demand for low-cost housing is high and there is a shortage of such housing, the Government should support good park home operators in the creation of sustainable communities. Pro-park home planning policies, the extension and intensification of existing sites, if appropriate, and consideration in national planning policy of the demand for such sites are needed. Planning policies at local level tend to be anti-park home, which is regrettable. Such homes have a part to play in the housing market. I am pleased that you have allowed me to make those balancing points, Mr. Jones.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.83.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" speakername="Richard Benyon" colnum="83"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0003.htm#08032678000500">
	<p pid="a.83.0/1">In the two and a half minutes that I have to speak, I want to say, in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the hon. Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase> on securing the debate, that Mr. Small's name is obviously wrong, because he is a Mr. Big given how the situation is developing.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2030" name="Bob Spink">the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> has made a good point. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> also made that point to the all-party group on park home owners. He said that park homes are a life choice that many people make and should be encouraged to make. The problem is that, at present, because of the way in which the law is structured, and because of the inability of local authorities and other agencies to take action, people are actively discouraged from making that excellent life choice at a particular time in their lives. I want to suggest three ways in which the Minister could address that. Many of these points have been touched on.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/3">First, on the sale of park homes, I shall describe a factual scenario. I am not dressing this up&mdash;it happened in my constituency. Somebody was selling their park home for a similar figure to the one mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>. She was a widow, and had to go into residential care. She agreed a price with a buyer&mdash;&pound;60,000 or &pound;70,000, I believe&mdash;and, as required, they went to see the site owner. He said, &quot;Absolutely fine. I agree that she would be perfect on this site. By the way&quot;, he said to the purchaser, &quot;when you come here, I will make your life hell. I will put more pitches close to you. I will remove parking spaces and put up the pitch fees as much as I can. I will be at you day and night.&quot; That person said, &quot;I'm not going to live here in the evening of my life,&quot; and quit. The park home site owner then purchased the home at a knock-down price, and added insult to injury by charging 10 per cent. on the sale. I hope that the Minister will address that, because it is one of the greatest unfairnesses of the current system.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/4">I also suggest that we consider tribunals. The Minister made some good points in a recent meeting of the all-party group on park home owners. I tried to amend the then Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Bill so that disputes relating to issues such as residents' associations&mdash;a problem in some park homes in my constituency&mdash;do not have to go to the Crown court and can instead go to a tribunal set up, for example, by the local authority. That is a much less difficult scenario for people to deal with.</p>
	<p pid="a.83.0/5">Having made those two key points, my final point is that residents' associations are still being subjected to unbearable pressure. People in park homes in my constituency have not been able to set up a residents' association because of pressure by the park owner. That is unacceptable. I hope that the Minister will address these key points.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.84.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" speakername="Daniel Rogerson" colnum="84"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0003.htm#08032678000501">
	<p pid="a.84.0/1">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" name="Richard Younger-Ross">the Member for Teignbridge (Richard Younger-Ross)</phrase>, not just for securing this debate&mdash;I congratulate him on doing so&mdash;but for his constructive work in this area for a number of years. He has held discussions with the Minister in the hope of taking forward some of these issues, and he has participated in the all-party group on park home owners, which hon. Members have mentioned. The all-party group is a constructive and useful forum for moving forward on the issue of park homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">My hon. Friend was keen to say that it is not always a sad story&mdash;people live happily on park home sites that are run well and park homes make a positive contribution&mdash;and he was right to do so. However, we are discussing this matter today, because that is not everybody's experience. My hon. Friend clearly set out the problems, which he was keen to say may, in some cases, be down to negligence on the part of park owners rather than design. Hon. Members have mentioned park owners using the rules as they currently stand to intimidate or press residents to fit in with their plans. However, I am sure that there are park owners out there who see parks as a valuable source of income, which is the key driver for them. It happens not so much by design, but through negligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">My hon. Friend has been an advocate of the concept of a fit and proper person. There may be questions about such a concept, if it is a disincentive for people involved. Having said already that much good can be done in providing park homes, in terms of people's lifestyle choice, we would not want to impose artificial barriers that would prevent people from doing that. However, my hon. Friend is right to mention the concept, because often site owners do not just have one site, although some do. The gentleman that he mentioned&mdash;the infamous Mr. Small&mdash;has a large number of sites, as do many other owners, so they are significant people. Using the concept of a fit and proper person may be a way of looking at people who are such a significant figure in so many people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/4">My hon. Friend identified a range of problems: not just the obvious ones in respect of the financial issues to do with commission and increasing ground rents, but those to do with the moving of homes, which are the assets in which people have invested. People do not have so much control over the rest of the site&mdash;they accept that they are paying ground rent and that they are on someone else's land&mdash;but they have invested in the home itself and, perhaps, in providing some extra facilities around it, as my hon. Friend has described. So it is extremely distressing and damaging for people to have that work undermined and their investment damaged in any way.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/5">My hon. Friend also mentioned the lack of maintenance. Many hon. Members have experienced that in respect of homes in their constituencies, where the park home owner is not meeting their side of the bargain and providing a pleasant environment in which people can enjoy park homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> talked about the legal situation in respect of particular local circumstances. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1435" name="Mark Simmonds">The hon. Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> made a number of points, including the key point about transparency, which is important. People who are looking at park homes as a way of enjoying their retirement&mdash;we are, in many cases, talking about people in retirement&mdash;need to understand the issues. Although the written agreements that are a feature of this process have a part to play, he was right to identify the fact that more can be done in terms of the transparency of financial arrangements, in all the ways that those are applied, whether at the point of sale and transference of a park home or a site or in respect of ground rent or any other fees that are levied.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> was keen to put the positive side of the case. Park homes are a positive lifestyle choice, and there is potential for them to do more in meeting housing need and allowing people to downsize, and so on. He mentioned council tax, which is a problem for park home residents. I am sure that the Minister will want to take that away with him, because it might not be a main focus of our deliberations today.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/8">The hon. Members for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Newbury (Mr. Benyon) courteously made brief contributions. The hon. Member for Castle Point spoke about the positive side of the issue, particularly in respect of the large sites in his constituency. If I ever have the opportunity to visit those, it will be interesting to see the size of the community that has developed there. The hon. Member for Newbury mentioned a more formalised arbitration process to allow some issues to be resolved without recourse to the courts. As other hon. Members have said, we are often dealing with residents who do not have the financial resources to pursue legal cases and, even if they are able to get access to legal advice, with support, they may be distressed by that process, so they are not best placed to represent their interests or to put those things across effectively. Therefore they may rather acquiesce in the face of bullying.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/9">In responding to the issues more generally, park homes make a positive contribution. In respect of the park home sites in my large, rural constituency, in nearly three years as a Member of Parliament only one case has been brought to my attention&mdash;it involved the new owner of a park taking a slightly different view of parking permissions that the previous owner had been happy to allow. That was one of those vexed issues, but it was not the sort of problem that we have heard about elsewhere in the country. In the past, I visited a site in the south of England where such problems were occurring. However, I will not mention the constituency, because I have not had the opportunity to discuss that matter with the hon. Member concerned. There was great dilapidation of the site area, park homes were being removed and the owner seemed to want to replace them with new park homes with a view to the profit that was to be made. So they were running down the site to persuade existing occupants of park homes to move on and sell to him&mdash;again, at a knock-down rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/10">We are talking about people who are often older and on fixed incomes, who are particularly vulnerable to the bullying and distressing actions that we have heard about&mdash;particularly in my hon. Friend's constituency. I hope that the Minister will seriously consider my hon. Friend's suggestion about a fit and proper person. If he feels that that is not the appropriate route to go down at this stage, perhaps he will be able to offer interim arrangements that may reassure people out there on park home sites who are suffering at the moment from unjust treatment. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw mentioned his ability to sniff out injustice at some distance. One thing that unites all of us here is our determination to see that anybody who is currently living in a park home should not suffer injustice.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/11">Finally, I want to probe the Minister on commission and the consultation undertaken in answer to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1928" name="Mark Oaten">the Member for Winchester (Mr. Oaten)</phrase> in July 2007, when the Department for Communities and Local Government set out responses, and the balance of those responses, to the different options that were presented. There seemed to be a will to shift towards 7.5 per cent. commission and to consider other ways of creating income for park home owners, but the proposals that eventually emerged from the Department were to stick with the 10 per cent. I shall be interested to hear whether the Government will re-examine that, and on what the final decision was based, given that so many responders wanted a change.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.88.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="88"  time="010:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0004.htm#08032678000505">
	<p pid="a.88.2/1">The debate has illustrated an important point, which is a key matter for many constituents of hon. Members here today, including the good constituents of Elmtree Park in Hartlepool in my constituency. The hon. Gentleman's debate has provided a much-needed opportunity to discuss this matter, and the excellent contributions from many hon. Members have illustrated its importance. The subject is worthy of a debate longer than the 90 minutes available in Westminster Hall, and I would press for a three-hour debate on a Thursday afternoon to tease out in more detail the important issues that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/2">As other hon. Gentlemen have done, it is worth paying tribute to the work of the all-party park home owners group, which is excellently chaired by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1749" name="Bill Olner">the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner)</phrase>, and benefits from the commitment and wisdom of my noble Friend Lord Graham of Edmonton&mdash;Lord Ted of Ed, as he describes himself&mdash;who is its secretary and driving force, and who is a fellow north-easterner. Support for the group and its members concern for park home constituents was demonstrated by the high turnout of hon. Members at the most recent meeting in November last year. I do not believe that I have ever seen so many hon. Members attend an all-party group, which demonstrates the strength of feeling about the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/3">The driver for today's debate is hon. Members' concerns about bad practices by owners of park home sites. I believe that hon. Members accept that those owners represent a minority in the sector and that most sites are managed by professional, competent people. That point was made well by the hon. Members for Castle Point (Bob Spink), North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson), and Wycombe (Mr. Goodman). In support of that view I am aware of the efforts of trade organisations to secure high standards of performance among their members and to promote good practice. However, as hon. Members have graphically illustrated today and as I can confirm from the correspondence that I have received in my role as the relevant Minister, professionalism is not universal in the sector. Indeed, I admit that standards of management at some sites are sometimes woefully inadequate and in some cases border on the criminal, as we have heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/4">I start from the principle of wanting to incentivise good park home site owners, while penalising the bad ones. In a minority of cases, only enforcement with meaningful and appropriate penalties will change behaviour or drive unprofessional operators out of the sector. I acknowledge that further change is necessary, and I confirm my commitment to reforming the sector, specifically in the field of site licensing. However, we are not starting from a low base and, in a moment, I shall outline the improvements that have already been made to the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/5">It is right that I now address the central matter of the debate, site licensing. I recognise that there is a need to bring forward a comprehensive and effective system of site licensing to replace the scheme introduced under the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960. The comments of hon. Members have reinforced my conviction that something needs to be done to prevent unscrupulous individuals from operating in the sector. Action also needs to be taken where an individual has acted in a criminal manner that is relevant to their fitness to be engaged in the management of a park home site. Therefore, let me make it clear to hon. Members that I intend to introduce a licensing regime that requires managers of park homes and other caravan sites to be confirmed as fit and proper persons, and to have the relevant competencies to manage a specific and, as hon. Members have said, in some cases unique type of accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/6">As mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>, I also want to ensure that local authorities have the right tools to enforce licensing requirements and that they are properly resourced to do so. We need to ensure that any regulation is light touch, that it is clear and easy to understand and that it will neither drive good owners out of the market nor discourage suitable other persons from entering it, which is a point well made by the hon. Member for Wycombe.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/7">A new licensing regime must meet the needs of all, be comprehensive and work in the 21st century housing market. Park homes could have in increased role in addressing the need to supply suitable and affordable housing in the years to come. Therefore, before we embark on any detailed proposals, I think that hon. Members would agree that we need to consult on such proposals and assess their potential impact. I want to hear from residents, site owners, local authorities and their representatives about how we should take matters forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/8">We cannot stand still on this issue. There is need for reform and although I fully understand that hon. Members are concerned that people's patience has been stretched, I want to get it right. Knee-jerk or ill-thought-through legislation is rarely successful and often compounds the problem. We need to consider the specific details on matters such as licensing, the procedures to grant a licence, the fee regime, whether or not a licence can be transferred or assigned, how licences can be revoked on transfer of ownership or management, and other such detailed and technical matters. I hope that the hon. Member for Wycombe agrees that we should try to avoid unintended consequences or unworkable solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.2/9">I aim to get my response to the issue right, rather than having a race to Royal Assent. With help and support from residents and the industry, we will get it right, but it will take time. For that reason, the amendments to the Housing and Regeneration Bill tabled by the hon. Member for Teignbridge, which are due to be considered on Monday, are not the appropriate vehicle to take the matter forward. However, I hope that he and other hon. Members will accept my clear commitment to deal with the issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.94.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1451" speakername="Ian Liddell-Grainger" colnum="94"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0004.htm#08032678000515">
	<p pid="a.94.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for his intervention. He is, as usual, perceptive and to the point. Yes, I agree. The county council has always been Taunton-centric. His experience is greater than mine: he has been an MP for much longer. We all know that the council has stifled investment in other parts of Somerset. MPs such as me and many others, including, dare I say it, Liberal Democrats, have had concerns about that. My right hon. Friend is right. Why should the council be Taunton-centric? Surely Southwest One is part of the answer. They want to keep the money in the centre and not give it to the peripheries, such as Brean, Highbridge and Wells.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/2">The creators promised that the scheme would save a lot of money&mdash;&pound;200 million, which is the equivalent of a &pound;20 million cut from existing budgets every year. Last night, I was bombarded with documents from Somerset county council hoping to convince me of the savings. I read them all. They all mentioned the magic word &quot;guarantee&quot;, but it is all aspiration; it is not an explanation of what is going on. Somerset people are being asked to believe in fairies, and we do not. Painless savings cannot be made unless there are real economies of scale, and they certainly cannot be guaranteed. In other words, many public authorities need to be on board to justify the cost, and even then some brutal job cutting will be needed as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/3">Assuming that the instigators of the scheme were not complete idiots, there had to be a viable plan to get several local authorities involved at once. There was: Somerset county council's bid to become a giant unitary authority. Last year, the council appealed to the Government for permission to take over the responsibilities of five district councils. It was a half-baked and stupid idea. The sums had not been done. It was said that there could be a saving of &pound;27 million and that only 65 jobs would be got rid of&mdash;lunacy. The plan would have left Somerset people democratically unrepresented at local level and created the most unwieldy local government monster.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/4">The unitary plan was driven by one dangerous but very determined individual. His name is Alan Jones and he is the chief executive of Somerset county council. Rather like Joseph Stalin, he does not give a fig about democracy. He is, in his dreams at least, a ruthless business man&mdash;a pint-sized Alan Sugar. If his unitary plan had succeeded, the core business of Southwest One would have been ready made, and those involved would have been laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/5">However, the Government's civil servants took one look at Somerset's proposals and rejected them out of hand. They made no sense economically or democratically. Suddenly, the rug was pulled from underneath and the new joint venture company was left struggling for clients and credibility. A desperate bid for extra business was launched. Devon county council was approached, and Cornwall too&mdash;let us spread our wings; let us march to the periphery. Both, as I understand it, gave Southwest One an instant, and correct, thumbs-down, goodbye, you are the weakest link.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/6">We all knew that Southwest One could not survive, let alone prosper, with the work of a single county council and a tiddly little borough council. It needed richer, fatter clients and, what is more, it needed them fast. Last Thursday, Avon and Somerset police finally signed up to a contract to become the latest member of this strange secret society. Soon it will hand over to Southwest One much of the boring back-room work, such as financial services, human resources, information technology, facilities management, procurement and even inquiry offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/7">The police do not like to be seen cracking open the Bollinger; it tends to give criminals the wrong idea. The thin blue line had fixed grins last Thursday, and no wonder. The forces of law and order had paid rock-bottom, bargain-basement prices to join Southwest One. Perhaps they were the sprat designed to catch the mackerel. It is said that IBM wanted to bag as much back-room police work as it could from all over the UK, but no one will get this &quot;buy one, get one free&quot; deal in the future. Somerset county council and Taunton Deane council will have to cough up &pound;40 million a year to transfer 800 people to the Southwest One payroll. Avon and Somerset police has 600 back-room staff, but they are all coming in at half the price. The police contribution is so small that it amounts to a bribe. If the police were not already in it up to their necks, I would be demanding a police investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/8">How did it all start? We are assured that it was from the purest of motives. Somerset county council wanted to save money, so a few years back, it invented a project called &quot;Improving services in Somerset&quot; (ISIS). It was a lofty ideal that no one could disagree with. However, if one examined the small print, one would find that most of it was missing. ISIS appointed a project director on a two-year consultancy to help get things going. The appointment was made under what is known as the &quot;urgency procedure&quot;, so the individual was given the job without going through the council's normal strict selection process. Only two people were involved, one of whom was the county council chief executive&mdash;Stalin himself&mdash;Mr. Alan &quot;Sugar&quot; Jones. &quot;You are hired,&quot; he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/9">The new project director was Sue Barnes, who had excellent qualifications and substantial experience in local government. Sue Barnes is a constituent of mine, and she happens to be married to Mr. Colin Port, the chief constable of Avon and Somerset police. At best, that is an uncomfortable coincidence. Although Sue Barnes was not an officer in the council, she was given unusual delegated powers to conduct commercial negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/10">According to Somerset county council's auditors, Grant Thornton, there was no &quot;conflict of interest&quot; in the odd relationship. Let the phrase &quot;conflict of interest&quot; echo for a second or two, while I continue to be struck by the irony of Grant Thornton's language. At the same time as auditing Somerset county council's books, that well-known accountancy firm was also responsible for vetting the books of the Avon and Somerset police force. Furthermore, I think that Grant Thornton was working on behalf of the Audit Commission when Somerset county council was awarded its four stars. Do we think that is odd or what?</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/11">It is strange how times change. Grant Thornton is no longer hired by the Audit Commission. All current investigations into Somerset are being handled by the commission's own experts. I am told that this time, they are going through the books of Somerset county with a fine-tooth comb. Yesterday's four-star council could be presiding over a five-star scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/12">I received a letter today from the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" name="Hazel Blears">the right hon. Member for Salford (Hazel Blears)</phrase> in which she raises the connection with Southwest One partnership. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The arrangements that Somerset County Council and Taunton and Deane Borough Council have made in entering into the joint venture partnership are primarily a matter for them: you should certainly direct any concerns you may have about the procurement process followed to the councils concerned, or to the District Auditor.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/14">That sums it up. Even the Government see that something is not right. I do not blame the police authority for signing the deal with Southwest One. Given the deal that the police were offered, they would have been absolute twits to turn it down, but I remain deeply suspicious about Southwest One itself. For example, how did IBM become the preferred partner in the first place?</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/15">Originally, British Telecom and Capita produced detailed pictures. At least, they are home-grown companies. Capita has more hands-on experience of local government work than almost any other organisation. What was the competitive tendering process? We do not know the precise ifs and buts because of the extraordinary degree of confidentiality surrounding the whole affair, but we know that after any competitive tendering, there has to be an evaluation&mdash;the safeguard whereby local government officials can assure themselves that everything they have done is hunky-dory. I know that the Minister understands what I am talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/16">There is a specialist team in Government which does nothing else but evaluate councils. It is known as the &quot;four Ps&quot;, which stands for public-private partnership programmes. As the Government know, those guys are the experts and, more to the point, their service is free.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/17">In the early stages of ISIS, the four Ps were called in, but when it came to vetting IBM, the Government boffins got an extremely cold shoulder; they were fired. Instead, the project director, Mrs. Colin Port&mdash;remember who she is?&mdash;recommended an entirely different evaluation process so, at an undisclosed cost to every taxpayer in Somerset, a private consultancy firm was hired. The consultancy company is called Maana, which is a Polynesian word that means &quot;mature wisdom, with a hint of magic&quot;&mdash;in other words, expensive eyewash.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/18">The men from Maana previously worked for Suffolk county council. Guess what? Mrs. Port used to work there. It is always so much easier dealing with people we know, is it not? However, this time Maana was asked some searching questions about IBM's business plans. The consultancy completed unedited reports that have never been made public, despite repeated requests made under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Like so much of this appalling story, secrecy, underhandedness and deviousness rule.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/19">However, there are some things that we know. We know that IBM was hired by the colleagues of the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to run the computer agency at the Rural Payments Agency. I know farmers who still have slight concerns about that. I know that the IT system used by the Rural Payments Agency is similar to the one that IBM wants to use at Southwest One. We also know that it is a hugely costly system with a track record of going wonky and not working. Are the vast consultancy bills a cock-up? Every time one asks, one is told something different. The system is embarrassingly German. There again, what is a few million Deutschmarks here and there? As a matter of fact, there is nothing wrong with the main IT system currently used by Somerset county council, and there never has been. It has been saving money. It could easily be expanded. More important, however, it is 100 per cent. British.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/20">As of now, a team of geeks are working their hearts out to make the software work. The software was originally written to serve the city of Bradford. Now it is being converted to the functions of Somerset. We were promised that ISIS and Southwest One would provide an improved service and real jobs. The House will be interested to know that the important work of producing a new computer system for the two councils and one for the police authority is being undertaken, not in Taunton, Bridgwater or Wales, but in India. That is also a secret&mdash;like all the details of the contract that were signed at 5 o'clock on a weekend morning between Somerset county council, Taunton Deane and IBM. We are not allowed to see the small print, or even the big print.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/21">We are obliged to take a few face-value promises and guarantees of savings. We are expected to believe the unbelievable, swallow the lies, and to turn a blind eye to the growing suspicion of dodgy dealing and underhanded deals. My purpose is to open up this issue so that the Government can do something before it is too late. We appear to be lumbered with an arrangement that ties the hands of politicians and people for 10 years, but the details are totally secret. That is inequitable. I do not think that any of us would disagree that the Minister and his officials have a duty to ensure absolute probity in the spending of public money.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/22">The Minister could demand to see the detailed arrangements for all partners in Southwest One. Such partnerships are high-risk for the public purse unless there is a robust evaluation, monitoring and control system. Excessive secrecy inevitably erodes public confidence and inadequate democratic control washes it away altogether, which is why I want the Minister to consider this simple remedy: in future, such partnership arrangements should be subject to mandatory review by impartial organisations that represent, or report directly, to the Audit Commission and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/23">Southwest One is currently being investigated by the Audit Commission. I am respectfully seeking firm assurances that the recommendations of the audit will be fully implemented. The 10-year deal, which was pushed through by Stalinesque methods, is hazardous. The Lib Dems on the county council pathetically allowed it to happen&mdash;they did not even try to control the deal, and it could now tie the hands of all subsequent elected politicians regardless of their party.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/24">I invite the Minister to investigate how one non-elected chief executive, Alan Jones, forced through such a mad, corrupt, barking scheme. Even Joseph Stalin did not go beyond five-year plans.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.2/1">I am pleased to have secured this debate. We are a thin audience this afternoon; others have obviously found President Sarkozy's attendance in the House a greater attraction than a debate on the future of Aldermaston, but there you go. I declare an interest in the matter: I am the national vice-chair of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and have been for some time. Indeed, I have been a member since the age of 15.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">I was at Aldermaston on Monday afternoon, when a large demonstration of CND supporters and opponents of nuclear weapons surrounded the establishment at 2.30 pm to commemorate 50 years since the first Aldermaston march, to show our concerns about Aldermaston's phenomenal cost and its continuation as a site for the development of nuclear weapons, and to protest against this country's possible nuclear rearmament, to which I shall come in a few moments. The chair of CND, Kate Hudson, said in a <i>New Statesman </i>article on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-20">20 March</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/3" class="indent">&quot;you&mdash;like I on a recent visit&mdash;will probably be stunned by the sheer size of the buildings that are being constructed at the site. The new facilities will house a range of equipment, which will be used to simulate the effects of nuclear testing&mdash;so that new warheads can be developed without actually contravening the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which outlaws nuclear tests.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/4">She then goes on to describe the development of the new computer and all the costs associated with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/5">I want to draw the House's attention to a number of issues concerning Aldermaston, but I shall first go into a little of the history of Britain's involvement with nuclear weapons. Britain was involved in the Manhattan project during the second world war; indeed, Sir William Penney was central to the project. After the war, the British were denied access to US nuclear secrets under the McMahon Act and the US refused to pass back many of the nuclear secrets developed at Los Alamos by British and other scientists during the second world war, so instead, the British set up Fort Halstead in the north Kent downs near Sevenoaks. It was an old 1892 fortress, one of a ring of fortresses around London. In 1950, the site was moved to a farm at Aldermaston, near the former RAF base. For many years, Ordnance Survey maps did not recognise AWE Aldermaston&mdash;it was just put down as Aldermaston farm&mdash;so demonstrators going there would look for the farm, and then they would see that massive place used to develop nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/6">Aldermaston is a huge facility by any stretch of the imagination. I have been there on many occasions for various demonstrations and have always been concerned by its size, but I am concerned above all by its cost and purpose. Nuclear weapons are expensive and extremely controversial. The nuclear weapons expenditure planned for AWEs between the financial years 2008-09 and 2010-11 amounts to &pound;2.65 billion: &pound;800 million in the forthcoming year, rising to &pound;900 million and then &pound;950 million. Over those three years, the Trident replacement programme will add up to another &pound;900 million and other expenditure a further &pound;2 billion, leading to a total expenditure on nuclear weapons of &pound;5.8 billion in the next three years, excluding present running costs. Those are phenomenal amounts of money.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-30">30 October</phrase>, after I asked a question about additional funding and what it meant, the Secretary of State for Defence confirmed the figures that I just mentioned for additional funding from 2008 to 2011. The strategic defence review stated that AWE running costs in 1997-98 were &pound;302 million. We are seeing a large increase in expenditure at AWE Aldermaston, and the intention in forthcoming years is to spend even more on it. The total spend on new investment from the main Ministry of Defence budget will be &pound;1.35 billion. There are many other figures that I could quote, but I wanted to give those as examples of the huge expenditure on AWE Aldermaston and the development of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/8">A number of issues have been raised by people who live in the area, environmental campaigners and others about the environmental impact of nuclear weapons, particularly the issue of Aldermaston and related facilities at Burghfield in Berkshire and the transport of weapons after development to the Clyde naval base, which is, obviously, a long way away. According to an MOD assessment dated <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-15">15 December 2004</phrase> and released to the then Green MSP Mark Ruskell in 2005, there was a risk of an &quot;inadvertent yield&quot; from a nuclear warhead, resulting in lethal doses of radiation. It said that &quot;multiple failures&quot; triggered by a vehicle pile-up or aircraft crash could mean that</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/9" class="indent">&quot;the nuclear weapon may not retain its single point safety nature&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/10">That is the main barrier to an accidental nuclear explosion. The MOD said that the risk was extremely low, and therefore acceptable</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/11" class="indent">&quot;when balanced against the strategic imperative to move nuclear weapons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/12">The risk of an inadvertent yield, or a small nuclear explosion, was confirmed in a second MOD assessment obtained under freedom of information law and published in <i>New Scientist</i> in July 2006. The assessment again related to the danger of an explosion caused by an accident. A response to an FOI request by an anti-nuclear group confirmed that there was serious risk of a terrorist attack on the nuclear bomb convoy. David Wray, the MOD director of information, said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-04">4 May 2006</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/13" class="indent">&quot;Such an attack...has the potential to lead to damage or destruction of a nuclear weapon within the UK and the consequences of such an incident are likely to be considerable loss of life and severe disruption both to the British people's way of life and to the UK's ability to function effectively as a sovereign state.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/14">That is pretty chilling stuff.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/15">Another report, published in July this year, revealed that bomb convoys have suffered 67 safety incidents during the past seven years, including mechanical faults and equipment failures. The safety of nuclear bomb convoys is not,</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/16" class="indent">&quot;as far as I am aware,...subject to any independent regulation. The MOD will tell you that the convoys are regulated by their own internal regulators. In 'Fact Sheet 6' on nuclear safety provided by the MOD&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/17">for a meeting,</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/18" class="indent">&quot;it states: 'Where the Ministry of Defence is exempt, or the law does not apply, the Defence Nuclear Safety Regulator...provides independent internal regulation of the nuclear propulsion and weapons programmes, using near-identical processes and standards.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/19">At the very least, we should be asking for independent external assessment of the risks involved and the dangers to the community. The report from which I am reading also raises many questions about the safety of Coulport and Faslane, but that is not part of today's debate, although it is clearly linked to what we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/20">Moving on to the future of AWE Aldermaston, a great deal of money is being spent to develop that bomb-making facility. The warheads are transferred to Clyde and fitted to British nuclear submarines, which are then sent out on patrol. They form part of our ill-named independent nuclear deterrent. I have two huge concerns: first, about the development of the Aldermaston site, about safety at that site and the one in Burghfield and, in particular, about the danger from polluted waste from the building leeching into ground water and other bodies of water. The second concern is about the clear dangers involved in moving nuclear explosives along ordinary roads around the country&mdash;from Aldermaston several hundred miles to Scotland. We need to consider the huge safety issues involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/21">What is it all for? This country is a signatory to the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, signed in 1970, which requires signatory states that are not nuclear powers or holders of nuclear weapons not to own or develop them, or cause them to be developed. In many cases, it has been fairly successful in achieving that aim. Those countries that are declared nuclear weapon states&mdash;China, Russia, France, Britain and the United States&mdash;are required to take steps towards eventual disarmament and to promote disarmament. I would argue, therefore&mdash;this argument has much legal back-up&mdash;that the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons, the expansion of the bomb-making facility at Aldermaston and the huge costs involved are in breach of the principles behind the non-proliferation treaty, because it requires us to move in the opposite direction. We are not moving in the opposite direction, but in the direction of developing a new generation of nuclear weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/22">Last year, when the House debated the replacement of the Trident nuclear submarine fleet, we were assured that Britain adhered to the non-proliferation treaty and that there would be a further vote in the House on the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons. The figures that I just quoted indicate that we are spending several hundred million pounds every year on AWE Aldermaston, where a huge capital programme is going on that appears to be making way for the development of a new generation of nuclear weapons. None of that was subject to a debate in this House, other than in the debate on the Trident fleet. However, as I understand it, there has been no specific debate on the levels of expenditure at AWE Aldermaston. I hope that the Minister can throw some light on that and on the associated safety considerations.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/23">We are talking about a facility that has grown like top seed since the early 1950s, when it was opened as a research establishment before passing over entirely to AWE. There is now a large degree of public sector involvement in its development and running, hence the murkiness and secrecy surrounding it. Many brilliant people work there. When pressed, the Government often say, &quot;Yes, we adhere to NPT; yes, we are in favour of nuclear disarmament; yes, we are in favour of peace negotiations; and yes, we would like a decommissioning laboratory to be developed.&quot; What plans are there to use that skill, brilliance and intelligence at Aldermaston and elsewhere to provide a facility for nuclear decommissioning, rather than nuclear construction? Clearly, the skills are there to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/24">It seems to me, as it seemed to many others at Aldermaston on Monday, that we live in a world deeply divided between rich and poor that faces enormous environmental consequences from climate change and other massive problems. Does the fantastic level of expenditure on the development of atomic weapons at Aldermaston actually do anything to make the world a safer or more secure place, or does it merely feed huge sums of public money into the arms industry to create nuclear weapons? I hope that the Minister will say that we will never use them, but if that is the case, why have we got them in the first place? I remain committed to nuclear disarmament, because I do not believe that such weapons make us safe or secure. In fact, they make life more dangerous for the entire planet.</p>

	<p pid="a.105.0/1">It is very nice to serve under your watchful eye, Mr. Jones, for the second time today. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on securing the debate. Although he and I come at the issue from very different directions, I, like him, must declare an interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/2">Last year, when we debated the replacement of Trident, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)</phrase>, now the First Minister of Scotland, in response to an intervention from the Conservative Benches, asked how we would like to have a facility like Faslane on our doorsteps in the Thames valley. If I remember rightly, I invited him into my bedroom&mdash;not something that I expected to do when I entered the House&mdash;because from there one can see, just across the valley, the rooftops of the AWE Aldermaston. I own land in that part of the world, close to the AWE and extending right up to the fence of the Royal Ordnance factory in Burghfield. In that part of the Thames valley&mdash;Kennet valley&mdash;we have become very used to such facilities over the past half century. Not only do we have Aldermaston and Burghfield, but Greenham Common, where American cruise missiles were so memorably based back in the 1980s, is just up the road. I may refer to that later in the context of Aldermaston.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/3">The AWE facility is in my constituency, and I suspect that shortly it will overtake Vodafone to become my constituency's largest employer. I am a great supporter both of the centre of excellence that it has become, and of many of the wonderful people who work there and live locally. I am delighted that the hon. Member for Islington, North went to my constituency; I hope that next time he visits, he will let me know and we can have a debate with local people about that important facility in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/4">What first strikes people when they visit the AWE is the great emphasis on safety. Almost the first thing that I did when I was elected was to request a visit, with the assistance of the Minister's predecessor; its purpose was to see the safety procedures for myself and be reassured, as best I could as a layman, that the site was as safe as possible for local people.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/5">I was also shown around the museum, which is a horrific catalogue of weapons of mass destruction. Let us not forget that is what we are talking about. Whatever our views on nuclear weapons, they are horrific weapons of destruction, but in fact the man who showed me around was enthusiastic. When he showed me a small device that an aircraft could deliver in a battlefield scenario, I asked, &quot;What would happen if the plane that was training with them crashed?&quot; His reply was one of the best euphemisms I have ever heard; he said, &quot;Don't worry about that, sir. The casing on this device is designed to withstand a multi-penetration insult.&quot; I have never come across a more fantastic euphemism than that, so I wrote it down in my book when I got home.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/6">Nevertheless, we must remember what we are talking about: probably the most important issue that can affect the future of mankind, alongside climate change. The Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston, as I have already said, is a centre of excellence for science and engineering. Although I wish it did not need to exist, let us look at that positive fact, because an enormous amount of the skills from the work at Aldermaston have gone on to assist in the civil areas of science, plasma physics, engineering and many other civilian developments. Many of those advances would not have come about but for the dedication and professionalism of the work force at Aldermaston. The new Orion centre, which is possibly one of the new buildings to which the hon. Member for Islington, North referred, offers fantastic opportunities for non-nuclear weapons-type development of science and engineering, and I understand that there are great plans to involve a range of civil organisations in the work that takes place there.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.0/7">As I said earlier, I wish that the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston did not need to exist, but let us consider what is going on in the world in which we live. Let us talk about proliferation. We see the development of nuclear weapons in countries such as India and Pakistan, and in other areas such as Iran and North Korea. Who are we to say what kind of world we will be living in over the next 20, 30, 40 or 50 years, which is the time scale for the replacement of the Trident submarine fleet? No one in this place or beyond can second-guess exactly what kind of world we will be living in, and I cannot identify a single state or group of states that, as we sit here today, we would wish to threaten with our nuclear weapons. However, there may come a time when the deterrent effect of nuclear weapons might just secure the future for our children or their children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" speakername="Willie Rennie" colnum="108"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0007.htm#08032678000534">
	<p pid="a.108.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on the excellent prosecution of his case. I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> for his extensive inside knowledge of Aldermaston.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">We must commend and congratulate the peace campaigners on the past 50 years of protest at Aldermaston. Without doubt, they managed to put the nuclear issue at the centre of political debate in the past five decades. They had their first protest meeting in London in February 1958 and their first march at Aldermaston that Easter. They managed to ensure that the whole world sat up and listened to the call for nuclear disarmament, which, in those days, meant unilateral nuclear disarmament. They attracted people from across the political spectrum, including Quakers, church leaders, trade unionists, members of the Labour party and some members of the Liberal party.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">That changed the atmosphere in the world, and it changed the debate about nuclear disarmament and the need for nuclear weapons. It was not so long before that the bomb had been dropped on Nagasaki, in Japan, so that was fresh in many people's minds and fear about the threat of nuclear weapons gripped the world. It is therefore important to recognise that people must be allowed to continue to protest at establishments such as Aldermaston. They must have their free speech protected and their right to protest maintained, and any thought that those rights should be restricted in any way should be sent packing.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4">As I have said, the debate at that time was all about unilateral nuclear disarmament. In the 1980s, debates split my party, as it was then, and the Alliance between those who were in favour of multilateral disarmament and those who were in favour of unilateral disarmament. The debate has moved on considerably since then and seems to be between those who are in favour of putting nuclear disarmament on the agenda and those who would rather brush it under the carpet. That is where the divide seems to be now.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/5">This week, I had a look at the CND website and many of its publications, and the word &quot;unilateral&quot; does not appear that often these days. The debate now is about trying to get disarmament up the agenda and to build as broad a consensus as possible. That is where the hon. Member for Islington, North and my party have common cause. We believe that nuclear disarmament should be at the top of the agenda, particularly leading up to the 2010 talks. In that respect, I have been particularly impressed by Kate Hudson of CND, who takes an inclusive approach to nuclear disarmament. She includes as many people as possible in the debate, in contrast to the exclusive debates of the 1980s, when we had the unilateral tactic, rather than the strategy of trying to achieve disarmament.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/6">The 2010 talks are coming up very soon, and the preparatory talks are being organised. Those talks will give us an important opportunity to consider the work that goes on at Aldermaston. We had quite a successful round of nuclear non-proliferation talks in 2000, and I commend the excellent work that Robin Cook did in that respect. However, 2005 was considered a major failure, and I hope that we grasp the opportunity that 2010 presents to run down nuclear weapons over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/7">Last week, the Prime Minister's security statement included a large section on nuclear disarmament, and he had some fine words to say about the issue. He called for the &quot;control and reduction&quot; of nuclear weapons and talked about</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/8" class="indent">&quot;ultimately freeing the world from nuclear weapons&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/9">He also said that we in Britain</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/10" class="indent">&quot;are ready to play our part in further disarmament.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-03-19.927"><i>Official Report</i>, 19 March 2008; Vol. 473, c. 927</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/11">Those are great, fine words, but actions speak louder than words. Last year's decision to renew Trident was premature, because we all know that it did not need to be made until 2014, when the main gate comes. That is all tied in with Aldermaston, because the new investment there is connected to the renewal of the nuclear deterrent. Obviously, we need to upgrade the facilities at Aldermaston, if we are to have an effective facility there, but there is no doubt that extra investment will tide us well now that we have decided to renew Trident.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/12">At this point, I want to make the Liberal Democrat position clear. We are in favour of nuclear weapons and a nuclear deterrent, but we want to be in a position to negotiate those weapons away over time and, indeed, to be in the best possible position to negotiate them away in time. We regard them as a necessary evil at present, but we should negotiate them away over time. We accept that Aldermaston is part and parcel of the nuclear weapons system, and transportation to Coulport is something that we must accept. However, many questions must be asked about the transportation of the warheads to Coulport and the naval base on the Clyde, and I hope that the Minister will address some of the issues raised by the hon. Member for Islington, North.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/13">It is vital to give everyone in this country absolute confidence that safety is the paramount concern. We need to make sure that the proper systems are in place, and I hope that the Minister will consider some form of independent external assessment for the regime. Obviously, security considerations need to be attended to so that no information can leak about when warheads are to be transported to Coulport, but I am sure that a system could be devised to give people such as the hon. Member for Islington, North and myself the confidence that safety is paramount.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/14">The hon. Member for Islington, North raised the question of the amount of investment going into Aldermaston. It amounts to considerable sums&mdash;the figure of &pound;5 billion has been mentioned. That is going on the new ORION laser, which replaces the HELEN laser and the hydrodynamic tester. I was in the fortunate position last year of being able to visit Aldermaston with the Select Committee on Defence. It was a very informative visit, in which top-class researchers showed us around the facilities. It did not mean an awful lot to me as a biologist. It seemed like an awful lot of expensive technical equipment in big caverns. However, there was in reality a lot happening on the site, and it attracts many top-class scientists. Part of the battle is making sure that Aldermaston, which is an essential part of the nuclear weapons system, is not deskilled, and that we attract the brightest and best to that facility, especially when we are, unfortunately, developing civil nuclear facilities in power stations. There will be huge competition for such scientists, and we need to ensure that proper investment is made in the establishment, so that safety standards are maintained and there is absolute confidence in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/15">I want to mention the sell-off of the British Nuclear Fuels Ltd part of AWE plc. That relates to the partnership between BNFL, Serco and Lockheed Martin. I understand that Serco, which is part of the Babcock Group, in which I have a constituency interest, and Lockheed Martin, have been excluded from buying the BNFL part of the partnership. Is that so? Why was it necessary to exclude a well established British company from obtaining a greater stake in Aldermaston?</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/16">What plans do the Government have for a new warhead? I have seen written answers that state categorically that there are no plans for a new warhead, but the new facilities at Aldermaston will come in handy when a new nuclear warhead is developed. I want the Minister to explain a bit more about the process of extending the life of the current warheads, whether there are any problems in doing that, and what consideration has been given to any potential new warhead. Will we go down the route of having tactical rather than strategic weapons, which would be a retrograde step because they are more likely to be used?</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/17">We accept that Aldermaston is part and parcel of a nuclear deterrent system. I should like to see the day when the facility is run down, because we no longer have nuclear weapons. However, as long as we have them, it is part of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/18">I referred earlier to the premature decision on renewing Trident submarines, and the fact that the main gate decision did not need to be made until about 2012 or 2014. I understand the issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.112.0/1">I shall directly address the point made by the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase>, about the long-term future. When he asks of the Conservative party, &quot;Will we always have nuclear weapons?&quot;, the answer is, &quot;Yes, as long as other countries have nuclear weapons too&quot;. That is not a controversial viewpoint; that is the key point about unilateral nuclear disarmament that has resonated throughout the debate for the last half-century.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/2">Twenty-five years ago, when I was working professionally in this sector and was arguing the case both for the replacement of Polaris by Trident and for the deployment of Cruise missiles at Greenham Common and Molesworth, I commissioned a series of opinion polls that asked that very question: &quot;Do you think that Britain should continue to possess nuclear weapons as long as other countries have them?&quot; The answer that came in time and again throughout the 1980s, at the height of the second cold war, was as follows: two thirds of people asked said, &quot;Yes, we should continue to have the nuclear deterrent as long as other countries have nuclear weapons&quot;; about one quarter said, &quot;No&quot;; and usually fewer than 10 per cent. of those asked&mdash;it was usually a single figure number&mdash;were undecided, because it is indeed a very polarising issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/3">A couple of years ago, I asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1958" name="John Reid">the right hon. Member for Airdrie and Shotts (John Reid)</phrase>, the then Secretary of State for Defence, what polling evidence the Government had on such questions. The interesting written answer came back, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-03">3 November 2005</phrase>, that the Government had last conducted a poll a few years earlier, in December 2003, and that</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Overall, some 66 per cent. agreed that the UK should retain nuclear weapons while other countries retain theirs, with 21 per cent. disagreeing&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-11-03.1261"><i>Official Report</i>, 3 November 2005; Vol. 438, c. 1261W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.112.0/5">So we can see a pattern continuing throughout the decades showing that about two thirds of the British people think that, as long as other countries have nuclear weapons, we should continue to possess them, and I believe that they are absolutely right to think that.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.1/1">I really thank the hon. Gentleman for entering into the spirit of the occasion. He and I have debated these points many times, so my response now will not come as anything of a surprise to him. I do not accept that there is an equality between stable democracies that have certain weapons systems, and lunatic dictatorships, which should not have them. I believe that there is no inconsistency in saying that it is perfectly acceptable for a democracy to be armed with a certain weapons system and a lunatic dictatorship to be denied it. I do not accept that there is an equality between dictatorships and democracies.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.1/2">By way of example, I cite the attitude that we had towards Russia when it was a totalitarian Soviet state, and that we had when it ceased to be one. As soon as the dictatorial and aggressive element went out of the Russian political system&mdash;perhaps temporarily but hopefully permanently, despite recent adverse indications&mdash;we straight away stopped worrying about the Russian nuclear arsenal, except in one respect. Because we were no longer afraid that the Kremlin might use that arsenal aggressively, we began to worry instead that remnants or elements of that arsenal, including individual nuclear devices, would leech out and into the hands of other groups and regimes that would not hesitate to use such weapons aggressively if they could get their hands on them. So what matters is not the nature of the weapons themselves, but the nature of the regimes or groups that control them. It is perfectly acceptable for democracies to have these weapons while denying dictatorships the same right.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">The hon. Gentleman and I ought to consider going on the stage as a professional double act, because he seamlessly carries me forward in my argument. He has referred to article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty, which I shall now read out, as I do in all debates on this issue. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/3">The last part about</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/4" class="indent">&quot;general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/5">is always left out when CND supporters quote article 6, as it means worldwide conventional disarmament. Article 6 requires us to do three things, one of which is to end the nuclear arms race at an early date. Britain has never been involved in the nuclear arms race, and nor have France or China. Each of those three of the five recognised nuclear powers in the non-proliferation treaty regime has followed a policy of minimum strategic nuclear deterrence, which means that we are content to have a tiny proportion of nuclear devices, in comparison with the superpowers, because we know that having even that small number is enough for strategic nuclear deterrence purposes. Russia and the United States were involved in the nuclear arms race, not the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/6">Article 6 also requires us to try to negotiate a treaty for worldwide nuclear disarmament and for worldwide conventional disarmament. Nothing in the article requires us to give up all our nuclear weapons before other countries do the same or before achieving a world Government to prevent an outbreak of conventional war on a grand scale&mdash;and by God, it was on a grand scale before nuclear weapons came along. Many more people were killed by conventional weapons in world wars one and two than died in Japan in August 1945. I venture to suggest, although I shall never be able to prove it, that many more would have been killed in &quot;world war three&quot; by conventional weapons or other nuclear weapons if the good people of Aldermaston, as well as the scientists, the people in the Royal Navy and the people in the Royal Air Force before them who constitute the strategic nuclear deterrent of the United Kingdom had not done their work so well. I appreciate the opportunity that the hon. Member for Islington, North has given me to pay tribute to the real peacekeepers of the cold war and, I trust, the post-cold war period&mdash;the men and women of Aldermaston and of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force before them.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/7">I shall conclude soon, but first I shall address a few of the points that the hon. Gentleman made. He talked about the cost of Aldermaston. I refer him to a written answer that I received in December 2006 when I asked the Secretary of State for Defence</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/8" class="indent">&quot;what the running costs have been of the strategic nuclear deterrent in each of the past 10 years&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/9">The answer was that they had ranged between</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/10" class="indent">&quot;3 and 5.5 per cent. of the annual defence budget.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2006-12-04.87"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 December 2006; Vol. 454, c. 87W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/11">Of course, 3 per cent. or 5.5 per cent. of the annual defence budget is a large sum of money, but as a proportion of the defence budget, it is small. If there is a strategic justification for a weapons system, what more justification can one have than that it will deter others from using such a weapons system against one? Then, it is a small price to pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/12">I commend my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1727" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Mr. Benyon)</phrase> on his excellent speech and the way in which he focused on the fundamental point about the unpredictability of conflict. He was absolutely right to pick on the conflicts that he mentioned: super-sensitive Israel was taken by surprise in 1973, and we were taken by surprise by the invasion of the Falklands in 1982. He was right to say that everyone was taken by surprise in 1990 when Saddam attacked Kuwait. He could also have mentioned that the world's only superpower was taken by surprise by 9/11 in 2001. I could cite examples from further back in history to show that when warfare breaks out, more often than not, it has not been predicted. It is a big mistake to assume that because weapons can do terrible things, the good guys should get rid of them regardless of what the bad guys do.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/13">Finally, I shall address the Liberal Democrat contribution. Of course, CND says little about unilateralism these days, and tries to blur it in a general distinction about nuclear disarmament; it has always done that. I remember Bruce Kent arguing that he was both a unilateralist and a multilateralist, but one cannot be both. Either we keep nuclear weapons as long as other countries have them, or we say that we are going to get rid of them whether other countries have them or not. We cannot marry the two, and I know on which side of the argument my party and I stand on this life and death issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.123.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" speakername="Martin Linton" colnum="123"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0009.htm#08032678000563">
	<p pid="a.123.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones. I am grateful for the chance to raise the issue of high street shops in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/2">Battersea has a long high street, only the first part of which is called Battersea High street, which ends in a market. The second part is called Falcon road, and the third is the main shopping street in Clapham Junction, which is probably the biggest shopping centre in south-west London. I am concerned only with the last half mile of the high street, which is known as Northcote road, a popular, traditional high street with a market and a lot of small independently owned traditional food shops, including bakers, butchers, fishmongers, a cheese shop, an Italian deli and patisseries, as well as a lot of wine bars, restaurants and coffee shops. It also has a bookshop, a music shop, a toy shop, a kitchen shop and even a honey shop. Nowadays, there are a lot of expensive clothes shops, including children's clothes shops, as might be expected in an area that has been known for the past 15 years, at least, as &quot;Nappy Valley&quot;. As long as people have the money to shop there, I do not think that I am exaggerating when I say that it is one of the nicest shopping streets in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/3">There is a problem, because the national chains want to move in and cash in on the street's popularity. Landlords are responding by raising rents, with the result that they are threatening the very food shops that make the street popular in the first place&mdash;in other words, they are in danger of killing the goose that lays the golden eggs. We have already lost some popular food shops, after their leases came to an end or the rents were doubled and, in some cases, trebled, and those that remain are feeling the squeeze. They either have to pass on the cost of their higher rents to customers, if they can, or move; those are the only options.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/4">The street has already lost a post office because of the high rents. The last postmaster retired in 2006 and although the Post Office advertised the vacancy several times, it could not find an applicant who could afford to take on the franchise. That post office has now been written off as part of the current consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/5">Over the 18 months to two years since the campaign started, we are seeing ever more upmarket clothes shops, which may be fun for some people to shop in but are in danger of squeezing out the food shops that give the street its character. That is not at all what people want. The Northcote road action group was set up in 2006, and 250 people, both shopkeepers and residents&mdash;more residents, of course, than shopkeepers&mdash;attended its inaugural meeting. Some 7,000 people signed a petition presented to the council by Prunella Scales, a local resident.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/6">Wandsworth council has called in a consultant to report on what it can do through existing planning powers. It already has a strict planning regime on the street. The first 50 shops or so are in a protected secondary frontage and the council can refuse non-retail use, if the proportion of retail falls below 60 per cent. The next 50 shops have slightly less protection. Then there is a middle section of the street. The far end of the street is classed as an important local parade. So the council uses the current planning powers to try to support the character of the street.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/7">The planning system allows the council to prioritise retail over wine bars and estate agents, at least in most of the street, and if it is possible to do that more effectively by re-zoning the street or changing the zoning, we should do so. There may be some leeway for giving greater protection to retail shops by extending the protected secondary frontage further down the street, but planning law will never allow the council to favour independent shops over chain stores or small shops over bigger shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/8">I am more concerned about what cannot be done through existing powers. We would need a change in planning laws or regulations, because the council and local councils are pursuing everything that can be done through existing powers. It is my job to pursue those things that cannot be done. I hope that the Minister will apply his mind to what changes can be made in the law to give councils the powers that they need to protect food shops in popular shopping streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/9">The problem is by no means unique to Northcote road. Other streets, such as Portobello road and Marylebone High street, face similar problems. There may be many more, for all I know, in other parts of London or in other cities, but these are the only streets that I know about which are victims of their own success. The popularity of such a street becomes a problem, because it brings in so many national chains or other shops that squeeze out the shops that were there originally.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/10">Marylebone High street has found a solution to this problem; it has retained that old villagey high street character, with its own butchers, bakers, chemist and all the shops that people would expect to find in a traditional high street, despite being close to Oxford street. Some of those shops might be quite expensive, but at least when people walk down Marylebone high street they feel that they are in a traditional high street with a good range of food shops. What is unique about Marylebone High street is that all the shops are owned by one man&mdash;Lord Howard de Walden&mdash;who knows that it is not only in the residents' interest, but in his interest as the landlord to keep a butchers and a bakers in the high street, so that people can continue to do all their shopping in the same street. That solution is not available in Northcote road, where no landlord owns more than a dozen shops and most are individually owned, so no one person has an interest in keeping a good mix of shops in the high street. Left to their individual devices, all the landlords naturally rent their shops to the highest bidder, without any consideration of how that affects the balance of shops in the street.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/11">Portobello road is, of course, famous and draws people from all over London and probably from outside. Kensington and Chelsea borough council set up an inquiry involving people such as Terence Conran to see what can be done to protect its character. It came up with 54 recommendations, which were mainly things for the council to do or for shopkeepers to do themselves, but about a dozen were recommendations for Government action, and some of those are worthy of the Minister's consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/12">The first thing is to protect small food shops by putting them in a special planning category. One could then stop chains from buying up shop fronts and creating big shops by requiring planning permission to knock two shops into one. That would require a definition of a small shop to be in place&mdash;the inquiry group suggested 80 sq m&mdash;and any plan to increase a shop's size above that limit would require planning permission. One could also prioritise food shops over coffee shops and internet cafes, which has been a particular problem in some high streets, as they take over sites from food shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/13">Behind such measures, councils need to be enabled to make diversity of shops one of the reasons why they can turn down a planning application. Otherwise, they will be powerless to do anything other than stand by and watch as a much-loved high street turns into a row of wine bars, with all the problems that creates for the neighbours, or into a row of expensive fashion boutiques, which, although they are not objectionable in themselves, are not helpful because people cannot eat clothes.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/14">If there is nothing but boutiques or rows of estates agents&mdash;as in Lavender Hill&mdash;it is no longer a high street. That is what has started to happen on Northcote road. As much as I would like the council to use its existing powers to the utmost&mdash;there are still ways in which it can do more&mdash;it does not have the power to stop those trends, once they take hold.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/15">I shall mention a couple of suggestions that have been made. Wandsworth council is keen for more powers for retail conservation areas, which could be used more effectively to protect existing high streets. A number of organisations have suggested expanding the small business rate rebate scheme, which would favour smaller shops, regardless of their ownership. That would help to correct the balance, which can get out of kilter when large chains try to move in. I have nothing against large chains, and I appreciate that in planning law it is impossible to have a satisfactory definition of what a chain is. A small individually owned shop may set up a branch in a neighbouring high street and become a chain, but it should not be thrown out of the original high street simply because it is part of a chain. It would be a penalty of success if belonging to a group of more than one shop was a reason to refuse planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/16">We must find other ways&mdash;proxies&mdash;to provide a distinction to enable planning authorities to control the tendency for large chains to take over shopping centres, push out individually owned or characterful shops and create a high street identical to one somewhere in the London suburbs. One can walk down several high streets, see exactly the same shops and wonder which particular high street one is in. Northcote road is nothing like that yet; it is a characterful shopping parade. People love it for its character, and they want to preserve that. I fear that the fundamental problem is that the planning system leaves too much to the whim of the market and gives too few powers to the local community to defend its own high street.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/17">Of course, I fully accept that shops come and go&mdash;they always will. I am not making an argument for or against town centre shopping. I am not an opponent of supermarkets; on the contrary, I like to shop in them myself. However, I am saying that we must be alive to new trends such as those in places such as Northcote road. Many people there want to be able to shop for everything on their own high street. Such people are not particularly price sensitive. They do not mind if the small individually owned butchers that they go to charges a little more for a leg of lamb, because they value knowing the butcher and being able to discuss with him how he has treated the meat, how he cuts it and what his cooking recommendations are. People know that they and the butcher are part of a community.</p>
	<p pid="a.123.1/18">That is the high street many of us know from our childhoods, and it is how the traditional English high street is described in history books. It is ironic that there was a time when the only people who did not shop in the high street were wealthy people, who shopped in Harrods food hall. Now, those at the lower end of the income scale shop at Asda, and those at the higher end prefer to shop on a traditional high street. However, this is not solely a matter for one income group, because the high street is one of our traditions. Although I do not wish to detract from the need for supermarkets, we ought to be alive to fact that many people want to preserve their local high street. In relation to this example, huge numbers of people have signed petitions, campaigned, and attended protests to defend their high street. What people do not have, and what I hope the Minister will point us towards, are the planning powers that would enable them to defend those high streets.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.126.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="126"  time="016:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0010.htm#08032678000564">
	<p pid="a.126.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Jones, and it is a long time&mdash;about five hours&mdash;since I last saw you. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> for his thoughtful contribution to the important issue of the future of our high streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/2">It is difficult to overestimate the importance of our high streets and town centres&mdash;whether they are larger cities, market towns or small villages. The places that provide goods, services and amenities for our day-to-day needs are much more than just places to shop or work, to which my hon. Friend alluded. They also provide the focus for our civic and cultural life and are at the heart of our communities. When I or other Ministers talk about the importance of place-shaping, a vibrant high street and town centre is at the heart of what we mean.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/3">That is why the Government are committed to providing a suitable and appropriate framework to help develop and maintain thriving high streets and town centres. I hope that my hon. Friend and others would agree that the past decade has seen a welcome renaissance for thriving town centres. I grew up in the 1970s and early 1980s and I remember the ghost towns that were caused by economic depression. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a tendency for planners to concentrate on out-of-town development. Independent retailers in towns and cities struggled because of the emergence of retail parks. Town centres virtually shut down at 5pm and became cultural deserts and havens for crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/4">In the past decade that situation has been turned around. The proportion of new retail development in and around town centres has increased from less than 25 per cent. in 1994 to around 40 per cent. in 2005. Most of the top 50 retail centres have received a new major town centre retail scheme. I was in Birmingham recently, for the Labour party spring conference, where there is the exciting and vibrant Bullring. Manchester is a fantastic northern city that has smart new shops and high-quality public spaces. Other areas, such as Reading, have new developments in the pipeline to maintain their competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/5">A significant amount of retail development is now planned for smaller and medium-sized centres, as well. To see the difference such a development can make, I suggest that people have a look at Corby. I was there recently and it has a fantastic, positive and optimistic future, which is largely thanks to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" name="Phil Hope">the Member for Corby (Phil Hope)</phrase>. Corby has ambitious plans regarding an Olympic swimming pool and other Olympic facilities, and a fantastic theatre. Other successes will build on the positive work of Willow Place, which is at the heart of the town. That is the model that we need to take forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/6">The turnaround over the past decade that I have mentioned is the result of a number of factors. A favourable economic climate over the past 10 years has helped to provide confidence and has ensured that previously boarded-up properties in our town centres have become vibrant areas in which to shop, relax and work. The planning system has also been important in leading to a turnaround. We have maintained a strong planning policy over the past 10 years, and we have sought to promote the vitality and viability of town centres and to ensure that they meet the needs of the entire community in a good environment that is accessible to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/7">Our planning policy statement 6, &quot;Planning for Town Centres&quot;, asks local authorities to plan proactively for how they want their area to develop, and to take the lead in preparing a shared vision for town centres in partnership with business, retailers and the wider community. Good development plans can be immensely powerful. They can effectively target the range of specific challenges that different places face. If local people want to preserve the character of their high street, as in the case raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea, development plans can seek to provide a mix of uses in high streets and limit the size of new shop units. If local people are worried about a dwindling number of local shops, and independent retail units have been converted to other uses&mdash; such as estate agents, takeaways, cafes and offices&mdash;without regard for the wider impact, development plans can oppose that trend.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/8">If parts of a town centre need regeneration and investment&mdash;that does not necessarily apply to my hon. Friend's constituency&mdash;development plans can prioritise them. As he said, it is important that local authorities use their development plans to create development opportunities that are suitable for businesses of all sizes, large and small. In introducing the debate, he cited examples of places where local planners are doing exactly that. I am impressed by the way in which some places have used the wider range of tools at their disposal to translate plans into reality. I encourage all local authorities to consider that approach and to use the tools available. I shall outline some of the further tools that we have put in place and the methods that they can employ.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/9">Where it is justified in local circumstances, planning authorities can use planning conditions, when granting planning permission, to control the size of shop units and the goods to be sold in them. They can seek financial contributions under new development proposals, where justified, to help regenerate secondary shopping areas where many smaller shops operate. Where it is necessary and appropriate, they can use conditions to prevent changes of use that would not otherwise need planning permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/10">In some cases, local development orders and directions under article 4 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, which remove permitted development rights for certain designated areas, may be helpful in managing development. Local authorities can also use compulsory purchase orders to help achieve their objectives&mdash;for example, to ensure that key sites within or on the edge of town centres are brought forward for development, in line with their vision and strategic ambition for those centres. They can work with businesses to create business improvement districts to spearhead the regeneration of shopping areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/11">Our policies promote the use of those tools to enable local authorities to manage development more effectively and to maintain and promote a locally distinctive mix of uses. I therefore strongly suggest to my hon. Friend and to hon. Members more widely that local authorities already have a wide range of planning powers available to help them protect and promote diverse and vibrant town centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/12">That said, I accept that, with 60 per cent. of retail development still outside town centres, there is still some way to go. That is why we intend to improve the effectiveness of our town centre planning policy, as we said in last year's White Paper, &quot;Planning for a Sustainable Future&quot;. We will shortly publish for consultation limited revisions to PPS6. Those will maintain a strong &quot;town centres first&quot; approach and introduce a new impact test, which will replace the current need and impact tests and enable local authorities to assess more effectively the impact of out-of-town development proposals on town centres. We will strengthen the way in which policy is designed to promote competition and improve consumer choice and retail diversity. We propose to introduce additional guidance to help local planning authorities apply our policies and make more effective use of the planning tools available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/13">I would like to make it clear that small independent retailers remain at the heart of our vision for town centres. We do not want a greater number of larger stores being developed where they may not be appropriate and where their impacts are significant, at the expense of small businesses and traditional high streets. As my hon. Friend rightly said, successful high streets need to offer something diverse and distinctive, which includes independent stores and multiples. We want a productive retail sector, which gives consumers a real choice in obtaining the goods and services that they need and want. On environmental and health grounds, I personally would like more local produce from independent retailers to be sold in our high streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/14">We will therefore continue to work closely with our stakeholders, including organisations such as the Association of Convenience Stores and the Federation of Small Businesses, to ensure that we strike the right balance in the policy changes that we make. We look forward to hearing everyone's views in response to our forthcoming consultation&mdash;I encourage my hon. Friend to contribute to that&mdash;and to continuing the helpful dialogue that we have had so far with stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/15">We are preparing a new planning policy statement on planning for economic development&mdash;PPS4&mdash;which sets out a policy framework for how planning authorities should positively and proactively plan for sustainable economic development, including retail, that is responsive to the needs of businesses both small and large.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/16">We will publish very shortly our proposals for taking forward the review of sub-national economic development and regeneration. That includes proposals for a stronger local authority role in economic development, including a new statutory duty to assess local economic conditions. That would improve the evidence base to inform the sustainable community strategies, local planning policies and local area agreements. It would also improve the understanding of how economic development can better support regeneration priorities in a given area and the conditions required for businesses, including retail businesses, to flourish.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/17">I cannot respond to a debate on high streets and town centres without referring to the concern about the potential implications of the recommendations arising from the current Competition Commission inquiry into the groceries market. As my hon. Friend will be aware, the commission has provisionally recommended that a &quot;competition test&quot; should be introduced within the planning system when local planning authorities are assessing planning applications for new large grocery stores and supermarkets. It is important to place the commission's suggestions in context. Its provisional decision, made last year, stated that it was not intending to make any further changes to planning affecting grocery retailing, as the Government have already set out revisions, to which I have referred. The commission's proposals are provisional. I stress that we need to see what the commission recommends when it publishes its final report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-08">8 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/18">If the commission recommends that a supermarket competition test should be introduced, that would require significant changes to the planning system in England, and we would need to consider carefully what that would mean for business, local authorities, consumers and communities before we could accept such a recommendation and make further changes to the planning system. I reiterate that we await publication of the report on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-08">8 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/19">My hon. Friend has raised important issues. I hope that I have demonstrated that the Government recognise that small shops make an important contribution to the character, diversity and vitality of our high streets. Planning can play a key role in promoting retail diversity in our high streets and fostering the conditions that enable small shops to thrive. Local planning authorities have a wide range of planning tools available to help them plan proactively for the needs of their high streets, large and small. Robust, locally specific and proactive local planning policies that are based on a clear evidence-based local vision are an essential part of that toolkit. It is critical that local authorities and others use those tools effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.126.0/20">We have put in place a range of planning policies and statutory instruments that help to ensure diverse and vibrant town centres. We are introducing further proposals to help local authorities still further in achieving that aim. I am keen to do what I can to assist my hon. Friend and others to ensure that we have vibrant and thriving town centres and high streets.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.1/1">I fear that the debate that we are about to have will be slightly overshadowed by President Sarkozy's address to the joint Chambers of Parliament. I must apologise to the Minister, because I am sure that she has a marginal preference for listening to President Sarkozy rather than me&mdash;in fact, I think I have a marginal preference for listening to President Sarkozy rather than me&mdash;but the fact is that plastics are fundamental to modern social life. I find myself sounding rather like the character of Dustin Hoffman's future father-in-law in &quot;The Graduate&quot;, who, when discussing his future son-in-law's prospects, looks at him very earnestly and says, &quot;Plastics, my son, that's the future.&quot; I have great empathy with the Dustin Hoffman character, because my father has been very involved, as a chief executive, in the plastics industry and that message has certainly been pointed out to me from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/2">The reality is that plastics are crucial to our lives. They are light, versatile and extremely durable, and they take many and various forms. They are also chemically inert, which is good for medical uses, culinary uses&mdash;we have all used plastic utensils for eating food&mdash;food packaging and other things. The electrical industry and the construction industry make very heavy use of plastics. We could have a full half-hour session just listing the various things, including the microphone in front of me, that involve plastic in one way or another, but I will hurry on.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/3">Chemical inertness is one reason why people take against plastic or dislike it, but it is not the only reason. Fundamentally, people dislike things made of plastic for cosmetic reasons; they do not like the look of them. I have a plastic glass in front of me, but people often prefer to drink out of glass glass, particularly if they are drinking beer&mdash;I have been told that beer tastes completely different out of a proper glass rather than out of a plastic cup. It is mainly the chemical inertness that generates the problem and the animosity to plastic. It is the reason why it lingers around and the reason why, when it is disposed of, it gets in the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/4">In the <i>Daily Mail </i>a few weeks ago, we saw some graphic photos of bits of plastic in strange foreign seas that had started off in British supermarkets. If we sit in the countryside for any length of time and look around, it is not unusual to notice a plastic container that has been left by a picnicker. It will remain there until someone clears it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/5">The city is littered with plastic in one form or another. In landfill sites, there is always an element that does not disappear. It is not bulky, however, and does not take up a massive amount of space. In one sense, therefore, it is not all bad. Something that is not biodegradable, that hangs around and is chemically inert, does not react and does not leak methane and other gases, even if it is left in landfill, is a positive thing in favour of the plastic industry. The plastic industry is not slow to point out that benefit in its products. Plastic does not generate the same amount of greenhouse gas in landfill as other materials.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/6">The industry also points out that plastic is an eminently reusable and recyclable material. It will add to that the entirely fair argument that the carbon footprint for plastic containers is relatively low. For example, plastic packaging reduces the weight of packaging in general. I am told that the amount of plastic used to package any one utensil is being reduced all the time. Although we have all heard arguments about little electrical gadgets such as USB sticks being wrapped up in enormous quantities of plastic, by and large, the weight of plastic used to package goods across the piece is genuinely reducing.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/7">The production of plastic involves a less high-energy process than the creation of other materials that are a substitute for plastic. For example, an intense amount of energy is used to generate glass products as opposed to plastic products. The plastic industry also points out the clear environmental benefits of plastic, particularly plastic packaging. It points to the fact that we waste far less food than we used to. Food is biodegradable and produces gases that are hazardous to the environment. Plastic not only makes the food last, but it protects goods from breakage and ensures that they do not get damaged on their way to sale, which is a good thing in itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/8">The down side of plastic is that it enables people to move food that much further, increases the amount of food miles, and ensures that products that we would not ordinarily eat travel from places such as Africa and South America and get to our shops. While that is a culinary benefit, it is not necessarily an environmental benefit because of the CO2 emissions involved. I do not know how we can assess the overall carbon footprint of plastic, but we have no reason to think that it is any more damaging than some of the alternative products that we might use for the same purposes. That said, we must note that plastic&mdash;the use and disposal of it&mdash;features very heavily in the environmental debate, even if that debate appears to be centred on issues such as global warming. It features very prominently in environmental policies of various parties and Governments. All are keen to do something about plastic bags, whether prompted by the press or by the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/9">There are reasons for that focus on the industry at this particular time. One reason that I can identify with, and which I have observed within my local council area, is the fact that if there is a drive on recycling and if people are encouraged to waste less and reprocess what they can, refuse collections can be altered to enable them to do that and to encourage and incentivise them. One refuse system that is well used by councils is the alternate weekly collection, which often excludes plastic as a recycled material. When looking at their residual waste stream, householders will look at plastic and say, &quot;This forms a very large and substantial part of that.&quot; They will urge their councils to do something about it and include it in the items that are recycled. However, there are obstacles to that, and I will enlarge on them in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/10">The second reason for the particular concentration on this material as an environmental hazard is the fact that plastic waste is more visually intrusive. It is certainly more highly coloured and more easily noticed than most other forms of waste. Therefore, there is a general demand to reduce waste plastic. Clearly, recycling plastic must come after avoiding unnecessary use of plastic and plastic containers in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/11">When I was queuing up to buy a newspaper in WH Smith the other day, I was horrified to see people who were not buying much more than a newspaper&mdash;perhaps a newspaper and a pencil or a packet of cigarettes&mdash;habitually being offered a bag. In times gone by, they would have put their goods in a bag that they had with them, stuffed them in their pocket, or just carried them out. The habitual reminder that they did not have a bag to carry their goods in was there and was slightly disturbing.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/12">I have quizzed the Minister at the Dispatch Box about Sunday newspapers. Such papers bang on a lot about how desirable plastic recycling is, but they are delivered in a non-reusable plastic bag&mdash;the broadsheets in particular. They often omit that fact. The first stage, therefore, is to avoid unnecessary use. The second stage is to encourage reuse, and clearly the supermarkets are doing that. Most hon. Members will have been invited to their local branch of Asda and been asked to pose with various plastic bags that are being put to second, third and fourth use. That is totally desirable and quite the thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/13">Much of the drive and discussion concerning plastic bag taxes and many of the campaigns against unnecessary packaging are designed either to deter unnecessary use or to encourage reuse, both of which must stand ahead of recycling. Those are well worked-up themes and ones that we all applaud and have no problem with. I do not see any particular problem in developing those types of initiatives. We would all be hypocrites or capable of self-deception if we thought that we could easily dispense with plastic. When I am handing out political literature, as I do from time to time, to people who are eager to distribute it on my behalf, I find a reusable plastic bag extraordinarily useful. I do not know how I would manage leaving bundles of &quot;Focuses&quot; on people's doorstep without using a plastic bag. It would be dishonest and hypocritical of me to visualise a day when we could totally manage without them, because managing without them might mean that we have to use substitute materials that create other environmental problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/14">There will therefore always be demand for recycling&mdash;it will not go away. That demand is quite legitimate, whether from the public&mdash;society in general&mdash;or the Government. The debate is about the fact that the demand is hard to satisfy, and I am looking for and expect a positive response from the Minister in that respect. It seems that there is a triad of problems&mdash;collection, processing and a lack of mature markets for the recycling product&mdash;all of which require some sort of attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/15">Of the three, I am most familiar with and informed about the first, namely collection problems. Plastic is light and needs crushing, but there is not much weight in a lorry full of plastic bottles. To collect plastic, one might need several lorries to make several trips, which adds to the cost. We are all familiar with the overflowing plastic bottle banks in supermarket car parks and how difficult it is to educate the public to crush the bottles to make more room in the containers. We have also seen how people indiscriminately, despite notices, put any plastic in the banks, any how, thereby contaminating the waste stream. Many lorry journeys are involved in the removal of plastic from people's doorsteps, and there is much corruption of the waste stream. Clearly, one obstacle, which I am not sure we can easily get over, is to educate the public about different kinds of plastic, how to deal with them and how to put them into the appropriate waste stream.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/16">This shows the level of public ignorance&mdash;and my own. I learned only the other day that every plastic is in fact identified by a particular number within a certain type of triangle. I did not believe it at first, but I found that it was true when I looked at different plastics. Apparently, the European Union, in its wisdom, decided at some point in time that if plastics were to be produced, it would be good to put markers on them so that we would know which is which. I am debating plastic recycling in the House of Commons, and I learned that only the other day&mdash;the public's learning curve will be that much sharper and steeper if recycling in general had a well informed public effort behind it.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/17">Secondly, on the processing problem, often, when we have collected stuff, we need to separate, crush and bale it, which requires equipment. Some local authorities have got the situation well organised. For example, pretty well every district council in the Hampshire area can collect plastics, because the waste disposal authority there is ready to use and process it effectively. The same situation does not prevail in my area. We are dependent on Merseyside waste disposal authority. I have asked several times what it is doing to help the collection authorities better to recycle plastic, but I have not been given a clear answer. However, it has an extensive private finance initiative investment programme ahead. Processing needs critical investment, and there is a substantial difference between Merseyside, which does not get that, and Hampshire, which does.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/18">The third problem is markets for end products. There are many burgeoning and innovative recycling industries growing up at the moment in the UK. I came across one of them in the Wirral the other day, which deals with the CDs and DVDs that newspapers and other organisations send us ad nauseum, for which we have no place. I have no doubt, Mr. Jones, that you put every single one that you receive on and look at it carefully before disposing of it, but many of us do not have the time to do that, and we simply dispose of them. There are huge quantities of such items hanging around in the world, and a firm in the Wirral recycles what I believe are called polycarbons. However, it is not obvious that there is a ready pipeline for such items&mdash;perhaps charity shops could be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/19">I tend to agree with Peter Smith of the British Plastic Federation. He summed up what I am trying to say. He has stated that recycling rates depend on the collection, sorting, recycling infrastructure and the economies of scale of strategic waste management, but we do not have those things in the UK. He added, charitably, that the federation welcomes the recent announcement by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that it will consider joint waste authorities to ensure more joined-up thinking on those aspects of waste management. If that were to happen, it would be applauded.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/20">I am not saying that the situation is negative. There have been appreciable successes, and the Minister would be right to refer to them. Only 2.6 per cent. of polyethylene terephthalate bottles were recycled in 2005, but now 21 per cent. are. Some 22 per cent. of plastics are said to be recycled&mdash;I am not sure whether that is 22 per cent. of all plastics or 22 per cent. of plastics that the public throw out, or whether that involves the break down of commercial and private waste. There has certainly been an increase in the use of plastics whether in fuel or fillings. Sadly, there is much work to be done. We seem to be engaging in the unnecessary process of collecting plastic for recycling and sending it to China, where something is done so that it can be sent back to us as bin liners. That does not strike me as the sound thing to do, if we are seriously concerned about global warming.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/21">I am told that 100 per cent. of Ribena bottles are made of recycled material, that 40,000 tonnes of post-construction polyvinyl chloride have been recycled, and that a great deal is being done, but we need more than a tokenistic approach to plastic bags. As the industry says, the plastic bag tax in Ireland has had mixed results. The actual quantity of imported plastic has increased, bin liners have been substituted for other kinds of plastic bag and non-reusable materials have proved to be heavier to shift around, which has added to the carbon footprint of goods. The chief executive of WRAP has said that a simple levy on plastic bags in Ireland only made matters worse. She said that people underestimate how many plastic bags are used to put out for recycling that are substituted by plastic bin bags, and that we must remember that taxes and levies can have perverse effects, such as making people use more plastic.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.1/22">There is much more to do, but it requires&mdash;I think the Minister will be sympathetic to this plea&mdash;a strategic role for the leadership in DEFRA and not a simple, knee-jerk reaction from the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-26a.135.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1681" speakername="Joan Ruddock" colnum="135"  time="016:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080326/halltext/80326h0011.htm#08032678000568">
	<p pid="a.135.1/1">Indeed. Many discussions have been held on many issues, and my hon. Friend is right to point to that one. It would be much easier to deal with collection and reprocessing if there were fewer types of plastic. Then we could look for more obvious markets and ways to make new products from recyclates. The Government are not in a position&mdash;no Government would be&mdash;to force people to use only a limited number of plastics, but it is highly desirable, and we have had discussions along those lines.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">The hon. Gentleman said rightly that demand is hard to satisfy, but I can tell him that there has been a substantial improvement in local authorities. More than 90 per cent. of UK local authorities now offer some sort of plastics recycling service, and more than 50 per cent. of UK households can now put plastic bottles in their kerbside recycling box. Some 25 per cent. of plastic bottles used in the UK are now recycled, compared with 2001, when the collection rate was only 5 per cent. The UK recovered about 22 per cent. of all plastic packaging in 2006, and the Government are committed to doing more. About 2 million tonnes of plastic packaging are produced every year, and most of it is still not recycled. We need to find ways to do much more.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">The targets for recovery and recycling of plastic packaging have recently been increased, and we expect the plastic target to rise from 24.5 to 26 per cent. this year with further improvement. I am aware of the confusion that consumers can experience when trying to decide whether plastics can be recycled, and we know that we need to make it simpler for them. We want more convergence between local authorities on what materials they will collect for recycling, including plastics, but we recognise that there are still gaps and variations in what is collected at the kerbside.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/4">I have also asked the Advisory Committee on Packaging and WRAP to work with the Local Government Association, the packaging industry and retailers to develop practical proposals to increase collection rates for plastics. The hon. Gentleman referred to the lightweighting of plastics. He is absolutely right that that is one of the successes of the European directive and the transposing regulations, which require producers to minimise packaging. It is important progress, but we would like to see more of it. WRAP is undertaking a number of trials to see what scope there is for further recycling. They are wide-ranging and aim to understand the best ways to handle plastics from the environmental, economic and technological perspectives. The programme is investigating three main areas&mdash;collection, reprocessing, and end markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/5">I shall give a few examples. Last year, as a result of funding from WRAP, the London Development Agency and the private sector, the first UK plant to recycle PET into plastics suitable for food packaging opened. The plant has the capacity to recycle 35,000 tonnes of waste plastic. Another project looking at trays used for chicken led to a 17.5 per cent. reduction in the use of polypropylene in that product. A large-scale trial of HDPE milk bottles with Dairy Crest, Nampak and Marks and Spencer found that it was possible to make bottles with 30 per cent. recycled content that performed to the same standard as bottles made from virgin plastic.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/6">The hon. Gentleman referred to sending recyclates to China. Because the ships bringing manufactures to this country tend to return to China empty, it is not wasteful to send plastic recyclates to China, as they enable China to use recycled material, with great savings over raw materials. WRAP also recently started a project to undertake trials using a number of technologies with the aim of understanding the best ways to handle mixed plastics. Different recycling and recovery options are being considered as part of that work, including reprocessing mixed plastics into new plastics, incineration, chemical treatment and even turning mixed plastics into a form of diesel. WRAP has just completed the first 10 trials and will hold a conference in June to disseminate the results and discuss the way forward. The next steps from those projects are to scale up one or more of the best technologies to a commercial scale and work with local authorities and householders to raise awareness of the best ways to collect waste plastics for effective and high-value treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/7">Whatever progress I describe today, and whatever innovations the hon. Gentleman and I refer to, there is no doubt that we need to do a great deal more. DEFRA has at least the aim to develop a strategy. We now have projects within all the major waste streams, including a plastics project that will consider all aspects of plastic waste and how to advance reuse, recovery, minimisation and recycling of that important material. We need greater public awareness that plastic bottles include cleaning bottles, shampoo and conditioner bottles, trigger sprays and a raft of household goods. We need more kerbside collection, more bring bank provision, more careful bottle design to ensure recyclability and increased recycling and reprocessing capacity in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/8">Consumers can also play their part, and we urge them to do so by refusing products, reducing and reusing, and by acting appropriately according to their local recycling provisions. Much can be done. Not enough has been done, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we, as a Government, and the Department are determined to do much better on plastics in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/10" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
