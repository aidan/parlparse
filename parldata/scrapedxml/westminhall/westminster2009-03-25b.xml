<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-25b.73.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" speakername="Andrew MacKinlay" colnum="73"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090325/halltext/90325h0001.htm#09032539000477">
	<p pid="b.73.2/1">I am pleased to raise this debate about the residents of Ashraf City and the obligations of the United Kingdom, and other members of the so-called coalition, to them in terms of their protected person status under the Geneva convention. I am proud, for the purposes of the debate this morning, to wear the symbol of Ashraf City in solidarity with these people, who are brave patriots of Iran and are looking forward to the day when their country will be rid of a cruel totalitarian regime that not only persecutes their people within Iran, but is acknowledged by United Kingdom Ministers, along with many others, as the arch-exporter of terrorism around the world and, particularly, as destabilising the region of the middle east. That is the backdrop.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/2">I acknowledge the helpful response that I received, as did those of us in the parliamentary campaign that represents the whole political spectrum at Westminster, and which has hon. Members drawn from every party and every persuasion. We acknowledge the endeavours of the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" name="Bill Rammell">the Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell)</phrase> and his predecessor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase> and, because it is relevant to show a reason why we have to raise this debate, the noble Lord Malloch-Brown. My reading of the comments and reactions of those Ministers is that they have some sympathy with and concern about the issues involved and, I suspect, anxiety about the future of the people at Camp Ashraf, which is situated some 80 km north of Baghdad.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/3">I name those Ministers because they show where the United Kingdom Government have not shown great coherence of policy and utterances. I separate those three members of the Government from my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform, who, in their respective roles as Foreign Secretary, Home Secretary and Home Office Minister, have sent mixed, ambiguous messages to the regime in Tehran, both in relation to the people at Camp Ashraf and in respect of the wider campaign and movement of people in exile trying to overcome the cruel regime in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/4">Some of the mixed messages have been given in relation to what the United Kingdom says and does concerning the people of Camp Ashraf. Everyone in the parliamentary campaign Committee recognises that we have to deal with the world as it is, rather than how we would like it to be, so we always understand the need for engagement with the cruel regime in Tehran; but we do not accept the need to appease it. In our view, regarding the people in exile and those in Ashraf City, my right hon. Friends the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and the Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform have not understood that.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/5">Why do we raise the question of the people in Ashraf today? These people have, for two decades, had this camp in Iraq, which is now called Ashraf City. They are Iranians who have stood firm for two decades in defiance, close by the territory governed by the cruel regime in Tehran. Of course, they have been a source of considerable irritation to that totalitarian regime. It is a matter of fact that they were given harbourage there during the time of Saddam Hussein's rule of Iraq, but they have always been at pains to distinguish between the accommodation that they were granted by Iraq and the fact that they did not support the Saddam regime.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/6">Just before the invasion of Iraq, my noble Friend Lord Corbett of Castle Vale gave the United Kingdom Government the co-ordinates of the Ashraf camp in order that it would not be shelled or attacked by coalition forces. Those of us in the parliamentary Committee have to say with some regret that we are bewildered about what happened to that information supplied by Lord Corbett, because the people in Ashraf suffered and endured attacks by the coalition forces. We wonder whether those co-ordinates were transmitted to our UK coalition commanders. That is history, but it is raised as a relevant issue this morning, because in my view it heightens the obligation of the UK Government now to get it right.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/7">All hon. Members welcome the handing back to the people of Iraq the sovereignty of their country. However, the view of the parliamentary Committee is that that change&mdash;particularly handing over the green zones in Baghdad just at the turn of the year&mdash;does not absolve the United States, the United Kingdom or other coalition partners of their humanitarian obligations to the people of Ashraf and their obligations under the Geneva convention, because these people have protected person status.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/8">At the challenge of the UK Government the people of Ashraf demilitarised: their weapons were put beyond use. That was a noble gesture. It is a product of a carrot-and-stick policy, but since 2002 they have demonstrably and unchallengeably been disarmed. I deliberately use the word &quot;unchallengeably&quot; because this matter was tested in the UK courts. We in the parliamentary Committee&mdash;this is in the Register of Members' Interests&mdash;were proud to pursue in the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission in London, which has the status of the High Court, an appeal against the attitude of the Home Secretary in relation to the supporters of the people of Camp Ashraf City: what is known as the PMOI, or the People's Mujahedeen Organisation of Iran. In that court, Lord Justice Ognall accepted that these people had been disarmed since 2002-03, although the British Government tried to infer otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/9">For your information, Mr. Benton, this matter was tested by the highest standards of the United Kingdom courts. At one point, we members of the parliamentary campaign Committee were excluded from the court and special advocates looked at the secret information, but still the court found that there had been demilitarisation and the standing-down of weapons. The case went to appeal with the Lord Chief Justice presiding, who said that the attitude of the British Government was perverse. I am told that this is a pretty high comment, coming from the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.2/10">It is important that the House understand that the judgment of the British Government was found to be flawed. These people in Ashraf, and their supporters, have stood down from what could be described as military activity in a way similar to what Sinn Fein-IRA have done in Ireland.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.1/1">Part of the problem, of course, is getting our minds around the idea of how society in Iran functions. We know that women who are inappropriately dressed in the street will be beaten, and put into cars and driven off. We have seen footage of that on the BBC. When we tried to show the Iranian MPs that they dismissed it and were not interested. Camp Ashraf is a community. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1742" name="Brian Binley">the Member for Northampton, South (Mr. Binley)</phrase> mentioned the Falkland islands. We are talking about a population in excess of that of the islands, and we should recognise that community, which has lived there for some time.</p>

	<p pid="b.82.3/1">There was a token one; I use the word &quot;token&quot; because the IPU encourages delegations to bring women to conferences, because we want more women to be elected and to take positions of responsibility. I am afraid that there was just one, token, woman in the Iranian delegation. Our delegation was led by a woman, and I was very pleased by that difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.3/2">If people going to visit friends and relatives in Ashraf are persecuted in Tehran, as has happened, my great fear is about what the consequences will be if the 3,500 people in question are taken to Iran. There are all sorts of reasons for wanting good relationships with Iran&mdash;for example, Iraq is its neighbour in the region&mdash;and we can understand that. I suspect we can even understand the possibility of secret negotiations involving our Government, the American Government and Iran; all sorts of deals are done behind closed doors. Indeed, Obama has already made a number of public proclamations about wanting a friendlier relationship with Iran. We want that; we would prefer dialogue to a stand-off and Iran's continued progress towards making nuclear weapons. What a fearful prospect it would be if Iran could make and deliver them; we know that it has the capability to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.3/3">I want the Minister to acknowledge that he recognises the current situation and knows that the regime is, to use an understatement, unpleasant, and that if the people of Camp Ashraf are taken from there to Iran the likely consequences will be torture and execution. We cannot allow that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.3/4">I finish as I started, by paying tribute to the many democracy-loving Iranians throughout the world who pray for the day when the regime that currently occupies their country will be removed and a proper full democracy will be implemented there, to everyone's benefit. I pay tribute to them because we, as politicians, sometimes take stands on difficult issues, but in the main we do not fear for our lives from a regime in our own country. When they speak out publicly about wanting change in their country they risk their lives. Many have paid the ultimate price, and those who live abroad who want democratic change still risk their lives and cannot return to the country of their birth or their parents' birth, which they love. Some day, we hope, they will be able to do so, and be greeted by a truly democratic peace-loving Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-25b.88.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" speakername="Bill Rammell" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office"  colnum="88"  time="010:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090325/halltext/90325h0003.htm#09032539000500">
	<p pid="b.88.0/1">I am pleased to respond to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1875" name="Andrew MacKinlay">the Member for Thurrock (Andrew Mackinlay)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing this debate. He and a number of his colleagues have pursued this issue with passion and conviction, and I genuinely congratulate them on doing so. I am aware that several hon. Members and noble Lords have expressed considerable, regular and diligent interest in Camp Ashraf and its residents. On at least two occasions over the past six months I have met delegations of Members to discuss the matter and to listen to their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/2">In considering the situation in Camp Ashraf, we should not forget the considerable progress that Iraq has made as a result of the improving security situation, to which my hon. Friend referred. It has transformed the situation out of all recognition from that which existed even 15 to 18 months ago, and national reconciliation is today a far brighter prospect than it has been for a number of years. I gave media interviews on the day of the recent local elections in Iraq, and I telephoned our ambassador, who described to me the feelings and emotions on the streets of Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere. He spoke of the almost festive atmosphere in the country as Iraqis rightly went about asserting their democratic rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/3">I visited Iraq last year, and it struck me that the country was slowly, but evidently, getting back on its feet. I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate Prime Minister al-Maliki and the people of Iraq on their progress towards achieving a more stable country in which people go about their daily lives in safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/4">The Iraqi-led Operation Charge of the Knights in Basra in March 2008 did a great deal to improve the security situation. In downtown Basra, where people were once terrified to leave their homes for fear of being attacked or caught up in an explosion, the streets are bustling once more, with children on their way to and from school and local Basrawis back at work. That trend is positive and the Iraqi Government firmly believe that all Iraqis deserve to live free from the threat of violence or intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/5">As a result of improvements to security, coalition troops have handed back responsibility for security to the Iraqis. That is an important point that underlies this debate. We have fully supported that process because we have increasing confidence in the ability of the Iraqi security forces to maintain that security, while respecting the rights of the people.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/6">The Government of Iraq have signalled their commitment to developing both the culture and the institutions required to embed within Government, the security agencies and society as a whole a fundamental respect for human rights. This debate has provided an opportunity for hon. Members to express their concerns, and for me to clarify the Government's understanding of the complex legal position of the residents of Camp Ashraf.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/7">Before I address those points directly, let me say that I very much share hon. Members' concerns about the situation facing the ordinary people in Iran. There is a palpable lack of democracy there. On the nuclear issue, there is a complete unwillingness to respond to the legitimate concerns of the international community and to deal with the International Atomic Energy Agency. There is a lack of respect for human rights, whether it be for Christians or Baha'is. Iran is one of the largest users of the death penalty anywhere in the world. Of particular concern is the continued execution of minors under the age of 18 despite a recent Iraqi ruling that such a practice should not take place. I find it staggering that a draft mandatory death penalty for the so-called crime of apostasy is before the Majlis. If anything underlines the degree of concern about human rights in Iran, that is very much it.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/8">Notwithstanding all of that, it is right that we say to the Government of Iran and their people that we want a legitimate relationship, and that we want the regime to engage with the international community. I welcome the recent decision of the US Administration to make that very clear. I hope that we will see a response to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/9">Many hon. Members, including my hon. Friends, have raised a number of questions to which I will try to respond. Before I do so, it may be useful for me to outline, in brief, the history of the camp to date. The People's Mujahedeen Organisation of Iran&mdash;or Mujaheddin-e-Khalq&mdash;was founded in Iran in 1965 with the broad aim of replacing the Shah and the political situation in which he dominated.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/10">In its first years, the MEK's main focus was on organisational and ideological work, but in the early 1970s, it carried out violent attacks against the interests of the Shah, his Government and their western allies. After the February 1979 revolution, the MEK continued to condone violence. In the course of 1980 and 1981, the MEK's relationship with the authorities became increasingly hostile and again violent.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/11">Having fled to Paris in 1981, the exiled MEK moved to Iraq and Camp Ashraf in June 1986. The Iraqi regime under Saddam provided land for bases and helped equip the MEK's armed force in Iraq&mdash;the National Liberation Army. MEK forces fought on the Iraqi side during the Iran-Iraq war. They claimed responsibility for a series of attacks during the 1990s and a spate of attacks in the early part of 2001 against numerous Iranian targets, both in Iran and around the world. Following the invasion of Iraq in 2003, the MEK turned over its arms to US forces in Camp Ashraf.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/12">The legal position was a key issue for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase>. As I understand it, the US Government's position is that members of the MEK in Camp Ashraf are to be treated as protected persons for the purposes of the fourth Geneva convention. The UK position has been that as the fourth Geneva convention ceased to apply in Iraq after <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-28">28 June 2004</phrase>, the designation of &quot;protected persons&quot; under that particular convention could no longer be applicable as <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-28">28 June 2004</phrase> signified the end of the occupation. However, that does not mean that the residents in the camp are entitled to no protection under Iraqi or international law.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/13">Our view is that we stopped being the occupiers under the Geneva convention after <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-28">28 June 2004</phrase>. Our obligations as occupiers continued for one year only after the occupation. I mention that because the hon. Gentleman raised that point directly with me. The year starts after <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-28">28 June 2004</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.2/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to raise this issue, which is of particular importance to many Muslims in my constituency. I extend a warm welcome to my good friend, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1911" name="Claire Ward">the Member for Watford (Claire Ward)</phrase>, who has been asked by the Government to respond to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/2">The Hajj is a pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia. It is the largest annual pilgrimage in the world. Making the pilgrimage&mdash;the Hajj&mdash;is the fifth pillar of Islam, and an obligation rests on all Muslims to carry out that pilgrimage at least once in their lifetime, providing that they are fit enough to do so and can afford to. For Muslims, the Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people. It takes place over a four-day period in late November or December, depending on the Islamic calendar.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/3">Every year, more than 150,000 British Muslim pilgrims travel to Saudi Arabia as part of the 1.7 million Muslims who go there from all over the world. The Hajj pilgrimage is greatly looked forward to in the Muslim world and should be a time of enjoyment and self-fulfilment. However, for some British Muslims, the experience turns into an expensive disaster due to the activities of rogue travel operators, who either fraudulently take money from clients and disappear, or promise a five-star package pilgrimage that turns out to be nothing of the kind. Sadly, many of the people who have been ripped off by rogue travel agencies come from my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/4">For example, in November 2008, one of my constituents handed over a cheque for &pound;4,500 to the owner of Qibla travel. The cheque was cashed and my constituent, who was paying for his mother and father to go on the Hajj, was told that they would fly out on a specific flight. Just before they were due to leave, they were told that the owner of Qibla travel had disappeared with the money and passports, which he said he needed in order to get the visa put in them. No flight existed and no visa applications were made. Although that incident has been the subject of a police investigation&mdash;I am pleased to say that the passports have been returned&mdash;it is not an isolated incident. Another example is that of a company that was paid &pound;10,000 by a family to make arrangements for them to go on the Hajj pilgrimage. Again, the flights and bookings never materialised.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/5">The Foreign Office has set up a special unit to deal with British pilgrims travelling to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj festival, which is greatly appreciated by the Muslim community. It has worked with organisations such as the Association of British Hujjaj (Pilgrims) UK, whose general secretary, Khalid Pervez, operates from offices in my constituency. Advice is offered to would-be pilgrims by the Foreign Office, by the association and by officers from Birmingham city council's trading standards department, who have been particularly helpful in giving advice to pilgrims and in trying to assist victims of rogue travel operators.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/6">The problem, however, is that many people who go on the Hajj pilgrimage feel more comfortable dealing with travel agencies run by members of their own community, whom they believe, as Muslims, will understand more clearly what the pilgrimage is about and what is required. The average cost of a pilgrimage is &pound;2,500 per person, so there is a strong inclination to look for the cheapest deal on offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/7">The Package Travel Regulations 1992 oblige any operator who offers a package tour combined with air travel to have an air traffic organiser's licence&mdash;ATOL. That provides some protection so that passengers whose travel agent goes into liquidation or defaults on its obligations can be refunded or flown home. The Association of British Travel Agents&mdash;ABTA&mdash;is a trade organisation. Although it offers a degree of protection for customers and travel agents that are members of ABTA should they go bust, there is no obligation on travel agents to be a member of that organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/8">Many of the clients who seek to go on the Hajj pilgrimage are not aware of the Package Travel Regulations and do not know the rules and regulations regarding air traffic organiser's licences. They are unaware of the status of ABTA. Furthermore, if the accommodation that is allegedly being booked is separate from a scheduled flight, there is ambiguity as to whether the flight and separate accommodation are covered by ATOL. The loophole allows rogue travel operators not only to default in terms of promised scheduled flights, but also to give inflated promises about the quality of the accommodation that will be provided during the stay in Saudi Arabia. The pilgrims are in a position to complain only once they return to the United Kingdom, but by then, the rogue travel operator has often ceased trading or disappeared.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/9">A feeling exists within the Muslim community that, although the Foreign Office is trying to be helpful in looking after the interests of Hajj pilgrims and liaising with the Saudi Arabian Government to ensure that British Muslims are properly treated while in that county, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has a &quot;soft&quot; approach to the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/10">The Association of British Hujjaj (Pilgrims) UK has made clear its belief that all travel agents should be members of ABTA and should be required to provide a bond to that organisation to be used as compensation for travellers who are given inferior accommodation or arrangements to those promised when the booking was made. It is aware that a large number of small tour operators in Birmingham&mdash;and in other parts of the country, such as Watford&mdash;might have difficulty in meeting the stringent requirements laid down by ABTA. However, it believes that if such stringent regulations result in a number of small tour operators going out of business, it will be a price worth paying to ensure that some of the most blatant abuses that pilgrims have suffered are no longer tolerated. If such abuses do happen, compensation could be paid and the operator can be deregistered by ABTA, which, in effect, would mean that it was forced out of business. Although the voluntary approach of encouraging tour operators and travel agents to become members of ABTA has resulted in more Hajj tour operators registering, there are still many who have not done so. Rogue elements who intend to deceive trusting clients will obviously not seek to register.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/11">Through the consumer affairs Minister, the Government have made it clear that they want to help pilgrims avoid booking with rogue travel agents. They have said that pilgrims should book with</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/12" class="indent">&quot;a member of ABTA or other recognised trade organisation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/13">However, the rip-off continues and for some, a once-in-a-lifetime experience is turned into a huge, expensive disappointment. The DBERR website claims that it leads the better regulation agenda; I contend that this area needs better regulation. The Muslim community in this country would strongly welcome a Government commitment to considering what further regulation and legislation could be enacted to address the problem of unscrupulous travel agents.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/14">Some people might say that individual would-be pilgrims should take responsibility for whom they booked with, and that further regulation would be another step towards a nanny state, but I would remind them that the Government commendably introduced a scheme in response to widespread concern within the Muslim community about rogue immigration advisers who were misleading people about immigration matters and ripping them off. The Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 forced anyone who was taking money for giving immigration advice to be registered with the newly created Immigration Services Commission. Section 91 of the Act made it a criminal offence, punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment, to provide immigration advice or services in contravention of the scheme. The Government then were able to recognise that the growing Muslim population in the UK was vulnerable to being ripped off by rogue immigration advisers, and took welcome steps to address that problem, so why can this Government not recognise the vulnerability of the Muslim community to rogue travel agents, and take steps to strengthen the regulations and laws?</p>
	<p pid="b.93.2/15">The Under-Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1554" name="Ian Pearson">the Member for Dudley, South (Ian Pearson)</phrase>, who should have replied to the debate, has more pressing affairs of state to attend to today. However, this short debate will be enhanced by his absence, because his most intelligent, charming and delightful replacement, my hon. Friend the Member for Watford, knows this issue well, as she, too, has a sizeable Muslim community in her constituency. I therefore hope that she will take this unusual opportunity to liberate herself of the departmental brief that she has been given and to speak from the heart about the problems being caused in her Muslim community by rogue travel agents. I hope that she will agree with&mdash;or perhaps be persuaded or even enticed by&mdash;me and the Association of British Hujjaj (Pilgrims) UK regarding how this problem should be addressed. If she consigned the departmental position to the waste bin, abandoned her brief and bravely spoke out, she would rightly earn the thanks and continued support of the Muslim community in Watford and the rest of the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1419" name="Roger Godsiff">the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath (Mr. Godsiff)</phrase> on securing the debate and on taking this opportunity to raise awareness in the House about problems within this sector. As he has said, I know about the issue from my constituency work. I know that he has raised concerns about the matter in the past and that he fights hard for his constituents&mdash;not only his Muslim constituents, as in this case, but those across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/2">I am grateful to have this opportunity to outline the action that the Government have taken in the two years since they learned of the problems being experienced by Hajj pilgrims. The Government take this matter very seriously, and we have been saddened to learn of the suffering and inconvenience experienced by Hajj pilgrims at the hands of rogue tour operators in the UK. My hon. Friend has mentioned one incident concerning Qibla travel, which is, as he has said, under police investigation&mdash;and rightly so. We hope that there will be a good outcome for most of his constituents who have suffered in that case.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/3">The problem is particularly pernicious given that the Hajj and Umrah are a religious obligation on Muslims, for many of whom those journeys are the trip of a lifetime and cost a considerable amount of money. In the past two years, my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, Development and Consumer Affairs and his officials have been working with colleagues from other Departments and the trading standards service with a view to encouraging better practice in the Hajj travel industry. Importantly, they have also been raising pilgrims' awareness about what they should expect of package organisers, about their rights of redress under the law and about who to complain to if things go wrong. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath is right to express concern that until now the Muslim community has not generally been aware of its rights or about where to go to express concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/4">The Government's view is that problems in the sector are not due to a lack of regulation, as Hajj trip organisers are as liable to regulation as any other package organiser and Hajj pilgrims have exactly the same rights as anyone else going on a package trip. In many cases, people who have used organisers' services have not understood the true extent of their rights. Under package travel regulations, tour operators must ensure that all descriptions on brochures and internet sites are accurate, that the customer is given information about passports, visas and health and security issues, that the customer is informed in good time about significant changes to the trip, such as changes to flight details or itineraries, and that the customer receives a written copy of the terms of the contract for the trip. The operator must also be able to show that it has in place measures for the protection of consumer payments. In these cases, protection would be in the form of an air travel organiser's licence, which ensures that customer pre-payments are protected and that customers can be repatriated if the tour operator suffers financial collapse. Local authority trading standards departments have day-to-day enforcement responsibilities for the regulations, and the ATOL system is run by the Civil Aviation Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/5">Enforcement activity is generally driven by consumer complaints. Previously, it seemed that only a few of the Hajj pilgrims who had suffered at the hands of rogue operators were informing the relevant authorities. I would be interested to hear how many cases were brought to my hon. Friend longer ago and whether people believed that they simply had to put up with what had happened and thought that there was nowhere for them to go. Clearly, many people now know to go their Member of Parliament or to trading standards. It was clear, previously, that the key to improving the situation lay with raising consumers' awareness about their rights and about what to do when things go wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.0/6">For two years in a row, my hon. Friend the Minister for Trade, Development and Consumer Affairs has written to hon. Members asking them to contact their local mosques and Muslim community groups. He has also issued a number of press releases, which have received good coverage in Muslim national and regional press. Trading standards departments have also issued warnings to the public about the risk from rogue tour operators. The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has also produced two well-received information leaflets&mdash;one for pilgrims thinking of booking a Hajj or Umrah trip, and one for Hajj travel organisers. If my hon. Friend the hon. Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath would like access to more such leaflets to provide his constituents with information, officials from the Department will assist with that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-25b.97.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1911" speakername="Claire Ward" colnum="97"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090325/halltext/90325h0004.htm#09032539000508">
	<p pid="b.97.1/1">If a travel agent books a package that includes a scheduled flight, it must be an ATOL member. In that instance, therefore, the consumer&mdash;the constituent perhaps in my hon. Friend's case&mdash;would be covered by the protections offered by ATOL.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2">As my hon. Friend has said, the Hajj period is slightly flexible and tends to be around the end of the year. Officials from DBERR and the Civil Aviation Authority attended several regional events organised by pilgrim groups to talk about pilgrims' rights and protection. The cross-Government group recently met with the two main groups representing UK Hajj pilgrims&mdash;the Association of British Hujjaj and the Council of British Hajis&mdash;to take their views on Government action this year. Both those organisations do valuable work to help pilgrims to enjoy fulfilling and safe trips. The Minister for Trade, Development and Consumer Affairs will shortly be writing to all UK mosques and other Muslim organisations to continue to raise awareness of the law both for pilgrims and the smaller Hajj travel organisers. We will also look at the best ways of raising awareness in the weeks preceding Hajj.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/3">Trading standards departments have also been involved in raising awareness, and Birmingham trading standards has been particularly active in issuing press releases and talking to local pilgrims' groups and operators. There are signs that the overall message is getting through. The numerous complaints received last year by Luton trading standards after the collapse Go4 Hajj seem to indicate that our work to publicise the issue has had some impact on members of the Muslim community.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/4">As well as raising the awareness of pilgrims, the Government have begun to engage with the Hajj travel industry. There are many good operators, but there is clearly an element that is disorganised and unprofessional. This is not an easy business to be in. There are many unpredictable elements to the relatively complicated arrangements for Hajj in Saudi, but that does not explain the fact that, in many cases, pilgrims are simply misled about the nature, quality and facilities of the trip that they have bought&mdash;usually for several thousands of pounds. Last year the Minister for Trade, Development and Consumer Affairs, hosted a summit for Hajj travel organisers. That was held to deliver our message about their responsibilities and to hear their views on how they believe the sector can improve its reputation and achieve greater consumer confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/5">Since that event, the Civil Aviation Authority has reported that it has received an increasing number of applications for air travel organisers' licences from Hajj trip organisers. Many licences have now been granted, which extends the financial protection of pilgrims travelling to Hajj. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath asked whether the travel operators should be members of the Association of British Travel Agents. There is no legal requirement for them to be a member of a trade association, which is essentially what ABTA is. However, they should be members of ABTA, and membership is encouraged by the industry. In essence, the bonding that ABTA provides would not necessarily improve the quality of service or compensate for the poor services that are perhaps provided by some travel operators. However, as I have stated, membership of ATOL would give some financial protection where scheduled flights are part of an overall package.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/6">As I mentioned, Birmingham trading standards has been actively engaged in discussions with local travel operators and, last week, Tower Hamlets trading standards invited local operators to an awareness-raising seminar. There is a greater awareness, and trading standards are taking up the issue and promoting it within communities. This year, we are pressing ahead with engagement with the industry and hope to explore the possibility of achieving a degree of effective self-regulation. We hope that the responsible tour operators can help to banish the poor image and the poor operators from the sector by setting out for pilgrims their commitment to proper behaviour and standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/7">Over the past year, we have also forged links with the Saudi embassy in relation to the issue. The embassy is responsible for issuing entry visas to UK Hajj pilgrims. Visas are only available via certain Saudi approved Hajj tour operators and travel agents. The Saudi embassy has agreed to ensure that the list contains only ATOL registered companies in the future. I hope, again, that my hon. Friend sees that as a significant step forward in providing some protection to his constituents, as well as to my constituents and others throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/8">I hope that I have shown that the Government take the issue seriously. We appreciate that some UK pilgrims continued to be subject to unacceptable behaviour at the Hajj last year and that that is a continued cause for concern. There is no quick answer to that, but we have seen some signs of progress. In initiating the debate, my hon. Friend has yet again put the issue on the agenda and ensured that, where it is relevant, there is an opportunity for trading standards across the country to promote the importance of protection for Hajj pilgrims. He has also ensured that the issue of an improvement in the service and quality of the tour operators has been raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/9">I am sure that all the parties concerned are hopeful that the various initiatives in which we are involved will help us to reach the point where the Hajj becomes a memorable and, as far as possible, trouble-free occasion for all. That is certainly something that my hon. Friend would like for his constituents, and I can assure him that it is something that I would like for mine&mdash;in fact, the Government wish to ensure that that is the case for all those who wish to take part in that important event within the Muslim calendar.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-25b.99.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="99"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090325/halltext/90325h0005.htm#09032539000513">
	<p pid="b.99.6/1">I do agree, and I cite the example of my own college, where &pound;2 million has already been invested by the college with a full application in principle. It is in a terrible situation because it does not know whether to go ahead with what it planned to do, or to restore existing and wholly inadequate buildings.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.6/2">However, the object of the debate is not to lay blame. That is far too easy a task. The object is to analyse where we are now and to hear how the problems will be solved, particularly the latter. I hope that the Minister will use all his time to do the latter. We do not want to hear him read out the achievements of the scheme, thereby taking precious minutes away from explaining what will be done to get us out of this pickle. Therefore, to save him a bit of time, I shall read out some of the achievements of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.6/3">A lot of money&mdash;&pound;2.9 billion&mdash;has been promised. According to the press release from the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills, a work force of approximately 10,000 has been employed on college sites in 2008 and 2009, and one in 20 of the work force are apprentices. Much good and worthy stuff has been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.6/4">I am sad to say that with all the talk about apprentices&mdash;the press release came out on a propitious day&mdash;in the industrial press, when the 10,000 constructions jobs were mentioned, there was an announcement that contractors on the projects were ordered to cut prices or lose jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.6/5">So that is where we are. We are in a desperate situation, and we need to concentrate on solutions. A review is not a solution. The Labour party seems to have a succession of grandees lined up for occasions such as this, rather like cabs at a taxi rank. They are scheduled to appear when things go wrong and to conduct a review, but that would be wholly inappropriate in this case, such is the seriousness of the situation. It would be like an AA man going to someone who had broken down on the motorway and giving them a book on the history of motoring. That is not what is required.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.0/1">It is a pleasure to have a few minutes&mdash;I shall try to make it a few minutes&mdash;to talk about the state of capital funding for further education colleges.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/2">Three colleges serve my constituency: Bishop Burton college in my constituency, East Riding college, which is predominantly in Beverley and Bridlington in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1954" name="Greg Knight">the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase>, and Hull college. Two of those colleges&mdash;East Riding and Hull colleges&mdash;have been affected by this fiasco. We have heard powerful speeches today showing the real effect on marginal communities and the most vulnerable people in those communities from the Government's failure to deliver their promised programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/3">Unfortunately, Hull often finds itself at the bottom of the national league table for educational performance up to GCSE, but Hull college is outstanding, and it was told to be ambitious, to think big and to have 21st century buildings fit for 21st-century learners. The LSC told it to be more ambitious. Was that an aberration? Was the LSC on autopilot? Did the chief executive have a fit of ambition with no link to the Department? It is incredible. The colleges in my area and I hope that the Minister today will put to rest where that ambition programme came from.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/4">Was the LSC responsible? Is that why the chief executive has gone? Or were things driven by the Department? Did it want that message sent out all over the country? Are the Department and the Minister&mdash;whether personally or in his capacity as a Minister&mdash;responsible for what now seem to be the false promises that were made to so many communities around the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/5">Notwithstanding Labour Members' understandable words of congratulation to the Government on their investment in FE over the years and the comparisons with the Tory years, the sad truth in this time of recession is that, for all the billions that have been spent, the number of young people who are NEETs&mdash;not in education, employment or training&mdash;is the same as when Labour came to power. Those 16, 17 and 18-year-olds are effectively washed up and do not see education and employment as offering them anything.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/6">How much more important is it, therefore, to ensure that every penny that is spent on providing hope and opportunity to people in such a parlous situation actually reaches them. It is nothing short of a national scandal that a &pound;10 million loan was made in Barnsley and that &pound;1.6 million was spent in Streatham on consultants' fees that might ultimately go completely to waste. It will not be enough to blame the LSC, which is the largest quango that this Labour Government have ever set up and which they are now seeking to abolish and to replace with not one body, but what, on closer inspection, looks more like three. That is the Government's idea of streamlining. It is not enough to blame that quango&mdash;what we need from the Minister today is an honest statement of the Department's role.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/7">I turn now to East Riding college, which is perhaps more fortunate than some in many ways. This summer, it will have had support in principle for its funding for two years. As a result of the sale of its current site and moneys that it has raised independently, it is seeking funding of just &pound;15 million for a completely new college in the centre of Beverley. That will take the college from the leafy suburbs&mdash;I live at the entrance to the current college, so I know from personal experience that it is narrow, dangerous and unsuitable&mdash;to the centre of Beverley. The new site will be close to the railway station and to where the new park-and-ride will be. It will also be close to the Swinemoor estate, which has many of its own issues and looks to the FE college to provide hope and promise. The project will cost &pound;23 million or &pound;24 million, and the LSC will be expected to fund just &pound;15 million of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/8">The college provides an increasingly good standard of education. At its last Ofsted inspection, it was graded good and it was improving in all areas. It hopes that it will be graded outstanding when it is next reviewed. It will serve isolated rural communities&mdash;the east riding is the largest single unitary authority area in the country&mdash;and cover the area all the way to the coast, marginal communities in many of the coastal towns and villages and the area to the west of Beverley. It offers opportunities to people who have not done so well at school, and it will give people a real chance to get into work and pay taxes. As other hon. Members have said, this will be an excellent investment by the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.0/9">I hope that the Minister will tell us today who is ultimately responsible for the current fiasco and what he will do to ensure that the millions of pounds that should have been spent on front-line education do not go up in smoke. Obviously, I would also be interested to hear about the prospects for East Riding college and its move to the centre of Beverley. That move is the first phase in the regeneration of a large derelict area, which is an eyesore in the centre of Beverley. The project will not only regenerate the town, but provide hope for those with least in the surrounding community.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-03-25b.113.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" speakername="Maria Miller" colnum="113"  time="015:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090325/halltext/90325h0007.htm#09032539000539">
	<p pid="b.113.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">the hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> on securing the debate. My constituency has been hit hard by the funding freeze. In Basingstoke there is an excellent further education college, Basingstoke college of technology, and a sixth-form college called Queen Mary's college. Both need significant investment if we are to make sure that they can deliver what the Government want from Basingstoke, which is that it should be a diamond for growth and provide the economic prosperity and growth in the south-east that we so badly need during the recession.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/2">Ten weeks ago the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/3" class="indent">&quot;An economic slowdown must not be an excuse to slow down the pace of investment and reform to strengthen our country for the future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/4">I am sure that students, parents, staff and employers in Basingstoke want reassurances from the Minister that they will not be let down.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/5">BCOT has a much needed plan to replace its outdated 1960s buildings with a modern facility that is right for the job, to teach and train employees for the future and to achieve the ambitions that the Government have for us. Indeed, it was the South East England Development Agency that highlighted the fact that access to further and higher education in Basingstoke needed to be improved if we were to achieve the high targets that the Government have set for my constituency. The investment that is made must be focused on those areas that will generate the best social and economic returns. I think that Basingstoke has a strong case to make in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/6">Will the Minister confirm today that the information given at the capital summit in Westminster on Monday, which representatives of his Department attended, is correct, and that colleges such as BCOT, which have an application in principle on their projects ready for submission but have not yet submitted it, will also be included in the review and prioritisation process? When will decisions be made on that process, and what criteria will be used? I am sure that everyone will want such detail. How will the available money be rationed to be put behind the projects that need to be completed?</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/7">BCOT has already spent &pound;1 million on fees to get to the stage it is at. It has been working closely with the LSC in the firm knowledge that building further education capacity in Basingstoke was the Government's strategic priority. It is vital that we should hear today what support will be provided, particularly given the rising number of NEETs in my constituency. In the words of the principal of BCOT, Judith Armstrong, the project is not a &quot;nice to do&quot;, but is a necessary project that must be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/8">Queen Mary's college is part way through a significant redevelopment of its site and is just entering the next phase. I understand from a letter from the LSC that that is now under review. Again, that is deeply unsettling and a matter of deep concern for everyone involved. The Minister needs to suggest today when we are likely to get a resolution of that. A short delay in the implementation of those plans for BCOT and QMC would be manageable, but a failure to proceed at all would be, in the words of the leader of the council,</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/9" class="indent">&quot;damaging to the area's economic prospects&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.113.1/10">not to mention the prospects of its young people. The situation is a matter of great concern for my constituents and I hope that the Minister can assure us that there will be a speedy resolution, that he will tell us what criteria will be used to assess which projects can go ahead, and that he will make it clear who, if costs are involved in the delay, will cover those costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.122.0/1">I wrote to Members this week setting out the situation, but I shall write again to those hon. Members whose constituencies we believe to be affected, making it clear that, as has always been the case, anybody who wants to discuss their own situation will be welcome. The problems with the programme are well known. Many right hon. and hon. Members spoke with passion and feeling about the difficulties in their constituencies, and I have repeatedly said that I understand their frustrations as local representatives. I also understand the frustrations and fears of college principals and governors. I was in Leicester this morning talking to hundreds of college governors and clerks; understandably, there feelings were strong.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.0/2">I was specifically asked not to do so, but, before entering into further details, I shall, in five short sentences, put a few fundamental points on the record. It is important that all right hon. and hon. Members, especially Opposition Members, understand that, in 1997, this budget was nil. Since then, 700 renovation schemes have been carried out in 330 colleges, and only 42 colleges in the country have yet to receive any investment.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.1/1">I deliberately have not entered into the food-mile debate, because it is not possible to do so in the time available, but there is another debate to be had about food miles, and I support the idea that, wherever possible, people should buy food that is grown locally. It is complete madness that we import New Zealand lamb, for example, when we can get such meat much closer to home.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/2">On the solutions, I am sure that the Minister will be relieved to hear that I am not suggesting that we must go vegetarian or vegan to save the planet. However, Gidon Eshel and Pamela Martin, researchers from the university of Chicago, said that becoming a vegetarian does more to fight climate change than switching from a gas-guzzler to a hybrid car. The head of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change also said:</p>
