	<p pid="a.197.4/1">I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. The all-party community media group will be campaigning on those issues, and I am sure that the Minister, who has ears to hear, will act in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.4/2">As my hon. Friend has pointed out, community media are particularly effective in engaging and serving some of the most disadvantaged groups in our society. It provides a voice for many people who are disengaged and excluded from traditional media.</p>
	<p pid="a.197.4/3">Community media projects are a key economic growth area in the creative industries sector. Since the enabling legislation contained in the Community Radio Order 2004, 122 community radio stations have been licensed and many more are in the pipeline. Even though similar enabling legislation for community television has not yet been introduced, there are 17 local community television stations around the UK, and there are many more groups with aspirations to become truly local community radio and television providers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-24a.204.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" speakername="John Barrett" colnum="204"  time="009:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070424/halltext/70424h0002.htm#07042430000511">
	<p pid="a.204.0/1">Community broadcasting is often seen as a poor relation in the world of television and radio, but it is one area of communications of which we should all be more aware and which we should encourage to grow. I <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1566" name="Ian Stewart">therefore congratulate the hon. Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart)</phrase> on triggering this debate, which raises an important subject, and on giving us an excellent introduction. I hope that the debate will help to keep the issue on the agenda and will let those who are listening and watching, or who will read the report of our proceedings, know that their parliamentarians are aware of this important dimension of the media, which is thriving in many communities up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/2">I should like to go into some detail about what is happening in one such community&mdash;South Queensferry&mdash;in my constituency. Before I do, however, I should like to put on the record the background to the issue, which resulted in my own awareness of the importance of community involvement in radio and television production.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/3">Some years ago I was fortunate enough to attend Telford college in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the constituency of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase>&mdash;although at that time it was in my constituency&mdash;to study radio and video production. After that I spent two summers at Cornell university in New York state, developing that work. The lessons that I learned then have stuck with me to this day, in two different ways. First, I saw how even in the developing world, where access to conventional media was very restricted, people could change their lives and tackle the problems of the community in a way that would provide hope to many who had given up, whether that was through dealing with social problems or alcoholism, educating people to improve their health, or tackling political injustices. Secondly, I experienced at first hand how, with access to community broadcasting and the skills that facilitate good production values, important messages could be spread to the wider community and to those with the power to make decisions affecting the lives of those involved. Real change could result.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/4">I was involved through such work with the homeless, and a shelter that was set for closure because of lack of funding. When the people in the shelter were asked what they would do if they were given the tools to enable them to communicate with the authorities and others who knew nothing of the homeless, they agreed that they wanted to tell those in power how important the shelter was to the many young people who would otherwise end up on the street, where they would be at risk of violence or worse, where girls would be more likely to move into prostitution, and where there was the attraction of dealing in drugs to make money. Their story was told and the shelter stayed open, and that was possibly the best example I have ever seen of involvement in community radio and television.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/5">Nearer to my home in my constituency, much is going on in Queensferry. South Queensferry in Edinburgh, West is home to two local community broadcast services: Jubilee FM Radio and Jubilee FM Television. Jubilee FM Radio was established in 2001 and currently has a bid with Ofcom to operate a full-time service in North Queensferry and South Queensferry and in nearby towns and villages. Jubilee FM Radio was launched initially to promote and celebrate the Ferry Fair festival, the oldest continuing civic gala in the UK. The station was an instant hit and has grown in popularity over the years. It has become a fixed part of the community and has a strong brand for entertainment and information. When it is not broadcasting, the station delivers live commentary and entertainment at a range of events in the town. It is now in its sixth year and has developed a partnership with the community high school in South Queensferry. It is a unique development and was the idea of one of the sixth-year students, Scott Findlater. He had been one of the volunteer presenters on Jubilee FM the previous summer and suggested that it would be great to have radio at school. A week later the head teacher, Robert Birch, and the station manager, Charles Fletcher, met and began the process of bringing the community radio station into the high school.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/6">If Jubilee FM Radio is awarded a full community licence by Ofcom&mdash;something I fully support&mdash;it will, I believe, become the first radio station in the UK to broadcast full-time on FM from a school. To put it another way, Queensferry high school will become the first school in Britain to have its own FM radio station broadcasting to its local community. The school has been awarded school of ambition status, and hosting the community radio station is a key element of that programme. Having the station at the school offers students the opportunity to learn first-hand how to make programmes. They will have workshops in presenting, producing, recording, editing and technical skills, and they will have the opportunity to go on air and present and produce their own programmes, once they have been trained. Jubilee FM and Queensferry high school are making a major investment in the students' media skills and education, and the community radio station gets direct access to a sea of talented youngsters, who have already shown that they are willing and ready to learn how to make radio. Having the community radio station at the high school will also offer opportunities to senior students to use radio production as part of their subject work. Instead of writing an essay in English, they could submit a documentary; or they could record a series of interviews with people in the community to create an oral history programme and submit that as part of their course work.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/7">Queensferry high school is also the home to Jubilee FM TV, which was established in December last year. Students who worked on the radio in the summer were given training in television production skills: how to use a camera and then edit pictures. That project has created a series of news, documentary and entertainment programmes posted online at the Jubilee FM TV website. In January, on new year's day, Jubilee FM TV did a live worldwide broadcast of the annual Loony Dook, when people&mdash;including Margaret Smith, the Member of the Scottish Parliament for Edinburgh West&mdash;waded into the River Forth to raise large sums of money for charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/8">Jubilee FM TV&mdash;community television for Queensferry&mdash;offers groups and bodies in the community an opportunity to upload videos of their activities for the rest of the community to access freely. Like community radio, community television needs money to operate, and there frankly is not enough money set aside by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, or Government generally, to help fund local broadcasting. Local broadcasting is a vital link in the community&mdash;arguably more now than before, as local and regional radio and television stations are merging into large unitary bodies. There is less requirement on the ITV companies to provide local news and programmes, and some local radio stations have cut their commitment to and output of locally generated news and information. That means that people are more and more reliant on community broadcasting for their local news and information. Services such as Jubilee FM in Queensferry have a key role to play in the community and should be able to rely on more support from Government than they currently get.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/9">A number of possible funding sources must be considered, including looking again at the dispersal of the television licence fee. At the moment, all the income generated from the licence fee goes to the BBC, but is not community broadcasting a public service? I believe that it performs a vital public service. It is not only the BBC that engages in public service broadcasting. Community radio in particular needs serious financial support to help it survive, let alone develop. The BBC is experimenting with a series of localised services. Might it not be better, instead of extending the BBC's reach into more localised services, to consider channelling the money needed to deliver those services into community radio stations? It is also worthwhile to seek to divert some funding out of the Ofcom digital dividend into the community broadcasters; but I would not rule out top-slicing some of the licence fee as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/10">Ofcom manages the community radio fund&mdash;an opportunity for stations that have community radio licences to apply for some financial support to help to pay for positions on the station such as the station manager, a fundraiser or a technician. The DCMS has confirmed that the total community radio fund for the year 2006-07 will be &pound;830,000. The average station grant in 2005-06 was about &pound;23,000 and the average grant in the last round was about &pound;15,000. Community radio stations are generally staffed by volunteers, with a handful of paid positions. They try to generate an income from advertising, programme sponsorship and grants from local government and the lottery. It is a hand-to-mouth existence for many of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/11">Additionally, broadcasting legislation has put a fundraising restriction on community radio stations by insisting that they can only generate 50 per cent. of their income from advertising and sponsorship. The other 50 per cent. must come from grants and donations. That is a restrictive practice which means that community stations could be turning advertisers away, because they have reached their 50 per cent. sales income threshold. I understand that the ruling is intended to help protect some of the heritage stations from other services that might eat into their advertising market, but perhaps the 50 per cent. barrier is unrealistic and should be adjusted to help those stations generate more sales income.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/12">One new community licence holder, in the Shetland Islands, has written to Ofcom to seek a change in its status to a full service commercial licence because it is confident that it can raise 100 per cent. funding through sales of programmes and advertising spots; it is equally convinced that it cannot raise 50 per cent. of its income through grants and the lottery. If it is successful in its bid for a change in status, it could set a precedent that other community stations would be ready to follow. Services such as Jubilee FM Radio and TV in Queensferry open a unique window on a community. They help to give access to debate and exchange of views on local and national issues that are not found anywhere else in the media world.</p>
	<p pid="a.204.0/13">Community stations also serve a further purpose&mdash;training the broadcasters of the future. Stations such as Jubilee FM train all their volunteers in production, presentation and diction. People who have had the break there are turning up on the doorstep of radio and television stations ready trained. No one knows their community better than the people who live and work in it; and it is usually such people who deliver community broadcasting. It is our duty in this House to help ensure that the sector is properly funded and economically stable, so that communities throughout the country can follow and build on the excellent pioneering work currently going on in Queensferry.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-24a.208.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="208"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070424/halltext/70424h0002.htm#07042430000512">
	<p pid="a.208.0/1">I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate, and I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1566" name="Ian Stewart">my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles (Ian Stewart)</phrase> for securing the debate and therefore allowing us to spend some time on an issue that resonates through many communities and constituencies in different parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/2">In my constituency and, I am sure, those of many hon. Members, there is a growing interest in local community media of all sorts. Community radio has been mentioned and I shall discuss community television in some detail, but there are also community websites and a whole range of community newspapers, news sheets and outlets of all types. They reflect the explosion of local community life up and down the country and, perhaps, show that at a time when big media corporations dominate much of the media, people want to see other coverage and news, and want the opportunity to debate local issues in a forum that they feel is part of their lives and community and over which they have some say and influence.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/3">In my constituency, we have a local community radio station, Leith FM, which was recently awarded a full-time community radio licence. It has operated for several years on an occasional basis and has played an important role in the local community. Like the community radio station that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> discussed, Leith FM was initially concentrated very much around a festival&mdash;the successful Leith festival&mdash;and the community radio station developed out of that. There are now plans to involve a wide range of organisations in the community with the station, which is expected to start regular broadcasts shortly. It will provide a range of programmes to cater for all sections of the community, and I am sure that it will proceed from its current, strong foundation to a wider audience within the communities of Leith and north Edinburgh, where its programmes should also be received.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/4">The hon. Gentleman has told us that the experiences at Leith FM might be replicated in his constituency, and my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles described very well how they have been replicated up and down the country. As he said, such experiences should be encouraged and made a reality for communities throughout <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">the country. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> made clear in his interventions, community media should reflect the diversity of communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/5">Although that welcome flourishing of life in our communities happens spontaneously in many ways, it also needs to be encouraged. It needs the right regulatory framework to allow further development, as it is an important aspect of community life. Some key decisions to be taken in the very near future will either do a lot to encourage the development of community media, or, if the wrong decisions are taken, will undermine the flourishing of community media and set back its development in this country. I therefore take this opportunity to encourage the Minister and the Government to take the right decisions and encourage community media in the way that hon. Members have suggested in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Eccles and the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West spoke mainly about community radio, which I shall say something about later if there is time. I want to talk about community TV, which still has not really taken off in this country. Yes, we have a few community TV outlets of various types in different parts of the country, but compared with many other European countries the UK cannot be said to have anything like a vibrant local TV structure. However, there is no reason why that should not change. Indeed, if it were to change, that would reflect the wishes of communities up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/7">There is some evidence about the likely demand for community and local TV if it were more widely available, and that evidence clearly indicates that the public want it. Some 18 years ago, in 1989, an independent survey carried out in Edinburgh found that 93 per cent. of respondents were interested in watching a locally made programme about one of their interests; 92 per cent. of respondents were interested in watching local news on a local television channel; 80 per cent of respondents were interested in watching local current affairs on a local television channel; and respondents were similarly interested in local arts and cultural activities, local festivals and local sport.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/8">Some 15 years later, a similar study carried out in south Wales for Merthyr TV suggested that there was a similar level of interest in local programming that offered news and local documentaries, local music and local sports projects and the like. Research has been carried out not only by groups with an interest in local and community TV; Ofcom has also produced research that came to similar conclusions. I understand that research was conducted for Ofcom last May which asked respondents to rate the importance of a series of statements when assessing the importance for UK society of new digital services. Respondents agreed, most frequently, that local news and information should be available on TV&mdash;I emphasise &quot;on TV&quot;&mdash;at home; local news and information about their local area should be available from at least one media source; and that programmes about community, local people and events should be available on TV at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/9">So, when the public are asked about what they want to see on TV, they consistently tell us that they want local and community TV to be offered as part of a range of TV services. However, the reality is that in most parts of the UK, broadcasting regulation has resulted in local TV being excluded primarily for the benefit of existing TV suppliers, particularly big media corporations in both the private and public sectors. That needs to change, and we have the opportunity to change it with the digital dividend and the ending of spectrum scarcity. We can make that range of community TV services available to the public. It is therefore important that the Government take the right decisions to allow that range of services to be offered to the public and to local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/10">As I am sure hon. Members present will know, because of their interest in the subject, Ofcom has undertaken a study into how local TV could be provided as an outcome of the digital dividend. Decisions will be taken very soon about how the local TV element can be provided as part of that review. There is an ongoing debate about how far that greater facility for local and community TV should be provided through the digital terrestrial spectrum, and how far it should be left to the satellite channels or provided through broadband. I argue strongly that if we are to take full advantage of this opportunity and if we are to meet the public interest in local and community TV, it is essential that the digital terrestrial spectrum provides genuine community TV as one of its elements. By genuine community TV, I mean community TV in which the community has direct involvement and ownership. Certainly, the simple auctioning off of local TV channels in the way that my hon. Friend the Member for Eccles suggested might be the outcome, would not provide the boost for community and local TV that the public want.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/11">The opportunity exists for the Government to make the right decisions, as section 244 of the Communications Act 2003 allows the Secretary of State to make provision for genuine local and community TV. I urge the Minister to take advantage of that section, either today or when the decisions are made, and ensure that a genuine community TV network is established throughout the UK. I want him to ensure that local TV can be a public service broadcaster, as set out in statute. Either that section should be implemented or, if required, amendments should be made to the primary legislation. Making community TV possible requires a level of funding that enables it to offer the kind of services that meet the needs of the community. Ofcom has discussed the fact that funding could be provided through a public service publisher facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/12">To sum up, I hope that the digital dividend review will mean that a digital TV channel is available for a local community TV station in each area and that such local TV channels are required to be genuinely community-based. They should carry local news and community information, and provide a forum for local arts, culture and sporting events.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/13">I want to spend a little time discussing two other issues relating to community media, the first of which is the development of community radio. My hon. Friend the Member for Eccles rightly set out how it is sometimes difficult for local community radio stations to get themselves established. The funding that is available is welcome, but there is a need for a longer term perspective. Using examples from Shetland, the hon. Member for Edinburgh, West pointed out that there should be more flexibility, and I would endorse that view. My experience of, and contact with, local community radio demonstrates the need for more flexibility in how set-up support is made available to community radio stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/14">The example of the funding from the Welsh Assembly Government, which I have mentioned, should be followed both at UK level and in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Again, my hon. Friend has rightly pointed out that there are a number of opportunities for Government and public sector agencies to use community media outlets in a cost-effective way to provide information about important issues in the community. Such outlets can deliver that information well. Community radio and TV are means not just of establishing local media but of strengthening local communities. In so doing, they help us to tackle some of the divisions in society and to get the best out of a rich fabric of community life that exists in most parts of our country. We are now at a crossroads, because some of the decisions that will be taken could determine the future of community media for many decades, and it is important that we get them right.</p>
	<p pid="a.208.0/15">I want briefly to comment on a specific issue relating to the subject matter of this debate which has been raised on a number of occasions in the House. There is concern about how the allocation of spectrum could have serious effects on the programme making and special events sector. Some hon. Members present have spoken of the concern elsewhere that the auctioning of the spectrum could have a serious effect on thousands of small businesses and community events that make use of radio microphones. Hon. Members raised the matter in an Adjournment debate in the House a couple of weeks ago.</p>

	<p pid="a.224.3/1">As far as I am aware, efforts are being made to recruit replacements. One of the problems with recruiting replacements for a number of post offices is the uncertainty about the Government's plans, not only about funding, but about the provision of other Government services. That makes it harder than it should be to recruit replacements in such communities where post offices are necessary. If the funding and the services are not there to enable the post offices to move forward, it seems that we might be going back to where we started, with the rural post offices allowed to wither away, but with 2,500 less post offices than we started with.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.1/1">I believe that I said twice that the BBC made a sensible commercial decision. It was made under conditions of doubt and uncertainty, and a vicious circle of downward decline in the post office network caused by the brutal withdrawal of the benefits transactions income. I would like a virtuous circle. I would like many more services to go through the network. I entirely agree with the comments of earlier speakers about other Government services that could be put through post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/2">Let me give a classic example. A furious constituent from Market Drayton rang me the other day. He had been clocked for not paying the congestion charge. He knew nothing about it, as he had not been to London in a car for years, and he was very upset. That small example shows that if information on services such as the congestion charge was available across the post office network, which it could be, such charges could be paid. Other services offered by post offices seem to be positively Soviet and stone age&mdash;for example, pensioners can only withdraw their winter fuel payments in one lump sum and cannot have an account at the post office accumulating interest, which seems to be similar to 1917 Soviet economic thinking. There are many areas where the Government, with imagination, could develop more economic activity, particularly in relation to banking. Why do HSBC, Halifax, Bank of Scotland and the Royal Bank of Scotland Group not offer any access to their current accounts at post offices? What is happening to make the Link service universally accessible in post offices? Those basic banking facilities could be part of the network and would bring in income.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.1/3">I consider the network to provide opportunity. A couple of months ago, I went to a brilliant new post office in Maesbury where the post office takes up 0.46 per cent. of the space of a brand new post office, which is probably about a third of the desk that you are sitting at, Mr. Chope. However, it generates 25 per cent. of the turnover. It is a brilliant place that has a shop, an off-licence, a bed and breakfast, canoeing and drying-out facilities. However, it also has internet facilities and a place to show a film and is exactly the sort of go-ahead, positive post office that we should be encouraging. In contrast, when the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry last made a statement in the House about this issue he looked miserable and as if the last place that he wanted to be was in the Commons answering questions from ghastly Members of Parliament like myself. Instead of being hounded about the post office, he wanted to get back to Edinburgh. Much as I like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Minister, the hon. Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>, I think that he would also prefer to be somewhere else this morning. There is no enthusiasm on the part of the Government at all about what they could do to make the post office network more positive.</p>

	<p pid="a.232.2/1">I will be brief because I am aware that other hon. Members wish to speak. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1995" name="Danny Alexander">my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey (Danny Alexander)</phrase> on this debate. I promise the <i>Hansard</i> reporters that there will not be too many place names that will be a struggle to spell, as there have been quite a few already.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/2">I draw hon. Members' attention to the concerns of sub-postmasters in Cornwall and other isolated rural areas about the potential impact of further post office closures. My perspective is taken from the work that I have done on the Sustainable Communities Bill, which is a private Member's Bill currently going through Parliament and has been introduced by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>. I will also use the perspective that I have from being on the Liberal Democrats' Treasury team. I will discuss the impact that post offices could potentially have on local economies and on widening financial inclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/3">I emphasise the almost unquantifiable social value of post offices in many rural communities. I am reminded of the time when I went to Tehidy post office, which is one of my local post offices. There was no particular reason for my visit; I was simply running an errand. The person in front of me in the post office was a gentleman who was probably in his late 70s or early 80s and had not left his house for a year. On being well enough to leave his house for the first time, the highlight of his day was going to the post office and catching up with the local sub-postmaster and the many friends that he knew he would meet there. The importance of such social interaction cannot be underestimated&mdash;particularly in Cornwall, where demographics show that we have an older isolated population. People live in villages where there is often no access to rural transport and they cannot physically get to where other services may be provided. Often such people cannot drive a car themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.2/4">As my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey has mentioned, the post office network should be used as a key tool for widening financial inclusion. The Post Office card account is an important area where that could be expanded. Like my hon. Friend, I was incredibly disappointed to see the Treasury's latest report on financial inclusion, which describes the Post Office card account as a barrier to financial inclusion. That was concerning because it should be recognised that many people who cannot access a post office will be even less likely to be able to access a bank. For such people, the Post Office card account should be regarded as a first step.</p>

	<p pid="a.238.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Convenience is very important to post offices. The ability to use public transport and to get to post offices was one issue on which my constituents responded.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/2">We also want the post office to be a one-stop shop where people can buy their TV licence, renew their car tax and pay council tax and other bills. The Government should be allowing post offices the opportunity to engage and invest in other businesses as they become apparent, but the Government have clearly been taking every building block away from post offices. We have heard about benefits and pensions, about the difficulties of getting a Post Office card account and then of using it, and about TV licences and car licences. The postmaster in Ystradgynlais, where there is just a post office and no other business involved in it, tells me that the number of car licences that he issues has decreased by 30 per cent. Particularly in rural areas, the presence of a post office is essential for the continuation and survival of the village shop, the village garage and all the other facilities that are so important in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/3">On the business of 95 per cent. of rural people being within three miles of a post office, we are worried that a canny cartographer in the DTI will be able, with his compass and other instruments, to draw little lines of three miles and to work this out on a very artificial basis to meet the target that the DTI has set. Is that three miles as the crow flies or does it refer to the length of road that one needs to use to get to a post office? As my hon. Friend the Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey said, if there is a mountain or loch in-between, someone may have to travel round that physical feature to get to the post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/4">That said, good things have happened. My colleague, Kirsty Williams, the Assembly Member for my area, recently went to Llanbister, where a cash machine has opened in the post office, so there are ways in which both the Government and the Post Office can work to get good facilities for people living in what are often disadvantaged and low-income areas. Often they do not have a car or access to public transport to get them to a post office.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/5">I say to the Minister that I hope that closures will not be driven by the postmasters and postmistresses who are looking towards retirement. If there are to be closures, it is essential that they take place on the basis of the network and the need to serve the people, rather than of the individual needs of postmasters and postmistresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/6">The timing of the announcement of the result of the consultation is quite interesting. I understand that it is being deferred. When I asked the Secretary of State whether the results of the consultation would be announced before May, he said that the closing date was <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase> and added:</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/7" class="indent">&quot;I imagine that March comes before May, even in Liberal Democrat-land.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, </i><phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase>; Vol. 455, c. 1042.]</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/8">When I shared that response with my constituents, they were concerned about the flippant approach that the Secretary of State had taken to my inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.238.3/9">It is especially important that we keep our post offices open in rural areas, where the local economies do not have the robust characteristics of urban areas, and where there is variety in type and character of economic investment. In rural areas, stability and continuity are essential. However, the Government's approach to the future of post offices does not in any way deliver that for us.</p>

In particular, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">my hon. Friends the Members for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> and for North Shropshire (Mr. Paterson), who have been energetic campaigners on this issue, on highlighting what could be done to bring new business to the Post Office. We are looking not for the gradual managed decline of this much-loved institution, but for policies that will bring it new business.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1581" name="Julia Goldsworthy">The hon. Member for Falmouth and Camborne (Julia Goldsworthy)</phrase> was absolutely right to say that the debate is being carried out against a background of great uncertainty, which, in itself, undermines the future of the network. As we have heard, we expected a response to the consultation document in December, but even on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February</phrase>, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/6" class="indent">&quot;It is very much as I outlined in my statement. The consultation ends on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase>. We are assessing the submissions as they come in so that we do not have to wade through hundreds of submissions on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase>. As I said, the Secretary of State hopes to make an announcement by the end of March so that we can confirm, amend or adjust the access criteria and the points that he made in his statement on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Third Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>; c. 13.]</p>
	<p pid="a.239.0/7">Something therefore happened in the last week of that consultation process to blow the time scale out of the water, and we believe, with good reason, that it could be that the Government have in mind more closures than they have announced so far.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-24a.243.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="243"  time="012:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070424/halltext/70424h0008.htm#07042430000567">
	<p pid="a.243.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I should be happy to give way towards the end of my speech, when I have answered points that have been made so far in debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/2">The Government announced proposals to the House on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase> with the aim of putting the post office network on a stable footing and to ensure that there is a national network across the country, because we know how important post offices are. Our proposals were the subject of a 12-week national consultation, which closed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase>, and we received more than 2,500 responses. We are grateful to those who took time to participate in the process. We are giving full consideration to the comments received and hope to be able to announce our final decisions in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/3">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey suggested that we have delayed a final announcement&mdash;I think that he used a phrase about a possible whiff of politics in the timing&mdash;until after the devolved Administration and local elections in early May, as a way of withholding bad news. That is utter nonsense and it appears to me that we would have been damned if we announced our response&mdash;for being too premature&mdash;and damned if we did not. I should have thought that hon. Members would agree that it is essential to take sufficient time to give full consideration to the issues raised by those who responded.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/4">That very point was made by the hon. Gentleman's colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" name="Michael Moore">the hon. Member for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk (Mr. Moore)</phrase>, who, expecting an announcement in March, said in a press release on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-13">13 February</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/5" class="indent">&quot;How, then, are the Government intending to give full consideration to the many thousands of responses that they will receive to their consultation in just three weeks and one day? This smacks of utter complacency. The Government must listen to all the points&mdash;this must not be a fait accompli.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/6">In addition, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" name="Robert Smith">the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/7" class="indent">&quot;The closing date for the consultation is in March and the Minister is going to respond in March. When we met him, I understood that he expected to respond in May. How do the Government expect to do due justice to all the concerns expressed in the consultation so soon after its closure? Will it be a genuine response that reflects those concerns?&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Third Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>; c. 11.]</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/8">It was always our intention to make an announcement as soon as it was possible. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1913" name="Charles Hendry">The hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> asked what changed in the last two weeks. What changed, very simply, was the volume of responses that we were getting. During the consultation I had been informally sharing with colleagues what was almost a running commentary about the number of responses that we were getting, and in various debates I had tried to provide reassurance that we were assessing the responses that were arriving, so that on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-08">8 March</phrase> we should not have a mountain to climb. Unfortunately&mdash;it is the way of consultations&mdash;the vast majority of people, because of cycles of meetings, the consideration that they were giving to the matter, or the timing of their own business, delayed and made their responses in the last two weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/9">We had hoped to make an announcement in March and we wanted to make an announcement then, although it would not have killed the uncertainty: it would have been our announcement of the access criteria and comments made on them, but would not have listed the offices that needed to be restructured. That will be done by Post Office Ltd six or eight weeks after we make the announcement, whenever that happens, in March or May. It will have to get to grips with changes that we make, such as amendments or alterations, in the light of responses received, to the Secretary of State's statement of <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>. I assure hon. Members&mdash;and I am sure that they will accept&mdash;that there is no duplicity. What has happened is a straightforward case of volume. We agree entirely that sufficient time is required for the proper consideration of responses. Our aim is to be in a position to announce final decisions in May.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/10">To respond to comments by the hon. Member for Wealden, since 1999 the Government have committed some &pound;2 billion to support the network. We now propose to make a further investment of up to &pound;1.7 billion to support the national post office network. Last year we announced financial support to the tune of &pound;1.7 billion to Royal Mail Group, in the form of a mixture of access to reserves and extra access to borrowing, to ensure that the business overall had the support that it needed to enable it to restructure, modernise and buy the necessary technology and equipment to put it on as sound as possible a footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/11">The hon. Member for Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey asked about the franchise arrangements with WH Smith. Franchisees are bound by stringent contractual requirements to ensure that service standards remain at the same high level. After a transfer from the direct management of Post Office Ltd, staff at franchise offices receive the same training as employees of Post Office Ltd. All the evidence from mystery shopper visits and feedback groups suggests high customer satisfaction. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1969" name="Russell Brown">My hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr. Brown)</phrase> was among hon. Members who asked about the length of the contracts with WH Smith. The contract guarantees that a branch will operate for a minimum period of seven years. In the extremely unlikely event that WH Smith did not want to renew the contract when the initial period expired, Post Office Ltd would act to ensure that the main post office services were retained.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">The hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> and others made some points about extending the opportunities for Post Office Ltd to function. We are very committed to that, as we have explained in detail in many debates in the past six months. I shall not go into the details now, but I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are doing all that we can to ensure that Post Office Ltd will be in a position to operate efficiently and effectively, and to expand its services. The vast majority of sub-post offices are individual small businesses. They have the licence to expand services, although there are one or two restrictions, such as using PayPoint to serve contracts that they already have with other suppliers; that is obviously a bit of a contradiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> asked about the consultation. More than 2,500 hard copies of the consultation document were issued by the Department, including to Postwatch and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. The consultation document was also available electronically through the Department of Trade and Industry and Directgov websites, and was downloaded 3,700 times; so more than 6,000 took the opportunity. As to remarks about sub-postmasters not knowing that the consultation was going on, I do not for a second challenge them, but with the national publicity and the campaigns being run by virtually every regional newspaper in the country, and some nationals, one or two of which actually mentioned me, I find it hard to accept that sub-postmasters do not know what is happening to their services&mdash;especially when the national federation is so centrally involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/14">Several hon. Members raised the question of thresholds for the access criteria. The proposed criteria were designed to balance the Government's desire to preserve a national network with the need to put Post Office Ltd on a more sustainable footing. They were developed in a way that would offer as much protection as possible to vulnerable communities most in need of Post Office services. Clearly, we accept that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach and that there are geographical obstacles to be overcome. When we deal with the consultation with Post Office Ltd we shall be able to address some of the points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/15">I shall respond in writing to points raised by other hon. Members. Much has been made, rightly, of the valuable social role played by post offices. Not only do we accept that, but we are putting our money where our mouth is, by supporting them to the tune of &pound;1.7 billion between now and 2011. In May we shall be presenting our response to the thousands of submissions that we have had following our announcement on <phrase class="date" code="">14 December</phrase>. However, it makes no sense to suggest that we should remove the choice of how services can be accessed, and force people to use post offices. Last year, for example, more than 5 million people renewed their car tax disc online. That was 4 million more than the previous year.</p>
	<p pid="a.243.1/16">We have set out proposals to create a sustainable framework for the good of the network in the future, so that the Post Office can move forward with confidence and rise to the challenges of the 21st century.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.6/1">I shall seek clarification from the Minister on that, and I shall come to that point shortly. DEFRA accepts that those changes will add to bills, but I do not think that its figures are very reliable. Rather than helping to reduce bills, the plans regarding private sewers will increase them. DEFRA estimates that the increase will be anything from &pound;3 to &pound;11, but the industry believes that it will be much higher. My experience from dealing with large numbers of constituents who face problems with this issue tells me that costs are likely to be extremely high.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.6/2">I do not believe that the figures take into account the fact that those sewers are likely to be extremely dilapidated and will therefore require very high levels of capital infrastructure costs, and not just maintenance costs. Typically, in our part of the world, many of the estates were not officially adopted when they were built precisely because their sewerage systems were not of an adequate quality and were often made of pitch fibre. They are currently collapsing and often need replacing. Whilst that is a huge issue for the residents of those estates, simply deciding to bung the problem on to South West Water bills without an adequate calculation of the likely increase in bills could leave us saddled with a repetition of the mistakes that the Conservatives made in the late 1980s.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.6/3">In my last debate on this, in 2005, I got the distinct feeling that the Minister who responded saw bills as a south-west problem and a south-west responsibility, but the entire country benefits from our coastline. In 2003, Cornwall alone received 5 million UK tourist visitors and there were 25 million tourist nights. Those figures do not include the 2 million overseas visitors. Our part of the coastline is part of the bedrock of Britain's tourist industry and is a national asset, but just 3 per cent. of the national population is bearing the cost of cleaning up to a third of the national beaches.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.6/4">At the heart of the debate, more than the question of who should pay for what and who benefits from what, is the fact that the people who are paying for all this are the poorest in the UK. It is a mistake of the Minister's Conservative predecessors, but surely a concern of the Labour party, that people on such low incomes, in such high levels of poverty, are paying such big bills without any help from the benefit system in the way in which it would help them out with housing or council tax costs.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-04-24a.253.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="253"  time="012:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070424/halltext/70424h0010.htm#07042430000587">
	<p pid="a.253.1/1">The hon. Gentleman left me very short of time, and I want to respond to some of the specific points that he raised, so I shall press on.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/2">Another reason why the Government are sceptical about the idea of the customers of one water company subsidising those of another is that such a subsidy would be very difficult to target. The overall effect would be that low-income customers in other water company areas would subsidise all customers, including owners of second homes in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/3">I would like to speak positively about what can be done about water bills. The true water affordability problem is for those who are least able to pay. That is particularly serious in areas with high water charges and low incomes, and it is worst of all in the south-west. That is the problem that we must look at, and it would not be addressed by blanket subsidies to all customers, including the well-off in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/4">The Government acknowledge that there is an issue with water affordability, particularly for those with the lowest incomes. We have already taken action, through legislation, when there might be a risk to household health. We have legislated to stop household water disconnection because of inability to pay. We have also set up protection for vulnerable groups on meters who might otherwise cut back on water that they could not afford.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/5">In 2004, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows, a cross-Government steering group reviewed the way low-income households are helped with their water and sewerage charges. A wide range of stakeholders were involved in discussions with the steering group, and the Government published their report on the review in 2005. Since then, the Government have been working with Ofwat, water companies and the Consumer Council for Water to take forward the recommendations in that report. They include measures, which I am sure hon. Members are aware of, to look into alternative tariff and charging options, and a pilot study in the south-west. I would like to talk briefly about the progress of that work.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/6">The first strand is to look at the scope for redistributing the burden among customers of a company through tariffs and charges. The Government reviewed methods of water charging and tariffs in 1997-98, which resulted in the Water Industry Act 1999, including protection against disconnection and the free meter option. We are currently working with water companies to develop a model to look at the distribution effect of tariffs, particularly the winners and losers that would be created among households. The model is looking at the effects of a wide range of measured and unmeasured tariffs. One tariff that the group is looking at is the rising block tariff, offering a free or cheap basic amount of water to a household, with higher charges above that.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/7">We have set up a working level group to look at the results of that work, and to advise on how lower income groups might be affected by any change to the current charging system. The members include representatives from the Treasury, Ofwat, the Consumer Council for Water and water companies. The group is considering how tariffs might distribute the total burden of a company's charges in ways that might address affordability and promote water saving. We hope that that work will provide some real ways forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/8">There has been discussion about whether second home owners pay a fair share of costs. The Government recognise that there are issues about the balance between fixed costs of the network and costs that vary according to how much water is used. Ofwat regulate that balance when it approves company charge schemes. I certainly agree that second homes should pay a fair share, and we are willing to look at any proposals to improve fairness on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/9">The other strand of work from the report is the south-west affordability assistance pilot study. That involves the Government, South West Water and other stakeholders, and it is being run in the south-west to assess the combined impact of benefits checks, water efficiency measures and metering. The Government have been working on that pilot study with South West Water, the Consumer Council for Water and Ofwat since 2005. The pilot study is targeting and assessing the effectiveness of water affordability assistance to lower income households in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.1/10">The pilot study is assessing the combined effect of benefits checks, water efficiency measures and metering on low-income households. The pilot&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> The hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell&mdash;</p>
