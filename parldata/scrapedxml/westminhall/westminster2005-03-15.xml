	<p pid=".1.5/1">I would like to go back beyond 2000, as I sketch out how we arrived at the present situation under the Ports Act 1991, the governing legislation in respect of trust ports.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/2">The answer to the hon. Gentleman's question is that the ruling of the Office for National Statistics was initially resisted by the Department for Transport; there was some negotiation as to whether the ruling was correct, but it has been accepted. It took a little time, but the harbour revision orders of 2004 were the outcome of those negotiations; the aim was to resolve the situation and provide some certainty. The uncertainty over the future of ports has certainly resulted in some difficulties. Most recently, the delay of a &pound;6.6 million investment caused problems for the port of Poole, but I gather through conversations this morning that that difficulty might be resolved for now.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/3">It is worth saying what a trust port is. It is a convenient shorthand term used to describe ports that are not owned and run by a company, a local authority or a nationalised industry. Many have operated for a long time. Poole's trust port was formed in 1895&mdash;this is pertinent to our debate&mdash;when port users rebelled against the neglect and profiteering of the private owners of the port; care of the port was entrusted to commissioners who were charged under an Act of Parliament to conserve, regulate and improve the port and harbour of Poole.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/4">That status quo continued happily until the 1980s, when the then Conservative Government were pursuing their dogmatic desire to privatise. In 1988, the Secretary of State of the day, Paul Channon, expressed his disappointment that ports had not yet been privatised and declared all ports as candidates for privatisation. His frustration that ports did not want to privatise led to the Ports Act, which gave him the power to force privatisation on ports and allowed the Exchequer to take 50 per cent. of the proceeds. That love&mdash;that dogmatic desire&mdash;for privatisation is alive and well in the Opposition today.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/5">Happily, the general election in 1997 ended that particular episode, but the decision of the Office for National Statistics in 2000 decreed that trust ports should be classified as public sector corporations, reopening the debate. The way in which such ports are classified means that London, Dover, Shoreham, Tyne, Harwich, Milford Haven and Poole all have their borrowings set against the public sector borrowing requirement, which, in turn, restricts their freedom. They all want to return to the status quo that they enjoyed before the debate on this issue began.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/6">Others would like the ports to be privatised, but the chairmen and chief executives, including those at Dover, oppose privatisation. Unfortunately, the power to impose it on them still remains, although the harbour revision orders sought to remove it. This is only a guess, and it will be interesting to hear the comments of the hon. Member for Christchurch, but the Conservative party appears to be pursuing this issue to plug the &pound;35 billion hole in its public finance plans. I put it to Conservative Members that if they cannot persuade authorities to privatise, they should not impose privatisation.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/7">I would be grateful if the hon. Gentleman would make it clear whether he agrees with or opposes privatisation. I say that particularly in respect of Poole, because I represent 75 per cent. of the harbour area. If he wants to state his intent clearly, it would be helpful if he withdrew his formal objection to the Poole harbour revision order. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-03">3 November 2004</phrase>, he wrote to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, saying:</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/8" class="indent">&quot;The effect of the Harbour Revision Order would be to deprive the taxpayer of resources and will undermine the will of Parliament clearly expressed in the Ports Act 1991.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/9">I do not deny that the will of Parliament, as expressed in 1991, was clearly in favour of privatisation; happily, the composition of Parliament has changed since then, and the will of this Parliament would be somewhat different. However, the key phrase in the letter is</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/10" class="indent">&quot;to deprive the taxpayer of resources&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/11">The letter, which is specifically about the proposed Poole harbour revision No. 2 order, is the clearest indication that we have of the official Opposition's desire to privatise Poole harbour.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/12">That would be a disaster for Poole. The harbour area extends across 10,000 acres of an exceptional environment. I am pleased to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1266" name="Robert Syms">the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms)</phrase> in his place, and I am sure that he would vouch for the fact that it is one of the south coast's jewels. Poole is one of the world's largest natural harbours, and its extensive waters provide what the website calls</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/13" class="indent">&quot;a magnificent haven for recreational sailing and water sports&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/14">It is home to all manner of leisure craft and to a fishing fleet of about 100 vessels. Walkers, bird-watchers, sailors and fishermen all enjoy the wonders of Poole harbour, an area that I am privileged to represent so much of.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/15">For more than 100 years, the Poole harbour commissioners have been entrusted with conserving, regulating and improving that environment. They bring together stakeholders such as Poole borough council, Purbeck district council and Dorset county council. In addition to those statutory bodies, English Nature, the Southern Sea Fisheries Committee, the Environment Agency, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the harbour yacht clubs all have a strong and close working relationship with the commissioners.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/16">This morning, I met the chairman of the Poole harbour commissioners, Captain Malcolm Shakesby, who also happens to be a Conservative county councillor. I asked him whether he opposed privatisation, and he was very clear that he does not allow party labels to get in the way of his good judgment. His judgment is that privatisation would be bad for Poole because stakeholders would not have the same voice or the surpluses currently generated by the commercial port, which takes up just 60 acres of the 10,000 acres of the harbour area. Those surpluses are reinvested in looking after the interests of all the stakeholders who sit round the table when the commissioners meet. In Poole. People's real fear of privatisation is that the surpluses will go to shareholders and that we will return to the days when a few rich traders and the corporation of Poole owned the port in the 19th century and before, and there was profiteering and neglect of the harbour. It is in order to preserve the harbour and its environment and to protect the interests of all its users that I strongly oppose its privatisation.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/17">The commissioners' objective is</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/18" class="indent">&quot;to maintain the balance in the harbour between commercial, recreational and environmental interests, at the same time maintaining a sustainable and commercially viable medium-sized trust port.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/19">That is a commendable objective for the commissioners to pursue. Realistically, a private company cannot balance those interests in the same way.</p>
	<p pid=".1.5/20">Several Members want to speak, and although I secured the debate, I want to hear voices from all over the country who are concerned about the issue. As I said, I am strongly opposed to imposing privatisation on trust ports. It is good to see Members from all parties in the Chamber, and I invite them to make a clear statement of their intent. Are they for or against the port's privatisation? For the sake of my constituents who are concerned about the port and the harbour of Poole, I ask the hon. Member for Christchurch to be very clear about whether he is in favour of, or against, its privatisation.</p>

	<p pid=".4.2/1">The issue is whether I support the trust status of the port, and I do. If, in 20 years, the commissioners believed that a different relationship or organisation was necessary, one would have to consider that. At the moment, however, and for the foreseeable future&mdash;and, I suspect, for the next 110 years&mdash;Poole will remain a trust port because it works well. We are the second largest port in the south-west, and are very successful.</p>
	<p pid=".4.2/2">As the hon. Member for South Dorset pointed out, there is a good balance between the commercial activities of the port, which is profitable, although it is always a struggle to keep ferry companies interested in coming in&mdash;a vital component of the port's success&mdash;and its recreational and environmental activities. Indeed, the port's profitability is used to manage the harbour, to ensure that it is properly dredged and that the sites of special scientific interest are protected. Poole is well known for its leisure activities, such as sailing and yachting. They depend on the success of the port.</p>

	<p pid=".5.1/1">That is a different issue. As the hon. Member for South Dorset said, the Office for National Statistics has changed the way in which these ports are considered. The Government have some form in the way in which they finance some of their public corporations. Network Rail is a perfect example. It has about &pound;10 billion of debt, which the Government have kept off the public balance sheet. With <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/795" name="Christopher Chope">my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase>, I think that it is legitimate to consider how we determine and count the amount of money that is used by various public corporations. That is a legitimate area for some political argument and no doubt that will be resolved in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/2">Returning to trust ports, Poole is certainly a successful port. The Government have not done us any great favours over the years. The road network into Poole is not particularly good. In the roads programme under the Conservative Government, there were proposals to build a bridge over Holes bay to the A350 and to build a link road to the A31, which were cancelled. Fortunately, through the hard work of the harbour commissioners and the borough, we managed to persuade the Government to put a scheme back into the local transport plan, with the support of our neighbours in Bournemouth and Dorset county council. It has been a little delayed because the Government were pushing for a private finance initiative, which was not appropriate. However, the prospects for Poole are pretty good and getting the second bridge in place should help the port.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/3">If I were to make a plea, the greatest difference to be made to the port of Poole would be by focusing on improving the road network so that people could easily get out of the port. When I run into friends and individuals who have used the ferry port, it is noticeable that quite a lot of them have got lost coming out of Poole. I therefore think that, if we are to maintain Poole as a successful port, when we are in Government we will have to consider very seriously how to improve transport links.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/4">As I have said, Poole is a successful port. There is a legitimate area of disagreement over the harbour revision orders and the question of money and finance. I know that that will irritate some local people in Poole, who are getting caught up in a political argument, but I hope that that can be resolved. On trust ports, we have to consider each example and decide whether they are fit for purpose. In the previous Parliament, the Government made reforms to corporate governance. Poole has always done extremely well in terms of how it has run its affairs. It has been open and transparent. I know that some trust ports were run in rather bizarre and undemocratic ways and that there were necessary reforms. However, we must all examine the trust ports in our constituencies to assess appropriateness and fitness for purpose in terms of what is being provided.</p>
	<p pid=".5.1/5">I am happy with how Poole is run. I understand that we are a few months from a general election, and it is easy to make various allegations across the Chamber. I am sure that my party is as capable of doing that as your party&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".7.2/1">Indeed. None of that surprises me, and it helps me to make my next point. In 1995, the then Conservative Secretary of State for Transport planned to privatise three ports: Ipswich, which was privatised, Dover and Tyne. Dover and Tyne were saved only because of the 1997 general election and, as my hon. Friend has clearly indicated, that not only puts his port in the picture, but the port of Tyne as well. That is a cause of deep concern to port users and stakeholders.</p>
	<p pid=".7.2/2">In Transport questions last week, the hon. Member for Christchurch described privatised ports as &quot;thriving&quot;. That is interesting, because it is exactly the same word that has been used again and again to describe the port of Tyne. It is thriving because profits increased by 49 per cent. last year. Turnover is &pound;27 million and rising. That allows investment on an unprecedented scale&mdash;&pound;72 million in the last decade and &pound;10 million in the past year. The Port of Tyne authority now employs 430 people directly, of whom 80 have been employed in the past 12 months. It plans to employ more people.</p>
	<p pid=".7.2/3">One NorthEast, the regional development agency, has assessed that as many as 10,000 jobs depend on activity in the area covered by the Port of Tyne authority. The port deals with 3 million tonnes of cargo. The number of cruise ships entering the Tyne is doubling year on year. The number of passengers, most of whom are going to northern Europe and Scandinavia, has grown to almost 1 million.</p>
	<p pid=".7.2/4">One of the most significant developments of the port is as a car terminal. The port allows the export of about 400,000 Nissan vehicles from the nearby factory in Washington and the import of 60,000 Volkswagen into the country. That makes the port of Tyne the ninth largest car terminal in the world. Having made that happen is a great commendation of the Port of Tyne authority. As a throwaway point, it is interesting that a port that made its name on the export of coal is&mdash;sad to say&mdash;importing coal. That is a sign of the times. It means that income is generated that allows investment in new and upgraded deep-river berths and in the transport infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid=".7.2/5">So, the port is a success story. That is a credit to the way in which the port is managed. It is a credit also to the work force and a credit to the decision not to go down the route of privatisation that the Government made when they came into office in 1997. I therefore ask my hon. Friend the Minister for two assurances. The first is that the uncertainty that resulted from the ONS reclassification will not be used as an excuse to introduce privatisation by the back door and that the Government's position on privatisation has not changed. The second is that, if the objections remain in place and we go to a potentially lengthy public inquiry, the Government and, in particular, the Treasury will make it absolutely clear that none of the investment plans will be held back during the period of uncertainty.</p>

	<p pid=".10.0/1">At the outset I should declare some interests. As well as being a former merchant navy officer, I spent the last 12 years of my sea-going career sailing in and out of the grand port of Dover under the white cliffs. It is the busiest ferry port in the world, and certainly the busiest premier port in the UK. It is an area for which I have great affection and to which I have a great connection, having lived in it for more than 25 years.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/2">I know a little bit about Dover harbour board, including its successes and some of its weaknesses. I know about the people who use the port to run the ships, sail on the ferries, cross as passengers or run the port. The port is our largest employer bar none, and the port-related industries stretch far and wide. We rehearsed all those arguments during the long and exhaustive channel tunnel debates that took place in this very Room when it was the Grand Committee Room.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/3">Let us come back to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1027" name="Jim Knight">the present. My hon. Friend the Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase> accurately set the scene in respect of harbour revision orders. The matter is not being discussed in the back room of the Dog and Duck, people have not been knocking on our surgery doors about it, and it takes quite some time to explain it. My hon. Friend's explanation was succinct.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/4">My summary is that the harbour revision orders are seen as a method that has been agreed between the Government and the trust ports sector of avoiding the negative impacts of reclassification on trust ports and of minimising the damage that reclassification would have on their present good governance, which emerged mainly from work done by the Labour Government between 1997 and 2001 and the publication, &quot;Modernising Trust Ports&mdash;a Guide to Good Governance&quot;. To put the matter into context, one of the main conclusions of the review was that trust port status was a highly effective system of port management that successfully combined commercial and statutory objectives, and that trust status offered an accountable and open system of port management whose financial and strategic independence should be protected. We are here today to protect that good governance and not to look for solutions to a problem that clearly does not exist.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/5">The report went on to state that reclassification would result in the need for financial reporting to the Department, that it would bring trust ports into the scope of Government public borrowing limits, that it would require scrutiny and approval of port borrowing requirements and that it would possibly even require the return of an annual dividend to the Government. It would be interesting to explore that possibility, especially as the would-be Conservative Government would cut &pound;35 billion out of the general public spending budget and take &pound;2 billion or &pound;3 billion out of transport, which is what we are discussing today.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/6">Frankly, no one would have been particularly surprised&mdash;I would not have been&mdash;if the harbour revision orders had gone through without any objection, debate or rebellion in the streets. The only reason that that did not happen was because politics raised its ugly head. The objections about the port in my constituency&mdash;I believe that this is common to all the other trust ports&mdash;came from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/795" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> and also, in my neck of the woods, from the Conservative leader of Dover district council and the Conservative regeneration spokesman at Kent county council, although those two people have allowed wiser counsel to prevail and have withdrawn their objections to the orders.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/7">The objections were lodged so close to a possible general election that I thought and suggested to colleagues that they offered an ideal campaigning opportunity for the Labour party to link them with the spectre of an incoming Conservative Government&mdash;moreover, a Government who would privatise and sell off all the trust ports to the highest bidder. I recoiled from that, because I questioned whether my wise and worldly constituents would swallow such a mouthful. They saw what happened in 1995, 1996 and 1997, when the Tories tried to sell the port of Dover.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/8">While I was still pondering whether we could make that link and take on board that great campaign, events intervened and the Conservative shadow Secretary of State&mdash;God bless him&mdash;came to my constituency and announced to us all that the port of Dover would be privatised and that all the money would be ploughed back into the local community. The Conservatives would build new railways, roads and huge car parks in the middle of Kent, and all the transport problems would dissolve because of changes at the port. He also said that a dividend would be paid to the port to give it some capital growth. How they would do all that is another question, but perhaps one for another debate.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/9">We do not have to consult the crystal ball, however, to discover whether the Conservatives would put money back into the local community after selling a public asset. All we have to do is read the record. Their very first privatisation was of Sealink. I declare another interest: I was a chief engineer with Sealink when it was sold, as though from beneath our feet, almost a pilot scheme. Sealink was a Dover-based company, although we had vessels all around the coast. Not a penny piece of the proceeds from that privatisation came down to Dover or to any of the ferry ports. Sealink was sold for a song to an American gentleman who cut conditions and crews, and sacked half the work force. That is the nature of privatisations under the Tories, including any future privatisations.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/10">That was the first privatisation, so let us consider the last privatisation, of British Rail&mdash;at least I think that it was the last. We have rehearsed time and time again what a huge botch-up that was. Indeed, we are still struggling and paying taxpayers' money to correct the difficulties and injustices caused by that privatisation. In east Kent, where I live, Connex has been taken back into Network Rail, which is a publicly-owned company, to redress the balance and get things, shall we say, back on the rails again. Again, what did we see in that privatisation? We saw loss of jobs and futures for many people. That is the reality of privatisation.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/778" name="Alan Campbell">My hon. Friends the Members for Tynemouth (Mr. Campbell)</phrase> and for South Dorset talked about the 1997 election intervening on the Conservatives' plans to sell trust ports. However, it was not only the 1997 election that intervened, but the good people of Dover and the trade unions. I should like to remind people of the marvellous campaign that was fought then. I anticipate that a similar campaign will be fought this time, although we shall have to concentrate it all into the next eight or nine weeks, or between now and whenever the general election comes.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/12">At that time, we enjoyed the support of the Dover Harbour Board. The chairman and the directors of the board said what they say now: that privatisation of the port of Dover would not be in the interest of the port&mdash;or, they added then, the community. The Dover Harbour Board has always worked well in parallel with the local community, although the two, of course, argue&mdash;it is almost second nature for people to complain about the council, the Government or, in this case, the harbour board. However, in the background the community knows that Dover Harbour Board is the biggest employer in Dover bar none and wants it to stay that way. Although the new management has launched efficiency drives, it is trusted to manage the port not only commercially, but fairly and equitably.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/13">In 1995, we enjoyed the support of the local community, with petitions in the street. I cannot remember how many thousands of people queued to oppose the privatisation&mdash;after all, they had not been consulted one iota. The change was being imposed on them and delivered from on high, which was just not the way to do things. Our objections enjoyed the support of Dover district council, Kent county council and the town council. Notably, we had the support of the mayor, Councillor Jimmy Hood, my good friend and comrade, who was also then the Speaker of the Cinque Ports. The Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports was the late Queen Mother, and even she thought it appropriate to write to us with words of encouragement in our struggle against privatisation. That is how high the campaign went.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/14">Not to put people in any order or category, Dame Vera Lynn turned out for us in Parliament square, to sing &quot;There'll be white cliffs over&quot;&mdash;no, sorry, to sing &quot;(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs Of Dover&quot;. I hope that <i>Hansard</i> gets that quotation right.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/15">The issue is not something that will be discussed between, perhaps, an incoming Conservative Government, a few transport officials and the port of Dover; rather, it is a massive community concern, which people feel strongly about. People are resistant to change, but it is not just that; as well as feeling that, at the very least, it is better the devil they know, at another level they know that the port of Dover has worked alongside the community since the 1600s, and they do not want that situation upset.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/16">Who would buy the port of Dover? Who showed an interest back in 1995? First, the ferry companies, which had initially resisted the sale, started to ask what it would cost and what they would get out of it&mdash;what would be the advantages? As soon as the private ferry companies showed an interest, the port of Dover smelled a rat. Did it want one private operator to run the busiest ferry port in the world, one that Calais totally relied upon? Of course it did not. Therefore, the port of Calais became the main interested party. In the port of Dover, there is already a French company, SITA, collecting the refuse and sweeping the streets. It is one thing for the French&mdash;some of my best friends come from the other side of the channel&mdash;to sweep the streets of Dover; it is another for them to own and run the busiest ferry port in the world. That is why local people were so concerned, and why the campaign reached such great heights. That is what happened in 1995, and it could well happen again.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/17">In our local newspapers, people are recalling those dark days, remembering the great campaign that was fought and taking a stand against any movement towards privatisation.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/18">Lastly, I look back again at 1995, and at the vested interests. Given their experience of mergers, reconstructions and privatisations, the trade unions in Dover, not unexpectedly, lined up in opposition, along with the local Labour party and my local campaign. They included what is now the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, the GMB, the Public and Commercial Services Union and every union that had any connection with the disparate activities that go on in a busy port such as Dover. I have not sounded them all out, but in the past 24 hours I have spoken to all the trade unions at local and regional level, and they are looking forward to the campaign. At last we have what amounts to a recruitment sergeant for the Labour party in Dover. It will be interesting to hear what the hon. Member for Christchurch has to say. If the speeches that we have heard so far in this small gathering are anything to go by, the word isolation enters one's consciousness.</p>

	<p pid=".15.1/1">I shall keep my comments fairly brief. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1027" name="Jim Knight">the hon. Member for South Dorset (Jim Knight)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has today represented the best interest of his constituents&mdash;as he always does&mdash;in bringing this matter forward. He has highlighted concerns that many of us have about the future of the trust ports&mdash;and certainly about their future should the Conservative party ever return to power, not, thankfully, that that is very likely at the moment.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1173" name="Gwyn Prosser">The hon. Member for Dover (Mr. Prosser)</phrase> referred to the Cinq ports. We all, of course, remember from our school history that those were at one time important for the future of England. However, the Cinq ports are still important to Britain. They are important to our imports and it is important to ensure that they are well managed and properly run.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/3">I mention those ports because I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/795" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> sees himself, given all the objections that he raised, as the hon. Member for the Cinq ports. The only trouble is that he does not spell the term as we would; he spells it &quot;sink&quot;, because, clearly, his policies would entail the sinking of the trust ports, which are important to the future of shipping in this country.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/4">I have the honour to represent a port, the port of Teignmouth&mdash;not Tynemouth, although the two are often confused and mispronounced. We will not go into the pronunciation of Devon terms. The port has just had two harbour revision orders. One was made at the request of the Government. It was necessary to re-establish the management of the harbour commission to make it more accountable to the local public.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/5">The Government moves have been much appreciated, because south Devon now has a consultative body for Teignmouth, on which all the other people who have an interest are represented, so that they can put their views to the harbour commissioners. That is a way forward and shows the trust ports that it is not necessary to go down the privatisation route to get the best out of something. It can be done by involving local people.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/6">That does not mean that everyone in Teignmouth, Shaldon and the surrounding villages is 100 per cent. ecstatic with everything that the harbour commission wants to do. I wish that it were so. Having listened to other hon. Members I am glad that everyone is so happy with their harbour commissioners and what they do. That is not necessarily so in Teignmouth.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/7">At least the advantage of harbour commissioners is that they are local people with an interest in the local area, not shareholders in London, or, as was alluded to earlier, a foreign company. We can disagree with them and what they say and do. I am the honorary president of the Teignmouth fisherman and waterman association and there are times when that body has arguments with the harbour commissioners.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/8">Even amid those arguments&mdash;and I speak to those on both sides&mdash;there is an understanding that all involved are seeking the best for the town. I seriously question the future of ports if they are to be privatised. I do not see the need to seek private ownership for Dover or other trust ports. The debate is important in providing an opportunity to set that out clearly in the run-up to a general election.</p>
	<p pid=".15.1/9">I hope, given what has been said, that what would happen under Labour representation would be similar to what would happen under Liberal Democrat representation, although in the past the Labour party has sought to privatise some sectors, wrongly, in my party's view. I hope that the Minister will, in the 15 minutes that he will have for his response, state clearly that the future of the ports is safe and that the Labour party will not allow, but will resist and campaign against, the privatisation proposed by the Conservative party.</p>

	<p pid=".16.4/1">I will not give way at the moment, but I think that I have answered that point to begin with.</p>
	<p pid=".16.4/2"><i>Lloyd's List</i>, which is a highly respected journal dealing with ports and shipping said in an editorial on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-09">9 March</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".16.4/3" class="indent">&quot;Dover, it will be recalled, was one of the few large ports left unprivatised by the last Conservative government, which has been able to point to the undoubted success of many of the trust ports it moved into the private sector during the years before 1997.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".16.4/4">The words &quot;undoubted success&quot; are used. That is what we are interested in: developing successful ports in the UK, and that includes the port of Dover.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15.17.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/795" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="17"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050315/halltext/50315h01.htm#50315h01_spnew38">
	<p pid=".17.5/1">I will not give way again at the moment. I have only a limited amount of time&mdash;[<i>Interruption.</i>] I will not give way again, as I have to deal with a large number of issues. Almost every Labour Member who has spoken said that they were eager to hear what I had to say.</p>
	<p pid=".17.5/2">I find it perplexing that at a meeting in Dover on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February</phrase> of the Port Users Group&mdash;incidentally, that was the first meeting of that group since the previous March; it is another cause for concern that there is almost one year between meetings, and port users feel that they are not being consulted or involved by the Dover Harbour Board in the port's affairs&mdash;a statement was made to the effect that a public inquiry would be held into the harbour revision orders. In the sixth item of business in the minutes of the meeting, it was said that a national public inquiry in June would address the objections made by the UK Major Ports Group and myself to the harbour revision orders for all the major trust ports.</p>
	<p pid=".17.5/3">That is the only firm indication that I have received that the Government wish to proceed to a public inquiry. I would welcome an inquiry, but the letter that I received from the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" name="David Jamieson">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson)</phrase>, dated <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-15">15 February</phrase>, in response to a parliamentary question about the Dover harbour revision order, referred to the public inquiry in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid=".17.5/4" class="indent">&quot;The applications for the orders have now all been advertised, and objections have been made in respect of all the ports. Where there is an objection to an application for an order which is not withdrawn there must by law be a public inquiry. Unless these could be combined, this might lead to seven inquiries given that there are objections lodged against each Order.</p>
	<p pid=".17.5/5" class="indent">Even if the inquiries might be combined the issues raised by yourself and the UK Major Ports Group are fundamentally points of principle of the type not normally the subject of such inquiries. There must be some doubt on how an inquiry would help resolve matters and thereby justify the costs of setting up and participating in it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".17.5/6">That statement is totally inconsistent, one might think, from what was announced at the meeting of the Dover Harbour Board users' group on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-28">28 February</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".17.5/7">One of the grounds for objecting to the Government's fiddling with the definition of trust ports is that it is a means of trying to circumvent section 10 of the Ports Act 1991. Our view is that if the Government wish to amend or repeal section 10, they should do so by means of primary legislation. They have chosen not to do that in their eight years in office, and if they want to change their policy, they should not try to do so by encouraging the ports in an underhand way to submit harbour revision orders, which could result in a fraud being committed against the national taxpayer. Whether the ports like it or not, the Office for National Statistics defines them as public corporations. In that respect, they are like the Post Office, which must make a return on capital. The Government's policy, however, is that these bodies should not make a return on capital, despite their being public corporations.</p>

	<p pid=".21.1/1">Essentially, subsequent to the ONS definition, we revert to the status quo, which, overwhelmingly, is what is desired by those who have spoken. There has to be a statutory public inquiry if the objections prevail. The letter the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/995" name="David Jamieson">my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Mr. Jamieson)</phrase>, sent to the hon. Member for Christchurch does not contradict that in any way. My hon. Friend made his points precisely to exhort the hon. Gentleman and others to withdraw their objections.</p>
	<p pid=".21.1/2">We have heard how farcical it is that there is even an objection in the context of Harwich. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman will offer Milford Haven as the way forward. Perhaps he just missed that port and made a minor mistake, or perhaps there is something magical about Milford Haven that means it has not attracted the hon. Gentleman's attention. If the objections prevail, there will have to a public inquiry. That, of course, leads to a degree of uncertainty and time, when we would far rather the ports got on with what they want to get on with.</p>
	<p pid=".21.1/3">It is not a question of fiddling or the Government having form in the readjustment of figures, but simply a clash between the ONS defining things in one way, and our disagreement with that. The other point that my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State made was this: we feel that these are points of substantial principle that are not normally dealt with at a public inquiry, given that ONS told us what would happen if we go one way in terms of composition and disapplying the privatisation element. A public inquiry usually concerns the detail and substance of the way forward in relation to a trust board.</p>
	<p pid=".21.1/4">In truth, my hon. Friend the Member for Tynemouth started to move in the right direction in revealing what really lies behind the position of the hon. Member for Christchurch on Dover. I do not doubt that that will be the position on all trust ports. It must be. Why else would the hon. Gentleman object to the disapplication of privatisation compulsion in the cases of the other ports we are considering in relation to harbour revision orders?</p>

	<p pid=".23.1/1">We have said clearly that, with the harbour revision orders, we are trying to get back to the status quo where the Government and the trust ports can work together and be confident about the future. We seek to work with trust ports to disapply compulsory privatisations, and seek to recalibrate the balance of public sector figures on the board, so that we can return to the status quo that prevailed before. I say that with certainty. We have no intention of inhibiting investment plans should things go to public inquiries. It is not our role or intention to interfere with or inhibit those investment plans.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/2">What I cannot do is give the House an assurance that those investment plans are safe or secure in the event&mdash;God help us&mdash;of a Conservative Government. Given what the hon. Member for Christchurch said about Dover and his actions in putting up objections to the disapplying of compulsory privatisation, I cannot give any such assurance. It is interesting that the hon. Gentleman did not either.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/3">The Conservatives are supposedly going to match our transport plans. They cannot, by their own lights, do that. They are planning at least &pound;2 billion worth of cuts a la the famous James report. Of that, &pound;800 million or &pound;900 million is already being dealt with through efficiencies, so there is a hole of &pound;900 million straight away. The hon. Member for Christchurch and his colleagues are travelling throughout the country. Every time they are in a hole on transport, they promise something. We have clocked them at about &pound;3.5 billion worth of promises beyond what the transport party is doing. Throw in the &pound;900 million hole and, before the hon. Gentleman has done anything, there is a black hole of nearly &pound;5 billion in transport commitments, let alone anything else.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15.24.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/766" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="24"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050315/halltext/50315h02.htm#50315h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".24.1/1">It is a welcome, if somewhat rare, pleasure to have the chance to focus the attention of the House on the needs of my constituency and, in particular, its appalling public transport provision. I note that the Minister has already been present for one debate and I feel somewhat guilty about detaining him further&mdash;he may consider it a kind of detention. He is welcome to write out 100 times, &quot;I must do more for public transport in Leigh,&quot; but I will leave that up to him.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/2">Now is perhaps not the best time in the parliamentary cycle to highlight areas of failure, but as the growing debate about transport priorities in the north-west has gone live, I have felt increasing frustration about the raw deal that my constituents are getting. It cannot be allowed to continue. Last year, a major transport scheme in my constituency, the Leigh-Salford-Manchester guided busway, was one of a number of schemes placed on hold pending a review of transport priorities by the North West regional assembly. In the region, that was seen as a consequence of ongoing negotiations about the Metrolink scheme.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/3">Metrolink does not affect my constituency directly, but I have supported colleagues in the call to get it back on track because I recognise its huge strategic importance to the economic regeneration of our city region. Of course, all the towns in Greater Manchester, Leigh included, have a stake in the continuing success story of city centre Manchester. That is why it is right that my constituents should contribute to Metrolink via their council tax. However, there is a real danger that Greater Manchester's transport needs will become defined by Metrolink. If the lobbying campaign pays off and the scheme goes ahead&mdash;as I have said, I hope that it does&mdash;transport officials may feel that Manchester has had its lot and should not come knocking for some time. I hope that the Minister understands and appreciates how unfair we would feel that was.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/4">The Greater Manchester passenger transport authority has long recognised that links west from Manchester are poor and that there is no immediate prospect of the towns along the East Lancashire road leading to Leigh benefiting from Metrolink. For precisely that reason, the &pound;26 million guided busway was long in the planning to compensate Leigh for not being part of Metrolink, not phase 3 but phase 2. The guided busway was expected to be fully operational by this year.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/5">I sought this debate because I believe that Leigh's transport needs are becoming lost in the debate about Metrolink. It would seem that the guided busway has been thrown back into the pot of medium to low-priority public transport schemes in the north-west, even though it was given provisional planning and funding approval by the Department for Transport a couple of years ago. There are many things in its favour. It is an innovative use of bus transport, which seems to fit well with current priorities in the Department, and it would cut congestion on one of the north-west's main arterial routes, the East Lancashire road, which is a severe and growing problem.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/6">I know the Minister well and I appreciate that he may be subject to more constituency special pleading than most Ministers, but, if he will allow me, I would like to issue something of a challenge to him&mdash;he is not normally one to back down from a challenge. I ask him to see whether he can find a town similar in size to Leigh, with a population of roughly 43,000 people, in a metropolitan borough, which has poorer public transport provision than we do. I hope that he will take me up on that challenge, because I genuinely do not believe that he can find such a town. My constituents are getting the rawest deal of any in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/7">There are some facts to back up the rhetoric. First, Leigh is the largest town in the country without a rail station. In addition, there is no tram station. We do not benefit from Metrolink, as I have said. Buses are the only option. Secondly, as I will show in the course of my remarks, new research from the House of Commons Library shows that, for public transport, Leigh is by a long margin the worst-served town in Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/8">I understand the need to balance priorities and to focus scarce public transport resources on areas of strategic transport importance, but it is not as though Leigh is a backwater. We are located at the crossroads of the north-west, halfway between Liverpool and Manchester, and we are flanked on one side by the M6, with the East Lancashire road to the south. We are a matter of miles from overdeveloped Warrington. I do not say that to antagonise my Warrington colleagues, but the town has experienced significant development in the past 20 years, and Leigh is well placed to take up some of the extra development that the north-west is experiencing.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/9">Public transport resources should go towards easing congestion on strategic routes, but they should also pick out the areas of greatest social deprivation. Leigh provides a perfect case study of the importance of quality transport links in preserving a town's economic, social and cultural well-being and of what happens when those links are lost.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/10">In the '50s and '60s&mdash;perhaps you will remember this, Mr. Deputy Speaker&mdash;Leigh was a thriving industrial town, with high employment in coal mining, the textile industry and engineering of many kinds; big employers such as BICC and David Brown Tractors were based there. However, the 1963 White Paper &quot;The Reshaping of British Railways&quot; dealt the town a savage blow whose proportions could not have been imagined at the time. As a result of the Beeching cuts, railway lines passing through Leigh were closed, and all the town's stations were lost. Since then, the area has suffered huge social and economic decline. The Beeching cuts were the catalyst for the loss of thousands of jobs in traditional industries and at major public facilities such as our accident and emergency department.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/11">That act of savagery towards Leigh by Howard Macmillan's Conservative Government was compounded by Margaret Thatcher&mdash;our town was left cut off and isolated when the worst of the Thatcher Government's cuts took effect. Following the large job losses that came with the closure of the coal mines and other heavy industries, people were simply unable to find alternative employment; indeed, they really would have had to get on their bikes to do so, because no other transport was available. A double whammy was landed on our town.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/12">The combination of the lack of transport and the loss of employment knocked the stuffing out of Leigh, and the lack of quality transport links has held back our recovery ever since. We are now beginning to see signs of that recovery&mdash;the Wigan borough has its lowest unemployment rate for a generation&mdash;but the travel-to-work survey in the 2000 census shows that public transport has played little or no part in that. People's only option is to use buses, which simply cannot be relied on to get them to work on time in the main areas of employment: Manchester, Warrington and Bolton.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/13">I should say at this point that in Jim Stones Coaches, Leigh has the best local bus operator in the whole of Greater Manchester, if not the north-west. Jim and his team have provided a first-class service since deregulation and they are thoroughly committed to serving the people of the town. I do not know where we would be without the service that they have provided.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/14">To return to the main issue, however, the 2000 census shows that Leigh residents must rely on cars far more than the residents of any of the other 16 towns in Greater Manchester, with all the extra costs that that puts on people in low to medium-paid work. Only 7.9 per cent. of people aged between 16 and 74 in employment in Leigh use public transport to get to work, which is an appallingly low figure. If the Minister doubted my rhetoric earlier, that figure tells its own story about the quality of public transport in Leigh. Those cars jam the East Lancashire road, the M62 and the A49 junction at Winwick every morning.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/15">As I said, I have independent verification of my argument from the House of Commons Library. I commissioned from it a survey of public transport provision in the 16 biggest towns of Greater Manchester. It confirmed what many people knew: Leigh is the only town without an overground train station or a Metrolink tram service. To add insult to injury, even I was shocked to find that Leigh came bottom in the list of towns ranked according to quality of bus links to central Manchester, with only three frequent services. The Library report states:</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/16" class="indent">&quot;It is clear that Leigh's bus services do not make up for its lack of tram and train services. Leigh has the smallest number of frequent public transport services with the city centre on each mode&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/17">The report concludes that</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/18" class="indent">&quot;it is difficult to argue against the assertion that the public transport service between Manchester and Leigh is poorer than with any other similar sized town&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/19">With the exception of Atherleigh way, opened in the mid-1980s and funded by the old Greater Manchester council, Leigh has not had any major transport investment since Beeching did his damage.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/20">The Minister will probably be pleased that I am coming to the end of what he may regard as a long whinge, but I make no apology for it. What I have said needs to be said, and the voice of my constituents needs to be heard, because the current state of affairs is not acceptable. In conclusion then, what am I asking from the Minister and from transport officials, both in our region and in Whitehall? Longer term, Leigh needs access to rail or tram services to the east and west&mdash;to Liverpool and to Manchester. We are strategically well located, on the main crossroads between the two great towns of the north-west. In the interim, however, I hope that my hon. Friend will consider a number of specific requests.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/21">First, I hope that my hon. Friend and his officials will reflect on what I have said and let me know whether they think Leigh is fairly served. I would appreciate a response to the challenge of finding an equivalent-sized town that is more poorly served by transport. As an aside, I also ask the North West regional assembly, which has been instructed by the Department to review transport priorities in the region, to consider what I have said as a contribution to its consultation.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/22">Secondly, I hope that the Minister will clear up the outstanding planning issues affecting the Leigh guided busway as soon as possible, or at least give a commitment to do so. The problem is holding things up, and resolving a number of what I understand to be minor issues would help us to make progress. The Minister may recall that the Secretary of State gave the scheme planning approval in principle some time ago, pending work on other issues, which required further evidence. I am afraid that there is a blight on Leigh and our area in the north-west in that we have, it seems, a large number of great-crested newts, which hold back human progress in the area. I hope that the Minister can say that the issues surrounding the protection of the newts have been satisfactorily dealt with.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/23">Thirdly, there is a genuinely unanswerable case for the Department, working with the Greater Manchester passenger transport executive, to find an immediate funding solution for the busway. Given that provisional funding approval has already given and that it was part of the deal for Metrolink phase 2, it is not fair that the busway is now pitched back into the pot with the other schemes in the north-west competing for funding. The busway had already been picked out as a priority for progress.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/24">Fourthly, I hope that the Minister will take an urgent look at our proposal for a rail station in the former mining village of Golborne. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1064" name="Ian McCartney">My right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield (Mr. McCartney)</phrase> and I are utterly convinced that a rail station there would be a well used feature of strategic importance in the region. Such a station would be our best hope of bringing a rail service to the Leigh and Lowton areas in the not-too-distant future. However, we have experienced great frustration in getting the component parts of the rail industry to engage positively with the case that we have made.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/25">Such a station would be right on the edge of a major sporting facility, Haydock race course, which attracts thousand of visitors every year&mdash;I know, because my house is literally next door and they queue up at the end of my drive. I do not call for a station there because of my nimby considerations. The place in question is nestled in the corner between the M6 and the East Lancs road, and there is a huge sporting facility on our doorstep, so it would make great sense to have a station there. Will the Minister see whether he can get more positive engagement from transport officials on that issue?</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/26">Ironically, Merseytravel has shown more interest in the Golborne station proposal. It will soon launch a Golborne rail link bus service between the potential site at Golborne and Newton-le-Willows station in Merseyside, in the hope of building a market for rail travel in the Golborne area. Merseytravel deserves help and encouragement from other parties, not least the GMPTE, to approach the proposal with a will to make it succeed.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/27">As I acknowledged, my speech has been something of a whinge, but I ask hon. Members to imagine sitting where I am and having to talk about public transport in Leigh; I would be laughed out of court if I claimed there had been all kinds of positive progress. The situation is not good enough and it needs to improve. I am raising the stakes today and saying that for the next few years I will keep on banging the drum until there have been real improvements.</p>
	<p pid=".24.1/28">Until my constituents have real alternatives to the car to enable them to get to their place of work I shall fight tooth and nail any proposal for a congestion charge in Greater Manchester.</p>

	<p pid=".30.1/1">Given that it is a statutory, or quasi-statutory, process, I cannot give any fixed assurances about a timetable. Suffice it to say that when I go back to the Department, I will try informally to elicit what stage we are at and when we can anticipate a decision.</p>
	<p pid=".30.1/2">Although I will bear in mind my hon. Friend's points about alacrity, I have no idea about Prorogation, Dissolution or anything else. I will not promise to do or not do something in light of a date about which I, my hon. Friend and even the enlightened Deputy Speaker know nothing except what we read in the papers and idly speculate about with colleagues over cups of tea.</p>
	<p pid=".30.1/3">My hon. Friend will know that as part of the spending review 2004, and bearing in mind the Government's desire for greater regional involvement in privatisation, we have had to review the relative priority of major local transport schemes. I would not say as abruptly as my hon. Friend that the Leigh guided busway has been lost in the fog and smoke of the debates about Metrolink, but clearly as we move to greater regional devolution there will be finite pots of funding for each region. Perhaps there will be some additional strategic elements but, as ever, politics is the language of priorities, whether decisions are made regionally or at the centre. I unpick my hon. Friend's argument a little bit, none the less I understand the points that he made.</p>
	<p pid=".30.1/4">Difficult decisions have had to be made about the priorities of investment proposals. Let me make it very clear: we certainly recognise the merits of the Leigh guided busway scheme. That is precisely why it was given provisional approval in the first place. There is no question about the merits of the project, but since then the cost of the total quality bus contract scheme has gone up significantly, with Government contributions increasing by &pound;17 million to &pound;42.3 million. Given the other funding pressures in the north-west, it has not been possible to prioritise the scheme for funding in the current spending review period. That decision can, and should, be regularly revisited. The scheme has not been cancelled and we will consider it again in light of advice on priorities received from the region.</p>
	<p pid=".30.1/5">It is important to say that in the three-year spending review and the last local transport plan settlement, an image was formed&mdash;I understand why&mdash;that if projects were not set running this year, they would somehow be put to the back of the queue, with no consideration until post 2008 and the next round of the comprehensive spending review. That is not accurate, as there will be any amount of to-ing and fro-ing, slippages and other changes in the regional pot and the projects that have been prioritised as we look at the world in 2005. It is incumbent on us and the region to review the regional prioritisation list on a year-by-year basis, even within the curtilage of the three-year spending programme. That is not to say in any coded way, &quot;The money's there, don't worry about it&quot;, but things are not as stark as has often been suggested since the <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-01">1 December</phrase> regionally focused settlement. They are not as stark as my saying, &quot;Leigh guided busway has no chance until the next spending review.&quot; The position is far more fluid than that.</p>
	<p pid=".30.1/6">I accept much of what my hon. Friend says about Leigh and Wigan borough council being a poorer relation in transport provision for Greater Manchester. I accept his point about the peculiarities of Leigh and Wigan, given that they are on the western periphery of Greater Manchester and sit almost squashed between Merseyside, Warrington and Manchester&mdash;the crossroads to everywhere but with contacts to nowhere. I accept those points broadly, and I will look further into the points that he raises.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15.42.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1119" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="42"  time="14:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050315/halltext/50315h03.htm#50315h03_spnew19">
	<p pid=".42.0/1">At the risk of being the third one in a row, I have to say that I am another Liberal Democrat who is not an expert on this subject, but I am sure that the whole House is waiting in anticipation for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/895" name="Don Foster">my hon. Friend the Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>, who will put us all right if he should catch your eye during the winding-up speeches, Mr. Deputy Speaker. That may be the triumph of hope over experience, but I am willing to go with it today.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1311" name="Steve Webb">My hon. Friend the Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb)</phrase> has raised an important issue. As hon. Members have shown, it is beginning to be an issue in our constituencies and it will become much more of an issue in the years ahead. My part of the world is the south of Scotland and I would make the bold claim&mdash;although I am confident about it&mdash;that I probably represent the most beautiful constituency in the whole country<i>. [Interruption.] </i>Perhaps Macclesfield is one small exception. The important point is that, in many places, the source of that beauty is the topography&mdash;the hills and the valleys. For all that, read that those are difficult technical circumstances in which to supply television and other broadcast signals.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/3">One local worthy recently highlighted to me that it took more than 40 years to get 90 per cent. analogue coverage for our part of the world, yet it is proposed that, somewhere between now and 2008, we will move exclusively to digital and complete the switchover in the first tranche of regions. That seems extremely ambitious, not least when important villages such as Clovenfords in the heart of my constituency currently barely receive the analogue signals for existing terrestrial channels, and when the issue of Channel 5 still dogs many of the communities across all the towns in the region. So, there has been some surprise that the Border Television region has been selected to be in the first group of regions that will transfer over. I do not want that to be interpreted as a denigration of the technical prowess of the people at Border Television or the many other engineers up and down the country who will tackle this matter, but having spoken to different people in Border Television and elsewhere, I remain concerned that there is a lot of doubt about the technical feasibility of the switchover on such an ambitious time scale. Let no one get the wrong signal from me&mdash;if Members will pardon the pun. I am not suggesting that anybody in my constituency does not want digital television services. Those of us who have the good fortune to be able to get Freeview or satellite television and the like appreciate that it is a major breakthrough. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1313" name="Brian White">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes, North-East (Brian White)</phrase> said, it is something of which Britain can rightly be proud, and we all want it as soon as possible. However, it must be introduced in a manageable and sensible time frame, and, as my hon. Friends have remarked, we must take account of some key issues&mdash;not least affordability.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/4">I have been in correspondence about that subject on behalf of different constituents over the past year or so with Lord McIntosh in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. I am grateful to him for the detailed way in which he has sought to answer those letters and tackle the concerns of my constituents. In response to a recent inquiry, he confirmed that analogue will be maintained until digital</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/5" class="indent">&quot;is an affordable option for the vast majority of people&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/6">and the Government</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/7" class="indent">&quot;are satisfied that the interests of consumers, especially the most vulnerable, are well protected&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/8">My hon. Friends have already highlighted those issues in the guidelines and other correspondence, and I applaud the Government's intention; but I have yet to see or hear the detailed definitions of &quot;affordable&quot;, &quot;the vast majority&quot; or &quot;the most vulnerable&quot; that will assure me that important sections of my local community are not left out. Affordability affects not only one television. The days are long gone when households might have only the one piece of equipment to be affected by such a change. It is not simply about changing the black and white telly in the corner over to colour, or getting one with teletext; in many households every room has a television, with VCRs or DVD players attached. Even now pieces of equipment are being sold that are not digital-compatible. For many who do not have a seven-year-old child, a neighbour or friend who can assist, switchover will be a big burden.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/9">Many people are doubtful. They do not have to be technophobes; they just have to be a tiny bit sceptical about the process, given the fiasco that we endured during the Channel 5 switchover. If that is any indication of what the process will be like in the future, people are right to be worried.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/10">Separately, I am concerned about people's ability to choose between different digital platforms. The experts present&mdash;we have already eliminated four or five people from that description&mdash;have highlighted that there are a number of platforms out there. Beyond Sky Television, and Freeview where one can get it, most people are unaware of any other options. They do not recognise the prospect of other serious options coming on stream in an affordable and accessible way soon. Many fear that only Sky will be available to them because they are not in an area that enjoys Freeview. They also remain doubtful about the boosted Freeview signal allowing them to receive those services in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15.53.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/774" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="53"  time="15:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050315/halltext/50315h03.htm#50315h03_spnew37">
	<p pid=".53.0/1">That is our intention. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree with something that the debate has shown clearly. As he said, we can go for dates, but if we are not reassured that we will deliver a service to everyone, including the vulnerable, it would be a mistake to start giving out dates. The first question that must be asked is, &quot;Can we deliver the service?&quot; We as a Government must be sure that we can give clear political leadership. The issue is not just about dates, which are important but just one part of the debate. We must be reassured that the technology is in place and that we can deliver.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/2">This afternoon, I want to try to lay out how we believe that we can deliver the technology to the people that the debate has been about and central to&mdash;vulnerable people. Once we are reassured on that point, I will be much more assured about giving dates. That is also the case as far as the Secretary of State is concerned. Ofcom and the BBC do not have the responsibilities that Government have to deliver the service to all sectors of society. That is a political decision of the Government. It is one that we will make when we believe that we have all the information. We think that that is important. What has been useful about the debate is that it has brought that into political focus.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/3">At the heart of the Government's plan is the key role that the BBC will play in switchover. We agree with the BBC's view, expressed in &quot;Building Public Value&quot;, that it should have a lead role in the switchover. We will ask the BBC to help establish and manage the organisation that will co-ordinate the implementation of switchover. We will also ask it to take a lead role in public information campaigns, telling consumers what will happen and when and what consumers need to do. That has been clearly emphasised in the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/4">We know from reports from Generics, the consumer expert group, and Ofcom that some people will need considerable help at switchover. We therefore agree with the consumer expert group and Ofcom's independent consumer panel that the vulnerable consumer should be assisted throughout that stage of the switchover. We will also ask the BBC to help establish and fund schemes for the most vulnerable consumers. We are not able to announce details of who will get help at this stage, but we continue to work with the charities that deal with vulnerable households and will set out our proposals in conjunction with the BBC. So, there will be a wide consultation in the area. Details will be set out at the time of an announcement.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/5">Whatever we do, we must ensure that the public have an awareness and understanding of switchover. Broadcasters, and the supply chain to them, will hold the primary responsibility for ensuring that everyone gets all the information that they need about the switchover process. However, the Government will continue to take responsibility for communicating their switchover policy. In November 2004, the Government launched a public awareness campaign that aims to use the mainstream media to educate the media and the public about switchover.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/6">The switchover logo has been referred to, the development of which is a crucial part of the support. The logo indicates digital-ready products and services and reliable information about switchover. So far, 20 manufacturers and more than 200 retailers, representing more than 2,300 retail outlets, and a number of aerial installers, as well as Top Up TV, have signed up to the use of that logo. We are making progress. Information leaflets are readily available at all major stores, including Dixons and Comet. We are also working with charities on plans to ensure that everyone, including those who are hard to reach, get the right information and support. We are working with shadow SwitchCo, the switchover organisation that is being set up by broadcasters and the supply chain to ensure that communication and marketing plans reflect the needs of consumers. We understand that it plans a proactive information campaign at both the national and the regional level. There is surely no clearer message to focus people's minds than the Government's announcement that confirms the timetable of that switchover.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/7">As I mentioned, the Government will confirm the timetable once all remaining issues are resolved and we are satisfied that the interests of consumers&mdash;especially, I repeat, the most vulnerable consumers&mdash;are protected. One of those interests is the precise coverage requirements. That comprises the number of transmitters to be converted, modes and power combinations. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-09">9 February</phrase>, Ofcom published a consultation paper setting out options on how best to deliver substantially the same coverage with digital terrestrial as with analogue transmission. That includes details of the benefits of particular options for availability and trade-offs that would be needed. It has invited responses by <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-21">21 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/8">Ofcom also published a technical briefing paper on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-09">9 February</phrase> setting out the proposed regional order for switchover by 2012 as part of its wider spectrum management responsibilities. The order in which the regions will be switched off is based on technical criteria that have been agreed between broadcasters, multiplex operators and Ofcom. The specific dates of the process remain, of course, a matter for Government. The switchover process involves a number of different parties with different interests. For switchover to be successful, there needs to be in place an organisation to manage the process and see it through, hopefully, to a successful completion.</p>
	<p pid=".53.0/9">Both the BBC's and Ofcom's reports into switchover supported the idea of a SwitchCo organisation to take forward the switchover project. SwitchCo has been set up as the primary body charged with ensuring the successful achievement of switchover in the United Kingdom. It will need to build constructive relationships with the industry to educate consumers on the benefits of switchover, and allow regions plenty of time to prepare. The structure of the new organisation is being developed and will involve public service broadcasters, multiplex operators and representatives from the supply chain.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15.55.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/774" speakername="Richard Caborn" colnum="55"  time="15:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050315/halltext/50315h03.htm#50315h03_spnew39">
	<p pid=".55.0/1">They are issues that have to be worked through. I want to answer some of the specific questions that have been asked if I have time, but I should like to conclude.</p>
	<p pid=".55.0/2">The Government are committed to switchover: the question is not &quot;whether&quot; but &quot;when&quot;. Switchover is in the UK's interests, and everybody agrees with that. The Conservative Opposition can smirk about that, and giggle and laugh, but we are genuinely trying to manage the system responsibly. We are at the leading edge of technology in this country and intend to stay there. In that position, some difficult questions have to be resolved, but we shall try to do that in the most common-sense and transparent way possible. Giggling from a sedentary position does not help.</p>
	<p pid=".55.0/3">The cost-benefit analysis published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-10">10 February</phrase> showed the quantifiable benefits of switchover to be around &pound;1.1 billion. Ofcom figures for digital television penetration were estimated to have reached 55 per cent. of UK households. Based on Freeview projections and Sky's figures, that is almost certain to top 60 per cent. of households. However, only 73 per cent. of UK households can access digital terrestrial television services. That figure cannot be increased before switchover, but the analogue switch-off should be seen as not a switch-off, but a switch-over.</p>
	<p pid=".55.0/4">I shall quickly respond to some of the specific questions that were asked. In the south-west, take-up is low because digital terrestrial coverage is limited. We need the switchover to happen before we can remedy that. Lack of Freeview is a major issue during the charter review, and will continue to be considered.</p>
	<p pid=".55.0/5">We accept that flats will be a challenge. We are working with the industry and the Chartered Institute of Housing on guidance for the housing sector, and I hope that we can resolve some of the questions that have been raised on the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".55.0/6">We are looking at the Ofcom plan for voluntary help, and we shall announce who will receive voluntary help and what help they will receive. On the spectrum valuation, that will be released only in 2012 when switchover is complete. Spectrum release can be used only for broadcasting. That may change but we have made cautious assumptions about future worth; we do not think that it is possible to fund switchover costs from the future proceeds.</p>
	<p pid=".55.0/7">On covenants, Astra has raised the matter and we have asked it to give us further evidence but we are still not convinced that there is a real problem in that area. On aerials, we have found that in the technical trials that have been done in Wales, the aerials stand up quite well. Switchover signals will be within the aerial groups and at a higher power. Some people will need to upgrade, but much fewer than some of the figures that have been quoted in the media. We believe that on NTL issues, switchover will create competition: all those who receive analogue will get digital at switchover. We hope that Freesat will emerge so that people will have a choice other than Sky as a free-to-view satellite option.</p>

	<p pid=".57.7/1">I am most grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. Is not the burden of the point that he is making on behalf of his constituents that, intended or not, as a result of the Government's policies his force may have to reduce front-line policing? By contrast, following the election manifesto commitment for an increase of 40,000 police officers across the country over eight years, the Conservative party is committed to ensuring that that force has at least 2,200 more police.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15.57.8" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15a.57.8" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-15.57.8" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/749" speakername="Graham Brady" colnum="57"  time="15:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050315/halltext/50315h04.htm#50315h04_spnew9">
	<p pid=".57.8/1">My hon. Friend demonstrates huge versatility in making that absolutely core point. The experience of my constituents under the Labour Government is that front-line policing may be cut, whereas they know that it would be increased considerably across Greater Manchester under a Conservative Government. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point so clearly.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/2">As the police authority has pointed out, the major reasons for its funding shortfall are increases in the costs of employment, the fact that Greater Manchester is hit harder than most other forces by increased pension costs, increases in the costs that it has to bear for private finance initiative projects that now have to be funded by the force and a variety of other exceptional factors. The police authority's concern was repeated by the chief constable, Mike Todd, who stated in the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-18">18 February</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/3" class="indent">&quot;I am extremely disappointed about the likely outcome of the budget settlement. It is bad for GMP, bad for policing and bad for the people of Greater Manchester.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/4" class="indent">This will be the second year running that we have had a poor budget settlement, and it will not even be possible to continue what we have been doing this year.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/5" class="indent">We have worked extremely hard to improve the performance of GMP&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/6">He concluded by stating:</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/7" class="indent">&quot;This will now be put in jeopardy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/8">That was the chief constable making the point in his own words.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/9">The <i>Manchester Evening News</i> rightly picked up on the issue in its editorial and clearly made the point that the present Government's election pledges were being called into question by the local policing situation. As it happened, the editorial was adjacent to an article by Andrew Grimes with the excellent headline, &quot;Is it time to put Tony out to grass?&quot; I am sure that it made interesting reading, and it was an appropriate juxtaposition in the context of broken election pledges.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/10">Mr. Todd warned that Greater Manchester police may have to make redundancies for the first time in their 30-year history. In response to comments from Home Office Ministers, he said that it would be naive to imagine that redundancies in support staff would not impact on front-line policing.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/11">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-19">19 February</phrase>, the <i>Manchester Evening News</i> reported that the Minister for Crime Reduction, Policing and Community Safety had said that she expected Mr. Todd to get on with the job and put more bobbies on the beat. That is all very well. We would be delighted to have the chief constable get on with the job, and we all want more bobbies on the beat, and I am sure that the chief constable wants that as well, but he cannot do those things, given the resources and the situation that he is faced with as a result of Government policies and what the Home Office is doing.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/12">My constituents, who worry about crime and particularly the frightening levels of violent crime and gun use, are faced with a war of words between the chief constable and the Minister with responsibility for policing. The Minister says that everything is fine. The chief constable says that the force faces cuts in front-line policing. I mean no offence when I say that I am more inclined to believe the man who is charged with delivering policing in Greater Manchester, and I believe that the people of Greater Manchester know who to believe as well.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/13">The evidence is already mounting. Greater Manchester police recruitment, which was previously 100 officers a month, was cut to 30 officers a month, and there is a complete freeze on recruitment this month. The cuts in the Centrex training budget have forced Greater Manchester police to take on more of the cost of training their own officers. I welcome community support officers as long as they are an additional resource and are not used to replace fully trained front-line police officers, but the community support officers already in place are now being funded from the Greater Manchester police budget, not directly from the Home Office. The Home Office wants more community support officers, but long-term funding will come from existing budgets, which will put yet more pressure on the budget for fully trained police officers.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/14">Far from reducing the red tape, the new stop-and-search requirements and the changes to the national recording of crime are increasing the burden of form- filling and bureaucracy. Even with cuts in recruitment, a &pound;500,000 cut in street crime overtime and the withdrawal of funding for local crime-fighting initiatives, GMP still face a significant shortfall. That comes at a time when there are unparalleled challenges in dealing with violent crime and when Greater Manchester police have a regional and national role in fighting terrorism.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/15">The Minister knows that the Opposition understand the importance of policing. That is why the Conservative party has pledged to recruit 40,000 more police officers, more than 2,200 of which would be in Greater Manchester. That is something that has been taken up by my Conservative colleagues who, after a resounding victory in June&mdash;on which I know the Minister will want to congratulate them&mdash;are running Trafford metropolitan borough council. The council will hold its own debate on the crisis of police resources in Greater Manchester and I am sure that, as a result, it will want to press Ministers to resolve matters in a way that avoids cuts in front-line policing in Greater Manchester. My colleagues Councillor Alex Williams and Councillor Stephen Ogden are playing a significant role in that, as is Mr. Damian Hinds, who is the prospective parliamentary candidate for Stretford and Urmston.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/16">The Minister, in her reply, must accept that it is not good enough just to tell my constituents and Greater Manchester police that they have never had it so good. We constantly hear statistics, whether on funding or the number of officers, and receive endless good-news press releases from the Home Office, but the reality that is being experienced on the ground&mdash;the reality that we heard about yesterday from the chief constable in Nottinghamshire and that has been expressed by my chief constable in Greater Manchester&mdash;is very different.</p>
	<p pid=".57.8/17">I hope that when the Minister replies she will accept that there is a real problem that could lead to cuts in front-line policing. Most importantly, I hope that she will set out, in clear, measurable terms, how the Home Office proposes to reduce the burdens of cost and bureaucracy and to ensure that Greater Manchester police continue to have the resources that they need to protect my constituents. We do not want to hear that everything is fine because we know that it is not. What we want to hear from her is some real reassurance that cuts in front-line policing in Greater Manchester can be stopped and that the security and safety of my constituents can be guaranteed.</p>

	<p pid=".60.0/1">The hon. Lady said that the British crime survey is the most authoritatively accepted measure of crime. Will she accept that that simply is not the case? The survey does not include many aspects of violent crime, nor does it include murders or the fastest growing areas of crime, including juvenile crime. Surely she should look at recorded crime. Does she not agree with the leader of her party, who, when in opposition, made it clear that he was interested not in the crime survey but in actual recorded crimes?</p>

	<p pid=".60.1/1">Of course we should look at recorded crime, and although we cannot get a long-term series of figures because of the changes in recorded crime, one of the things that those figures do is show where we need to make our effort in dealing with crime; one of those areas is violent crime, which is why we are focusing on it. The common experience of crime is most accurately shown by the British crime survey, which surveys victims of crime. If we are to put the victim at the heart of our criminal justice system, which is what we should be doing, we should use figures that accurately capture the experience of the victim.</p>
	<p pid=".60.1/2">I am pleased that the Opposition did not seek to divide the House on the police funding settlement for 2005&ndash;06, because it was a good one. It was, indeed, better than predicted by many, including people in Greater Manchester. Within that settlement, Greater Manchester police got &pound;412.5 million in general grants, which is an increase of 4.9 per cent., or &pound;19.3 million, on the previous year, including an extra &pound;800,000 from the amending report, which makes for an overall increase of 5.1 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".60.1/3">That is substantially higher than the 3.75 per cent. funding floor increase guaranteed for all police authorities, and it is above the police pay increase of 3 per cent. and non-pay inflation of about 2.6 per cent. In addition, there is over &pound;32 million in specific grants for targeted funding and a further &pound;10.9 million in capital provision. Of the &pound;32 million in specific grants, more than half is from the crime fighting fund specifically to help to maintain record police officer numbers.</p>
	<p pid=".60.1/4">The situation is significantly better for Greater Manchester police than it was during the previous year when their grant was a broadly standard rate increase in common with other police authorities. Some claim that 5.1 per cent. is insufficient, but I am confident that it is a favourable outcome for Greater Manchester police.</p>
	<p pid=".60.1/5">The budget set by the police authority of &pound;493.9 million for 2005&ndash;06 is an increase of &pound;25 million or 5.3 per cent. We have provided the necessary resources to enable police authorities to produce an increase in activity to sustain the increased police numbers that we have advanced, and to deliver the improvements in policing. We have also asked the police service to make efficient use of its resources by making value-for-money improvements of over &pound;1 billion&mdash;about 3 per cent. per year starting in 2005&ndash;06.</p>
	<p pid=".60.1/6">The police service has a good record of achieving efficiency gains in recent years, and collaborative procurement is one of the key themes of the tripartite police efficiency strategy. I congratulate Greater Manchester police on saving over &pound;600,000 from regional collaboration on the purchase of body armour. It is through such initiatives that further resources can be released for front-line policing efforts. Releasing officers to the front line is an important element in the police efficiency strategy, and GMP have carried out a best value review which will help to identify opportunities for such redeployment in the force.</p>

	<p pid=".61.1/1">I do not predict that that will happen. If we consider the number of police that are available to the chief constable, we see that have sustained that number through the use of the crime fighting fund. Indeed, that was an important part of our strategy to ensure that there will be police on the street.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/2">I can see that the hon. Gentleman is asking who should be trusted. It is a sensible question, because he has referred to his party's commitment to put 2,200 more police on the streets. I cannot yet square that with its commitment to make cuts, as that commitment would cost around &pound;90 million a year. However, let us leave that aside and not poke holes in the Conservatives' fantasy figures; instead, let us consider the record.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/3">Let us consider the Conservative party manifesto in 1992. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We are continuing to increase police numbers. There will be 1,000 extra police officers this year.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/5">I looked at the figures for police officers in that year: there were 7,061. I looked at the figures for 1993: there were 7,060. The 1,000 extra police officers that were promised turned into one fewer.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/6">Let us take a more recent figure, as the hon. Gentleman seemed to want to do when I referred to the 1992 manifesto. Let us consider the words of his former Prime Minister, John Major, on <phrase class="date" code="1995-10-13">13 October 1995</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/7" class="indent">&quot;So, Chief Constables, begin to plan&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/8">This was his offer to chief constables, such as the chief constable of Greater Manchester. He continued:</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Because in the overall arithmetic of this year's public expenditure settlement we have found the resources over the next three years to put, not 500 but an extra 5,000 police officers on the beat.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/10">Again, I looked at the figures. John Major did not stay in power for the following three years, but nevertheless the Budgets set then were operated by the Labour party&mdash;to our cost, frankly&mdash;in government. In 1995, there were 7,037 police officers; in 1996, 6,938. Did the number go up the following year, which, as I am using the March figures, was also fully under a Conservative Government? We should remember that we were promised an extra 5,000 officers over three years. In 1997, the figure was 6,922. The following year, under the Labour Government, the numbers began to creep up, and there were 6,949 officers.</p>
	<p pid=".61.1/11">Who is to be trusted? The hon. Gentleman's party has a consistent&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".62.3/1">No, I did not say that and I do not believe that Mike Todd will have to make cuts, although I do believe that there will be a challenge&mdash;that is the point, is it not? We have discovered that one reason why, in the early years of a Labour Government, our commitments did not immediately translate into front-line police numbers was that we did not establish a clear mechanism to guarantee that the extra investment would turn into extra officers.</p>
	<p pid=".62.3/2">That is precisely why we made the crime fighting fund work as it does and why it gives the power to ensure that the resources translate directly into officers. The crime fighting fund pays for 643 recruits and is making a real difference in Greater Manchester, which has also enjoyed an increase in police support staff of 662 since March 1997. Even though there has been a 39 per cent. increase in police budgets since the election, there will challenges for front-line police officers. However, we have sought to give them the tools to meet the challenges effectively.</p>
	<p pid=".62.3/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to the important example of gun crime and bureaucracy. The biggest increase in gun crime is with replica guns, a significant problem that must be tackled. We have given the police an unbureaucratic and effective tool for dealing with gun crime, by including in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 an arrestable offence of carrying an imitation firearm in public without a reasonable excuse. In addition, we have introduced a minimum five-year sentence for possession of an illegal firearm. Both measures have given the police effective tools to help them to deal with gun crime.</p>
	<p pid=".62.3/4">The hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out that the most powerful way we have helped the police force to deal with red tape is through video identity parades. If one talks to police officers, they will all say that they spend hugely less time nowadays managing identification parades, because of the video identification parade electronic recording scheme, known as VIPER.</p>
	<p pid=".62.3/5">The hon. Gentleman referred to stop and search, and yes, some additional bureaucracy is involved in counting the incidence of that. That is because if stop and search is to be an effective policing tool, it must enjoy the confidence of all our communities. We have asked police officers to record stop and search in order to make it the effective policing tool that it is when it does enjoy that confidence.</p>
	<p pid=".62.3/6">I was in Reading today, visiting someone in whose shop a crime had been committed, and talking about his experience as a witness and how the police responded to him. As I was there, I walked past two police officers patrolling that side street in Reading. Knowing the area well, I must confess that I was struck by that example, because five years ago those officers would not have been there. We have more police on our streets than at any time. Of course there are challenges to the management of the police, but we have more than 8,000 police officers in Manchester, backed up by additional community support officers.</p>
	<p pid=".62.3/7">The extra resources that we have given to Manchester are not, and never will be, enough for the individual officer to say that he can deliver the perfect police force. However, that officer has had a substantial increase in resources, which, along with the resourcefulness that he and his team can show, will enable him to continue to ensure that there are more police officers on the streets of Manchester and that they continue to increase the effectiveness with which they police the community that they serve.</p>

	<p pid=".64.1/1">In every constituency there are many examples of great people and great buildings. In my town great people have built great ships, including, in 1765, Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory. It follows that we in Medway are passionate about our maritime history, and that is what this debate is about&mdash;our maritime history. It is about a unique ship that took working people on excursions and holidays, saved 7,000 men from the Nazis, and would now be lost to the nation if it were not for another great set of people, the Medway Queen Preservation Society. Our ambition is to see the Medway Queen restored, so that she can once again sail the River Medway in all her glory.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/2">I know that my right hon. Friend the Minister and his Department value our ships. Following consultations, our noble Friend Lord McIntosh recently announced the intention to set up a national historic ships unit that will advise the Government on policies and priorities and coordinate with those directly engaged in the preservation of ships to promote public interest in our maritime history&mdash;laudable aims that we all support.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/3">One important response to the consultation was the desire for the unit to engage fully with small craft and not to become preoccupied with the preservation of large ships. I hope that my right hon. Friend will be able to comment on that issue, or write to me if he is unable to comment today. I expect that he will tell the Chamber that there are thousands of ships and many worthy causes, and that there will simply never be sufficient funds to restore all of them. He will rightly say that there must be a better way of co-ordinating policy, so that grant-giving bodies such as the Heritage Lottery Fund are better informed when considering applications. That is right, but part of the thinking behind policy must be about the uniqueness and history of the craft, and, as the Government have rightly said, the consideration of the public interest.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/4">I am fully aware that my right hon. Friend does not have a chequebook in his pocket today, and nor will he have one tomorrow. Making grants is the job of independent bodies, but they will be informed by Government policy, and in securing this debate that is what I seek to influence.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/5">The Medway Queen is a paddle-steamer. She was built in 1924, in Troon on the banks of the Clyde, for the New Medway Steam Packet Company as part of their Queen Line fleet. She was a fine vessel and a model example of Scotland's shipbuilding at its best. I say that because we in Chatham know a thing or two about shipbuilding. Her passenger load was 800 with a top speed of 15 knots. Today, she is the only surviving paddler of her type. The Medway Queen has survived, and that is remarkable given the number of attempts there have been to blow her up, scrap her or sink her. However, despite her remarkable record of survival, given her current state, she cannot survive for much longer without financial support.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/6">The Medway Queen was one of many pleasure steamers operating at the time. The ship's regular route was from Medway to Southend. From Chatham she called at Sheerness and Herne bay before reaching her destination on the Essex coast. She also sailed up and down the Thames, to Clacton. That was her life for 15 years from the day on which she was commissioned, apart from occasional repair at the Acorn shipyard, where the finest and most skilled boilermakers in the land attended to her needs.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/7">After war broke out in 1939, the Medway Queen carried children who were being evacuated from Kent to East Anglia. She joined the Royal Navy as a minesweeper, serving for the duration of the war in the 10th minesweeping flotilla in the English channel. She was now HMS Medway Queen. In 1940, like many small ships, Medway Queen took part in the evacuation of our troops from Dunkirk. She distinguished herself by rescuing 7,000 men. On her seventh trip across the channel, she was badly damaged and reported lost. However, as has become her hallmark, she survived. During those seven trips she gained four awards for gallantry, having shot down three enemy aircraft. She became known as the heroine of Dunkirk&mdash;a paddle-steamer shot down enemy aircraft; a paddle-steamer saved 7,000 men.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/8">After the war, the Medway Queen returned to her commercial service on the River Medway. In the 1960s our access to cars and changes in holidays meant that paddle-steamers were becoming redundant. Many were broken up, and the Medway Queen was sold for scrap. There was a public outcry and, once again, she survived. She became a maritime clubhouse on the Isle of Wight. However, by the 1980s the Medway Queen was unused and deserted and once again the breaker's yard beckoned. Yet in 1984 a group from Kent brought her back to Chatham dockyard, intending to restore her. Sadly this group was unable to carry through its intention and she sank, lying abandoned in the River Medway&mdash;a seemingly tragic end to a wonderful ship that had once graced the same river but was now filled with tonnes of mud. In 1985, the Medway Queen Preservation Society was formed and became the owner of the ship. It spent the next two years removing the mud and patching the hull so that she might be refloated. A full and professional maritime survey was carried out and the results were promising. She was refloated and moved to her present site at Damhead Creek in the estuary of the River Medway. That is the potted history of this unique craft.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/9">It is 20 years since the preservation society started its huge project. The setbacks along the way have included the ship sinking, the visitor centre, including irreplaceable archive material, being destroyed by vandals just last year, and two rejections from the lottery, the last one being particularly painful. Despite all that, the preservation society has continued because of the huge public support for the project. Everybody in Medway knows somebody who has a story about the Medway Queen. She is held in great affection.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/10">It is important for me to pay tribute to the members of the GMB union. With their help, a new funnel was built in 2002 by young apprentices from the Appledore shipyard in Devon. The lads used parts of the original funnel and riveted them to the new one. Most recently, the unveiling of the new paddle took place with the help of south-east Co-op. Those are just two examples of public interest being aroused, and young people being involved in maritime skills, thanks to the Medway Queen.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/11">As I said earlier, last year's lottery rejection was painful. The society was bidding for &pound;6 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund in order that the hull could be restored to its original riveted specification. A cheaper option of plating the hull was advised against, so the MQPS produced a professional business plan that cost tens of thousands of pounds. It did that because that was what the HLF appeared to be recommending.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/12">I know that there is not enough money for every project. However, when people give their time and effort, not to mention raising funds&mdash;which is hard work, as we all know&mdash;they should be given clear guidance from the lottery as to what is expected. If necessary, they should also be given help. Otherwise, the criticism of the lottery that it is accessible only to well connected and professional types will continue.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/13">It appears that all is not lost, continuing the theme of the Medway Queen's survival. Shortly after the rejection, Mr. Stephen Johnson, a director from the lottery, said on a local radio station that the lottery was keen to assist the Medway Queen. There have been meetings, a grant has been applied for and the society will work up a cheaper option for the hull, namely a plated one. That was referred to earlier but was rejected. The society has not been discouraged, has made the application and is waiting to hear. The application is for a project management scheme to provide the detail on whether plating the hull can be achieved; it will still cost in the region of &pound;2 million.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/14">The society has been told by the south-east Heritage Lottery Fund that it will be given every assistance in applying for the grant. I hope that that is the case, because the Medway Queen's restoration will be a project for all people. Older hands from the skilled group of retired craftsmen who attend to the ship every Thursday will be able to show younger hands skills that we need to preserve, not just for this ship but many others in our nation.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/15">I conclude with an extract from J.B. Priestley's &quot;Excursion to Hell&quot;:</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/16" class="indent">&quot;But now&mdash;look&mdash;this little steamer, like all her brave and battered sisters, is immortal. She'll go sailing down the years in the epic of Dunkirk. And yet our great-grandchildren, when they learn how we began this war by snatching glory out of defeat, may also learn how the little holiday steamers made an excursion to hell and came back glorious.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/17">The Heritage Lottery Fund said that the Medway Queen was not of sufficient historical importance to warrant a grant last time. Well, the ship helped to shape the nation's history. At Dunkirk, 7,000 souls were saved, so let us save the Medway Queen.</p>

	<p pid=".66.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1217" name="Jonathan R Shaw">my hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Jonathan Shaw)</phrase> on securing this important debate. After hearing his contribution, if I had the cheque book in my pocket, I would sign one for him straight away. He spoke passionately about a subject that I know is close to his heart, and it is important that the Chamber hears such messages coming from a constituency. I hope that the advice that is given can be heeded, not just in Government but in other quarters.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/2">As my hon. Friend said, the Medway Queen had a particularly distinguished record in evacuating British troops from the beaches of Dunkirk in 1940. It is appropriate that we are recalling that now in 2005, when we are celebrating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war. The Medway Queen saved some 7,000 men not only from the beaches but from the sea, thanks to the courage and tenacity of her crew. I know that some of the men saved still remember vividly, and often recall, how they were rescued.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/3">After the war the Medway Queen settled into the less adventurous but important role of a pleasure steamer. Sadly, the great ship had the indignity of hitting an underwater obstruction and sinking in the River Medina in the early 1970s. She was tied up at Chatham where her decline and neglect have been sad to witness. I pay tribute to the Medway Queen Preservation Society, which my hon. Friend has congratulated, which was formed to save the ship and secure her future. The society's devotion and commitment and that of the ship's owner, the New Medway Steam Packet Company, bring the story of the proud ship right up to date. Thanks to the work of volunteers, the Medway Queen is now at least afloat in a safe berth in Damhead Creek at Kingsnorth in Kent.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/4">I appreciate that the owners and the preservation society face a huge task in restoring the ship to full working order; there is no doubt about that. I confirm to my hon. Friend that the Government do not provide direct funding support for the acquisition, movement or conservation of historic ships, other than by providing grant-in-aid to museums that we sponsor which have vessels of historic significance in their collections.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/5">However, we are committed to delivering a national policy on ship preservation which preserves the best of our maritime heritage. In February, we announced the creation of a national historic ships unit. That unit will, for the first time, formally advise the Secretary of State and the Heritage Lottery Fund on historic ships, their funding needs and their investment priorities. We expect the unit to be up and running by April 2006. Capital funding for historic ships projects will continue to be dealt with by the HLF and other public or private grant-giving bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/6">In July 2004, as my hon. Friend recalled, the HLF considered a major grant application from the New Medway Steam Packet Co. for &pound;6.7 million towards full restoration of the paddle-steamer. The HLF's trustees recognised the heritage importance of the Medway Queen and the role that she played in British history during the Dunkirk evacuations. They also praised the enthusiasm and commitment of the company and its members. However, the trustees felt that the high cost of restoring the ship, and the level of rebuilding necessary, would not represent value for money in terms of heritage and the long-term viability of the ship. The HLF also felt that a couple of their key criteria for awarding grants&mdash;sufficient public access and opportunities for learning&mdash;had not been demonstrated.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/7">In August 2004, Heritage Lottery Fund staff met representatives of the New Medway Steam Packet Co. to explore whether there might be scope for a more modest project, funded by the HLF, that would play a part in securing the ship's long-term survival. As a result of their discussions, the company has identified an alternative approach, which could provide a renewed hull and, potentially, a new weather deck. Completion of that work could secure the ship in the medium term and provide the company with a platform for further fundraising to complete the full restoration over time.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/8">Heritage Lottery Fund staff have continued to provide advice on developing the project, resulting in a recent application to the fund for a project planning grant of &pound;31,500 to enable the New Medway Steam Packet Co. to complete detailed survey work, a conservation and management plan for the ship and other technical approvals needed to underpin the restoration of the ship. The HLF received the application on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-21">21 February</phrase> and, subject to a full assessment of the proposals, a decision should be made in three months. As my hon. Friend recognised, some progress is being made and the way forward is now clearly identified.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/9">The Heritage Lottery Fund will remain the principal source of funding for historic ships. Its trustees make decisions independently of the Government; it is not open to Ministers to intervene or seek in any way to influence its decisions. The HLF has a role to play and it is engaging in that role enthusiastically, giving advice to the New Medway Steam Packet Co. The company's relationship with the HLF does not guarantee funding, because there are always so many competing bids for the available funds. However, we hope that the new national historic ships unit will provide an authoritative source of advice for the HLF and for those engaged in the preservation of our maritime heritage. My hon. Friend clearly outlined how that has impacted on our nation over the years.</p>
	<p pid=".66.0/10">I congratulate my hon. Friend again on his support and commitment to this project. He represents an historic constituency that is famous throughout the world for its history and record of shipbuilding. In this 60th anniversary year of the ending of the second world war, I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving us the opportunity to discuss the future of one of the ships that played such a distinguished and magnificent role in that war.</p>
