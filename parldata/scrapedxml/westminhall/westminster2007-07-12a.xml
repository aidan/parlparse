<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-12a.487.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" speakername="Alan Beith" colnum="487"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070712/halltext/70712h0001.htm#07071271000355">
	<p pid="a.487.2/1">I am glad to see you in the Chair, Mr. Martlew, and I am grateful for your assistance already in trying to ensure that we can accommodate those who are very interested in the debate. Indeed, I wish that your authority extended to allowing us to change places with the main Chamber, because given the number of hon. Members who want to take part and the wider interest, there might be more interest in this debate than in what is going on in the main Chamber, but alas the Standing Orders do not give you the power to do that. I welcome the Minister to her new post and congratulate her on her appointment. I look forward to hearing from her later.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.2/2">The debate is on a report that the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs produced on the Carter review of legal aid. That process&mdash;that report&mdash;produced more evidence than any other report on which the Committee has worked. Vast quantities of evidence were submitted, which were of great value to us. I am particularly grateful to the staff of the Committee and its advisers for the work that they put into analysing the very large quantity of evidence and dealing with the many responses that we received. The Government issued their response to our report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>, and I shall refer to that as the debate continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.2/3">Legal aid guarantees access to justice and is a fundamental human right. Criminal legal aid is enshrined in article 6 of the European convention on human rights, which is given domestic effect by the Human Rights Act 1998. Scottish cases that have gone to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council have shown that funding arrangements and fee structures for legal aid providers have serious human rights implications and, if insufficient, violate the right to a fair trial, so let no one be in any doubt about the importance of what we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.2/4">Legal aid is a powerful tool to fight social exclusion: it is focused on the financially weakest and most vulnerable members of society. In the light of the Prime Minister's recent welcome announcement of his desire to strengthen accountability in local government and public services, it is worth remembering that legal aid can be a powerful vehicle for holding local authorities to account. In the areas of housing, welfare benefit or community care law, for example, it is decisions of local and other public authorities that are often in dispute, and legal aid granted to individuals allows them to challenge those decisions by means of court action if necessary. That, in turn, sets standards for the future conduct of public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.2/5">We can be proud of the legal aid system in England and Wales, whereby we spend more than any other democratic country per capita on publicly funded legal advice and assistance for those in need.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-12a.490.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" speakername="Alan Beith" colnum="490"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070712/halltext/70712h0001.htm#07071271000364">
	<p pid="a.490.2/1">You will know from that intervention, Mr. Martlew, that there are many hon. Members present who are well aware that in their constituencies there are legal aid providers who do not see how they can provide under the new arrangements the service that they are providing at the moment. Indeed, figures provided to the Committee by the LSC indicate that in London, which is a hotspot of social exclusion and deprivation, the incomes of 63 per cent. of lawyers who provide housing law advice will be reduced under the Government's plans for new fixed fees for the transitional period if they do not change their working practices. The average loss for those lawyers who face fee reductions will be 18.5 per cent. The picture is even worse for those who provide welfare benefits advice in London, of whom 70 per cent. will see a similar average fee reduction. Some providers in other regions of the country might receive significant increases in their fees&mdash;the previous Lord Chancellor talked about that when he gave evidence to the Committee&mdash;which could be a positive development, but it is deeply worrying that there is a risk to the provision of social welfare law advice in London and other urban areas that have particular needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/2">Research for the LSC by Andrew Otterburn on the economic situation of criminal legal aid lawyers demonstrated the fragile state that the supplier base is estimated to be in. He warned that the situation is likely to be even worse for civil and family legal aid lawyers. Despite the obvious risk to the provision of quality legal advice posed by fee cuts and aspects of competitive tendering, the Government appear not to have carried out appropriate, wide-ranging research into the likely impact of the Carter reforms on suppliers and clients. They have not undertaken detailed research into the cost drivers in the legal aid budget or into potential means by which to secure a lasting and sustainable development of the legal aid system that consists of more than simply cutting lawyers' fees. Their view on evidence was shown rather vividly in paragraph 40 of their response, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Work is in hand to fill the data gaps identified by the Review, but this is not expected to change our view of the fundamental factors driving cost.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/4">So they are saying, &quot;We are going to get some more evidence, but it won't change our mind, whatever it says.&quot; I find that very Sir Humphrey.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/5">An urgent warning about the effects of the lack of an holistic approach to legal aid came from Michael Robinson, who is a member of the Law Society Council from Northumbria. On the reform proposals for legal aid in child care proceedings, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/6" class="indent">&quot;It is not appreciated how fragile the care proceedings system is. No one has really undertaken a review of how it operates in each local magistrates' and county court or how well the non-solicitor/non-barrister professionals cope with the system. The system works very slowly and, in the main, the interests of children or of parents or grandparents are advanced because solicitors are pro-active. This pro-action will cease with fixed fees. Children will suffer.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/7">Despite the recent child care proceedings review carried out by the Departments for Constitutional Affairs and for Education and Skills, the Government reforms pay too little attention to the recurring problems faced by lawyers and court users in child care proceedings. Such problems include delay, understaffed courts, problems with the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service and insufficient case preparation by local authorities, all of which mar proceedings. The legal aid reforms do not take those considerations sufficiently into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/8">During its inquiry, the Committee was provided with many other examples of how the Government have failed to consider the legal aid system as a whole, carry out adequate research and then address the systemic difficulties comprehensively. For example, little attention has so far been paid to the way in which expert fees have contributed to the rise in the legal aid budget, especially in family and criminal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/9">The Committee's report generally welcomed the Government's intention to move comprehensively to the payment of legal aid providers by case rather than by the hour. However, our inquiry convinced us that neither Lord Carter nor the Government have managed to design fee schemes for the one to three-year transitional period prior to competitive tendering that would provide adequate remuneration for the work that a provider invests in a case. No appropriate set of objective proxies for individual case complexity was employed when deciding the fee levels, and there was almost exclusive reliance on the swings-and-roundabouts effect that is inherent in a fixed fee system with limited graduation. The lack of graduation for differences in case complexity in the initial fee scheme has attracted particularly severe criticism from the most senior family judge in England and Wales, Sir Mark Potter. He called the initial Government proposals for the family fee scheme</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/10" class="indent">&quot;a series of extremely crude averaged fixed fees&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/11">and said that</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/12" class="indent">&quot;the whole thing has to be radically revised&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/13">Although the proposals have been changed, the modifications to the fee schemes can hardly be called adequate. Crude fixed fees or fee schemes with rudimentary graduation will hit hardest the clients who are more difficult to deal with, and potentially the most vulnerable, as they may have greater difficulty in getting their cases dealt with by experienced providers. Fixed fees will waste the knowledge and talent of specialist and niche providers, as they will be forced to take on more straightforward cases to arrive at an economically viable case mix. Such specialists will not be able to deal with as many of the complicated cases that require a high degree of specialisation. There are no economic incentives in the new fee schemes in the transitional period for the provision of dedicated services and specialist advice. The fee uplifts for members of the Law Society's children panel will be severely curtailed under the revised Government plans.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/14">The quality control of legal aid lawyers by means of peer review will provide a quality floor, but will not encourage excellence. Michael Robinson, whom I mentioned earlier, told me:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Already, as a result of the criminal legal aid reforms, we are seeing firms restructure so that expensive, experienced fee-earners will be got rid of and replaced by cheaper, less experienced young people. It is the experience of solicitors which tends to make the system work, and this is not valued by the Legal Services Commission.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/16">The Committee concluded that more work needed to be done on the Government's proposals for what they call the transitional period, with LSC set-fee schemes, and that there needed to be a solid evidence base. Severe fee cuts are envisaged not only in the areas of legal aid in which the budget is still increasing, such as in Crown court cases and care proceedings, but across the board in virtually all areas of the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/17">The legal aid system is being put at risk even though significant parts of it appear to be operating acceptably and to budget. A wholesale and rushed change to the system is not needed, especially given that the Government have failed to assess the real risk of the reform plans to legal aid clients. The Committee has therefore called for the introduction of the new fee schemes for the short transitional period to be halted. Here is the problem: the dangers of the fixed fee schemes have caused such alarm that they have distracted attention from the main feature of the reform that the Government propose, which is a move to competitive tendering for block contracts for legal aid work.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/18">The Committee was astonished by the lack of concrete plans for the tendering process. There are well-known problems with competitive tendering, such as &quot;winner's curse&quot;, when the winning bidder bids at an uneconomically low rate and cannot fulfil their contract. Those who travel on the east coast main line will be familiar with that problem, which happened to GNER. It could perfectly well happen in the legal services sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/19">Another issue is whether there will be an adequate supplier base, especially after the fixed fees period. If that period goes ahead, who will be left at the end of it to compete in the tendering process? Who will be left at the second round of competitive tendering? There is a real danger that there will not be sufficient suppliers to make the second round a process of competitive tendering in any realistic way. We quoted the evidence of Professor Cape, who called the introduction of competitive tendering without proper piloting &quot;reckless&quot;. We thought that competitive tendering should not be rolled out nationally, even in a phased manner, without such a pilot.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/20">The Government's response to our report, issued on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>, was disappointing. None of the Committee's hard-and-fast recommendations seem to have been taken on board. The fixed, graduated fee schemes for the transitional period are to go ahead in all areas of legal aid, and no significant changes were made to the structure of the fee schemes in terms of graduation or to reflect the differing work costs across the country. There is to be no proper piloting of best-value tendering and no detailed analysis of the cost drivers in the legal aid budget to inform the current or future reforms. In short, the Government have failed to address the main flaws in their reform proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/21">There have been some improvements to the previous proposals, such as the phasing in of the new private law family fee scheme, with level 3 and 4 fees coming into force at a later date than levels 1 and 2, which come into force in October, but those improvements do not change the overall picture. The most recent fee schemes and consultations published by the LSC at the end of June and the beginning of this month vindicate the Committee's concerns. For example, one of the Committee's main criticisms of the Government and the LSC was the lack of data on which the fee schemes for the transitional period were modelled. This spring, the LSC announced a change to its initial plans to reform the arrangements for the allocation of police station slots for criminal legal aid suppliers. Because of what it described as &quot;data integrity issues&quot;&mdash;a wonderful-sounding euphemism&mdash;the initial proposals were stopped and the LSC re-consulted, asking suppliers to provide it with more and accurate data on which further models could be based. Similarly, it had to delay a crucial decision on the introduction of minimum contract sizes for police station and magistrates court work in order to refine its data.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/22">The most striking example is the new consultation paper on the litigators graduated fee scheme for Crown court defence work. The LSC acknowledges that certain complicating factors, such as a client being a non-English speaker, would increase the amount of work in a defence case, but it admits to not holding enough data to quantify the increase in work load. It concluded that it was not able to model, with certainty, an appropriate uplift for such complicated cases. In the light of that recognition and the apparent difficulties with modelling the level three fees for the private law family fee scheme, I wonder how the LSC will ever be able to identify the appropriate value for money for pieces of legal aid work, if not through crude cost averaging. Of course, some delay is justified when it is used to collate and apply better and more reliable data, but that should have taken place before fee schemes were published or, in the case of police station slot allocation, before firms engaged in re-organising their duty solicitor working practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/23">Another example of the undue haste with which the Government are pushing ahead with the reform proposals is the very short consultation period for the Crown court litigators graduated fee scheme, one of the most central planks in the Carter reform armoury. Consultees were issued with a 91-page consultation paper, replete with data and models, given two online calculators and asked to feed back their experience with these mock calculations to the LSC. Only six weeks were allowed for that time-consuming exercise for Crown court defence solicitors. General Government consultation guidance provides for a three-month consultation period, but the LSC is resorting to the pretext of these schemes having been the subject of a previous consultation: the one following the Carter report. Why is the LSC not allowing providers more time to calculate the fee models and come up with a sensible, well-tested response?</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/24">All that reinforces the suspicion that the current reform plan, especially in respect of the transition period with its Government-set fixed and graduated fee levels, is not a carefully-planned, well-thought-out step based on diligent analysis of extensive and reliable data, but a rushed attempt to save money at all costs in a short period of time. The Government partly acknowledge that, saying in their response that they intend to</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/25" class="indent">&quot;tackle known cost drivers as a matter of urgency&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/26">and that they need</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/27" class="indent">&quot;to act decisively if reductions to scope and eligibility&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/28">for legal aid&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/29" class="indent">&quot; are to be averted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/30">So, there is a sense and rush and urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/31">Reforms carrying significant risks to the provision of quality legal aid in the near future should not be implemented in this way, without proper reflection and without a solid basis of evidence and piloting. It sounds like a Treasury-driven approach is being taken, and it may be highly damaging to our legal aid system. Along with it has gone something that we were very concerned about: a breakdown in relations between the LSC and the professions and the not-for-profit providers, who are also important in this area. Citizens Advice has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/32" class="indent">&quot;We hope that members will support Citizens Advice in urging the Ministry of Justice and the Legal Services Commission to initiate a consultative process involving all stakeholders in the design of a pilot tender process, supported by robust research on demand and delivery cost drivers.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/33">Some of the damage has already been done. Many people have given us evidence&mdash;right up until this morning&mdash;of what is happening. The Association of Major Criminal Law Firms sent me some information this morning, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/34" class="indent">&quot;Over 80 per cent. of our member firms are contemplating taking or have already taken steps to make staff redundant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/35">Large firms have indicated that they are going to &quot;leave the market&quot; and others have indicated that they have &quot;no interest&quot; in taking on the work that those firms are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/36">It is not too late to make a change, even though some damage has been done. As was indicated at the beginning of the debate, an opportunity exists; some legal action may be taking place and we have a new Minister, whom I have congratulated on her appointment. She has an opportunity to take a new look. Any new Minister coming into office would expect to check carefully whether matters already in hand really do fit with the Government's wider social objectives. In their present form, these proposals cannot be matched to the Prime Minister's declared objectives for a fairer society. I hope that the Minister will examine the proposals carefully and follow some of our guidance on ways in which not only could they be mitigated, but we could proceed to a much more carefully thought-out second stage without the damage of the transitional fee scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.495.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on any matter, but especially on this one, as he chaired the Committee sitting that examined this important area of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/2">Mr. Martlew, you told me that we should be brief. I can be brief, because I agree with everything that the right hon. Gentleman has said. I am happy to support it, because he speaks with the authority of someone who, like myself and other members of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the Committee such as my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase>, took evidence from a wide range of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/3">The worst witness by far was Lord Carter. I cannot understand the Government's love affair with Lord Carter; with legal aid having been completely messed up and firms having been driven into legal action against the Government, they have decided to appoint him to examine the Prison Service. Goodness knows what will happen to that after Lord Carter finishes his report, because, to quote Catherine Tate, in our dealings he was just &quot;not bothered&quot;. He came along having not done any analysis of the impact that his proposals were going to have on legal aid firms, he had no understanding of the legal profession, he did not understand what running a legal practice that had to rely on legal aid was all about, and he just shrugged his shoulders when he was asked questions of fact. On the basis of that kind of demeanour, this report has been produced.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/4">I hope that having heard what the right hon. Gentleman has said, having read the Committee's deliberations and noted the way in which witnesses gave evidence, the new Minister will step back, carefully examine what has been proposed and take the pause that the professions, consumers and Members of Parliament have requested, so that this area can be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/5">I believe that 157 right hon. and hon. Members have signed my early-day motion on legal aid reform. Five key early-day motions are before the House: early-day motions 537, 738, 493, 1303 and 1475. Let us consider the collective voice of right hon. and hon. Members from across the House. A total of 264 have signed one or other of those early-day motions. Judging by the nods of Opposition members, it is clear that the Committee's report, which was unanimous, has the support of Members from both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/6">I congratulate the Minister on her appointment to one of the most exciting Departments in Whitehall. Its new and wide brief means that it is so easy to lose sight of a core responsibility such as legal aid. I am delighted that she has got it because she has proved in her ministerial career that she is able to master a brief quickly and to think carefully&mdash;and one hopes independently&mdash;once evidence is put before her. I hope that she will not just read out what civil servants have prepared for her predecessor, because we were not impressed by what was said by her predecessor on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/7">I know that since the Minister was given this job by the Prime Minister she has not had the opportunity to visit a legal aid firm. I believe that she has also not had a chance to talk to the Law Society and the Bar Council about this matter, although I might be wrong about that. That is one of the first thing that a new Minister does when they take office in Selborne house, and I hope that she will take the opportunity to have such discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">My hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> and I were on our way to see the previous Lord Chancellor to discuss these very issues a couple of days before the reshuffle. As a result of diary problems&mdash;I believe that he had to deal with overcrowding in prisons&mdash;and because we were delayed on other matters, we did not manage to meet him. We were looking forward to meeting him. He is strongly committed to the community legal service, and I think that he would have paused and considered carefully what we have had to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/9">I am sure that the current Lord Chancellor is in exactly the same position, because once he examines the evidence&mdash;I am sure that we can provide evidence of how the proposals will affect firms in Blackburn&mdash;he will know the effect that the proposals will have on the legal aid service in this country. He will also know they will affect the basic tenet of what this Government have tried to do over the past 10 years: to create the seamless community legal service. That was the intention when we took office in 1997. If legal aid is subject to this review and if it is implemented and these reforms take effect, the seamless community legal service will be fractured forever.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.0/10">The disproportionate effect that that will have on ethnic minority firms&mdash;my hon. Friend and I have raised this point on many occasions, both in the House and in meetings with Ministers&mdash;will destroy the ethnic minority base of the provision of legal services in this country. Our representations to a number of Ministers, the evidence that we have seen, and our conversations with black, Asian and Chinese solicitors suggest that the entire ethnic minority community will be forced to give up this work and to merge into bigger firms. They will lose their identity and their unique ability to communicate effectively with their specialist client base. That is why they have gone to court. It is not a welcome start for the new and strong ministerial team to have to cope with the Lord Chancellor facing action over a decision concerning legal aid. However, I am glad that they have done so, and if I can help in any way in supporting their legal action, I will because the case has been made and it must be prosecuted in the courts.</p>

	<p pid="a.497.0/1">It is a pleasure to stand here again to talk about an issue on which I introduced a debate with the previous Minister just last month. Unlike the Minister here and many other hon. Members, I am not a lawyer or an expert on the intricacies of legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/2">My interest in the matter began when I was contacted by constituents who work for criminal legal aid practices in Hull. They told me that, like so many others around the country, they were desperately worried about the Carter proposals and their impact on businesses and, more importantly, on the vulnerable clients with whom they deal daily. I promised to look into the proposals and to question the Government on their behalf. That culminated in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-12">12 June</phrase>, and I wish to return to several of the points raised in that debate, because my constituents were not happy with the then Minister's response.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.0/3">I congratulate the new Minister on her post and I understand that she has been a legal aid solicitor, which is extremely welcome. I hope that she will have a better understanding of the matter than her predecessor. It seems that the bigger the error made by Ministers, the higher the office that immediately results.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-12a.497.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="497"  time="015:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070712/halltext/70712h0002.htm#07071271000372">
	<p pid="a.497.2/1">Perhaps self-confidence and even occasional arrogance are seen more often in barristers than in solicitors. I say for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the benefit of my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase>, that that applies in only a minority of cases. We are asking the Minister to reconsider the matter calmly and coolly. We hope that she will take that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/2">If the suggestion that super-casinos in poorer areas of a major city are a means of regeneration can be reconsidered, surely the suggestion of marketisation, without pilot, without practice and without evidence, of something that affects the most vulnerable people in our society can also be reconsidered. I hope that the Minister will have the courage and self-confidence to do so. A solicitor in Hull wrote to me saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/3" class="indent">&quot;Civil liberty and freedom are illusory concepts if you cannot afford legal representation to defend them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/4">That is why so many hon. Members are in the Chamber today.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/5">Eight firms in Kingston upon Hull undertake publicly funded criminal defence work. They have historically covered towns in the East Riding, such as Beverley, Bridlington, Goole, Driffield, Hornsea and Withernsea. As a result, more than 8,000 East Riding residents received help through legal aid in 2006. Their united opposition to the Carter proposals stems from the fact that the Government have designated 16 urban areas in which solicitors can no longer charge for travel and waiting time. Hull has been declared an urban area, although, oddly, Norwich, Middlesbrough and Doncaster, have not. That has had an impact on out-of-town courts, such as Beverley</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/6">It is worth making the point that criminal legal aid solicitors are not in a highly paid area of the law. People who enter that sort of work do not do so because they seek riches; they do so because they want to put their legal skills to work to help some of the most vulnerable people in our society. However, they expect to be able to make a living and to sustain their practices. The diversity of supply may be confusing for the Government and perhaps for civil servants. There is complexity all over the country: different areas have different sorts of practices and different specialties are provided in different ways, but that organic system works and has provided stable costs. Many hon. Members cannot understand why the one area of legal aid work where costs have not exploded, is the very area in which the Government are smashing through change and putting at risk good practice provided in a stable, cost-controlled way. That is a question for the Minister to respond to.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/7">The firms in Hull went on strike&mdash;they were hardly minded to do that&mdash;but when that got them nowhere, they announced that they would no longer provide duty solicitor services for courts based outside Hull or take on new cases. That came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-16">16 April 2007</phrase>. The firms decided that it did not make economic sense to do such work, despite the fact that it constituted 20 per cent. of their business. The decision had a major impact on their businesses, but they could not afford to do the work. They are not high-earning individuals charging the vast hourly rates that perhaps the former Minister was able to charge as a barrister. The firms decided that they could not go to Beverley, Driffield or Bridlington, and that was not an easy decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/8">The Minister disputed the figure that the firms concerned would lose 20 per cent. of their income, but the Legal Services Commission admitted that Hull firms were expected to take on the same work load as last year, but for &pound;30,000 less. The previous Minister in the earlier debate tried to make out that those solicitors had pay rises, but, on the contrary, they lost business and were expected to do the same work for &pound;30,000 less when they already had low margins.</p>
	<p pid="a.497.2/9">That decision meant that there was potentially no legal aid provision at Beverley magistrates court in my constituency. The Legal Services Commission, after a short spell using the public offender service in Darlington at heaven knows what cost, arranged for three firms&mdash;one from Bridlington and two from Scarborough&mdash;to be used. Those firms are now being paid to travel and wait, at a cost of &pound;26 per hour to the taxpayer. When one considers that a case programmed for an 11 o'clock start at Beverley may often not start until 2 pm, we are talking about a significant amount of waiting time. If Hull solicitors come out&mdash;the previous Minister attacked them aggressively during the earlier debate&mdash;they are expected to sit unpaid in a courtroom while another set of solicitors is paid for waiting and the inevitable delays. Surely it is madness for firms to be brought in from further afield when local firms are willing to do the work.</p>

	<p pid="a.508.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>, as chairman of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, and all the members of the Committee on producing a detailed, common-sense report.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/2">I welcome the Minister to her new post and I hope that she took volume II, in particular, to bed with her as bedside reading. Anyone who has read all the details of the evidence that was given by people who know what they are talking about&mdash;I am not a lawyer, so I will not profess to have the detailed expertise of many of those people&mdash;can see that the Government response to that well-documented, detailed report is wrong and almost disgraceful. I am disappointed, too, that although a few minor changes were accepted and made, the report did virtually nothing to make the fundamental changes that would have made a difference. Fundamentally, nothing has changed about the underlying flaw in the way in which the fixed fee system will affect the most vulnerable in our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/3">We have heard a lot today about rural areas, but I want to point out&mdash;as I and many other London MPs did in an Adjournment debate on the same topic in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-11">11 January</phrase>&mdash;the particular difficulties and issues in London. We asked the Minister then to consider London in a different way. I looked back on that speech and read the whole debate, and I remember that we went away hoping that there would be some changes in the light of the fact that Members from all parties expressed concerns about the changes and the way in which they were being implemented. We felt that some changes would be made and that the Government would listen. We then saw this report and that little had been changed as a result of it. It has led not only the legal profession but many MPs to question who is ultimately supposed to make such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/4">I am distressed to discover that as an MP for an inner-city seat, where I rely so much on the valuable work done by my law centre and the many solicitors' firms that work in legal aid, I will end up representing people who will be affected by these changes without having had a chance, in our democracy, to make my views known through a vote. That is wrong, no matter what the rules are about the Legal Services Commission and its being a quango. Ultimately, Parliament should decide on the matter, but it has not had the opportunity to debate and vote on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/5">The Minister's boss, the new Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, comes from a background that leads him to know a great deal about inner-city areas and the particular and special nature of their multifaceted problems: people with concerns and issues that need legal advice and aid are linked to people with mental health problems, immigration problems and housing problems, which lead to all sorts of other problems. Those are the sort of people who will suffer in inner-city areas such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/6">I want the Minister to tell us, in particular on the question of London and other inner-city areas, whether she thinks, having listened to what everyone has said and having read the report, that she can be absolutely confident that the changes will not affect the most vulnerable. I certainly think that they will and I know that the people who have the experience in my constituency think that they will.</p>
	<p pid="a.508.0/7">Let me repeat what I said in January about the overall legal aid budget. Of course, more money has gone into legal aid. Although a few people laughed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> is right. There are some 3,000 more offences. Many of the people involved in those criminal offences have also been caught up in the net of some of the other issues to do with immigration and mental health problems. Of course that has led to more demand for legal aid. Legal aid solicitors are not being paid more and making huge amounts of money. There is more work&mdash;we know that from our surgeries. There is more work, and that relates specifically to some of the changes in the law and the Human Rights Act. It does not mean that we are against the Human Rights Act if we simply point out that it has led to more cases.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-12a.510.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="510"  time="016:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070712/halltext/70712h0004.htm#07071271000395">
	<p pid="a.510.1/1">I will be brief, because I want to ensure that everybody gets in. The attendance here, the volume of correspondence and the briefings that we have had indicate just how much of a crisis currently surrounds legal aid. Crucially, the issue is access to justice for the very poorest and most vulnerable people in our society. The comments of each Member who has spoken have reflected that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/2">I start from the point of view that if we deny people access to justice because they cannot get legal aid, and if they do not get a fair hearing in divorce, immigration, housing or criminal cases, we are effectively saying that they are not good enough to get any kind of justice. If we believe that the law is there to bring about justice and should have some degree of equality in its operation, we must be prepared as a society to spend a great deal of money on legal aid to ensure equality of representation when a case finally gets to court.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/3">I represent an inner-city London constituency, which, like those of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1897" name="Kate Hoey">my hon. Friends the Members for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase>, for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) and for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), has the perverse characteristics of fantastically fast-rising house, land and business prices, very high costs of running any business and an increasing sense of isolation and deprivation among many people. In the midst of all that, legal aid firms face a combination of factors. One is lower income, another is greater demand on them and yet another the people who end up in our advice bureaux. I was doing an advice bureau this morning for people with really serious problems. I am sure that all Members do this: we ask someone in an immigration case who their solicitor is and they say, &quot;Haven't got one. Don't know where to get one. What can I do about it?&quot; I sometimes then start ringing round local solicitors to get them to take cases on. It is not the function of an MP to go round finding solicitors for people&mdash;it ought to be a relatively simple process.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/4">I would be grateful if the Minister considered in her reply the related issue of access to the advice that goes with legal aid. She can write to me on it if she prefers. I find that people increasingly get into all kinds of serious legal problems on housing, immigration, divorce and so on because they do not have adequate access to basic advice in the first place. Funding for people's rights groups, citizens advice bureaux or whatever there happens to be in a given locality is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/5">The Select Committee described well in its report a lot of the issues involved. Its points should be read carefully, such as the one that it was breathtakingly risky to go ahead with the reforms. I took part in the debate in this Chamber a few months ago, and in today's debate there is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu plus. We are all making more or less the same speeches, but we are six months further on and have the experience of what has happened in our communities as a result of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/6">I shall quote from a letter that I have received from Islington Law Centre, which shows one of the reasons why legal aid is at crisis point. The letter urges me to get involved in the debate, which I am happy to do. The law centre is very good and the people there work incredibly hard. Nobody there is particularly well paid and they are totally dedicated, just like most legal aid solicitors all over the place. I do not draw a distinction between somebody who works in a law centre and somebody who works in a legal aid firm&mdash;they usually have an equal commitment to the community. The issue of funding is serious, and the letter states:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/7" class="indent">&quot;While general inflation has risen by 43 per cent. since 1993, legal aid rates have been increased by less than 10 per cent.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/8">Ruth Hayes, who wrote the letter, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I started work at the Law Centre in 2001, and we have received an inflationary increase in our legal aid rate only once since I have been here&mdash;5 years ago. As we have not received an inflationary increase from any of our other funders, it is a massive struggle every year to maintain our services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/10">I know that, because I ring up the staff to ask them to see people who cannot get a lawyer anywhere else, and they have a problem dealing with such cases. It is up to Parliament to do something about that, and I hope that the Government are listening to such concerns and understanding them.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/11">I have a letter from another firm, which is quite well known and not local to me. It points out:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/12" class="indent">&quot;As things stand we have already taken steps to shed staff in our Housing, Community Care, Family (including Children cases) and Mental Health Departments.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/13">That is the story for legal aid firms across London. The big firms that do a proportion of legal aid cases are continuing to do so only because they can cross-subsidise within the firm&mdash;not because there is sufficient funding but because they can afford to. However, I have a number of legal aid solicitors' firms in my constituency, as I am sure colleagues do, in which sometimes as much as 90 per cent. of the work is on legal aid. If the cuts go on, they will have to close down and we will lose the benefit of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/14">After the last debate, I took the opportunity of writing to every solicitor's practice in my constituency. I sent them a questionnaire and asked them to outline what they did, whether they had signed the new contract, what they thought the effect would be on their clients and whether they would be prepared to take part in a repeat exercise in a few months' time. Many companies replied. All of those that replied had signed the contract, but they pointed out that they had been unwilling to do so, it was done at the point of a gun and so on. They did not do so willingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/15">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase>, Deighton Guedalla and Company replied to my questionnaire. I asked what the effect of the new regime was likely to be on finances, training and so on, and the company replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Effect is likely to be adverse, and is already felt as such in terms of uncertainty which makes future planning almost impossible. We are uncertain whether and for how long we can survive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/17">Deighton Guedalla is a good, effective local company. I could read out all the survey reports, because they say much the same kind of thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/18">Colleagues may have done similar surveys of local firms in their constituency. I have a quote from Islington Peoples Rights, which is a very effective, popular voluntary organisation. It has a legal aid contract. My questionnaire asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/19" class="indent">&quot;What is likely to be the effect on your clients?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/20">The reply was:</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Lack of support to enforce their rights, financial exclusion, further marginalised communities, negative effects on improving child poverty.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/22">There are so many more responses like that one.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/23">I had a letter from a local legal aid solicitor, Greg Foxsmith, who referred to a meeting of legal aid lawyers that he had attended the day before in Conway Hall, at which it was said that allegations about the top 10 high-earning barristers had been used to an absurd degree by the media and others who go on and on about the gravy train for fat-cat lawyers. I do not doubt that there are fat-cat lawyers. I do not doubt that those who represent the Beckhams and other such people in this world probably make a lot of money. There is a difference between the world of the rich and the famous for being famous&mdash;those who are famous because of their barrister&mdash;and the reality of life for ordinary people who we have been sent to Parliament to represent. I wish that we could separate the two and seriously review the consequences of the changes that have been introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/24">Access to Justice Alliance set out a good summary of the issue. It asked, what is the point of legal aid, and said that it was the supply of advice, accessibility of legal aid services to all ethnic groups, local networks of organisations that provide help and support to vulnerable people, and quality of advice.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/25">Given that good advice and those sound points, it is important that the Government recognise that the Carter review came along, there were warnings about problems, and problems occurred. There was a debate in this very Chamber when prescient warnings were given. The Select Committee published a report&mdash;and a very good report it is, too&mdash;and here we are again, having another debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/26">We have a new Minister. I compliment her and congratulate her on her appointment. She has a real chance to do something about the situation by listening to those who work day to day in this field, by understanding the problems that they face, and by understanding that, in the present atmosphere, the reality is that the people who are being short-changed and treated the worst are those who have already been short-changed and treated the worst by society as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/27">If we are here for justice, we must ensure equality of access to justice. That is what I want. That is why I ask the Minister to think seriously about the Government's response to the Select Committee report, and to give us some hope when she replies that there will be a rethink on the contract and the funding, and on accessibility to advice services in constituencies and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/28">I shall conclude with this point. I have represented Islington, North since 1983. When I was first elected, the borough had three law centres, two citizens advice bureaux, a large number of community advice organisations and an effective welfare rights organisation run by the local authority. In other words, many people could get access to advice. Therefore, benefit take-up rates and all the other things that go with that were high.</p>
	<p pid="a.510.1/29">The borough now has one law centre, no citizens advice bureau&mdash;the last one just closed&mdash;Islington Peoples Rights, which does its best but is flooded by demand, and legal aid solicitors who do their best. I suspect that many people, particularly those whose first language is not English, have no access to any advice or the benefits that would come if they were to get advice, and no access to legal aid because of the shortage of legal aid provision. It is up to us, as Labour Government Members, to ensure that those people in our society do not go under-represented and short-changed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-12a.524.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" speakername="David Howarth" colnum="524"  time="017:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070712/halltext/70712h0006.htm#07071271000418">
	<p pid="a.524.0/1">This has been a remarkably powerful debate&mdash;I include the previous speech in that comment&mdash;which has had a clear message. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1953" name="Hugh Bayley">The hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> is perhaps the exception in that regard, but it was noticeable that even he was not agreeing with the Government's proposal. He was putting forward a different set of proposals which, admittedly, would not go far. I doubt whether he has worked out how much money would be raised by his cap, but I suspect that it would be only 1 to 2 per cent. of the budget. Nevertheless, he was not supporting the Government's ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/2">I served on the Select Committee during the writing of this report. Technically, I still serve on it, although I am in the process of extricating myself. I voted for the report and agree with every word of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the speech made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/3">Many hon. Members have mentioned the key thing: going back to the purposes of legal aid. Its main purpose is to allow people to vindicate their rights. I am talking about those who would otherwise not be able to do so because of their lack of funds. I believe that that is central to the whole idea of legal aid; otherwise we would spend our time in this place passing laws that would be meaningless. I think that one hon. Member said that civil liberties and all the welfare rights that we can think of would be illusory if people could not enforce those rights in the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/4">The second theme of legal aid is equality and to ensure that people are not put at serious disadvantage in the courts because they are poor. That is a fundamental principle that we should fight for. It applies in housing law, social welfare law, immigration law and, above all, criminal law where criminal defendants face the states' might and resources. Criminal defendants are perhaps the most unpopular group of people, and the civilisation of society can be measured by the extent to which it sticks up for the principle that criminal defendants, no matter how unpopular, deserve a fair trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/5">The Government's concerns are budgetary. There is no doubt about that. One of the odd background facts is that the budget would seem to most people to be demand-led&mdash;the number of people who need legal aid, especially in the criminal law, is the number of people who are brought before the courts. That is completely outside the control of those in the legal aid sector. A budget that is largely demand-led is counted by the Treasury as not being demand-led, but as part of the departmental expenditure limits, so unlike other demand-led budgets&mdash;for example, benefits&mdash;the Department must keep within annual spending limits even when it has no control over the calls on that budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/6">The overall cost of legal aid has risen sharply since the late 1990s, although more recently the budget has fallen back slightly. The Committee stresses in its report, as I want to do today, that the Government do not know and the Committee could not find out why that has happened. We know what is not a problem. The community legal service is not a problem, because it is rising by only around 0.7 per cent. a year. We know that it has nothing to do with the lower criminal court defence services because payments in that area and the magistrates courts are falling. There is an increase in payments for police station attendances, but almost all of that is explained by the increase in the number of people arrested.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/7">The problem seems to be in three places: first, in the higher criminal courts&mdash;the Crown court and above&mdash;where the cost per case is indeed rising; secondly in child care proceedings, as many hon. Members said; and thirdly, in the administrative costs of the Legal Services Commission. Little is understood about any of those three. There is speculation about the place of expert witness fees in child care proceedings, delays caused by other organisations in the system, and ideas in the system about degrees of certainty that cannot be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/8">No one knows for sure the causes of the increases, and it is reckless&mdash;the Committee used that word&mdash;to go forward with the changes without understanding the real reasons for the budgetary problem. The Government's solution is that if they cannot do anything about the case load, they can only reduce the spend per case. Everyone recognises that the danger of reducing the spend per case without understanding the causes is that quality of advice and representation will be reduced. The essence of the Committee's criticism and my criticism is that the Government have not gone about the task rationally. They have not tried to discover the cause of the budgetary problem and to deal with it; they have simply adopted an across-the-board solution as a quick fix.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/9">That quick fix is the average fixed fee system, and the idea is that firms and providers will absorb all the risks of variation in costs. There are two big variations in the cost of cases. One is the complexity of the case and lawyers' ability to deal with it. The other is the needs and requirements of the clients: their need for interpretation and translation, and so on. All the variations in those complexities, both legal and concerning the client, are borne by the providers under the fixed-fee system. The Government say that that does not matter because the fees will average out, but firms must bear the risk of that averaging out.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/10">There are three big problems. One is cherry-picking. Providers may take on only the cases that they can deal with within the fixed fee and let the others go. We know from other attempts at out-sourcing that that happens. The Government say that they will deal with that with the contract, and that the contract will provide a sign, but how will they know when there is cherry-picking? They will have no way of knowing. If they threaten to take contracts away, they will have to give them to another firm, or the threat will be empty. If, as we suspect, an effect of the system will be to wipe out vast swathes of other providers, there will be no alternative provider to give the contract to.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/11">The second problem with fixed fees is that it undermines the possibility of firms specialising by the complexity of the case or special needs of the clients. That is precisely what lies behind the problem of black and minority ethnic firms and the problem of clients with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/12">The third problem is that fixed fees undermine choice. A fundamental question for people who are represented is, &quot;Can I trust this lawyer?&quot; What happens if someone has been represented by a lawyer previously, had a bad experience, and wants to go to a different lawyer? The system undermines the possibility of finding a different lawyer.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/13">We have been told that the fixed fee system is necessary as a precursor to best-value contracting, but that argument does not work in its own terms. The benchmark applies only to the Government because they need to know what price they will offer. It does not help bidders, except as a general guide to what prices might be, but the Government can tell them that without setting up fixed fees. It is entirely unclear how the best-value contracting system will work, and that was the basis for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the comments by the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase>. The Government should think about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/14">The real problem is that if the contracting system is just an average, fixed fee with a bit of competition, which is what I think is intended, it will have exactly the same problems as the average fixed fee. It will cause cherry-picking, will undermine choice and make it impossible for firms to specialise by the complexity of the case or the complexity of their clients' needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/15">What is the way forward? I think it is to do nothing until the exact nature of the problem has been grasped. It might lie in the Treasury, not in the Department or the world, because of the way in which the Treasury deals with this budget. The Government should abandon the average-fixed-fee system at this stage. It is not needed as an interim measure and will be deeply damaging. Finally, they should rethink the best-value contracting system so that it does not merely reproduce the problems of the average fixed fee with a bit of competition added in.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/16">There is no ultimate solution to the problem of guaranteeing quality in public services; we can try different solutions at different times. The solution with the widest degree of support, however, is the idea of graduated fees, although it must be combined with a sophisticated system of quality assurance. One of the problems in the way that the Government have set about their task is in trying to simplify and make savings in the quality assurance system. The Chairman of the Committee said that that resulted in a minimum requirement, rather than a guide to the complexity of an individual case or of client needs. A graduated fee system with sophisticated quality control, on the other hand, could work.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/17">There is even a way of combining graduated fees with competition, which, as a former council leader, the hon. Member for Southampton, Test will probably recall. It was the method that was in use at the time of the schedule of rates contracts. For the reasons that he mentioned, that is probably not the way to go, but it would still be better than anything that the Government are suggesting.</p>
	<p pid="a.524.0/18">My impression is that, in the minds of the press and of some Ministers, legal aid has been seen as an obstacle to be swept aside using press releases about fat cat lawyers and so on. In reality, it is about modestly paid lawyers trying to vindicate the rights of their even more modestly paid clients. I urge the Government to think again.</p>

	<p pid="a.528.1/1">I shall not, because the hon. Gentleman said that the very top Queen's counsel should not be available to represent the poorest in the community, which is flawed logic. He spoke about contracting out to non-profit-making organisations that have the interests of their clients at heart, but I can tell him that every single law firm, citizens advice bureau and individual who has been involved in the debate on this topic has that interest at heart.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/2">We all recognise that, with the legal aid budget rising very quickly, action was needed. However, the Government should be targeting the areas in which costs actually are rising. Spending on civil legal aid has fallen by 24 per cent. in real terms since 1997, and there are many other areas of legal aid in which costs are either under control or falling. The budget for criminal legal aid has indeed increased but, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1541" name="Geoffrey Cox">my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr. Cox)</phrase> said, with all the extra offences that have been created, and with court procedures becoming more complicated, that is not surprising. There are a number of problems within the court system itself as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/3">One should think carefully about the argument put forward by people in some circles that solicitors are causing the problem by taking too much money. Legal aid payments to solicitors have been static for quite some time. The last pay increase for criminal legal aid was in 2001. Civil practitioners received just one rise&mdash;of 2.5 per cent.&mdash;in 2004, and there were no increases in 1993, 1994, 1997, 1998, 1999 or 2000. Even before the changes are introduced, the number of offices with civil legal aid contracts has already fallen from 4,301 in March 2004 to 3,500 in March 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/4">The debate needs to be seen in context. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">The hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> observed that there is a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu about it, and I agree. I welcome the new Minister to her post. However, the last time we had a debate on this subject, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-11">11 January</phrase>, I thought that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the then Minister, the hon. and learned Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>, was very complacent. We debated the consequences that we predicted would flow from the changes, and we were told that we were scaremongering and over-egging the pudding.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/5">In fact, very serious patterns have emerged since that debate. The previous Minister said that everything was okay because a lot of firms had signed the contract and therefore everything was rosy. However, I have received dozens of letters from solicitors' firms that signed the contract under what they felt to be duress. I shall quote just one example from a firm in SE20, which is probably in the constituency of Bromley and Chislehurst. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/6" class="indent">&quot;As a firm, we did not want to sign the new Civil Legal Aid Contract. It is manifestly unfair in as much as the Legal Services Commission can change it on very little notice and even put us out of business on six months' notice without committing any offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/7" class="indent">At the last moment we signed the Contract when it was apparent that our brethren were not going to hold their nerve and refuse to sign. We could not commit suicide then and there without a further review of our options.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/8">It goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I anticipate that, having made alternative arrangements for the structuring of our firm, this firm will be withdrawing from publicly funded family work later this year&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/10">The figures that were issued by the Law Society in January mentioned its survey of members. The figures indicated that 82 per cent. of family practitioners believed that their firm would be less likely to undertake publicly funded work in future, 78 per cent. of mental health practitioners were considering whether to continue to represent publicly funded clients, and 74 per cent. of immigration practitioners said that their firms were less likely to undertake legal aid work. The staggering figure of 95 per cent. of civil legal aid practitioners believed that the proposed fixed fees would make their work non-viable.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/11">Events have moved on. The Housing Law Practitioners Association survey, which is far more recent, says that 82 per cent. of respondents were opposed to the introduction of a national fixed fee, 65 per cent. expected their income to decrease by more than 10 per cent., 38 per cent. expected their income to decrease by more than 25 per cent., and 96 per cent. said that the proposals would produce a disincentive to undertake more complex cases or assist the most vulnerable. That is obviously what is happening now, and the Minister ought to recognise it and consider events as they are now.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/12">I went to see a firm in East Anglia the other day, and I sat down with its practitioners, who told me about the dilemma that they face. Some of the partners in the firm were doing a substantial amount of commercial work, and they were making a great deal of money. The other partners were doing legal aid, criminal and civil work, and they were being heavily cross-subsidised by the partners who were earning substantial amounts of money. Those other partners told me that, in all consciousness, they could not consider going on and on with the publicly funded legal aid work, because of the contrast in partners' earnings. The firm said that it would carry on for the time being until those other partners retired, but that it would almost certainly not take on any new legal aid lawyers. As we know, many other firms are pulling out, and there will be a great deal of consolidation.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/13">In the Otterburn report, which the Department commissioned, Mr. Otterburn made it quite clear that big does not necessarily mean more efficient. In some sectors of the economy, big may be more efficient, but he came up with some valuable and compelling evidence to show that, with the extra overheads that large firms must carry, they do not necessarily offer the Department better value for money in publicly funded work.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/14">The comments made by my hon. and learned Friend were pertinent. There will be legal aid deserts. There is no question but that in the small market towns in East Anglia, there will be a significant contraction in the number of firms supplying legal aid to my constituents and to those of my numerous neighbours in such sparsely populated parts of the country. People will have to travel much further; that is the pattern emerging in many places.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">My hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> once again went through the extraordinary example that affects his constituency. I hope very much that the Minister will respond adequately to his points, because the previous Minister did not respond properly to the concerns that the firms in my hon. Friend's constituency expressed. The time has come for the Minister to get a grip of that situation and give my hon. Friend a proper answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.528.1/16"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">The hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> spoke passionately about black and minority ethnic practices. There is no question but that they will be disproportionately disadvantaged by the Government's proposals. It is well known that in many large cities, small firms and black and minority ethnic firms are over-represented among criminal legal aid contractors, and the hon. Lady is right that many people from ethnic minorities feel more comfortable going to a business that is run by people from their community. I thought that the Government were in favour of trying to further social mobility and to help young people who want to set up in business and serve their community. I have seen people from the black and minority ethnic communities who have gone into business against considerable odds and with little support from their families. They have struggled to finance their way through college, often setting up set as single practitioners or as partners in a small business.</p>
