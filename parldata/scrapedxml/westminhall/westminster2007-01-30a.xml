<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.1.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1638" speakername="Peter Lilley" colnum="1"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0001.htm#07013038000502">
	<p pid="a.1.2/1">It is a privilege to open the debate, and I express my gratitude to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase>, for joining me in securing it, as we promised at a big public meeting on housing that covered both our constituencies. This is a key issue throughout Hertfordshire, but nowhere more so than in the city and district of St. Albans and north Hertfordshire district, both of which cover my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/2">The green belt is much loved and needed. I have defended it since my maiden speech, in which I described the contrasting views of different parts of my constituency and remarked that one thing that united the different settlements within it was the desire to remain separated from each other by strips of green belt. That desire remains. Those strips of green belt provide green lungs, access to the country, room to breathe and a sense of different identity. I have always defended the green belt, and for nearly a quarter of a century we have always succeeded in our defence. I have spoken at every public inquiry on proposals to build on the green belt, and we have usually seen off such developments&mdash;until recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/3">We have seen those developments off and been able to build homes and meet targets, so what has changed? A number of things. First, the Government keep raising the targets, and I want the Minister to explain why. Secondly, the way decisions are made has changed. We now have regional planning assemblies such as the East of England authority, which most of us do not recognise and few of us understand, but all of us knows is not directly elected. It is simply a creature of the Government that enables them to divide and rule and say to other representatives&mdash;or appointees&mdash;from Norfolk and Cambridge, &quot;Why don't you vote for more houses in Hertfordshire and Essex? If you don't, we'll plonk them on you.&quot; That change has given the Government the opportunity to steamroller through increased targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/4">There has also been a political resiling from defending the green belt. The first and most serious example of that was when the county council, which was temporarily under Lib-Lab control&mdash;together they had a majority of one&mdash;steamrollered through proposals for the biggest incursion on the green belt that this country has ever seen: the decision to build up to 10,000 houses on the green belt to the west of Stevenage. They had to change the orders of the council to ensure that the majority of one could prevail. It was a pretty sordid process, but it worked. Of course, their proposals were endorsed by the Deputy Prime Minister and given the go-ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/5">There has also been a change in the Government's attitude from the traditional view&mdash;in the words of the Deputy Prime Minister, &quot;We created the green belt and now we're going to build on it&quot;&mdash;to the other meaning of that unintended double entendre. They are now preaching that a green belt can be flexible and that the boundaries can be changed as long as that is compensated for by land elsewhere being reclassified as green belt. That destroys the purpose of the green belt: if it is elastic and plastic rather than firm, rigid and defensible, it ceases to serve any purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/6">If the Minister were given responsibility for defending the list of protected species, would she say, &quot;It doesn't matter if a few of them become extinct, because we can always reclassify the common house sparrow and chaffinch, so the total will not alter.&quot;? That seems to be the Government's view of the green belt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1.2/7">I can no longer say to my constituents, as I have for a couple of decades or more, &quot;Back me, support me, we'll fight and we'll probably win.&quot; I now have to say that the odds are stacked against us because the Government are actively encouraging building on the green belt, not least in my constituency and that of my hon. Friend and neighbour.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.8.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1631" speakername="Mark Prisk" colnum="8"  time="009:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0002.htm#07013038000510">
	<p pid="a.8.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1638" name="Peter Lilley">my right hon. Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr. Lilley)</phrase> on securing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1798" name="Anne Main">the debate, and my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans (Anne Main)</phrase> on her speech. The debate is timely and they have both shown how passionately the issue is debated in our area of Hertfordshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/2">It is important to remember that, with 1 million people, Hertfordshire is already one of the most densely populated shire counties in England. That is the essential context within which any future housing targets should be debated. The Government have published plans for up to 93,200 more houses in Hertfordshire by 2021, including up to 22,000 in my district. In English, that means an extra 200,000 people&mdash;an increase of 20 per cent. in 15 years. The plans are unprecedented in scale and completely out of step with local needs, as my right hon. and hon. Friends have said.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/3">The Government like to claim that people in Hertfordshire, and therefore we as their representatives, oppose all new houses and that we are merely nimbys. As my hon. Friend the Member for St. Albans said, that is complete nonsense and disingenuous. We recognise the need for more homes. Indeed, they are being built in my constituency at a faster rate than in many neighbouring areas including Harlow and north London. However, development must be sustainable, underpinned by funded infrastructure and planned democratically. Sadly, the Government's housing policy fails on all three counts.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/4">Take sustainability. The Government want us to build 12,000 houses in east Hertfordshire, plus at least 10,000 more in the new town that is currently known as Harlow North even though it is in my constituency. The total proposed development in our area represents more than 47,000 extra people&mdash;a 36 per cent. rise in population. It would mean 28,000 more cars on our roads, 300 more pupils in each secondary school and 2,500 more peak-time commuters when our trains are already seriously overcrowded. Environmentally, that scale of development would be disastrous. It would mean the loss of at least 15,000 acres of green belt land, along with several woodlands and the natural habitats of hundreds of wild animals. As any reasonable person can see, that scale of development is completely unsustainable and would prove unworkable in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/5">Ironically, the whole policy is undermined by the Treasury's unwillingness to fund even the most basic infrastructure. When presented with the initial list of key projects for improvements to roads, public transport and, as has been discussed, water and sewerage capacity, the Chancellor refused to fund more than 75 per cent. of them. In other words, the Government want houses for 200,000 people in Hertfordshire, but they are prepared to pay for houses for only 50,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/6">And that is just the most basic of capital projects. Our public services, such as schools and hospitals, are being squeezed, not improved. For example, the Government are closing our hospitals. The Chancellor's cutbacks mean that the proposed new hospital at Hatfield has already been scrapped. In the eastern part of the county, we now face the bitter choice of whether to shut the Lister hospital or the Queen Elizabeth II hospital. My colleagues in the western half of the county face a similar dilemma, because a further hospital is to close there. More people, fewer hospitals&mdash;that seems to be the reality of the Government's housing plans. Perhaps the Minister can tell us in her reply exactly where the proposed 200,000 people are meant to go when they fall ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/7">If the substance of the Government's housing plans is bad, the way in which they have been imposed is even worse. Where there could have been a collaborative effort, we have had ministerial diktat; where there should have been openness, there has been obfuscation. As a result, fewer and fewer private and public organisations support the Government's housing targets. The Environment Agency, for example, described the effect of those targets on the south-east as an &quot;environmental time bomb&quot;. The East of England regional assembly&mdash;the very body charged by Ministers with implementing the regional plan&mdash;has now withdrawn its support because of broken promises about the infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/8">However, the Government's approach to setting housing targets is perhaps best typified by their decision to reinstate the new town in my constituency that I mentioned, and I should like to explain how that particular housing target has been engineered over the past year. Promoted by an oil company's pension fund, the new town would entail the building of up to 20,000 new houses on 3,000 acres of green fields. It would destroy 15,000 acres of green belt land and swallow up the villages of Eastwick, Gilston, Hunsdon and High Wych. When the Government-appointed panel of inspectors considered the proposal in its inquiry last year, it recognised the problems, which included the environmental impact, the distraction from the urgent need to regenerate Harlow, in nearby Essex, the serious water and sewerage capacity problems and the absence of sufficient infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/9">On housing targets, the panel recommended to the Government on <phrase class="date" code="">19 June</phrase> that the new town should expressly not be included in the plan. Some people disagreed; indeed, the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1616" name="Bill Rammell">the hon. Member for Harlow (Bill Rammell)</phrase>, said that it was &quot;unfair&quot; and wanted to</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/10" class="indent">&quot;put an alternative to Government&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/11">Of course, as my right hon. and hon. Friends here know, the Government's planning rules on housing targets preclude that. Planning policy statement 11 states that in the period between the panel's report to the Government and the publication of the Government's response, any representations would</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/12" class="indent">&quot;undermine the whole examination process and be prejudicial to other participants&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/13">Thus, until the Government publish any changes to their housing targets, no one should meet Ministers to lobby them, which is fair enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/14">Regrettably, the Minister for Housing and Planning apparently breached that rule. On <phrase class="date" code="">13 July</phrase> last year, she met the Minister for Higher Education and Lifelong Learning to discuss development in and around Harlow. As a result, on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase>&mdash;strangely enough, that was the day on which the House rose&mdash;the Government suddenly announced that they would overturn their own inspectors' recommendations and reinstate the new town, to the surprise of the public and most housing and planning experts.</p>
	<p pid="a.8.0/15">My constituents believe that that meeting on <phrase class="date" code="">13 July</phrase> last year has undermined the credibility of the whole process of setting housing targets and proven highly prejudicial. That is why they, among others, are now seeking legal opinion on how to challenge the decision and, therefore, the Government's housing targets in our area. Such a challenge could affect not only housing in my constituency, but development across the county and, indeed, the eastern region.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.15.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="15"  time="010:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0003.htm#07013038000523">
	<p pid="a.15.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a good point. He says that centrally imposed targets are difficult for local authorities to address when there are constraints on the areas in which they can allow development. He mentions the green belt implications and I, too, find it difficult to understand how one can substitute one area of land for an area of green belt on which planning permission has been given for development. It was either the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford or the hon. Member for St. Albans who said that the importance of green belt is the separation of towns and communities rather than the conservation involved in the substitution of a different area. The spatial importance of green belt has been lost in the argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/2">The Government should consider supply as well as demand, and they should invest in northern regions, which are crying out for investment and for jobs. The right hon. Gentleman made a point about that, but the issue must be re-examined, because there is huge capacity in the north and west, and it could be used to our advantage. The key to the issue is the Secretary of State and centrally imposed targets. Local authorities and the assemblies should be trusted more and given more powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/3">Mention has been made about planning gain, and we are concerned about the legislation that is before the House and about the fact that the money will not be given to local authorities for them to determine its use. It is the very antithesis of localism. Commenting on the report by Select Committee on Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/4" class="indent">&quot;This report confirms the Treasury's proposals on planning gain supplement contradict everything Ruth Kelly has been saying about devolving powers to local people and communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/5" class="indent">Replacing the current planning contribution paid by developers with planning gain supplement will not provide more money for the roads, schools, GPs surgeries and any new houses that are needed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.15.1/6">One other issue that must be considered is the VAT system. All new build is zero-rated but the refurbishment and reconstruction of existing property bears the full VAT rate. VAT equalisation would lead to the much better use of existing housing stock and facilities in order to meet the needs of the serious housing situation in Hertfordshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.19.1/1">I will not give way at this point, because hon. Members have put a great number of issues to me and I want to try to answer them all. If I have time later, I will happily give way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/2">While Londoners continue to move to Hertfordshire, such as when they start a family and want a garden, it is clear that Hertfordshire cannot close its doors. Incomers such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the son of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase>, many of whom are vital to the economy, will also be able to compete effectively in the housing market, so it is existing local people who would be hardest hit by insufficient housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/3">As the panel pointed out, growth and living within environmental limits are not alternatives but joint imperatives. The proposed changes to the draft plan represent a new benchmark in reconciling the growth that we need with sustainability. We have taken the panel's recommendations one step further and propose to put in place stronger policies to reduce water consumption, improve energy efficiency and drive up the recycling of waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/4">It is alleged that there has been a lack of consultation. That is nonsense. First, consulting the public on our proposed changes is exactly what we are doing now. Secondly, there will be further substantial opportunities for public engagement at the local development plan document stage, when the broad intentions of the regional spatial strategy are translated by the local planning authorities into specific proposals. Thirdly, at the examination in public the panel asked the Hertfordshire local authorities what strategy they would propose if they were to recommend higher growth. Except for Stevenage borough council, none of them were prepared to put forward constructive proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/5">The green belt has taken centre stage in this debate. The pressing need for more housing, coupled with the sustainable benefits of expanding the new towns, provides the exceptional circumstances to justify the selective review of boundaries in a small number of locations. So, are we really talking about Hertfordshire's green belt being concreted over? Absolutely not. Let me counter the mischievous misinformation that is being bandied about. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage said, the reality is that only 3 per cent. of Hertfordshire's existing green belt will need to be built on in order to provide sufficient development land for the long term, to at least to 2031. The rest&mdash;97 per cent.&mdash;will remain. We are also putting in place a stronger framework to make that land more accessible for recreation. There is no question of towns merging together and losing their identity. It remains national policy that green belts must prevent coalescence between nearby towns. The local decisions on green belt boundaries in Hertfordshire must respect that principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/6">Ministers are not agreeing to such reviews lightly. The only alternatives are to plan to under-provide for housing, with higher prices and more homelessness, or to have long-distance commuting to homes beyond the green belts. The right approach is to take decisions now, looking ahead to 2031, so that boundaries need to change only once. That will give certainty for local communities and ensure that urban extensions are planned properly, rather than leaving uncertainty about whether boundaries will need to be changed again in a few years. Let me also clarify that the green belt extension for Harlow North is not at Peterborough. The extension will be along the edge of the Harlow development, extending towards the A120, which is in the constituency of the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford.</p>
	<p pid="a.19.1/7">Opposition Members have poured scorn on our proposals to extend the green belt for their county.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.21.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="21"  time="010:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0004.htm#07013038000542">
	<p pid="a.21.6/1">The Government are providing significant infrastructure support. We have already made substantial commitments to investment in the region, through sources such as growth areas funding, support for local delivery vehicles and the transport innovations fund. The favourable outcomes for the region&mdash;through the regional funding allocation on transport and the single regional housing pot for 2006-2008&mdash;indicate that the Government appreciate the region's investment needs. In my statement to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-19">19 December 2006</phrase>, I stressed that once the plan was finalised we would consider what support might be needed to towns with high rates of growth that do not benefit from growth area funding and related measures. At a national level, the Government have been reviewing policy on how development should contribute to the full range of development-related infrastructure, building on the existing section 106 system.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.6/2">We are currently consulting further on proposals for a planning gain supplement. No decisions have been made, so some of the statements that have been made&mdash;particularly by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire&mdash;are not correct. We are encouraging local authorities to make greater use of standard charges in the meantime, to help to maximise the effectiveness with which contributions are collected through the existing mechanism. The aim of a planning gains supplement is to simplify the system for getting developers to make a fair contribution to the full infrastructure costs of development.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.6/3">Let me respond to the concerns that have been raised about the rationale for the location of growth in Herts. We have accepted the panel's reasons for concentrating much of the extra growth needed in Hertfordshire in the new towns&mdash;not just in Stevenage, as proposed in the draft plan, but in Hemel Hempstead and Welwyn Hatfield. The panel's view, which Ministers accept, was that the most sustainable way of providing more housing in Hertfordshire was to concentrate development at the new towns. They have a good record of balancing jobs and housing growth, and have better infrastructure than older towns. Growth can stimulate urban regeneration, such as by boosting town centre services and public transport. The focus on new towns is part of a bigger picture. Basildon in Essex and the new towns in the south-east are also earmarked for growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.6/4">The focus on the expansion of new towns is a guiding principle in Hertfordshire county council's own structure plan, which provides for the expansion of Stevenage and Hemel Hempstead, both of which are new towns. The panel's advice is consistent with the general approach to new towns in England and in Hertfordshire's adopted structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.6/5">I should like to respond to the points made by the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden about migration. Let us deal with the true migration issues. It is true that the latest projections for the UK as a whole suggest that about 80 per cent. of population growth in the next 25 years will be due to international migration. However, that does not translate into a need for 80 per cent. more housing for migrants. There are several reasons why we need more housing. People living longer and complex social changes account for about three quarters of the estimated need for extra housing; migration accounts for only about a quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.6/6">At present, about 12,000 people move into Hertfordshire every year, mostly from London, and not many of them are international migrants. However, more than 10,000 move out of Hertfordshire every year to the rest of the UK and abroad. A total of about 33,000 will move into Hertfordshire during the regional plan period 2001-2021, but about four times that number will move into Essex, twice that number into Cambridgeshire and nearly five times that number into Norfolk. Hertfordshire is not a particular focus for migration and I regret that the right hon. Gentleman felt that he had to raise the matter as he did.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.6/7">I am sure that you will agree, Mr. Olner, that this is not the place for a wider debate about international migration. However, let us bear a few facts in mind. Hertfordshire's unemployment rate continues at a near-all-time low of just 1.5 per cent. There is an acute skills shortage in the county; there are thousands of unfilled vacancies for skilled and unskilled work. Business needs more workers and in Hertfordshire, as elsewhere, migrants are stepping in to do skilled jobs and some of the unskilled work that nobody else wants to do. We all benefit from their contribution; without any migration, our population would become increasingly aged. It needs a steady injection of younger working-age people to keep it balanced.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.6/8">The hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford raised the issue of developers pegging out land. That issue has been raised with me in respect of other areas. It rightly concerns hon. Members that members of the public are sold land for which there is no prospect of development. The Government deplore the practice and there is no specific evidence that the proposals encourage it. Indeed, long-term planning of green belt reviews in specific locations will discourage speculation by developers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" speakername="Claire Curtis-Thomas" colnum="25"  time="010:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0004.htm#07013038000549">
	<p pid="a.25.1/1">Before I begin my speech, I would like to declare a number of interests. I have served as a member of the excellent parliamentary armed forces scheme, which has been administered by Sir Neil Thorne for a number of years. I am immensely grateful for the opportunities that it has afforded me. I have also been to various Army training facilities all over the world and learned a great deal about how the Army functions, particularly from the point of view of working soldiers. In addition, Altcar training camp is in my constituency. It supports the Territorial Army and receives thousands of visitors at weekends. I am also a professional engineer and, as such, represent companies and individuals who serve and support the defence industry. I am proud to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">The role of our armed forces in the modern world is without question a matter worthy of our debate. Recently, the Prime Minister rightly brought the issue directly into focus. His speech on defence and the future of our armed forces highlighted the fact that, despite the difficulties and challenges that we face today, Britain has to maintain a warfighting as well as a peacekeeping capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">Iraq and Afghanistan are too readily perceived as the only theatres in which our forces serve, and the situation is often seen to be critically unstable. There has never been universal approval for any activity in which members of the Army are involved, from peacekeeping to engagement in war. Throughout its history, our Army has faced numerous challenges to its sovereignty&mdash;challenges that Britain has never shied away from and that, ultimately, have been overcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">We are a nation that will act forcefully when the moral right is on our side, and I am concerned that the British instinct may have been severely constrained by our experiences in Iraq. The Falklands war demonstrated to the world how important territorial integrity is to Britain, and that we will fight to maintain it. In Bosnia, and later in Kosovo, while regular massacres were occurring and UN peace troops could not stop the slaughter, it was through the strength of British and American action that peace could be brokered. When it is necessary and just, ours is a nation, I am proud to say, that is not afraid to fight. We do not wait for the enemy to come to us; we are in a continuous state of protecting our own.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">Many of our citizens may find defence matters repugnant or no longer relevant, but our history suggests that such attitudes are incorrect. Unless we want to lose our rights and the envy and respect of people throughout the world, which we have secured over time, we must maintain a defensive and, when necessary, offensive position.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/6">The 2003 Defence White Paper listed the major threats as international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the problem of failing states. The threats are from an enemy who is determined, difficult to identify and opposed to the core principles that many people sacrificed their lives to preserve. Ours is a nation of tolerance, but we must use all the means available to us to defeat the extremism that seeks to undermine practical secular governance.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/7">Given the new challenges that face the modern world and the UK, our military is surely one of the most capable of responding. From the Iberian peninsula to the Crimea, in Korea and Malaya, on the battlefields of France, in the waters of Jutland and on many other fields of conflict, men and women have served our national interests with professionalism, skill and bravery while continuously displaying ability to adapt and succeed. Now, with our armed forces serving, as ever, around the globe, it is right to discuss our military operations and how we should express ourselves militarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/8">Taking a wider definition of British security requires us to consider political and economic stability, which can be affected by changes in countries or regions anywhere around the globe. Where a direct threat can be clearly identified, Britain and our allies must be prepared to fight terrorists before they can attack us at home. However, our security does not necessarily have to be won through warfighting. Peacemaking and peacekeeping operations can help to bring stability to a country on the brink of collapse. By stopping conflicts, we can allow war-torn nations to enjoy their own peace dividend. In an ever more interdependent world, we cannot afford to view ourselves as an island&mdash;the fate of one nation affects the fate of us all. With our support, strong, peaceful nations can be built in which terrorism cannot prosper, and in which development thrives and hatred withers.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/9">Our armed forces' most notable commitments are in Iraq and Afghanistan, where they remain engaged in a battle to ensure future peace and stability for the people of those nations. Strenuous challenges are faced daily, and the armed forces in both countries have admirably demonstrated the skill and bravery with which they face such threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/10">In Basra, the number of murders and kidnappings is falling, and an increasing number of police stations in that area are meeting the standard required for handover. The assistance of UK military personnel and &pound;35 million of our money have helped the Department for International Development to start work on more than 800 projects to help to rebuild and develop Iraq. It must be noted that 90 per cent. of sectarian violence in Iraq occurs within a 30-mile radius of Baghdad&mdash;a fact not often observed by our media.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/11">In Afghanistan, alongside the efforts to hunt down Taliban fighters, there is an increased focus on helping to consolidate the abilities of the Afghan security forces. Development is occurring in both countries, but the main focus has been on securing and stabilising, for it is from there that true progress can occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/12">There can be few armed forces more capable of winning the battle to ensure true stability than our own, as they have demonstrated many times. The British military has been an active member of peacekeeping forces around the world, with a recent and continuing presence in Cyprus, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Georgia, Liberia, Sierra Leone and Sudan. The intelligence-gathering opportunities afforded by such deployments cannot be overestimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/13">In Bosnia, the UK led the EU military mission throughout 2005 and continues to have more than 600 troops stationed there. The reforms that followed have been significant, and include the establishment of a single Ministry of Defence and a single multi-ethnic armed force. The local authorities are increasingly gaining the skills to deal with weapon confiscation and combating organised crime. Training and assistance are being provided to equip former soldiers for civilian life. Crucially, on top of that, nine people indicted for war crimes have been captured.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/14">In Sierra Leone, the arrival of British troops allowed for the evacuation of UK, EU and Commonwealth citizens. Meanwhile, the securing of Freetown's airport in 2003, combined with regular patrols, paved the way for the arrival of UN aid and a subsequent UN peacekeeping mission that restored peace and stability to the country. Alongside that, the UK and the US were jointly responsible for construction of the special court presiding over the trial of the most appalling, murderous men this world has ever seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/15">I had the privilege of going to Sierra Leone and spending time with the Army. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate those personnel on their endeavours. Sierra Leone is rarely discussed, yet the nature of its civil war was unprecedented in world history. Appalling acts were committed, and I commend Army personnel on how they have conducted themselves since they liberated Freetown.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/16">The Army is now part of a UN force in Sierra Leone that is doing great good. Many people throughout the world may wish to see the back of the Army and an end to its work, but people in Sierra Leone willingly shake one's hand and thank God that we are there. We have saved them from a horror that we can only imagine, but that they, unfortunately, have lived through.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/17">British forces are always ready to be involved in humanitarian relief assistance. Three Chinooks flew more than 330 hours to deliver nearly 1,700 tonnes of aid following the earthquake in south-east Asia in 2005, and a team of Royal Engineers was able to construct emergency shelters at 5,500 ft using expertise derived directly from field training exercises.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/18">We are also able to maintain strong links with many nations through joint training exercises around the globe. At Goose Bay in Canada, the RAF is able to practise low flying and in Alberta&mdash;again, I have been to the area and spent three days with the infantry there&mdash;the Army trains six regiments a year. A full infantry battalion is able to conduct a wide variety of training from section attacks to battalion attacks, much of which involves live firing, in one of the Army's largest training exercises.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/19">In Kenya, Exercise Grand Prix allows training in a range of climates and terrain. Such training is essential for the challenges that the modern world presents. In Belize, 1,000 British Army and RAF personnel pass through a training programme each year, and the Royal Engineers, of which I am very proud, undertakes a three-month construction exercise that benefits not only our soldiers, but the residents of Belize.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/20">Our armed forces also gain strong international links through foreign recruits, with approximately 10 per cent. of the Army's strength recruited from outside the UK. Membership is open to and positively encouraged among Commonwealth members.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/21">The benefits of maintaining our military strength and remaining a key military contributor work from the bottom up. Those who serve in our Army can gain skills that will serve them for life, whether in or out of the services. Approximately 45 per cent. of armed forces recruits have very low educational skills. By joining the Army, they receive help to master that problem and to gain other skills that will serve them for life.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/22">I am delighted that the Army has now taken steps to ensure that any qualifications gained while serving in and being supported by the Army are accredited against the UK non-Army training facility. As such, there have been 12,710 level 2 or 3 national vocational qualifications, and, I am delighted to say, 5,718 apprenticeships, 2,527 advanced apprenticeships and 544 foundation degrees. In addition, 279 personnel were also able to gain graduate or postgraduate degrees. We as a nation will benefit from that immense skill resource when those men and women decide to retire from the Army. It is an excellent investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/23">Experience abroad continues to benefit the Army. A complete assessment of potential threats is impossible, so the broader the range of skills gained, the more we strengthen our ability to deal with any threat. In March 2003, the Ministry of Defence Joint Doctrine and Concepts Centre stated that the greatest threat to UK security would occur if the strategic environment were to change faster than the UK could acquire or apply resources to meet dangers. By playing a leading role in the world, our armed forces can gain daily hands-on experience of the techniques and abilities of our enemies, therefore receiving the best education in how to face the enemy of tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/24">The skills that the armed forces gain, both internally and externally, go on to advance British interests by providing us with the abilities to respond to threats wherever they emerge and whatever their nature might be. The growing threat from scarce resources, famine and religious and ethnic tensions are all examples of problems that can escalate and result in hatred, conflict and the subsequent destabilisation of a region. When those problems become globalised, the issues begin to affect the global economy, energy security and the UK and its allies.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/25">Foreign missions not only serve to reduce imminent threats to our security, but give the armed forces opportunities to continue to learn and develop so that they can deal with future security threats. The lessons learned can also be applied in the training that we can offer the security forces in countries where we have troops based, as can our skills in construction and rebuilding.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/26">By working as part of coalitions, as will be the case in most future engagements, we not only build stronger ties with our allies, but we can learn from those with experience of the problems we face. The threats from international terrorism are an issue not just for this incumbency, but for this generation. We must continue to lead in the search for a better, safer, more prosperous world, for it is there that our national security is truly based. We must be willing to consider and pursue all means possible to achieve our ends. Issues such as climate change or aid to developing countries are ones on which Britain is leading and are certainly means by which global stability and progress can be aided.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/27">We have highly experienced, well-trained, motivated and professional armed forces that must be used proportionately and appropriately&mdash;and, crucially, must never be ignored as an option. They must be maintained as a force that can participate in high-intensity warfighting operations, but that maintains the qualities essential for peacekeeping and humanitarian support. If we place that responsibility on our armed forces, we must be prepared to provide them with the political and financial support to achieve the demanding and essential tasks for which we require them, which the men and women of our armed forces are trained for and willing to perform.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/28">The search for national security in the modern world is just beginning. To retreat would be foolhardy and weak. We must continue to lead, adapt, innovate and secure. The fight will not be won overnight and it might at times seem short of significant victories. Mistakes will occur and, tragically, lives will be lost, but the threat to our national security posed by restricting the role of the armed forces cannot be overestimated.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/29">We should not allow the loss of life in Iraq and Afghanistan to put us off future acts of military aggression. When right is on our side and the security of our nation is at stake, we must be prepared to use attack as the best form of defence. I believe in a Britain that will not sit back passively and allow itself to be attacked, nor fall back into the pack or drift into global insignificance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.29.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="29"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0005.htm#07013038000550">
	<p pid="a.29.0/1">I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate. I had originally intended to make some interventions on issues raised by constituents, but I shall take the opportunity to make a wider assessment of the concerns that have been brought to me which the Minister can address.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is important to recognise the significant contribution that the British Army makes to this country's well-being. The sacrifice that is made by the men and women who serve in our armed forces needs to be recognised and tribute needs to be paid to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/3">The hon. Lady made clear the importance of recognising the interaction between the roles of the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The two have to go hand in hand in understanding first what resources are needed and, secondly, what resources are available when it comes to assessing our position in the world. We should not take for granted what is available from the Army and has been built up over generations, and we should not put at risk what we hand on to future generations. We are the custodians of something that has not happened overnight. Today's Army is the product of many generations of commitment, sacrifice, training, understanding and professionalism. We will not be thanked if we put that at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/4">It is important that we recognise the weaknesses in our armed services and that we repair them. We should recognise, too, in our foreign policy how far our ambitions can go without overstretching our armed forces, which would put at risk what has been built up. I come from the north-east of Scotland, and the regimental structure was engrained into links with the armed forces. The Gordon Highlanders, of course, have a great tradition in north-east Scotland. It is important that with the merger of regiments those links are not lost for those previous service people who fought for and served our country. Those links should not be lost as part of the way of ensuring recruitment for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/5">I congratulate the MOD on recognising, through the veterans medal, the strength of feeling that people have for the time they have served in the services. I recently encouraged people to come forward with a new deadline for when people can apply for such a medal, and the enthusiasm, the interest shown and the way in which the phone has been ringing off the hook in the office shows that people want to be recognised for what they have given and for the commitment that they have made. The network that can be built among veterans and the support network between them is extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/6">One of our problems as Members of Parliament is that people come to us with anecdotes about problems in the armed services and often, because of the nature of the chain of command and the discipline, they say that they do not want what they have said to be related back to the armed forces. The Minister is often faced with problems based on anecdotes and has to give us a response in the context of the wider picture. However, there has been worrying feedback from those on the front line and in the services about overstretch, to use the jargon. Some of the ways in which it manifests itself have been raised, such as people having to buy more equipment than they have been allocated to make their job easier.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/7">One more recent concern, which I raised in the debate on Iraq, was mentioned by a constituent. Obviously, when someone joins the military, they have to go where they are needed and provide whatever functions are needed, especially in a crisis or emergency. However, someone joined the RAF in a specialist role&mdash;they had been trained in packing equipment to be loaded on to Hercules aircraft for logistical purposes&mdash;and found themselves suddenly taken on a short, sharp training course to go into a peacekeeping role in Iraq on the front line. If the armed forces have to fill in like that and reposition people ad hoc to make it possible for the armed forces to carry on functioning on the ground, it suggests that we are putting a greater burden on them than they might be able to take in the long run. The military are obviously capable, in short, sharp bursts, of taking on extra burdens over and above those that are planned for, but if the over-commitment is sustained, there is a worry that we will damage those abilities for the long term as well as the abilities to use the armed forces in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/8">Another more recent point that was raised with me concerned the way in which tours of duty and the amount of active deployments have an impact on training. For those looking in from the outside it might seem that training on the front line is effective, because people are practising those roles for which they have been trained. The feedback from those serving is that they do not necessarily get the breadth of training that a true training environment would give. We need to remember to take people out of the front line and cycle them through the training so that they have all the building blocks that they need for a flexible response next time. We cannot rely on the fact that because they have been on the front line for so long they have sufficient experience and do not need training. That point was raised with me only yesterday, so I have not dug fully into it. How can we ensure, with the resources that we have, that the building blocks for the next deployment are properly put in place so that people are not put at risk?</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/9">The hon. Lady praised our armed forces peacekeeping work. The danger is that we take for granted how good our armed forces are; it is almost a clich&eacute;. Their skills and their instincts make them extremely effective in their peacekeeping role. They engage with other countries and other cultures, using the experience of others for those whom they are there to help. We must not be too arrogant, but our forces do much to train other countries in peacekeeping, engaging with the local population and in winning hearts and minds.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/10">I recently visited Pakistan with the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Given the traditional links between our countries and Pakistan's understanding of our military ethos and our foreign policy traditions, surprise was expressed that we had allowed ourselves to get involved with the Americans in such a poor way when tackling the transition in Iraq. In particular, Pakistan could not understand why we had allowed the destruction of the internal regime. Our armed forces had not done what the British traditionally do. When we go into another country, we obviously change the leadership, but often we use the institutions of that country to help us in our peacekeeping role.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/11">We may not be the largest partner among our allies, but the Americans have a lot to learn from our experience in peacekeeping. If we are to work with them, we need to ensure that they take on board our understanding and our experience, as history suggests that we have a better track record than they do.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.3/1">On the points raised earlier, I too have had members of the armed forces raising concerns about one moment being in store and the next minute finding themselves on the frontline. I would like to get to the bottom of this issue and find out what level of training they are getting. I welcome the Minister's contribution on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/2">What are the consequences of this overstretch? According to an MOD survey, one in five soldiers want to quit the Army at the earliest opportunity, with many blaming overstretch. More than half often think about quitting and more than a third blamed operational commitment and overstretch. A rising number of soldiers are no longer given the full recommended rest periods between operations, and only 30 per cent. of ordinary soldiers who responded to the survey were satisfied with the notice given for extra duties. Almost three out of five rated their workload as high or very high, and only 31 per cent. felt valued, with nearly one out of four saying that their morale was low or very low.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/3">I am pleased that the Government have acknowledged that more needs to be done to improve housing for the armed forces, but I am disappointed that it took the intervention of the Adjutant-General, Lieutenant-General Freddie Viggers, who condemned cramped and decaying living quarters in barracks. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.35.3/4" class="indent">&quot;there is still too much accommodation which is of a poor standard, which is old, and which is not modern in the way it's fitted for families. It's a key issue in what we call the military covenant - giving our soldiers and their families what they deserve in return for that they do for us.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.38.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1369" speakername="Gerald Howarth" colnum="38"  time="011:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0006.htm#07013038000576">
	<p pid="a.38.0/1">I follow on from what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> said and pay tribute to one of Britain's greatest success stories, Her Majesty's armed forces, and particularly, in the light of today's debate, the British Army. I do not believe that there is an army in the world that can match ours.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the hon. Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> on securing the debate. I am sorry that more hon. Members are not present, but I pay tribute to her because she is a tribute to the armed forces parliamentary scheme. She has clearly benefited from it and proven to the House and, we hope, to a wider audience&mdash;she has certainly done so to the Minister, although he needs no confirmation of this&mdash;that the scheme is an extremely good organisation and helps to ensure that Members of Parliament who do not have experience of the armed forces are introduced to what is, as I said, one of Britain's greatest success stories.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">I shall not go through all the points that the hon. Lady raised, but she made two fundamental ones. The first was that the Falklands campaign illustrated the importance of being prepared to fight for one's country, territory and interests. We must never forget that that is what our armed forces are for. Having come straight from a meeting with Baroness Thatcher and just discussed these issues, I can reinforce that remark.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">The hon. Lady's second point was about Sierra Leone. That is a very different operation, but it is one in which the British Army is conducting itself magnificently. It illustrates the extraordinary versatility of Britain's Army and particularly those who come from less privileged backgrounds. Some people come from very difficult home backgrounds and poorer parts of society, and it is a tribute to the British Army that it manages to train them and turn them into such stalwart citizens who are both brave and versatile. In theatres such as Sierra Leone, they are winning hearts and minds, as they are doing in Iraq and Afghanistan. That is an enormous tribute to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/5">As Conservative Front-Bench spokesman on defence, but also as one who has the privilege of being the Member of Parliament for Aldershot, the home of the British Army, I have to say that this is a wonderful opportunity for me not only to extol the virtues of the British Army, but to highlight some of the difficulties. May I say to the Minister, who has been in post even longer than I have, that if I do highlight the difficulties, I do so because it is part of the constitutional duty of the Opposition to hold the Government to account? Much is being done that I am sure is good. New equipment is coming on board, and the Minister mentioned accommodation, but there are real problems. The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife illustrated some of those.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/6">General Sir Richard Dannatt's first intervention when he became Chief of the General Staff was to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/7" class="indent">&quot;We are running hot, certainly running hot. Can we cope? I pause. I say 'just'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/8">Coming from the head of the British Army, that should send a shock through all Members of this House, not just Ministers, but it was a considered view and reflects what is happening on the ground. The trouble with the military is that when asked to do something by politicians, invariably their answer is, &quot;Yes, sir. We can do it, sir.&quot; We politicians then glibly say, &quot;Okay, that's fine. Let's crack on with it.&quot; The military are reluctant to say, &quot;No, we can't do it,&quot; because they would feel that they were failures or that they had failed to deliver what was expected of them by the politicians. I think that what General Sir Richard Dannatt said is absolutely right. It is certainly borne out by my experience and by the figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/9">I remind the Minister that in 1997 the required strength of the British Army was 106,360. That had fallen by 2006 to 101,800. The trained strength of the Army in 1997 was 101,360. Last year, it was 99,570. We now have the smallest Army since 1930. The fundamental difference between 1997 and 2007 is that today we are fighting two wars. There is no point in pussy-footing around: when we say that people are going on operations, they are going into war zones. Iraq is effectively a war zone and Afghanistan is most certainly a war zone, as are the myriad other operations that the hon. Lady mentioned and to which we are committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/10">The fundamental basis of our criticism of the Government is that there are insufficient men to undertake those tasks. It is no good saying, as the former Secretary of State did, that platform numbers no longer count because we have such sophisticated equipment. Of course numbers count. One ship cannot be in two places, as Admiral Sir Alan West, First Sea Lord, said. Equally, soldiers are human beings. To take territory and hold it, one needs men, and that means numbers. It does not matter how sophisticated the weapons are, the physical presence of the soldiers is what counts.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/11">We cannot understand why the Government have cut four British Army battalions when General Richards in Afghanistan has called for precisely 2,500 men. What is that? It is four battalions. That is in addition to what they are doing to cap badges and to destroy much of the morale and ethos that is associated with the support for individual units. Men do not fight for their country; they fight for the man next to them. They fight for their unit, their regiment and that battle honour. Anyone who doubts that should watch the 3 Para video of Afghanistan, which is extremely well worth watching. It exemplifies the sense of camaraderie and ethos.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/12">In 2005, some 3,350 more people left the Army than joined up. Last year, the number was about 1,500. I agree that the problem is not so much with recruitment, although only two battalions are properly recruited&mdash;the Gurkha battalions&mdash;while the rest are under-recruited and under-strength. There is an attraction for young men and women in serving their country and taking part in the kind of operations that are under way. The problem is something else. When I go around and speak to people, many of them tell me, &quot;I've done Iraq&quot;&mdash;probably three times&mdash;and &quot;I've done Afghanistan. It doesn't get much better than that, so I'm quitting.&quot; The people who are leaving are the backbone of the British Army: the captains, majors and senior warrant officers. They are the repository of the real experience in today's Army. Their loss is potentially the most damaging, and something has to be done about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/13">I have two Guards battalions in Aldershot at present&mdash;the Irish Guards and the Grenadier Guards. Before Christmas, the commanding officer of the Irish Guards, Colonel O'Dwyer, told me, &quot;Sir, we are not valued.&quot; That is a serious wake-up call and we need to wake up. The colonel is a splendid chap, and he did not say that in any way politically, but it is an accusation against the political classes. It is our job to make sure that they are valued. I shall return to the military covenant later.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">I am grateful, because there are many other issues that I could raise about the British Army. Although I do not have time to raise them all, I want to mention the important matter of medical care. We have an inadequate system of dealing with the aftermath of military operations and the Government need to do much more. The issue of mental health problems arising out of operations is also of paramount importance. If the Minister could do anything to increase the support that he makes available to Combat Stress, he would be doing a great service and would be widely thanked. We know that there are insufficient numbers of nurses and doctors. They are about 43 per cent. under-recruited, and that will also have to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/2">Mention has been made of the military covenant. There is not a person in this land who believes that Britain's armed forces have not fulfilled their part of the bargain. They have done so in shed loads. They have met their duty under the military covenant, but the nation has failed them in return. We have not given them the kit, the sufficient manpower, the family support or the accommodation. Whatever the Minister is now doing, we have not done enough for our armed forces to enable us to look them in the eye and say, &quot;We have fulfilled our part of the military covenant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/3">I want to make a point to the Minister by taking as my text the remarks made by the former Secretary of State, now the Minister for Europe, in supporting essay 2 to the Defence White Paper of 2003, &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World&quot;. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Since SDR our Armed Forces have conducted operations that have been more complex and greater in number than we had envisaged. We have effectively been conducting continual concurrent operations, deploying further afield, to more places, more frequently and with a greater variety of missions than set out in the SDR planning assumptions. We expect to see a similar pattern of operations in the future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/5">In other words, we are imposing on our armed forces a commitment that is greater than was proposed in the strategic defence review. The SDR was never properly funded and this is not properly funded. The situation is, &quot;Commitments of SDR, plus; funding of SDR, double minus.&quot; That sums up the dilemma that the Government face.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/6">It is no good the Prime Minister saying, as he did against a military backdrop&mdash;on HMS Albion&mdash;in a wonderfully orchestrated and typically Labour spin thing, that we are going to spend more on defence. When the matter was raised in the other place&mdash;I raised this with the Prime Minister at Question Time last week&mdash;Lord Davies of Oldham said of the comprehensive spending review that</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/7" class="indent">&quot;there will be a number of contributions to that debate. The Prime Minister's contribution will, of course, be regarded very seriously and very importantly indeed.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-17">17 January 2007</phrase>; Vol. 688, c. 647.]</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/8">What have we come to when the Prime Minister of the land deliberately gives a stage-managed appearance on HMS Albion telling the armed forces, &quot;Don't worry boys, I am going to look after you. I give you a commitment&quot; and that is a &quot;contribution to that debate.&quot;? That debate is presided over by, undoubtedly, the next Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has betrayed the armed forces. He has failed to fund them to the level required to meet the commitments that the Prime Minister has imposed on them. He is as much a part of this Government as the Prime Minister, and he has failed abysmally in doing the job that he ought to do of supporting our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1860" name="Nicholas Soames">My hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames)</phrase> and I offered a little challenge before the previous election. We offered a magnum, no less, of Pol Roger champagne&mdash;the favourite champagne of his grandfather, Sir Winston Churchill&mdash;to the first person to spot the Chancellor of the Exchequer arriving at, or leaving, a military establishment. The magnum of Pol Roger is still on my sideboard awaiting collection. I believe that the Chancellor has now been to Iraq and is trying to ingratiate himself with the armed forces, but he is a man who has never done anything to help them. He may say that the Tories cut defence spending, but we did so because the circumstances after the ending of the cold war, which was achieved by my noble Friend, Baroness Thatcher, meant that we had to have a rethink. To this Government's credit, they had a review. We should have had a review, but we did not. We cut defence expenditure but the trouble is that the Labour party wanted to cut it even further. The Government should not tell us that we did not do the right thing by the armed forces because Labour wanted further cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/10">There is an issue about the funding of our armed forces, and the hon. Member for Crosby raised it. On <phrase class="date" code="">30 October</phrase>, <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>gave figures from an opinion poll that asked people whether they thought more or less should be spent on defence. Some 46 per cent. of people said that we should spend more on it, of whom 18 per cent. said that significantly more should be spent. Only 22 per cent. said that less should be spent on it. Interestingly, there was an opinion poll about Iraq in another column showing that 57 per cent. of people said that we should be out of Iraq either now or within 12 months. That illustrates the complete disconnect between the public's opposition to the Iraq war and their support for the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.2/11">We have a duty to support the greatest army in the world. It has served us well and I, like everyone else, is proud of it. We are not doing our stuff by the Army and, if we do not do so, the haemorrhaging of people leaving the armed forces will get even worse and experienced people will go. Such people cannot be replaced. The military covenant requires us to do our duty by our magnificent armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.0/1">I shall give way in a moment on that point, but I do not agree with the analysis with which the hon. Gentleman closed his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/2">The incoming Labour Government considered where the armed forces should be positioned and how best they should be structured. That was an intensive programme, driven directly by the armed forces themselves. They knew that they had to get themselves better structured and positioned. On the back on the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, it was clear that more needed to be done. There was not a full review, but more consideration needed to be given to how to structure the armed forces, particularly the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/3">We considered the new technology that was coming in, which changed the relationship between the various services and how they could fight interdependently and flexibly, meeting new challenges and a different type of threat and enemy. All that had to be included in the examination process. Such a process will always be complicated while we are engaged in heavy commitments such as in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/4">Other countries where we are engaged have been mentioned, and it is interesting that people forget about Northern Ireland. Only a few years ago we had more troops committed there than to Iraq and Afghanistan put together. We have transformed Northern Ireland: when I was the Northern Ireland Office Minister with responsibility for security, we had about 15,000 troops committed. Some were on rear bases, but that was the total commitment, the vast bulk of which came from the Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/5">The peace process was required for a lot of reasons, one of which was the heavy resource commitment. We had been there for far too long and there was another, better way of doing it. We could never have solved the problem militarily, yet we had a large commitment. As of next year, we will have a commitment of 5,000 troops&mdash;not for the peace process, although a measure of support will be given to the civilian authorities, but overall. That is a major transformation and it has reduced pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/6">Two parts of our re-examination were called future Army structure and future infantry structure. The future Army structure represents a complete overhaul of how we brigade the British Army. Virtually every Army unit establishment was subject to examination, and will be in the months and years ahead. Some 10,000 posts will be redistributed, which will reshape and restructure the Army and is intended to get a better balance between heavy, medium and light capabilities. We inherited an imbalance: the enemy and threat had changed, so we had to change accordingly. That required re-roling and people doing tasks other than those that they thought they would do when they entered the armed forces. We were committed to one objective: maintaining the high quality and standard of Her Majesty's armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/7">A previous Secretary of State, now the Minister for Europe, commented on the matter on <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase>, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/8" class="indent">&quot;However, enhancements that we have already decided on include the creation of a new commando engineer regiment, a new port and maritime unit, an additional strategic communications unit and a new logistics support regiment for each deployable brigade. We are also creating a number of new sub-units for surveillance and target acquisition, bomb disposal and vehicle maintenance capabilities.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-16">16 December 2004</phrase>; Vol. 428, c. 1796.]</p>
	<p pid="a.46.0/9">In April last year, a new special forces support group was also formed to work alongside special forces tackling the terrorism that we face globally. I have visited a support group and spoken to those deployed in Afghanistan. I cite those examples because they are never recognised as part of the process of substantial change that we have seen. That process has been driven by a military imperative to get things right, and there has been political and financial support for it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.47.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" colnum="47"  time="012:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0008.htm#07013038000592">
	<p pid="a.47.1/1">Let us look at the figures. The hon. Gentleman said that trained strength was 101,300 in 1997. It dropped to 100,900 the following year and to below 100,000 the year after that. In terms of the figure being below 100,000 and the reference to 1935, therefore, he is wrong. The current figures are marginally below the 1999 level. Interestingly, however, recruitment grew at the height of the Iraq controversy, when there were massive demonstrations in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/2">In 2004 and 2005, the figure went up to 102,400. That tells us something that is probably hard to analyse&mdash;recruitment went up against the trend, but we are now having recruiting difficulties. Tempo is unquestionably part of the issue, but people tend to forget the strength of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1957" name="Robert Smith">the economy. The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> mentioned the strength of the Scottish economy and his own region. It is difficult to recruit from a particular cohort when the economy is strong, and especially when the demographics and all the higher and further education opportunities open to young people, which were not there before, are working against us.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/3">That is what this debate is about, and if people can find a solution to that problem, they should tell us. A lot of effort is being put into working towards the best conclusion. We offer young people immense opportunities not only in the Army, but in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the armed forces, and my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> mentioned the educational opportunities. We market and advertise the opportunities that the armed forces provide so that people are aware of them. Sometimes those recruiting campaigns work, but sometimes they do not. We are no different from any other major organisation that is trying to reach a market and attract people in.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/4">What militates against our efforts is people arguing that the British armed forces are underfunded, ill equipped, badly treated and badly looked after. There may be some underlying truth in terms of issues needing to be addressed, but no wonder we find it difficult to recruit when debates such as this present a picture of complete negativity, rather than highlighting the positive attractions for young people. That is why we are putting so much effort into our recruiting strategy and trying to lift the quality of the debate as best we can.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.50.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="50"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0008.htm#07013038000595">
	<p pid="a.50.1/1">Young carers are children and young people under 18 who help to look after a family member who is disabled or physically or mentally ill, or who has a substance misuse problem. Helping out around the house is a normal part of growing up, but young carers regularly carry out significant or substantial caring tasks and assume a level of responsibility that is inappropriate to their age. Caring can involve physical or emotional care, or taking responsibility for someone's safety or well-being. Many young carers spend a lot of time doing household chores or looking after younger siblings, in addition to helping a sick or disabled parent with tasks such as administering medication&mdash;often without training or support&mdash;helping someone to get up and dressed, or helping someone to use the bathroom. Some young carers help parents to look after a disabled sibling.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/2">The last census, in 2001, found 175,000 young carers in the United Kingdom. Of those, 18,000 children, aged between five and 15, provided 20 hours of care or more a week. That is nearly three hours a day. Nearly 9,000 provided at least 50 hours&mdash;more than seven hours a day. However, it is generally accepted that there are many unrecorded and unrecognised cases. The culture of secrecy is strong among young carers and their families, and many young carers are invisible to the agencies that are there to help them. Perhaps that is because of fear that if social services become involved the family will be broken up. Local research has suggested that there may be up to 30 young carers in a large secondary school. Government estimates show 250,000 young people living with parental substance misuse, and the latest research by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children suggests that 4 per cent. of children will be young carers at some point during their childhoods. Fifty-seven per cent. of known young carers are girls and 43 per cent. are boys.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/3">Last year, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> and I attended the annual young carers festival at Fairthorne manor in Hampshire, and I was approached, after the formal question and answer session, by a group of young girls. They were very challenging. What they said was, basically, &quot;All you politicians ever do is talk, but nothing ever changes for us.&quot; I came away with an even deeper commitment to try to make a difference to their lives. I felt quite ashamed, to be honest.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/4">The types of issues that young carers consistently raise include comments such as the following: it is</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/5" class="indent">&quot;not just the caring that affects you. What really gets you is the worry of it all. Having a parent who is ill and seeing them in such a state ...you think about it a lot&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/6" class="indent">&quot;If I'd have gone regularly to school I would have done all right. But under the circumstances I'd have felt I couldn't have gone. It would have just made me feel more guilty that I was going if you know what I mean. I just didn't want to do that&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/7">Another comment is:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/8" class="indent">&quot;I used to run away from school because I always wanted to be with my mum. I used to think that my mum was going to die. I was about eight .... they treated me as if I was playing truant.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/9">Other comments include:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/10" class="indent">&quot;It is just something I do. It has to be done and there is no one else to do it&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/11" class="indent">&quot;She was in hospital in and out going on two years. She couldn't go to the bathroom on her own, she couldn't walk. She couldn't go to bed&mdash;she just slept in the chair downstairs. So it was everything really. She couldn't cook, she couldn't clean, she couldn't look after my little brother. She was in a lot of pain, for a long time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/12">This is another:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Mum spends a lot of time alone, so it doesn't seem right not to keep her company&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/14">Each young carer has different needs, and so does the person whom they are caring for, but being a young carer has heavy costs, such as being unable to do the sorts of things that other children do; taking on much more responsibility than other children, which sometimes leads to emotional and stress problems and clearly affects school attendance and performance; and even experiencing bullying at school. As one young carer said:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/15" class="indent">&quot;There are a few young carers at my school and I'm sick to death of people hurling abuse at us. Sure I'm not the coolest or I wear all the latest fashions, but who gives? People think we do nothing at all, and if they were in our shoes, they would scream. So why give us abuse, if we wouldn't do the same to them?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/16">I was pleased to be able to raise issues affecting young carers throughout the passage of the Education and Inspections Act 2006, and to have a meeting with the Minister for Schools. I should like to welcome some great improvements: the revised Department for Education and Skills guidance for schools on promoting attendance for vulnerable and at-risk groups, which includes an updated section on young carers, and the draft school transport guidance, which sets out the rights of disabled parents to free school transport to get their children to school. I think that I also wish to welcome the commitment in &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot; to improving things for young carers, but I look forward to seeing the details.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/17">Something else that is greatly to be welcomed is DFES funding for the young carers initiative at the Children's Society, which is developing principles of practice for professionals who come into contact with young carers. Funding for many other initiatives and projects that support young carers in a variety of ways is welcome, too, and I hope that the funds will be continued for many successful projects, and not suddenly chopped off.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/18">Nevertheless, there is much more that needs to be done for the particularly vulnerable group of young carers. Research by Barnado's showed that on average each young carer had spent four years looking after a relative or parent before they received any support. I would start by requesting that every school had a named young carers lead in line with DFES guidance. I should have liked that to be a duty, as it is in the case of looked-after children. It is very sad that we have not moved further on that point. Most young carers are not known as such by school staff, so being a young carer can be a hidden cause of poor attendance, under-achievement and bullying, and many young carers drop out of school or achieve no qualifications. Poor attendance by a young carer should not be equated with truancy or attract punitive measures. Appropriate support is needed. Teachers are generally not aware of the support services, if any, in their school or the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/19">There should be a young carers champion in every local authority. Some local authorities include such a role, which allows them to knit together the work of children's and adults' services at a strategic and practitioner level. It is vital that every authority mentions young carers in its children and young people's plans. In his recent report on statutory children and young people's plans the Children's Commissioner for England calls young carers</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/20" class="indent">&quot;another much neglected group in the Children and Young People's Plans&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/21">and goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/22" class="indent">&quot;There is a risk that children affected by the illness or substance misuse of adults who would otherwise be expected to care for them are in danger of falling through the gap between adult and children's services.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/23">On this issue I recently asked a parliamentary question, and, indeed, the Minister replied at column 1398W on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-19">19 January</phrase>. I should be much reassured, I suppose, because we do have a framework for the assessment of children in need and their families, and guidance for fair access to care services, but what is happening on the ground? We cannot afford to be complacent.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/24">In a report called &quot;The state of social care in England 2005-2006&quot; the Commission for Social Care Inspection said:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/25" class="indent">&quot;Given the separation of adults' and children's services, and our assessment that no more than 20% of councils are taking a wholly strategic approach to carers' services, it is hard to see how young carers' issues can be routinely addressed unless there are clear and robust interdepartmental policies and procedures...Care needs to be taken that addressing the needs of disabled parents and young carers does not fall between stools.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/26">I cannot emphasise that point enough. Some young carers, when asked about assessments, said that social services decided that</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/27" class="indent">&quot;all was well because the young carer seemed to be coping&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/28">The report quotes one comment that</p>
	<p pid="a.50.1/29" class="indent">&quot;because we can cope day to day they say we can manage&mdash;but we need help as well&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" speakername="Annette Brooke" colnum="52"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0009.htm#07013038000597">
	<p pid="a.52.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his helpful intervention, and I agree that we must pay tribute to that invisible army of young carers for all that they do. We need a joined-up approach in education, health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/2">I have one particular example. The names have been changed. John's mum, Jackie, had a stroke and lost mobility. John, 13, was caring for mum, including helping her with intimate care such as using the toilet during the night. The provision of intimate care resulted in a deteriorating parent-child relationship, tiredness and behavioural difficulties in school. It encompassed all three strands: education, social care and health. The intervention needed to prevent John's excessive caring role was identified as night support for Jackie. However, Jackie did not qualify for night support from adult services in her own right, while children's services felt that it could not fund night support for an adult. The services debated who should pay while John carried on caring.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/3">I should therefore like every local authority to have a joint working protocol between children's and adult services, and perhaps to be inspected on their joint working. I should also like a commitment to review the effectiveness of the fair access to care services guidance in ensuring that every adult service asks all its clients, &quot;Are you a parent? How does your condition/disability/etc. affect you as a parent? And how can we support you as a parent?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/4">It would also be worth while reviewing the fact that 16 and 17-year-old carers, who try to juggle education and caring, lack an entitlement to carer's benefit. It makes no sense to give them a financial motivation to leave education when the Government are proposing education until age 18. The Government must consider in their new proposals how they will support young carers.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/5">We need a securely funded young carer service in every area. Young carers speak highly of their local young carer groups; they make such a difference to their lives. Many voluntary organisations are involved in the provision of such groups. They include the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, NCH, the children's charity, the Children's Society and Barnado's.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/6">The challenges that young carers face are beginning to be recognised, but there is still a lack of knowledge on the parts of families and of those people in the work force who could offer more support. The principles of practice that the Children's Society is developing should be included in the training of all relevant professionals. It is vital that front-line staff in education, health and social care are offered consistent training and access to ongoing information to deliver whole-family working and joint working between children's and adult services. Practitioners must understand the needs of young carers and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/7">I conclude by paying tribute to the enormous amount of good work that is done in many local authority areas by many organisations in the voluntary sector, particularly by the Princess Royal Trust, which has provided me with a great deal of material for today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/8">For the past few years, it has not been possible for a Minister to attend the festival about which I spoke earlier. I hope that the Minister present will be able to attend in the summer next year, because young people want to talk to people and they want us to listen, but most of all, they want action to make their lives better.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.1/1">I entirely understand the hon. Gentleman's points and where he is coming from. His is a heartfelt view, but we are not prescribing things from the centre for the reasons I have outlined regarding &quot;Every Child Matters&quot;. The practice is not to focus on particular staff for particular groups of children, but instead to ensure that every child does matter. Nevertheless, the hon. Gentleman makes an important point. It may well be that individual schools or local authorities wish to take a closer look at the matter. There may well be evidence of the practice working in places, and if that is the case, I would always be interested in hearing more and debating the issues with him. It is entirely fair for him to make such heartfelt points, but we have resisted dealing with the matter from the centre for the reasons I have already highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/2">We must continue to promote awareness of young carers' needs in other ways&mdash;for example, through personal, social and health education, the citizenship curriculum, the standards for qualified teacher status and in anti-bullying guidance&mdash;so that all schools and teachers are aware of the needs of young carers. Young carers are likely to be present in every secondary school and many primary schools, but we cannot always identify them as individuals and thus offer them direct personal help. Understandably, not everyone is either familiar or comfortable with the issues. There is clearly a case for confidence-building measures, so that young carers know that it will be okay to ask a teacher, or whoever, for help. They need to hear that message from schools, and from local children's services.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/3">We have to accept that sometimes things can be done better. There is excellent practice going on, but there are times when the system does not work for young carers in the way that it should. We cannot accept, for example, cases in which adult social services visit the disabled parent and ignore or neglect their carer's personal needs just because he or she is a child. Professionals cannot ignore the first-hand experience and knowledge of a young carer when compiling care plans for the adult.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-01-30a.59.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1989" speakername="John Robertson" colnum="59"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070130/halltext/70130h0010.htm#07013038000608">
	<p pid="a.59.1/1">My hon. Friend asks an important question. I hope and pray that the answer is: yes, the elections will be held and yes, they will be accountable. However, the sad fact is that although they will be held, they will not have the same accountability that we would expect in this country. It is for that reason that people such as ourselves have a job to do in raising the awareness of our Government and others, in order to help oversee the elections and see that they are as good as they can be.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">The system of management adopted is undoubtedly a more complex than might have been hoped for, but it is the only way in which local people will feel confident that the fees that they are asked to pay to run the water supply system are not spent foolishly, diverted to unrelated expenditure or even dropped off into somebody's private bank account, as happens all too often.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">Some days after our delegation visited the project in Kano, we visited another community called Iddo Sarki, which is just outside Abuja, the capital. There we saw what can unfortunately happen when the responsibility for water supply is left to the care of the local authority. We were shown several standpipes that had been supplied by the local government. Only two of six standpipes were in use, and even they were not working in anything like an efficient manner. We were told that the newest pumps had lasted for only a few days before breaking and that no one had ever fixed them. We saw that plastic piping similar to that which is used in guttering&mdash;very thin and unfit for purpose&mdash;had been laid partially below the ground in main thoroughfares. As one would expect, the piping had consequently been broken and become absolutely useless. Again, no one had come to relay or repair the piping.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4">We asked the people why they had not complained to their elected representatives and when their elected representatives had last visited their community. The villagers told us that they had not seen their elected representatives and that they had not been to the village. In fact, the only time an elected representative was seen or heard from was when there was an election and money was sent to the village to have a party. However, a party is no good to someone with no decent water to wash down the food with, even if they can afford it.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5">There is a serious problem in Nigerian political life, and a core reason why basic services are not being provided by authorities democratically responsible for communities such as those that we visited. I emphasise that our concerns are about not the original money, but what happens to it afterwards: people skimming off the top and diverting it to their own pockets. People then end up with thin piping&mdash;&quot;conduit&quot; as we would call it in this country&mdash;totally unfit for maintaining water pressure or, for that matter, having water run through it. The company that gets the job disappears and is never heard of again, a bit like the elected representatives. All that must be stopped. What are the UK Government doing to tackle the all-too-frequent corruption?</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/6">Another concern is that local officials lack the motivation to provide the services and local communities lack the sense of empowerment to demand their rights. In the case of water provision, there is a fundamental breakdown in the social contract between officials&mdash;both elected and appointed&mdash;and the people whom they are supposed to serve. Sadly, that is all too often true of the provision of many other basic services in Nigeria.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/7">The problem of poor access to water, as was pointed out repeatedly at the World Economic Forum just last week, is largely a problem of weak capacity and poor governance. Obviously, that is a highly unsatisfactory state of affairs. Although measures being taken in specific instances by the Department for International Development to recreate a more positive relationship are most welcome, and will contribute towards a renewed sense of empowerment in Wudil, the role that DFID can or even should play in intervening in the fundamental relationship between the people and Government of Nigeria is clearly limited.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/8">What role should the UK play in attempting to support an environment in which that fundamental relationship can become entrenched and improved? Groups such as the all-party group on Nigeria will continue to visit the country and talk to local people about their concerns. The group will revisit the communities that we have seen to find out how things have changed&mdash;hopefully, improved&mdash;since our previous visit. We will continue to write reports such as the one, soon to be launched, on the findings of our last visit and use them to ask the Nigerian Government what measures they will take to address the concerns expressed to us by the people we meet.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/9">We can also work to ensure that when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">the elections mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> take place, as they are scheduled to do in April this year, they do so in a free, fair and transparent manner. What are the Government doing to ensure that they will be free and fair? Lastly, we will continue to support and champion the efforts of DFID and other agencies like it.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/10">However, for now I should like to ask the Minister a few questions. What audit checks are the UK Government carrying out to ensure that projects are completed properly? How do the Government ensure that the right money goes to the right people and is used in the right places? Are regular checks carried out before and after the completion of projects? Given the partnership with the World Bank and the fact that countries other than the UK invest in Nigeria, does the Minister agree that the United Nations should consider establishing investment rules to ensure that money is not embezzled, but used to benefit the people of Nigeria and other countries?</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/11">Nigerians should have the opportunity to lift their heads above everyday survival needs and demand the wider accountability that they so sorely deserve. That should be possible in a country so rich in natural resources and human potential. I thank the Minister for his time. I hope that he will take a few minutes to respond to the points raised by me and my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.1/1">My hon. Friend is right that the private sector, be it multinational oil companies or Nigeria's own private sector, has a role to play and a responsibility to get involved in encouraging transparency, tackling corruption and promoting good governance. One of the most important ways in which it can do that, given the importance of oil to the Nigerian economy, is by supporting the extractive industries transparency initiative. The EITA process is backed by many Governments and private sector companies, and it is beginning to make a difference in terms of increased transparency, efforts to root out corruption and improvement in the use of auditing arrangements so that civil society can track how money raised through the exploitation of oil, for example, is spent and whether it is used for the purposes of all.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, North-West asked how we are supporting the elections. I hope that he will be encouraged to hear that we are working closely with the European Union and the Commonwealth to encourage international observation and to ensure that there is effective voter registration. He may not know that the voter registration process is due to finish today.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/3">We are spending some &pound;7 million to support the elections process. That support has two essential components. Some &pound;4.5 million is going to a consortium of civil society organisations, and we are working with the media and political parties to put in place the necessary conditions for a smooth elections process. The other &pound;2.5 million will help to ensure that the right organisations are in place with the right staff and the appropriate capacity so that the elections can run smoothly. Hence the spending on supporting the voter registration process, ensuring that women participate in the elections and that there is good domestic monitoring on the ground during the elections.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">When some of us were in Nigeria in November, we met with the electoral commission. There was a certain amount of dissatisfaction with the registration process. I agree with the Minister that the elections should go ahead, but there are problems. There is no doubt that the commission is very ambitious in what it is trying to do, but I doubt that it properly registered 130 million people, which is roughly the number of Nigerians.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.1/1">There has been an impassioned national debate about the benefits and burdens of the influx of people from eastern Europe since the EU enlargement of May 2004. Understandably, much of that has focused on the lack of Government preparedness given the unexpectedly large numbers that have arrived, from Poland and Lithuania in particular. The arrival to these shores of hard-working, committed, law-abiding young men and women who are willing and able to contribute to skilled, unskilled and semi-skilled employment in catering, construction, leisure and the hospitality industries, to name but a few, has clearly been a great boost to the United Kingdom's economy. Indeed, without such an influx, the Chancellor of the Exchequer's frequent boasts about strong and continuous economic growth would be somewhat muted.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/2">There has also been a darker side to the monumental human tide that has come into our country, and it is those problems that I wish to address. In the run-up to EU enlargement almost three years ago, my local authority, Westminster city council, warned repeatedly of the increased dangers of nationals from the new EU accession countries ending up sleeping rough on the streets and adding to instability as well as fuelling crime and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/3">Around the time of enlargement, the leader of Westminster city council, Sir Simon Milton, wrote to the then Home Secretary to warn him of the risks. In addition, I have submitted parliamentary questions over the past year about those who are described as A8 nationals&mdash;for those unaware of that term, it refers to people from the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia; the other two smaller accession countries from 2004, Malta and Cyprus, are not included in the definition.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/4">Naturally, those concerns have been compounded by the recent accession at the beginning of January of Bulgaria and Romania, the A2 nations, which have a total population of 35 million. Even during this month, we have seen evidence of many starting to arrive, although it is harder to track numbers as the coaches often come in via Germany. Last week some A2 families&mdash;not simply young men or women who were seeking work&mdash;pitched up at Charing Cross police station demanding accommodation. Although it is difficult to gauge exact numbers, five of the six people arrested recently in the Victoria area for persistent begging were from Romania.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/5">Needless to say it is central London&mdash;the most cosmopolitan melting pot in the country&mdash;that faces the greatest burden to its social services since the arrival of so many A8 nationals. That is particularly acute in relation to Romanians, for whom, unlike for Poles and Lithuanians, there is no significant settled UK community outside London. I should also stress at this juncture that the substantial increased workload has not lain exclusively on the shoulders of our local councils.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/6">Earlier this month I had the opportunity of speaking at great length with Sister Ellen Flynn, the chief executive of The Passage, which is an institution that proudly proclaims that it has helped homeless people since 1980. That charity in Victoria, which is sponsored predominantly by the Roman Catholic Church, has provided for the less fortunate in our society since the 1860s and is situated close to Victoria street, albeit on the other side of the street from the Minister. The Passage works alongside central Government in trying to give a hand-up to those in need with a view to ensuring that the homeless for whom it cares can return rapidly to a self-sufficient life, reliant neither on the state nor charitable giving. It is an organisation that is only a stone's throw from Westminster cathedral and only a five-minute walk from Victoria coach station, the preferred destination of many from Poland and Lithuania, and it has been under increasing pressure over the past three years. Naturally, neither The Passage, other charities nor Westminster city council are in a position simply to turn away those vulnerable A8 nationals who arrive in the country unable to support themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/7">Westminster city council has furnished the Home Office with a detailed report of the costs incurred in providing vital pastoral care and services. On several occasions, I have written to Home Office Ministers requesting future funding for additional police resources to tackle the increasing crime and antisocial behaviour related to the influx of A8 nationals. Approximately half of the funding needed has been confirmed and granted by the Department for Communities and Local Government, and I understand that at the end of last week the Home Office confirmed in writing that it would match that contribution to cover additional enforcement and repatriation costs incurred at a local level, which I shall describe in more detail later.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/8">Without continued funding at that level, or perhaps even at an enhanced level, Westminster city council will be forced to make cuts in other areas of its work for the indigenous council tax-paying population. Let us remember that those outgoings are not of Westminster council tax payers' making. To give credit where credit is due, I thank the Minister for the initial financial contribution. However, I have to say that we anticipate a worsening of the situation that I have described with the recent EU expansion and the freedom of movement extended to Romanian and Bulgarian citizens.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.0/1">We have similar problems in my constituency. I had a meeting last week with Janie Kidston and Ania Majcherek of the Upper Room at St. Saviour's church on Cobbold road. They deal with 130 homeless A8 nationals a day, serving them with meals. We have the Broadway centre, which, I was told, on one day alone dealt with 20 new clients who were A8 nationals. Again, that centre deals with homelessness and those with addiction problems. It certainly seems to me, and I wonder whether my hon. Friend would agree, that the Government are starting to get a grip on the problem but that they need to do a lot more and to wake up to the extent of the problems that we in inner London face.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.1/1">I endorse every word of my hon. Friend's comments. I should emphasise that the issue is not merely prevalent in inner London. Although as I mentioned it is inevitable that, as we are the great melting pot of this country, it will be an issue for the local London authorities&mdash;not only for Conservative-run authorities, but for those run by the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats as well&mdash;it is also a national problem. I ask the Minister to keep a close eye on developments and to take on board many of the concerns expressed by voluntary organisations and local authorities, which are able to watch as such things develop. As I have pointed out, one of our biggest concerns about Romanians is that there is no large settled community, as there is for Poles and Lithuanians, outside London, and we are now seeing families, and not just young men and women who wish to work in London, coming here and throwing themselves on the mercy of our social services.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">For almost three years, we seen up to 2,000 A8 nationals arriving every week into Victoria coach station. Many&mdash;the great majority&mdash;have friends and relatives in London, and many come with assured accommodation and with employment sorted out. However, a small and sizeable minority arrive without any means of support. Inevitably, many are from the most vulnerable groups and their personal, physical and mental capacity have a tendency quickly to deteriorate. They sleep on the streets, as they have no income, they tend either to beg or steal, and quickly become engaged in alcohol-fuelled assault and violence. They often seek food from the soup runs in large numbers, which also causes a rapid diminution in the quality of life of the local residential community as a result of aspects of their antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">Let me put that into context. Westminster city council received &pound;297,000 additional funding from the Home Office in 2005&mdash;the last full year for which I have figures&mdash;to tackle the problems surrounding the arrival of nationals from the original eight accession countries. That money was used to cover repatriation costs for those who wish to return home&mdash;a significant minority&mdash;to try to allow those who come here to deal with the reality of what survival in the UK is like and to tackle the increase in crime and antisocial behaviour related to the influx. The funding was, of course, for only a single year. Central Government's failure to fund local authorities properly and promptly&mdash;I suspect that Westminster city council is by no means alone in that regard&mdash;threatens such initiatives in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">As the Minister is aware, the law prevents nationals from A8 accession states from accessing benefits provided by local authorities to residents, as well as state benefits such as income support, shelter and drug treatment services. That has exacerbated the likelihood of A8 nationals descending into street life, as they have no other means of support. I know from my own experience that homelessness agencies are swamped, and the feedback that I receive from them shows that the failure of the Department for Work and Pensions to facilitate access to employment services has worsened the plight of those vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/5">An overview of the current situation makes for depressing reading. Towards the end of 2006, a detailed and comprehensive count of rough sleepers in Westminster revealed that nearly one in two were A8 nationals. That demonstrates an alarming trend in the number of A8 nationals living on our streets.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/6">Again, I give credit to the Government for what they have done&mdash;in this context, it is only fair. The recent trend contrasts with a reducing trend in the number of other rough sleepers, a decline that is testament to the effectiveness of public and voluntary sector interventions, including the Government's work on rough sleepers, which paid great dividends in the streets of central London for most of the first nine years of the Labour party's time in office. Many of the 300-odd rough sleepers counted in 2006 were Polish males, some of whom had been here for many months with little prospect of securing work and no recourse to public funds or social care assistance. The problem is inevitably reduced during winter months&mdash;a significant number go home because it is so cold&mdash;but those who stay are acutely vulnerable. They need to be looked after properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/7">Voluntary homelessness organisations are at breaking point because they have been inundated with requests for assistance and sustenance, leaving them less able to meet the needs of what might be described as their core client group. Many of those organisations have a range of support issues and they do not receive public funds. Sadly, in preparing for the debate I found that many local homelessness agencies have been forced to withdraw services from new arrivals from the accession states whom they deem to be not vulnerable. Given that the majority of arrivals are fit young men, very few qualify for support.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/8">Westminster city council works incredibly hard to tackle the needs of new arrivals, and over the past year, via funding secured from the Home Office under the invest to save scheme, it has managed to prevent nearly 400 A8 nationals from slipping into long-term rough sleeping. That increased funding allowed a secondee from the Department for Work and Pensions to be employed, who assisted more than 100 individuals in securing work. As a result, additional police community support officers were able to assist the existing police team in reducing the antisocial and criminal activities associated with rough sleeping.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/9">The Minister may be aware that, even when it was not my party's policy, I have always supported the police community support officers initiative. In that regard, they have done a tremendous job. Again, I thank the Home Office for its support. With 2,000 people arriving every week at Victoria coach station, short-term funding was vital in retaining the extra policing staff and interpreters required to manage the influx. However, a long-term solution needs to be found. In the meantime, I simply ask that the burden of looking after the homeless that arrive in this country does not fall so disproportionately on central London council tax payers.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/10">I take the opportunity to express a more general concern about the availability of housing in the capital. Paradoxically, despite the influx of skilled and semi-skilled workers from across the globe, London has the highest unemployment of any region in the UK. The fact of the matter is that many of those in London without a job are simply unemployable. They often have chaotic lifestyles. The great majority of London's unemployed lack the skills, the aptitude or the application to hold down a job of any description. However, many of them live in scarce council or social housing, where they benefit from security of tenure. As a result, the growing polarisation between rich and poor, which has been a characteristic of central London life for some years, is rapidly becoming an issue throughout the capital, and even beyond the M25.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/11">The London economy cannot cater for those without the skills and application to play a part in a globally competitive workplace. Our scarce social housing needs to be reserved for those working in the public sector or in relatively low-paid private sector jobs who make a contribution to the community at large. Indeed, many nurses, teachers and police officers who work in my constituency cannot afford to live within the boundaries of Greater London. The time is now right to enable central London's local authorities to offer council tenants, and potentially others in social housing, financial incentives in return for surrendering security of tenure on such scarce housing stock. Only then might London enjoy the balanced communities that will enable those dedicated people who provide such vital day-to-day services to live near where they work.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.1/1">The Minister is right about the generality of A8 nationals who are coming here, but many homelessness cases involve older men in their 30s or 40s with a limited knowledge of English. Typically, they come from eastern Poland or rural of Lithuania, but they come to Britain under false pretences&mdash;not their pretence, but the false advertising and the marketing documents that are sold to them. Not only the young are involved; some of those in real difficult in my constituency are middle aged.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that it is not only the younger and better skilled who face problems. Many have lower skills or, as he said, have poor English or face other challenges. It is important to ensure that we address both problems. We need to respond to the needs that arise, but we must also to try to discourage people who are not able to support themselves or take up employment from coming here in the first place. That is our clear policy approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/2">I shall continue my response to the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster. Although the overall impact of migration has been positive for Britain, the focus of today's debate is the small number who have been unable to access employment to support themselves and who therefore find themselves on the streets. Some may find themselves on the streets temporarily and are swiftly able to get back on their feet, perhaps with a good chance of getting a job. Others should not have come here. Perhaps they are too vulnerable or are for other reasons unable to take advantage of job opportunities in the capital and elsewhere in the country. Instead, they may need help to return to their home countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/3">The Government welcome nationals of countries within the European economic area, including the 2004 accession countries, who wish to come here to work or study or who are otherwise self-sufficient. As from <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-01">1 January 2007</phrase>, when Bulgaria and Romania joined the EU, the Government decided to limit access to our labour market for nationals of those countries for a transitional period.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/4">Regulations are in place to ensure that EEA nationals cannot come to the UK who have no intention of supporting themselves, nor will they be able to access the local authority housing and homelessness assistance funded by the UK taxpayer. Those who are working or self-employed, and their family members, are eligible to apply for assistance, but proper safeguards are important to ensure that the programme works as intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/5">The Department assesses the impact on homelessness services and on housing overall. Last August, research published by Homeless Link evidenced the issues of A8 nationals when using homelessness services. It suggested that, where there is an impact, it is mainly on London homelessness services rather than at a national level. The vast majority of people using homelessness services were able-bodied young men who were fit for work and who might, as I said earlier, be able to access jobs if they were given the right support. It is important to recognise that many people may not start off as vulnerable, but, if they live for long periods on the streets and face very difficult circumstances, they can become vulnerable and get into particularly difficult circumstances over time. That is an issue that agencies need to respond to.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/6">The most recent rough sleeper counts in Westminster suggest that there are around 30 rough sleepers on the streets from the A8 countries. It is important to look at the scale of the issue that we face. It is clear that Westminster faces many of the greatest pressures associated with homelessness, which is why we provided &pound;6.6 million for next year in homelessness grants to deal with the wider issues. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that huge progress has been made in dealing with rough sleeping, preventing homelessness and helping people off the streets and into proper accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/7">The investment put in alongside homelessness strategies has made a huge difference and the strength of those strategies has been that they focus on the individual causes of homelessness and on individual needs. Rather than adopting a blanket approach, consideration has been given to the particular circumstances of the individual homeless. That is the key to addressing the problems of people from A8 countries who are homeless.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/8">The Homeless Links research is to be welcomed as it provided important evidence regarding the impact on services. My Department has used that research when working with the local authorities in central London most affected by homeless A8 nationals. We have also used it to work across Government. The issues are wider than homelessness and include access to employment advice, which is important. The Department has worked with colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions to look at issues around access to jobcentre services, including Jobcentre Plus facilities. Many people are economic migrants who are looking for work, and help getting them into employment can prevent homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/9">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the invest to save programme set out by the Home Office a few years ago. That provided &pound;257,000 to Westminster city council, spread over a number of years, to implement a package of measures, including working with The Passage, and there was some success in working with that group. Part of that work included supporting people to return to their home country if it was inappropriate for them to provide for themselves or become self-sufficient here.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/10">The Department for Communities and Local Government has given &pound;100,000 in this financial year to continue to support A8s and my ministerial colleagues in the Home Office have just confirmed that they will provide an additional &pound;100,000 for 2007-08. In particular, that will provide interpretation services and dedicated police community support officers to assist and advise vulnerable people from the A8 countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/11">We have also announced an additional &pound;140,000 this year to other central London local authorities, including around &pound;20,000 for Hammersmith and Fulham, which was in recognition of the potential impact on homelessness services from A8 nationals. Additional funding this year is, of course, on top of more than &pound;20 million of grant funding from my Department to London boroughs towards the prevention and reduction of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/12">A further &pound;8.7 million has gone directly to the voluntary sector in London, in which many people work directly with the street homeless. It is important to recognise that the vast majority of investment that goes into homelessness services is about addressing the needs of those who are most vulnerable and who may have been in the capital for a long time&mdash;either long-standing residents or people who have ended up in London after travelling from other parts of the country. The number of A8 nationals who need support is still small in proportion to the number of homeless people being helped across the capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October 2006</phrase>, the Government announced a package of measures on managing migration to the UK. Last December, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government met local government representatives to explore some issues facing the sector in managing migration. Many towns and cities, including Westminster, are keen to work with us on developing best practice and in taking forward the work of the Improvement and Development Agency and the Audit Commission to ensure that residents can work as part of a programme and address the issues raised by migration.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/14">We know that migration can have a hugely positive impact on local economies, and to provide support for local services it is important to ensure that the issue is handled, addressed and managed in a way that can benefit all the community. The newly launched Commission on Integration and Cohesion will look at how local authorities and community organisations can play a greater role in ensuring that new migrants learn English and contribute to our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/15">The hon. Gentleman raised wider issues around housing pressures in his constituency and across the capital in general. He will know that the Government strongly feel that we face housing pressures&mdash;not simply in London, but across the country&mdash;as a result of the ageing population and the fact that more people are living alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/16">There are a series of reasons for the growth in housing demand, and the impact has been to push up house prices. House building across the country has not kept up with rising housing demand, so it is important that we increase the number of new homes built each year. Nationwide, we need to build around 200,000 new homes a year and we should be building more private, shared ownership and social housing. We need all three types of housing, and that is also the case in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/17">The hon. Gentleman raised the particular challenges faced by those on middle incomes or those who are public sector workers. They can find themselves pressurised in high-cost parts of the capital where they earn too much to be eligible for social housing, but simply cannot afford the high house prices. That is why we have supported the expansion of shared ownership.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.2/18">Local authorities should also look at other measures, such as supporting mobility to other parts of the capital and to other areas. It also important to recognise that people from every income group have needs and that we should ensure that we are helping those on lower and middle incomes at the same time. We have asked John Hills to look more widely at the long-term approach to social housing to ensure that we have mixed communities. We need to build more homes of all kinds in the capital and across the country to meet housing needs for the future.</p>
