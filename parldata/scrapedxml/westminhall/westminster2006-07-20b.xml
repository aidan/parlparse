	<p pid="b.141.2/1">I am delighted that today's debate, which has such importance for the people of Scotland, is being chaired by an hon. Member from another proud Celtic nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.2/2">I thank the Minister for making Government time available for the House to debate this important matter. The Select Committee on Scottish Affairs had asked for a 90-minute Scottish Grand Committee debate on the report from the Arbuthnott commission, so we were pleased to be offered a three-hour debate instead.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.2/3">The Commission on Boundary Differences and Voting Systems, also known as the Arbuthnott commission, was established by the Secretary of State in May 2004 to consider the consequences of having four separate voting systems for elections in Scotland and having different constituency boundaries for elections to Westminster and to Holyrood. The Commission was established in the wake of the Scottish Affairs Committee report entitled &quot;Coincidence of Parliamentary Constituency Boundaries in Scotland and the Consequences of Change&quot;, which followed the Government's decision to retain the number of Members of the Scottish Parliament at 129 and the provisional proposals of the Boundary Commission for Scotland to reduce the number of Scottish constituencies represented at Westminster from 72 to 59.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.2/4">After an 18-month inquiry, the commission published its report, &quot;Putting Citizens First: Boundaries, Voting and Representation in Scotland&quot;, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January 2006</phrase>. The commission's main recommendations included one that the current mixed member system for electing the Scottish Parliament should be retained, but with open lists to increase voter choice.</p>

	<p pid="b.141.4/1">I thank my hon. Friend for bringing an important point to my attention. I will address it later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.4/2">The commission also recommended that constituency and regional boundaries for the Scottish Parliament should be based on local authority areas rather than Westminster constituencies, with the regions revised to better reflect natural local communities; that candidates for election to the Scottish Parliament should not be prohibited from standing in a constituency and on the regional list; that clearer and more positive roles should be developed for constituency and regional MSPs; that the single transferable vote system should be introduced for European parliamentary elections; and that Scottish Parliament and local government elections should be held on different days.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.4/3">In February this year, the Scottish Affairs Committee took evidence from Sir John Arbuthnott, the chairman of the commission, and from one of its members, Dr. Nicola McEwen. During the evidence session, members of the Committee raised several matters of concern about the commission's report, including coterminosity of Westminster and Holyrood constituency boundaries; the remit of the commission and honouring the devolution settlement; the voting system for elections to the Scottish Parliament; the boundaries and size of Holyrood constituencies; Scottish local government elections; wasted votes; the multiplicity of MSPs representing Scottish Parliament constituencies; voter confusion; dual candidacy for elections to the Scottish Parliament; and elections to the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.141.4/4">Those are the facts. I am sure that if they catch your eye, Mr. Caton, members of the Committee will to express their own concerns, but I would now like to make a few observations on my own account, rather than as the Chairman of the Select Committee. I am greatly concerned that the Arbuthnott commission has simply not resolved three fundamental issues. The first is the complicated and confusing system that we have in Scotland, with four different voting systems for the four different types of elections. We have STV for local government elections; proportional representation for elections to the European Parliament; a mixture of first past the post and a list system for elections to the Scottish Parliament; and first past the post for elections to the House of Commons.</p>

	<p pid="b.146.1/1">Yes, if the people in England want devolution for the regions and want to bring power closer to the people, nobody is preventing them from taking that option. In fact, if Conservative Members of Parliament want to opt for devolution and want people to be in charge of their own destinies in the regions, we would be happy to support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.1/2">As you will know better than I do, Mr. Caton, the Government of Wales Bill seeks to rectify a similar situation concerning elections to the National Assembly for Wales. The Bill includes clauses to prohibit prospective Welsh Assembly Members standing in individual constituencies and on a regional list. I am pleased for the people of Wales that such sensible legislation has been introduced&mdash;well done. I have no hesitation in following a good example, wherever it comes from, be it Wales, England or any other part of the United Kingdom. I hope that the Bill becomes law shortly in Wales. However, if dual candidacy is not considered acceptable for the people of Wales, why is considered perfectly acceptable for the people of Scotland? I hope that the Minister will be able to answer me on this issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.146.2/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that the whole issue of dual candidacy would cease to be relevant if the Arbuthnott Commission had recommended, as it should have done, STV for Holyrood elections? Everybody would be elected on the same basis, but the system would still be proportional and would therefore fairly represent the views of the people of Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.147.1/1">An even better proposal came from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase>, who is unfortunately not present. He suggested that if there must be a proportionality element, we could elect 118 by first past the post and 11 using proportionality.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/2">If Holyrood insisted that it could not do with fewer than the current 129 MSPs, my solution would be that the large rural constituencies could elect five MSPs to represent two Westminster constituencies. In paragraph 4.34, the commission set out comprehensively the benefits of electing the Scottish Parliament by STV, citing, for example, that it would remove the problem of two classes of MSP, which has been mentioned many times during this debate, and that it would remove confusion over the use of a &quot;second&quot; vote. Unfortunately, the commission seemed to lose its nerve, and paragraph 4.35 raises a number of what it describes as</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/3" class="indent">&quot;weaknesses when compared to a mixed member system&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/4">One weakness mentioned was that it complicates the act of voting. What is more complicated than having four voting systems for four types of elections?</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/5">I believe the Commission missed a great opportunity, by not recommending the obvious solution to voter confusion. If we retain the current situation, the Scottish Labour party has made the sensible suggestion that voters should cast only one vote&mdash;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> made a good point about that. The vote should be assumed to be also a vote for their preferred party. Paragraph 4.40 of the commission's report quotes from the Scottish Labour party's submission, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.147.1/6" class="indent">&quot;There is potential to remove the need for a second vote and allocate the List MSPs on the basis of the constituency vote. This is a straight-forward measure that would simplify the voting system for those participating whilst still ensuring that the electoral system maintains significant proportionality.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.148.1/1">I am well aware that the Conservative party made a similar proposal. When we make proposals on which there is consensus with the Conservatives, I become a bit doubtful about whether we are doing the right thing. That is why I did not mention this proposal in my submission.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.1/2">By reducing voter confusion, I believe we could maximise voter participation. My third fundamental issue is that there are two classes of MSPs, as many colleagues have mentioned: the constituency MSP and the list MSP. In paragraphs 4.23 and 4.24, the commission rightly highlights the less than clear role of the list MSP, and that constituency MSPs have accused list MSPs of cherry-picking individual cases, about which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> made an eloquent point. The commission does not actually address the issue. The report is therefore disappointing, as it raises the problem, but does not seek to offer a solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.1/3">The final point I would make is about the e-counting of votes. I hope that the Minister will use today's debate as the opportunity to bring the House up to date on what is happening in this area. In particular, I would like to know who will take responsibility if e-voting does not work as well as intended? Will it be the Scotland Office or the Scottish Executive?</p>
	<p pid="b.148.1/4">I am sure many other hon. Members wish to speak in this debate, so I will now draw my remarks to a conclusion. As I said earlier, this is an important debate and I look forward to hearing what those on the Front Benches and other hon. Members have to say.</p>

	<p pid="b.148.2/1">It is pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1985" name="Mohammad Sarwar">the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar)</phrase> who said some sterling things about STV. I hope to convince him to continue down that lonely path on the Labour Back Benches because I think he is on to something that could be fruitful.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.2/2">I congratulate Sir John Arbuthnott and his commission on a good and measured report. It makes a number of useful and positive recommendations that I believe will help the cause of Scottish democracy. It also deals with a few myths that were beginning to emerge, particularly among Labour Members. It debunked those myths constructively and positively. Sir John was given the massive task of looking at boundaries, voting and representation in Scotland and trying to put the voter first. This is a good report and Sir John went about his business in the diligent and professional way that we expected from one of the most respected academics. It is a testament to him that we are still debating his report a few months later and kicking around some of the issues to ensure that we try to improve on some of his work.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.2/3">The report is good, but we do not agree with everything in it and there are some issues that I wish he had included, particularly STV, which the hon. Member for Glasgow, Central mentioned, and some that I wish he had emphasised a little more. It is worth looking at the background and the context.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.2/4">Arbuthnott was asked to produce his report because of demand by hon. Members in this House, particularly Labour Members. I clearly remember them coming to the House week in, week out, saying that something must be done and the matter must be looked at. They came up with stories of constituents who were perplexed, confused and anxious about the different voting systems, coterminosity and so on, and demanded that the then Secretary of State for Scotland, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1981" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh, South-West (Mr. Darling)</phrase> do something about it. To his credit, he acted on those concerns and asked Sir John Arbuthnott to set up his commission. It was important that the commission was to be consensual, cross-party and independent, and that was the case because all the parties were represented and all Scottish interests were reflected.</p>
	<p pid="b.148.2/5">The commission worked diligently and I was particularly impressed by the way in which it sought the advice and views of focus groups and consulted all political parties. I think there were three meetings at Dover house to discuss those issues, and the report fairly and accurately represents the evidence.</p>

	<p pid="b.157.0/1">If it was rigged, it was rigged by the hon. Gentleman's hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, who set up the remit of the commission. The Scottish National Party did not do it&mdash;the Secretary of State and the Scotland Office did it. There is no point in saying that it is an issue for me. The hon. Gentleman should direct his points to his hon. Friend, the Minister, and see what response he gets. He will I am sure do that when the Minister gets to his feet, but it is not an issue for me.</p>
	<p pid="b.157.0/2">I realise that I have been speaking for some time, Mr. Caton, so I shall conclude. I have been disappointed by some of the remarks that have been made about Arbuthnott. The remarks that have been made along the lines of &quot;an affront to democracy&quot; about dual candidacy do hon. Members no favours. Arbuthnott looked at the issues in the cold light of day, independently and consensually, and drew his conclusions. The affront to democracy, as I have said, is our role here in this Parliament. That is what must be addressed&mdash;not the fables about dual candidacy. The real issue is the voting rights of Scots Members in this place. After the opinion poll and the evidence that a majority of people in Scotland favour independence, we are now edging forward to somewhere where both our nations will have mutual self-respect and normality and be good neighbours. England will lose its surly lodger and gain a good neighbour. That day is coming soon.</p>

	<p pid="b.159.2/1">I agree with you, Mr. Caton. The hon. Gentleman makes my point for me. What we should not fear is having that debate. There should not be a conspiracy of silence between the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat, and Scottish National parties as to why these differences occur. We should just have an open and honest debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.2/2">I want to move specifically to the Arbuthnott report; that has brought a smile to the Minister's face. It is important that people know who represents them. In the south-east and east we have proportional representation for the selection of MEPs. There is absolutely no accountability. It used to be case before that system was brought in that people had a vague notion who their MEP was. They knew who was representing them in Europe but now they have no notion at all. You could stop a thousand people in Broxbourne, Cambridge and so on and ask them who is their MEP and I doubt that one would have any idea, because there is no accountability.</p>
	<p pid="b.159.2/3">I urge the Minister, when he is considering voting systems in Scotland especially for local elections, to think how important it is for people locally to know who their councillor is and to be able to put a name, a face and a party to that person. Although STV may have worked and probably does work at a national level in Scotland, taking it down to a local government level would be making things just a little too granular.</p>

	<p pid="b.160.4/1">Possibly on a future occasion we will hear the hon. Gentleman's wife's view of midges.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.4/2">I am speaking in an Adjournment debate on the last Thursday of the Session, which the Government gave us as an alternative to a meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee. I am not sure that that option has been as successful as it might have been. Resurrecting the Scottish Grand Committee in order to have more regular debates on Scottish issues in Westminster is perhaps something that should be considered further.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.4/3">I want to consider the question of Arbuthnott in the context of the points that I made earlier about it having been a fix from the very beginning. The results were determined by the make up of the Committee, but in particular by the remit which ruled out any re-examination of proportional representation for the Scottish Parliament. If, during consideration of how to harmonise voting systems, one system cannot be considered, matters will be skewed towards a proportional bent. I regret that, and the way in which consideration was undertaken without proper debate early in the process. I worry that some people deliberately seek to drive a wedge between Westminster and Holyrood, accentuating not only disagreements but differences.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.4/4">On boundaries, there would have been more opportunities to work with our Scottish Parliament colleagues had we shared the same or contiguous boundaries. Whether there were two Westminster Members to four Scottish Parliament Members, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1985" name="Mohammad Sarwar">the Member for Glasgow, Central (Mr. Sarwar)</phrase> suggested, or one Westminster constituency with two Members of the Scottish Parliament and a smaller number of top-ups, as others have suggested, we would work more closely than we do now in our devolved and disparate state. We must consider whose interests are served by driving that wedge between us.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.4/5">I do not support the first-past-the-post system, but Professor Arbuthnot and his committee did not adequately address two issues that arise from the two-ballot system. First, that system creates two classes of MSP: the first-class MSPs from the constituency section, and the top-up MSPs, who regard themselves as second-class, because they spend so much time trying to become first-class MSPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.4/6">I represented the parliamentary constituency of Glasgow Pollok until last year's general election, and I still represent a large chunk of it. Back then, it was noticeable that Johann Lamont, the Labour and Co-operative party MSP for that constituency, was frequently pursued by two list MSPs. One, Tommy Sheridan, was elected for the Scottish Socialist party. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is noticeable that the very mention of his name brings laughter from all parties in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.160.4/7">I should clarify &quot;pursued&quot;. Mr. Sheridan sought regularly to attend the same meetings as Johann Lamont, and he presented himself as the MSP for Glasgow Pollok. Kenny Gibson, a list MSP for the Scottish National party and a councillor in part of the Glasgow Pollok constituency, also attended many meetings in the area, similarly presenting himself as the MSP for Glasgow Pollok. Mr. Sheridan and Mr. Gibson stood for Glasgow Pollok in the subsequent Scottish Parliament elections. I am glad to say that they were roundly defeated. However, they spent a long period trying to persuade the electorate that they were MSPs for that area. Few if any MSPs elected by first-past-the-post seek to become list MSPs, which indicates their priorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.161.0/1">I do not understand the hon. Gentleman's point, which others make, too, because the Scottish Parliament has a corporate body on which the Labour party is represented. That body has made rules about how MSPs may act, but despite such concerns, it has not moved forward and the hon. Gentleman's Labour colleagues in the Scottish Parliament have not brought any pressure on the correct forum, the corporate body, to make clearer the rules about the roles of regional and constituency MSPs. Even without the Arbuthnot committee, if the Scottish Parliament were sitting, that could be done tomorrow.</p>

	<p pid="b.162.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman assumes that the second vote will be first and the first vote second, will he clarify how it will make any difference to people casting their votes? They will regard the vote that they cast for the first-past-the-post seat, the first-class seat, as the most important. They will still have to choose where to cast their second vote, even though it might be first on the ballot paper. They will know, because we will tell them, that in Glasgow, there is no point voting Labour in the second ballot, so if they want their vote to count, they will have to identify someone else to vote for.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/2">It is widely known that I was always in favour of the Co-operative party standing in the second ballot in parts of Scotland where it would have been beneficial. I am a Labour and Co-operative Member of Parliament at Westminster. It makes sense in such circumstances for the parties to run joint candidates. It would make equal sense in Glasgow to run separate candidates next time, with the Labour party not standing in the second ballot. The strategy might apply elsewhere, too. My main regret is that the issue has not been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.162.2/3">Arbuthnot ought to have considered other issues, too, such as the discrepancy in constituency sizes. The Liberals have an MSP elected for Orkney. Had the same number of votes been cast in East Kilbride for that Liberal candidate, he would have come not first, second, third or fourth, but fifth. It seems unfair that constituency sizes are skewed in favour of some areas rather than others. Arbuthnot ought to have examined the issue more carefully.</p>

	<p pid="b.163.1/1">There are undoubtedly difficulties in those areas. I am not entirely sure how best they ought to be addressed, as two conflicting issues have to be dealt with at the same time. One is sparsity, rurality and so on, and the other is the question of equal votes of equal value. The two are clearly incompatible and the fact that Arbuthnott did not consider the issue at all seems to be a noticeable omission.</p>
	<p pid="b.163.1/2">I recognise that those who represent scattered and widespread constituencies, if they were given equal numbers of electors, would certainly require additional resources to ensure that they could to provide a decent service to their constituents. When the European Parliament was elected on a first-past-the-post basis, Dr. Ewing, who represented Argyll and the Highlands, if I remember correctly, was given a large amount of additional resources to allow her to travel though her constituency and to employ additional staff to serve that widespread area. I am not sure what exactly the balance ought to be, but it is undoubtedly an issue and it is to be regretted that the Arbuthnott commission did not examine it in any way whatsoever.</p>

	<p pid="b.165.1/1">Yes, that is right. It is simple for the elector to use but to explain the effect of their vote is actually quite complex. Basically, it is impossible to predict the outcome of their vote as party A might lose a constituency seat to party B, which could mean that party C would receive an extra seat through the list. The effects of the system are simply bizarre. In the west of Scotland region, for example, the Labour party won all the constituency seats in 1999 and lost one in 2003. If Labour was to lose more constituency seats, it would not gain corresponding seats on the list. However, the party that gained the corresponding seats on the list might be entirely different from the one that gained the constituency seats. The knock-on effects of parties losing constituency seats are impossible to predict.</p>

	<p pid="b.187.1/1">I am being invited to speculate on the outcome of a request, which may or may not happen as a result of some negotiations that have yet to occur following an election that has not even happened yet. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for regarding that as one hypothetical question too many.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.1/2">The Scotland Act is entirely clear; it was born out of the discussions of the Scottish Constitutional Convention that took place for many years and to which his party were honourable participants, with my party, the trade unions, the churches, civic society and all those who had Scotland's best interests at heart. It was a source of great regret at the time, and it remains so, that two parties refused to take part in the constitutional convention: the Scottish National party stood on the sidelines moaning and whingeing because, given the opportunity of engaging in a debate and actually having some influence, it chose to stand to one side, and the Tory party, which was dead agin the whole notion of devolution from the start and opposed it tooth and nail. It is now embarking on a policy choice that will inevitably lead to the break-up of the United Kingdom. As I said in Scottish questions last week, I well understand why the Scottish National party supports that as it is in its interest to make Parliament unworkable, to create multiple categories of MPs from Scotland, from Wales, from Northern Ireland and from London.</p>
	<p pid="b.187.1/3">Where will it end? I firmly wager that, once we have multiple categories of MP, those living in the countryside in farming communities will ask why people in towns and cities are voting on agricultural matters that do not affect them. People living in fishing communities will ask why MPs in land-locked constituencies are voting on issues that do not affect them&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.188.1/1">The hon. Gentleman gave the very interesting example in his speech of the smoking ban. He seemed to be suggesting that Scottish MPs had voted on it was a discrete Bill. It was not; the smoking ban was a measure contained in the Health Improvement and Protection Bill, which had lots of clauses that applied in Scotland. His proposal is not English votes for English Bills, because not even his party could certify that Bill as an England-only Bill. It was a clause within a Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.188.3/1">I will give way in a moment. Not only will we have multiple categories of MP voting on different Bills under the hon. Gentleman's proposal, if we take the smoking ban as an example there will be multiple categories of MP, some voting on some clauses of the Bill and some voting on other clauses, because the smoking ban in that Bill does not apply in Northern Ireland, they would have to vote on different clauses.</p>
	<p pid="b.188.3/2">Can the hon. Gentleman accept that in attempting to answer what he perceives to be an anomaly in the West Lothian question, the solution he proposes can be graphically described as a constitutional abortion, although frankly I think that phrase is infelicitous? He picked the example of the smoking ban, which was a measure that applied only to England in a UK Bill, and that further demonstrates&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.189.0/1">With the leave of the House, Mr Caton. In reference to comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" name="Alan Reid">the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr. Reid)</phrase> about coterminus boundaries. I believe that I have had a different experience in my constituency and in Glasgow where people are really confused about boundaries. I am glad that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> shares that opinion. The issue of coterminus boundaries has to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.0/2">I do not think that the Minister has touched on the issue of dual candidacy. It is very confusing for the electorate when a candidate who is defeated in the first-past-the-post system then becomes a Member of the Scottish Parliament. I have experienced that in both my present and previous constituency of Glasgow, Govan where the leader of the Scottish National party was defeated twice by the Govan electorate and then became the MSP for Glasgow. That is confusing for the electorate and needs to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> made the point that the Labour party is playing politics, and I know that anyone who lives on this planet or in Scotland has realised that the new system introduced for elections to the Scottish Parliament has benefited every political party in Scotland at the expense of the Scottish Labour party. I do not understand how the hon. Gentleman can make that allegation against the Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="b.189.0/4">I genuinely believe that STV in Scotland for elections to the European Parliament would increase the turnout&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.189.0/5" class="italic">It being half-past Five o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
