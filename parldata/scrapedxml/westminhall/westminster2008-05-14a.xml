	<p pid="a.418.0/1">I had not intended to speak, but I saw my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase> speaking on the monitor earlier and it struck me that I should congratulate him on making such a good speech on an important subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/2">CDC representatives visited me some three or four months ago and took me through their projects and plans across the world, particularly in Africa. I subsequently visited the great lakes region of Africa, as I do from time to time, as my hon. Friend the Minister knows because he responded recently to a debate on that subject. The important thing about the CDC&mdash;I was not aware of it beforehand&mdash;is that it applies business assumptions to potentially emerging economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/3">Rwanda is a great case in point, because when considering central Africa and the great lakes region, one tends to focus on the poverty and the terrible conditions&mdash;the violence that still exists in the eastern Congo area, and so forth&mdash;and forget that in the small country of Rwanda there is a potentially emerging economy. Among all the investors going into the region, although there are not that many, the CDC is one of the most important. I was fortunate and privileged enough to have breakfast last week with President Paul Kagame during his visit to London. We spoke for five to 10 minutes specifically about the CDC and how important priming investment is. My right hon. Friend mentioned that. When the CDC invests, as it has done in a fund in Rwanda, through Actis, and through that into a bank that is developing new products, it encourages other companies worldwide to come in as well. The CDC has a good reputation and one hopes that private sector organisations follow it.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/4">I understand that most of the investment going into countries such as Rwanda goes into the services industry. However, investments are by no means constrained in that area. It just happens that in Rwanda, which I know a bit about, investment goes to telecoms, banking and to the emerging capital to buy such service products.</p>
	<p pid="a.418.0/5">I wanted to make not so much a speech as an extended comment to congratulate my right hon. Friend on initiating the debate. It caught my eye, and I had not realised that it was due to take place. I listened to him, but I am not aware of the internal and organisational issues, and the questions marks about the CDC's future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-14a.420.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1965" speakername="Michael Moore" colnum="420"  time="010:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080514/halltext/80514h0002.htm#08051456000463">
	<p pid="a.420.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow on from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1983" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk (Mr. Joyce)</phrase>, and I pay tribute to him for the significant work that he and his colleagues do on the all-party groups on Africa. He referred to his close interest in Rwanda, but I know that his interest extends to the whole region. I am delighted that he could contribute to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/2">The hon. Gentleman is not the first hon. Member to be drawn into the Chamber by the oratory and approach of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1967" name="Tom Clarke">the right hon. Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>. I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on securing the debate, and pay tribute to his sterling work over many years. He was able to draw attention to some of that in his speech. His legacy for all of us in the House is being able to monitor how Britain moves towards achieving its share of the millennium development goals and the like. He gave a comprehensive overview of some of the challenges still facing much of the developing world, and the importance of private capital and other organisations, particularly the CDC, in helping to achieve those aims. We owe him our gratitude for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/3">Like the right hon. Gentleman, I congratulate the CDC on its significant achievement of reaching the age of 60. That is a significant milestone in anyone's life&mdash;I have not quite reached it&mdash;not least for a public body. As he said, the CDC has been reorganised six or seven times over the years, and the question is what might happen next. I shall return to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/4">I recognise that the public sector and the Government can play an important role in conjunction with the private sector in an area where capital may be in short supply. The challenge for the CDC and its ilk is surely to demonstrate how they are different&mdash;what they add to the overall process&mdash;by showing that without them, the investment would not have happened, or perhaps not in that form, without the tough ethical business arrangements that it seeks to put in place, or that the investment acts as a magnet to draw in other investors to help the economies of particular parts of the developing world to grow, as the hon. Gentleman highlighted. One of the challenges for the CDC is to demonstrate that in each of those areas it is a champion and market leader, without which much of the investment would not take place. Perhaps it must also demonstrate thought leadership to challenge the rest of the investment community to invest in particular ways. It should consider its infrastructure investments to ensure that they are sustainable, by investing as much in railways as much as it does in road systems and transport hubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/5">There is a lot potential, and with due respect to the CDC's management team, it is not always obvious in its annual review and broader detail of the annual accounts that that is what it is doing. None the less, the chairman, Sir Malcolm Williamson, highlights in the latest review that the CDC's</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/6" class="indent">&quot;central purpose remains unchanged: sustainable economic development in the poorer countries of the developing world through responsible investment in the private sector.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/7">We all support that. The report also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/8" class="indent">&quot;CDC has a long history of putting capital to work in some of the world's most challenging economies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/9">That perhaps encapsulates its unique role.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/10">The figures are impressive and the right hon. Gentleman referred to a few of them. For example, &pound;1.4 billion has been committed to 42 fund managers who are investing in 100 funds, and the asset base has increased two and a half times since 2004 to &pound;2.7 billion. The report properly highlights that at the end of 2008, the investment policy and arrangements that were put in place at demerger will come to an end. That must introduce some uncertainty, and, like the right hon. Gentleman, I hope that at the conclusion of this short debate, the Minister will be in a position to address that uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" name="Jim Sheridan">The hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire, North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> and others highlighted the issue of whether the CDC is ripe for privatisation. We should bear in mind that the Treasury has just forked out an unscheduled &pound;2.7 billion for the great Crewe tax giveaway&mdash;every little helps, perhaps. The CDC's chief executive raised the issue of privatisation and put it in the public domain when he was interviewed on the &quot;Today&quot; programme in April, and he certainly did not rule it out. He indicated that it had been considered, that it had advantages, that it would be good for the public, that it would provide an opportunity for the Government to raise money, and that it would leave the CDC intact to continue investing in the poorest countries. It would be interesting to know what lies behind the choice of some of that vocabulary, and perhaps the Minister will tell us. We must be mindful that privatisation is a serious option, but the House is not at this stage in a position to judge whether it is a good move.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/12">In an attempt to understand more about the companies that the CDC deals with, at the start of the process I tabled a series of parliamentary questions on it. I sought to get copies of the accounts of the many different subsidiaries of the CDC placed in the Library of the House. The Secretary of State responded to my question by stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/13" class="indent">&quot;CDC had 79 subsidiary companies at <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-31">31 December 2007</phrase>...Where they are required to do so by their relevant regulatory authorities, these subsidiary companies file their accounts in those countries and with those authorities. Accounts are therefore not available from CDC, but from the regulatory authorities in the countries in question.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-03-20.1273"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 March 2008; Vol. 473, c. 1273W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/14">I was completely taken aback by that answer because it struck me as strange that the CDC does not itself have any copies of those subsidiary accounts here in London. From time to time, I am forced to disclose that in anther life I was a chartered accountant. I paid my dues and spent more hours than is reasonable auditing companies across the United Kingdom. I cannot remember an occasion when the parent company in a group of companies did not have the formal statutory accounts of each of its subsidiaries, even if they were just filed away and gathering dust in the corner.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/15">I wrote to the Secretary of State and asked whether he would address that point. He has not yet answered&mdash;perhaps it will come following this debate. However, I also asked for further information on the details of the subsidiaries and what regulatory authorities they were registered with. He responded by stating:</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/16" class="indent">&quot;CDC has confirmed that there is no requirement for the company to hold the information on the regulatory authorities with which their accounts are filed. However, they do require subsidiary companies themselves to comply with their respective local country requirements on regulatory norms for filing and submission of accounting information.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-04-03.1226"><i>Official Report</i>, 3 April 2008; Vol. 474, c.1226W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/17">A list of the subsidiaries was appended to that response. If one looks patiently at the subsidiaries, about eight or nine of them are registered in the United Kingdom. Even if we accept what has been said about the other companies, I still find it a little strange that the subsidiary accounts for the UK companies are not available for the CDC.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-14a.429.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" speakername="Gareth Thomas" colnum="429"  time="010:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080514/halltext/80514h0003.htm#08051456000475">
	<p pid="a.429.1/1">One reason why I welcome the debate is that it has given us the opportunity to acknowledge the considerable contribution that has been made by existing staff at the CDC, to whom I again pay tribute. However, we should also recognise that we need those talented individuals to continue to work in the most challenging circumstances if we are to maximise the opportunities that the corporation provides as our development efforts go forward. I shall reflect more generally on my hon. Friend's point&mdash;although we should celebrate the 60th anniversary and 60 years of progress, we also need to look at how we can use the occasion to concentrate on what else the CDC should do.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.1/2">As my right hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill said, the organisation has a distinguished history. It has taken several forms since it was founded in 1948 as Britain's first development institution through to its present incarnation. Rightly, my right hon. Friend said that throughout its 60 years, it has had the same mission&mdash;to reduce poverty by promoting economic growth in poor countries. However, as he acknowledged, ideas on how best to tackle poverty in developing countries have evolved in those 60 years. From a belief that the developing world should produce the commodities and raw materials that industrialised countries need, we are now convinced that the way to defeat poverty is to produce more sustainable, broader-based economic growth in poor countries, and to bring poorer countries into the global economy by increasing trade and investment. Such sustainable growth can be achieved only by building a sound private sector, which provides the type of jobs that we would recognise and generates commerce and trade. Our approach to poverty, and therefore the way in which the CDC mission is implemented, has changed to reflect that. From being an occasional source of credit, often to agricultural enterprises such as tea plantations, the corporation now provides investment capital to help businesses in poorer countries to grow and develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.429.1/3">The value of the corporation's investments stands at some &pound;2.7 billion. Of course, agriculture&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-14a.444.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="444"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080514/halltext/80514h0005.htm#08051456000496">
	<p pid="a.444.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention and I completely agree with him; I intended to mention that point later.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/2">The hon. Gentleman's intervention leads nicely on to the next part of my speech, which is to point out that Royal Mail is at a serious disadvantage compared with its competitors. It has to deliver mail to every home in the country. That obligation is often called &quot;the last mile&quot;, although in the case of my constituency &quot;the last hundred miles&quot; would be more accurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/3">The private sector clearly picks the profitable side of the business. There will never be competition to deliver mail to rural areas, which is the expensive side of the business. Going back to the Fionnphort example that I gave earlier, we will never see two mail delivery vans rushing nose to tail down the single track road to Fionnphort. That scenario conjures up an image of the driver of the leading van ignoring all the signs urging him to be a courteous driver and to use the passing places to allow overtaking. However, that scenario will never arise; deliveries to Fionnphort will always be left to Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/4">It is evident that Royal Mail requires more investment if it is to continue to deliver the USO without constant and large increases in the price of a stamp, so there are some issues that I would like the Government, the regulator and the review panel to consider. First, there is what is known as the &quot;access headroom&quot; rule. Royal Mail is required by its licence to maintain a minimum gap, known as the headroom, between the prices that it charges retail customers and the amount that it can charge its wholesale customers to use its network. The access headroom regime has paved the way for the fast growth of upstream competition&mdash;a rate of growth that is far ahead of all predictions.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/5">I understand that no other postal market in the world has an access headroom regime that imposes such competitive constraints on the universal service provider; nor is there a market that makes new entry to the upstream market so easy by enabling competitors to rely on the existing infrastructure of the universal service provider to deliver &quot;the last mile&quot;. The UK's access headroom regime is something that must be looked at. It certainly appears to be very unfair to Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/6">Another way of paying Royal Mail for delivering the USO relates to a point I made earlier; we should take advantage of the clause in the European directive that allows a charge to be levied on mail companies that do not deliver a universal service, and use the proceeds to pay Royal Mail for doing so. If those private companies are cherry-picking the profitable parts of the business, they should compensate Royal Mail adequately for carrying out the unprofitable parts of the business. At the moment, it appears that Royal Mail is cross-subsidising the universal service obligation from other parts of its business, which makes it harder for it to compete. Royal Mail desperately needs more investment and the Government must either provide that investment themselves or ensure that private sector investment is secured for the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/7">I turn to post offices. My constituency has already suffered from the latest post office closure programme; several post offices in my constituency have already been closed, so there is no point in my revisiting that ground. Instead, I want to look to the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/8">The post office closure programme in Argyll and Bute reported in January. As well as closing several post offices, the report contained one piece of good news. Post Office Ltd said that it wanted to reopen one post office, in the village of Otter Ferry, which had closed several years ago. That seemed to be good news. However, yesterday&mdash;four months further on&mdash;the Post Office told me that it was still working to try to restore the service to that community, but it was not yet in a position to confirm anything. That certainly worries me; four months have passed and no one has been found to take over the post office in Otter Ferry.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/9">To add to those worries, the post office in the village of St Catherines closed suddenly in the middle of February. Again, the Post Office told me that the closure was only temporary and that it was planning to find somebody to take over the post office. However, three months later, the Post Office has again not managed to find anybody. I know that throughout the highlands and islands, there are post offices that are supposed to be temporarily closed, but they have been in that position for several years. It certainly worries me that, when a postmaster gives up a small village post office, it seems to be extremely difficult to find anybody to take over the business. That suggests that people looking at those businesses do not regard them as profitable, so I am worried that even after the closure programme we might continue to see a gradual decline of the post office network.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/10">The key to keeping post offices open and profitable is clear&mdash;to ensure that the contract to pay pensions and benefits stays with the Post Office after 2010. We must not see a repeat of the TV licence fiasco, when the contract to renew TV licences was given to PayPoint, an organisation that lacks a rural network.</p>

	<p pid="a.447.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his excellent speech. I am meeting representatives of Royal Mail in about ten minutes' time so that they can tell me which post offices in my constituency they wish to close. On my hon. Friend's point about more trade for post offices, Fife council recently decided to put more business the Post Office's way by allowing customers to use post offices to pay council bills, but Royal Mail does not seem to have taken that into account. Does my hon. Friend not think that it would be wise for Royal Mail to wait until the full effects of that extra trade, which is significant, are felt so that it can make a full assessment before deciding which post offices it does or does not wish to close?</p>

	<p pid="a.447.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. I was certainly pleased with the initiative proposed by Essex county council for the council and post offices to share services. Unfortunately, in my area, the proposal was made far too late to allow the council or community groups to put together a proper business plan. In the case of my hon. Friend's constituency, I hope that the Post Office will give Fife council time to put together a proper business plan. One way to secure the future of rural post offices is by sharing services with councils, community groups and other public bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.2/2">The key to securing the future of post offices is the card account. The Government must specify that whoever wins the tender must have a rural network, but we also need to develop the post office card account. Clearly, it has limited functionality at present, but it ought to be developed into a bank account with a full range of banking products. That is the road that France, Germany, Italy and other European countries have followed. It would allow small rural post offices to become profitable and to survive, and it would be of great benefit to people on low incomes who are often financially excluded. I urge the Government to develop the post office card account into a proper bank account with full banking facilities, and to ensure that the contract for paying benefits and pensions specifies a rural network.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.2/3">I shall speak briefly about parcels. One of the complaints that I receive regularly from people in my constituency is that when they give their postcode when placing an order for something that has to be delivered as a parcel, they are directed to small print saying that an extra amount is charged for deliveries to the highlands and islands. That causes great consternation.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.2/4">Clearly, the private parcel delivery companies are not keen on delivering to remote areas. Part of the problem is that they do not have depots in remote areas where parcels can be left if the people to whom they are being delivered are out. The Government and the review panel should consider allowing small sub-post offices to retain parcels that parcel delivery companies cannot deliver because someone is out.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.2/5">At present, under the contract that small sub-post offices have with the Post Office, a parcel delivered by a private delivery company cannot be held anywhere in the shop. Even if the post office is in a corner of a shop, it is still against the contract to leave the parcel anywhere in the shop. Often, the post office-cum-shop is the only shop in the village, which means that if a parcel is being delivered to somebody in the village, there is often nowhere for it to be left if the person is out. I would like the Government, the regulator and the review panel to consider whether we could allow post offices to store parcels on behalf of private companies as well as Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.447.2/6">Royal Mail and the Post Office are clearly in a critical condition, as the report demonstrates, but I still believe that with the right action they could be rescued. I conclude with three questions for the Minister. First, will he assure us that the universal service obligation will continue and will not be watered down in any way? Secondly, will he assure us that the present round of post office closures is the last, and that the remaining network has a secure future? Thirdly, the interim report says that the present set-up is unsustainable, so what action do the Government intend to take to ensure that Royal Mail services are sustainable in the long term?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-05-14a.466.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" speakername="Daniel Kawczynski" colnum="466"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080514/halltext/80514h0009.htm#08051456000536">
	<p pid="a.466.1/1">This is an important debate on funding for the proposed unitary authority in Shropshire. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1696" name="Philip Dunne">the Member for Ludlow (Mr. Dunne)</phrase> and I had a terrible battle on our hands to try to prevent a unitary authority going ahead. The best comment on the matter, which I read in today's <i>Evening Standard</i><i>,</i> was from the late Gwyneth Dunwoody, who said it is one of the most cynical policies of the Labour Government, ignoring the wishes of local people. Regardless of that, we will now have a unitary authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/2">The Minister will be pleased to hear that I shall make very few criticisms of him and the Labour Government; rather, I will stick to the key issues that I would like him to consider surrounding future funding for the county. However, I should like to press him on one issue. The reason why I was against a unitary authority is that I feel passionately about local accountability to my constituents in Shrewsbury. It was important that only councillors who lived in Shrewsbury and who were accountable to my constituents through the ballot box could make decisions on key issues that affect Shrewsbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/3">We have many controversial matters before us in Shrewsbury, including co-location of the two colleges and plans for a huge incinerator. I would argue that Shrewsbury has the best and most experienced councillors in the county, so I hope that many of them will have senior positions on the new unitary authority. However, my first question to the Minister is: what mechanism is in place to protect a county town such as Shrewsbury in a unitary authority? We find ourselves with only a third of the councillors in the new authority, so we could be outvoted by the rest of the county on the incinerator issue, for example. It is easy for councillors who live 30, 35 or 40 miles away to vote for an incinerator to be built in Shrewsbury; obviously, it will not be built in their backyard and they will not be held to account through the ballot box, because their constituents might live 30 miles away from the town. I hope that some form of mechanism, certainly when it comes to planning law, will protect a county town such as Shrewsbury from the overwhelming votes of other parts of a county.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/4">We are going to have a unitary authority, and I am determined to make the most of it. The only downside is that there were no elections this month. We were due to have elections in May&mdash;we had elections every year in Shrewsbury&mdash;but, regrettably, because we will have a unitary authority, the Government decided that we would not have those elections. They will instead take place next May, when the unitary authority comes into place. With the drubbing that the Labour party got in the May elections, in which they lost hundreds of councillors, I believe that the Conservatives could have made a few gains in Shrewsbury. We already have a big majority on the council, but it worries me&mdash;the Minister may scoff&mdash;that some Labour councillors in Shrewsbury will continue in office when they might not have been councillors if the elections had gone ahead. I say that not to have a go at the Labour party, but to urge the Minister to think again in future when such organisations are introduced. Are such things legitimate, no matter what the difficulties of holding an election only 12 months in advance of the unitary authority? I am a democrat&mdash;I went into politics because I feel passionately about democracy and accountability. Is it right and correct to get rid of such an election and for people to sit as representatives illegitimately?</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/5">I must praise the work of the leader of Shrewsbury and Atcham borough council, Mr. Peter Nutting. He is doing a brilliant job in making the accession to a unitary authority work as well as possible, and I applaud him for it. Like me, he fought against the unitary authority, but he is now determined to do everything possible to move to the unitary authority. I should like publicly to acknowledge his work.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/6">I should also like to praise&mdash;sincerely&mdash;the chief executive of Shropshire county council, Mrs. Carolyn Downs. She obviously had to implement and undertake the policies of the Conservative-controlled county council when it pursued its wish for a unitary authority. Regrettably, we disagreed on many occasions on the matter, but I must put on record that I admire her stamina and determination to ensure that what she felt was right for Shropshire was implemented. I acknowledge her hard work on the matter and the achievements of Shropshire county council&mdash;it has achieved so much with so little money. The Minister will be aware that there are good, average and poor chief executives. Mrs. Carolyn Downs is an excellent chief executive. The Department for Communities and Local Government could gain a great deal by learning how Mrs. Downs manages to achieve such extraordinary results with so little funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/7">The Labour Government are determined to focus on the redistribution of wealth&mdash;to me, that is a cornerstone of socialism. Of course, Shropshire is a net contributor to the Exchequer&mdash;I have tabled many questions on how much tax Salopians pay and how much we receive, and there is no doubt that Shropshire is a huge net contributor to the Exchequer. We have a similar population to the London borough of Ealing, yet we receive a fraction of its funding. The Minister would be alarmed by a comparison of what the Government spend on Ealing and Shropshire. I am in the process of producing a pamphlet on the differences in funding between Shropshire and neighbouring Telford and Wrekin. I shall send a copy to the Minister, so that he can see how two communities, cheek by jowl, receive huge differences in funding for essential public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/8">When preparing for the debate, I spoke with Mrs. Laura Rowley, the director of resources at Shropshire county council, who helped me to articulate some points to put to the Minister. In Shropshire, there are tremendous pressures on services for older people. The number of over-85s in Shropshire is twice the national average. That is important because a tremendous amount of social service support is needed for people in the last two years of their lives. Having such a huge number of elderly senior citizens will obviously have an impact on the social services that the unitary authority will provide when it comes into being.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/9">Shrewsbury was voted one of the best places in England to retire in a major national finding. I am pleased about that because the older a person gets, the more inclined they are vote Conservative&mdash;wisdom comes with age. However, I should like the Minister to address the serious social services problem. The senior citizens forum in Shrewsbury is partly funded by the county council. I should like to tell the Minister what a tremendous job the forum does for senior citizens. Its leading representative, Mr. Bill Harris, has written to me. I shall give the letter to the Minister; I have a little dossier for him here with all the facts. Mr. Harris says:</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/10" class="indent">&quot;We believe that enabling the involvement of increasing numbers of older people in community affairs through frequent public meetings and coffee mornings, etc. is the way forward. This is part of our effort to increase membership numbers from the present 6,000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/11">The forum has 6,000 members. I have never come across a body more adept and able at lobbying than the Shrewsbury senior citizens forum. I hope to hear from the Minister what sort of extra help his Government will give to the unitary authority, bearing in mind the demographics of Shropshire and how many senior citizens we have.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/12">To move on to education&mdash;the most contentious point for me&mdash;Shropshire is ranked 145th of 149 local education authorities for funding. There is huge pressure on small rural village schools. According to the Minister for Schools and Learners, the Government have a specific policy of safeguarding rural schools, whereby they should be closed only in extremity, yet many rural village schools in my constituency have come under threat of closure, simply because we do not receive anything like as much money as other parts of the country. We get &pound;200 less per child than Telford next door, never mind Ealing. That is simply unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/13">I recently visited St. Andrew's school in Nesscliffe, where I saw for myself the extraordinary benefit to rural village life provided by such schools. It is important to keep rural schools going. I appeal to the Minister, who knows from his own county of Gloucestershire how important rural village schools are and how vital it is to save them. I do not know whether it was broadcast in Gloucestershire, but on Central news last week, the Government announced an extra &pound;28 million for schools in the black country. My goodness me, I should like to see something like that in Shropshire. Interestingly, the black country is full of Labour marginals, so it is perhaps not surprising that the &pound;28 million will go there, rather than to solidly Conservative Shropshire. Never mind; I hope that the Minister will take my views on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/14">An independent report on sparsity was sent to the Department for Communities and Local Government. It was funded partly by Shropshire county council and was submitted to the Department in 2006. It is important, because it highlights the cost of providing services across Shropshire&mdash;a huge rural county&mdash;due to the sparsely populated rural areas within the county. Scotland takes sparsity into consideration, using measures of dispersion when distributing finances throughout the country. My understanding is that Shropshire is treated similarly to Cumbria. More work must be done to differentiate the rural counties. The population in Cumbria is far more fixed in certain areas that are close to one another and large parts of the county are empty. In Shropshire, rural communities are spread out far more. That is why it costs even more to provide services in Shropshire than in Cumbria. I hope that the Minister will take on board my concerns about funding for sparsity. He knows as well as I do the huge increase in transportation costs and all the other costs involved in providing services in rural communities, and I hope that he will be able to say something on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/15">The Government trumpeted their actions on concessionary fares. I have spoken to many people in Shropshire who are disabled and who say, &quot;It's all well and good having a national scheme, but in parts of Shropshire at the moment, that scheme only operates after 9.30 am.&quot; Many senior citizens want to make use of that service to go to work, and most people start work before 9.30. It is a marvellous policy to ensure funding for free bus services for people who are disabled and senior citizens, more and more of whom now have to go to work to make ends meet. If the Government are serious about the scheme, it is important that it should operate before 9.30. I look forward to hearing when sufficient money will be given to ensure that people who are disabled and senior citizens have free bus transport before 9.30.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/16">A constituent, a lovely young lady called Ellie Johnson, came to see me. She is the designated nurse for looked-after children in Shropshire. She is responsible for 400 children in care homes around Shropshire. There is only one such nurse, and 29 hours a week is all that the council seems to have money for. Interestingly, 50 per cent. of those children are not from Shropshire, but from other parts of the country. Because Shropshire is such a beautiful county, many care homes set up business there, bringing in such children. It is important that the Government should acknowledge that Shropshire is dealing with far more vulnerable children than the average for a county its size. We are a magnet for disadvantaged children who need care. The dedicated nurse provides various vaccinations&mdash;she spoke to me about the importance of ensuring that vaccinations are given for cervical cancer&mdash;and advice on smoking, drugs and sexual health. All those issues are being raised with the children.</p>

	<p pid="a.473.1/1">It is a great pleasure to see you in the chair, Mr. Weir, as you watch over our debate on an issue of great importance to many people in the county town of Stafford. It will not have escaped your attention that my hon. Friend the Minister has often appeared in this Chamber to respond to debates about the closure of post offices under the Post Office network change programme. When I learned last week that I had secured this debate, I made a point of seeking him out to tell him that this is not one of those debates. I say in passing that he will know that the network change programme is under way in Staffordshire at the moment, and we are in the middle of the consultation period.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/2">Perhaps it is an opportune moment for me to place on record my thanks and gratitude to the Minister for agreeing to see me in his Westminster room on <phrase class="date" code="2008-04-01">1 April</phrase> to talk about the proposals for my constituency in which four post offices are to be closed. He might recall that I said that he and Post Office Ltd should do as much as possible to stop the closures of post offices if they are the last retail outlet in a village. The greatest focus of protest in my constituency is in the village of Great Bridgeford, which will lose its last retail outlet post office if the proposals go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/3">Today, we are debating Stafford's Crown post office. It is one of those included in the commercial arrangements that Post Office Ltd and WH Smith came to a year or so ago. It might be worth beginning by saying to my hon. Friend the Minister that for most of the 20th century, Stafford's main post office&mdash;its Crown post office, its only post office in the town centre&mdash;occupied a very beautiful building called Chetwynd House. The building was built in 1746 by William Chetwynd whose family seat was Brockton Hall, which is now a well-known golf club in Stafford. The house was sold in the 1780s to William Horton, then a famous shoe manufacturer. A plaque on the wall of the post office testifies that Richard Brinsley Sheridan, the very famous playwright and the less famous MP for Stafford in the late 18th and early 19th century, often stayed there with his friend William Horton. It is a very imposing building that is listed because of its character and design. It stands on an important corner in Stafford's main thoroughfare, Greengate Street, by what would have been in the middle ages the southern gate of the walled town of Stafford.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/4">We have now moved our post office to WH Smith, which is also on Greengate street, so it has not moved far. Personally, having read all the information about the commercial tie-up between Post Office Ltd and WH Smith, I can see why both partners made such an arrangement. I understand the commercial pressures that both were under and I can see that both businesses are reasonably compatible. Therefore, I was not going to go to the stake saying that, if selected, Stafford post office should not move into WH Smith. I waited for the proposals and found that we were in the list of 70 post offices to move into a WH Smith store following what was claimed to be the success of the six pilots. I was willing to consider whether we could make a success of the plan in Stafford until I learned that the post office was to be located on the first floor of the shop in a building that has questionable arrangements for disabled access. It was at that point that I took the view that I did not think that such a move would work. I was one of 45 consultees who objected to the transfer of the post office. I know that in 20 of the representations, access issues were specifically raised before the transfer went ahead. The decision was made that the move would take place despite the objections, and it happened last October. I pointed out in a debate about post offices in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-29">29 November</phrase> that I had objected to the move taking place, and that it had gone ahead against objections.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/5">Having seen that we could not save our post office from being moved, I resolved that I would do everything possible to make a success of the move. I had accepted the commercial pressures that drove the partners to work together. I wanted my post office to be successful, and it was fine that a famous trading business such as WH Smith should be successful in the town of Stafford. I wanted it to continue that success. I therefore arranged a meeting on site at the post office with managers of Post Office Ltd and WH Smith, representatives of Postwatch and Stafford borough council and, crucially, senior officers of the Stafford and district disabled access group, a man named Derek Boult and a woman named Joyce Middle, who are both strong and passionate campaigners for disabled access and disabled people's rights. Joyce Middle is confined to a motorised scooter because of her disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/6">We all met at the site before the move took place to talk about the changes that would be needed to make the building accessible to disabled people. In fairness to the management of WH Smith, they listened carefully and promised to make changes. They made the minor changes that we recommended, which were not costly, and I am grateful to them for that. It was a bit of a success. However, we saw that day that the post office was to be on the first floor and approached using an old-fashioned, wide staircase that is not particularly suitable for many disabled people or groups such as mothers with pushchairs. The store has what looks like a little goods lift in the corner of the building, and it was proposed that it would provide access to the first floor for disabled people. We expressed our view that it was not a big enough lift and asked whether a bigger one could be provided. We were told that that was out of the question because of the cost, the location or both&mdash;I am not sure which. WH Smith drew the line and would not agree to a larger lift.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/7">As soon as the post office opened, mothers with pushchairs and disabled people in bigger than average wheelchairs or in motorised scooters started to complain that they could not fit in the lift. A subsidiary problem, which we had predicted, was that the ground floor was full of WH Smith customers and the check-outs were immediately between the doors to the store and the little lift in the corner. We had predicted that there would be queues of people blocking access to the lift, and so it has proved. We have had almost as many complaints about people not being able to get to the lift as about people not being able to fit in it when they do get there.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/8">In response to the complaints, we asked whether more changes could be made. To give credit again to Post Office Ltd and WH Smith personnel, they agreed to meet us in the store again to talk about the changes. I was there, along with the council, Postwatch and Derek Boult and Joyce Middle. We again pointed out the big problems of getting to the lift and fitting in it, as well as one or two smaller problems that had arisen since the post office had been in operation. Again, people listened carefully and attentively and promised to make changes. The few modest changes that we suggested were made, but, crucially, the two big ones&mdash;allowing room for people to get to the lift and fit in it&mdash;could not be, or were not, addressed. The problems remained, and people could not reach the lift because of customers obstructing their route and could not fit in the lift when they got there.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/9">Despite that second meeting and the attempts to reconcile our objections, we still received complaints from members of the public. Last month, I spoke again to Derek Boult of the access group and asked him, &quot;What do we now think is the situation?&quot; We both concluded that if there is never going to be a bigger lift for customers, a first-floor location is not suitable for Stafford's main post office. We agreed that we should ask WH Smith and Post Office Ltd to consider bringing the post office down from the first floor, which is unsuitable for access by some groups of the community, to the ground floor. I did so in writing to both partners, and then I requested this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/10">Stafford is the county town, and its population is 60,000. The borough's population is more than 120,000 and the county's population is nearly 1 million. The town attracts a considerable number of visitors, and to lose a beautiful, historic, ground-floor post office in a listed building, Chetwynd House, replaced by a first-floor post office with access routes that are insultingly inaccessible to some groups in our community, is just not good enough. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister agrees with that. What can he do to lend his weight to our campaign to ask for the post office to be brought down to the ground floor?</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/11">I checked with the Disability Rights Commission, as it was then called, about the store and what the owner's obligation was. It advised me that it was the owner's obligation to make reasonable adjustments to make the building and its services accessible to all groups in the community and that, if the owner failed to do so, it was the responsibility of a disabled individual to take a case to a county court. I shall pursue that course if I must, but it seems a shame, especially considering that Post Office Ltd is in the public sector and might feel that it has a social responsibility to care about groups such as disabled customers.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/12">I say to both WH Smith and Post Office Ltd that it makes good social sense to ensure that all members of the public have access to the services in their stores, but it also makes good commercial sense. The demographics of this country show that our population is expected to get older and that more people will have access difficulties. The Post Office is peculiarly reliant on older people as customers, and if the business is not accessible to such groups, it will be deprived of a considerable chunk of its potential customers. I am fortified in my view that post offices should be accessible to people with access difficulties because my argument is sustained by Age Concern south Staffordshire, Mencap mid-Staffordshire and the Communication Workers Union for the midlands region. We all take the view that the present arrangements are not suitable.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/13">To make the matter personal and real for everyone in the room, I shall give an account that I received from a disabled visitor of their visit to the store this March. The person was in a motorised scooter and found that a filing cabinet obstructed the reversing space needed to get into the lift, that shopping baskets were piled next to the cabinet so that there was no room to manoeuvre and that the lift would not take the motorised scooter because of its size. They were asked to move from their scooter into a store-provided wheelchair, but there was no room and they needed help to move. There was nobody around to assist, and there was no electric bell to summon assistance. Their calls for help could not be heard by members of staff, because they were busy some distance away dealing with customers. There was therefore a delay. When they were eventually helped into the store wheelchair, they had to have their crutches and shopping on their lap as they made the short journey to the first floor.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/14">As a result of that experience, that person wrote to me that:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/15" class="indent">&quot;The postal services are essential and should not provide an obstacle course for the disabled&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/16">That is a perfectly sensible point for anybody to make to their elected representative. Derek Boult told me:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Although WH Smith have been willing to listen and have carried out certain alterations, it is quite evident that the only way the post office is going to succeed is to place it on the ground floor&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/18">He has also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Complaints are being received on a daily basis and the time for talking has to stop&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/20">It seems to me that complaints on a daily basis put pressure on people such as me and the Minister to listen and try to take action to help. There is a strong commercial imperative for something to be done, as I said earlier, and there is certainly a strong social imperative.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/21">When I was preparing for this debate yesterday, I noticed a news report about a Hastings woman who has been given leave in the High Court to challenge the current post office closure programme. One of the grounds on which she has put her case is that the closures are contrary to disability anti-discrimination laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/22">In the case of Stafford's main post office, we are not debating a closure and the taking away of the physical post office, but talking about moving a ground floor post office to a first floor location without providing adequate means for disabled customers and other groups with special access needs to get to their post office services. Therefore, I wonder whether the situation in Stafford is in fact a breach of those disability anti-discrimination laws. We should not have to wait for someone to take out a case themselves in the county court before we act.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/23">There is one last, minor point I would like to make to the Minister. I say &quot;minor&quot; in the sense that it is not germane to today's debate, but it is certainly a vital subject of debate in Stafford. It is the question of what is going to happen to Chetwynd House, which I walk past every day when I am in Stafford. The building is now boarded up and closed and there are very visible 'For Sale' signs on the outside.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/24">I have written to the building's owners, Post Office Ltd, several times to ask how things are going with the sale and they tell me, &quot;It's none of your business, it's a commercial transaction.&quot; I said to Post Office Ltd, &quot;If you get lots of people who make satisfactory offers for this building, there is a lot of concern in Stafford about what the use of the building will be, so would you consider consulting me, an elected representative, and other representatives of the local community, about which offer would be the best to accept?&quot; Post Office Ltd said, &quot;No. Go away.&quot; That is disappointing, coming from a body whose only share is owned by my hon. Friend the Minister, so maybe he could persuade Post Office Ltd that it ought to give a little more attention to a Member of Parliament who would like what I consider to be some sensible information and dialogue about a key building in his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/25">I want to leave the Minister time to respond. In conclusion, I am objecting to the lack of an adequate post office service for a significant proportion of the community living in and visiting Staffordshire's county town, I am objecting as someone who has worked positively and constructively for half a year to try to make unsatisfactory arrangements work, and I am objecting in the knowledge that many organisations with a special interest and expertise in access issues agree with me . I certainly know that many members of the public also agree with me, including the people who are disadvantaged by the present arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/26">In asking the Minister to help us, I leave the last word to Derek Boult, who said in his most recent contact with me this week:</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/27" class="indent">&quot;The relocation of the post office to the ground floor is the only solution that will provide the type and standard of service that the public expects. Nothing less will do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.473.1/28">I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister can understand the strength of feeling in Stafford about this matter, which I hope I have been able to convey to him in this short debate, and I hope that there is something that he can do to help us.</p>
