	<p pid="c.75.2/1">May I say how much I welcome the opportunity to debate social housing? The subject is highly topical, although not for reasons that we would support, but we none the less need to take advantage of that topicality.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.2/2">I welcome the fact that the Minister is still in place, as she has been extremely supportive and courteous in working with me on the problems of overcrowding, which I shall refer to later. She has visited my constituency and met a number of families who live in wholly unacceptable conditions, which is the thrust of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.2/3">Social housing gets a bad press that is not shared by any other public service&mdash;so negative is its image that &quot;Little Britain&quot; and Catherine Tate have created an industry out of it. Although it has been mocked and ignored, and more recently treated as if it were in some way a cause of poverty and social exclusion rather than a central line of defence against them, nothing less than a catastrophe has been allowed to unfold.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.2/4">It is necessary briefly to say that none of those factors can be used in defence of the housing disasters of the past&mdash;the great but badly designed monolithic estates, the paternalistic and sometimes poor-quality housing management, and the concentration of families with complex needs in single-tenure neighbourhoods. Serious mistakes have been made over the years, and they have given cover to those who were allowed to dismantle so much that was good over the past quarter century.</p>

	<p pid="c.75.3/1">I am listening to my hon. Friend closely and must say that there is always the risk of throwing the baby out with the bath water. We have three big regeneration schemes in my constituency&mdash;West Hendon; Spur Road, Edgware; and Grahame Park, Colindale. The net consequence of significantly increasing density, which will have a great impact on local services and communities, is a net loss of affordable homes. The London borough of Barnet, which is responsible for those schemes, is missing a trick. We have to do something about the chronic shortage of housing and the overcrowding in our area, but those schemes do nothing to ease the problems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.75.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000015">
	<p pid="c.75.4/1">I totally endorse what my hon. Friend says. I fear that Barnet is doing no favours to its own people, and it is also failing to make a wider contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.4/2">I am saying to the Government that the opportunity afforded by the Chancellor's stated interest in the case for social housing to be included in next year's spending review is almost a last chance to put right the failures of the past. It was comforting to hear the new Secretary of State in this Department emphasise the importance of social housing. I hope that people's ears are open to the case that needs to be made.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.4/3">Many good things have been done by the Government on housing since 1997, of which the decent homes initiative is the most important. Thousands of my constituents have benefited from the major improvements and renovations that have taken place under that programme, which are much to be welcomed. However, the overall failure to address the problem of housing supply, most especially but not entirely in London and the south-east, has not only caused untold misery for those families rendered homeless or trapped in chronically overcrowded accommodation, but has been a false economy to the public purse. It has shifted much of the cost, such as for temporary accommodation, on to housing benefit; contributed to the destabilising of communities; and, sadly&mdash;this is why the debate is so relevant&mdash;stoked the racism that is a consequence of the competition for scarce resources in an ethically mixed and fast-changing city.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.4/4">As the director of Shelter rightly said yesterday, the shortage affordable homes has led to a &quot;blame culture&quot; in which people turn on each other in their frustration and despair. Although the consequences might have been seen most graphically in Barking and Dagenham, we should be under no illusion that such sentiments are confined to one area.</p>

	<p pid="c.76.0/1">Of those Labour Members present today, several represent metropolitan constituencies and one is a distinguished former council leader; I am a provincial among them. The pressures in London are obviously particularly great. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government, despite their pretty sound record generally, must avoid what the National Housing Federation has called a &quot;pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap&quot; policy in responding to those problems? They must balance quantity and quality in responding to people's needs and aspirations as regards the environment and new housing.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="76"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000020">
	<p pid="c.76.1/1">Again, I agree with my hon. Friend, and I shall set those points out from my own perspective.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/2">Ironically, the choice-based lettings system, which is increasingly used to supply housing, and which I wholly support in principle, is making the intensity of the competition that I have described toxically transparent. For example, a rare three-bed property in my constituency was advertised through the choice-based lettings system two weeks ago and it attracted 244 bidders from the already heavily filtered top-priority category A list alone. Given that only six three-bedroom properties have been advertised in the current financial year, most desperate people, even on that list, face an almost endless round of unsuccessful bidding, which is an injection of pure poison into already deprived neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/3">On the shortfall in supply, targets for tackling rough sleeping and for cutting the number of households in temporary accommodation, both of which are entirely admirable by their own lights, simply squeeze the balloon that is housing need&mdash;reducing need in one place, only to see it to pop up elsewhere in the system.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/4">Before I summarise the priorities for action, let me sketch out some challenges. I shall make specific reference to London. The number of social housing lettings has been falling for a decade, and the number of vacancies has fallen because fewer people can afford to buy. In London, the ratio of lower-quartile house prices to lower-quartile earnings has more than doubled, compared with a 50 per cent. increase in the country as a whole. The right to buy is having a continuing impact, reducing the pool of lettings by about 12,500 a year, while the number of completions is substantially down across the country, although I recognise that it is up in London by about 2,000.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.77.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" speakername="Lembit Öpik" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000024">
	<p pid="c.77.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing the debate. Is she aware that the problems for inner-city areas that she is describing also affect rural areas such as Montgomeryshire? For example, house prices in my constituency have increased by 157 per cent. in just six years, while the average household earns just &pound;23,000 a year. Does she agree that the problems and the solutions, which I hope she will outline, are very much the same for rural areas? Such areas need to close the gap between the housing that families require and the housing they can afford.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.77.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000025">
	<p pid="c.77.1/1">I certainly take the point that rural areas face a serious challenge on housing need. Although London is at the sharp end of the problem, the pressure is distributed across the country, which is illustrated by the fact that, since 1997, the number of people seeking social housing has increased by about half across the country, but by 77 per cent. in London.</p>
	<p pid="c.77.1/2">The 2004 spending review was projected to deliver an extra 10,000 new social homes annually by next year, but that was substantially below what the Kate Barker report recommended, and it is less than half of what we need. Despite the Mayor of London's welcome commitment to meet housing need, there will be a continuing shortfall in the years to come. The Greater London authority housing requirement study estimated that 10,700 larger affordable homes&mdash;those are at the heart of the problem in my area&mdash;were needed every year, but the supply is unbelievably low, at 500.</p>

	<p pid="c.77.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend about the commitment to reach the target of 10,000 new homes a year, but in London, as she has outlined, we will not reach anything like our target at current rates, given the need for larger accommodation and the level of construction inflation.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="c.77.3/1">Sadly, I agree with my hon. Friend, which is why I welcome this chance to make the case in relation to the next spending review. The need is urgent, and provision is lagging well behind need.</p>
	<p pid="c.77.3/2">The Housing Corporation recently made a welcome contribution to recognising the need for family accommodation by upping its share of the social housing allocation for family homes from 27 to 34 per cent., but that is still way below what is needed to meet new demand in the system and to make inroads into the backlog.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.78.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000030">
	<p pid="c.78.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is particularly important to consider what the Housing Corporation says, because it provides social housing? For many families, affordable housing is no longer affordable, and there is a real need not only for affordable housing, but for social housing for many of those families.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.78.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000031">
	<p pid="c.78.1/1">I agree. Social housing is at the heart of my case, although affordable housing to buy is also priced out of the reach of families who in other circumstances might be able to afford to go into the private market.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.1/2">As a consequence of the devastating shortfall in supply, particularly of family-sized accommodation, severe overcrowding rose by almost half in London between the 1991 and 2001 censuses. More than half of all severely overcrowded households in the country are in London, and the social sector has for the first time overtaken private rented as the most severely affected. The fact that 500,000 London children live in severely overcrowded homes makes me ashamed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.78.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000033">
	<p pid="c.78.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for being generous in giving way. Does she agree that there is a real problem in that figures from the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister clearly show that overcrowding is greatest in areas where there are large numbers of black and minority ethnic communities, especially Asian communities? That is particularly the case in Newham.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.78.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="78"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000034">
	<p pid="c.78.3/1">That is right. In fact, my next point is that, despite the pernicious lies of the British National party and the perhaps more understandable willingness of desperate, badly housed families to believe its propaganda, it is black, ethnic minority and Muslim families who are over-represented in the severe overcrowding and homelessness figures, and indeed across the board in terms of housing need, so in a way we have the worst of all possible worlds.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.3/2">I have made the point about overall supply and, in particular, the supply of family-sized accommodation, but it is also important to say that the supply must be balanced out across London as a whole. That is my area of concern; others will make the case for the country as a whole. The geographical distribution, even of the increased provision in London, does not meet all needs. In fact, there is a danger that it is about to make the situation worse. Despite the fact that Westminster city council&mdash;Westminster is one of my two boroughs&mdash;has to deal with what is, unbelievably, the third highest overcrowding level in the local authority rented sector, we are unable to obtain adequate direct investment or to access properties through sub-regional allocations.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.3/3">I am told that housing opportunities in cheaper partner boroughs to my expensive inner-London ones will help to soak up the slack, yet even though I have just put forward two desperately needy families who want to move to Barnet, where they have family ties&mdash;Barnet is a borough in the sub-regional partnership&mdash;I am told by Westminster that no three-bedroom properties will be available in the sub-regional partner boroughs of Barnet and Enfield this year. Overall, Westminster and its sub-regional partners can expect only 90 properties to be made available to meet the needs of more than 3,000 people on the waiting list alone.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.79.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" speakername="Andrew Dismore" colnum="79"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000037">
	<p pid="c.79.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning Barnet, which is my borough. The problem is that Peter is trying to rob Paul. In my constituency, there is a desperate shortage of the housing that we are discussing, so frankly I am not surprised that Westminster received the response that it did, because there is no housing for our own people. Such properties simply do not exist in Barnet.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.0/2">One of my main concerns is that, although there is housing investment in parts of London, other parts of London&mdash;where there is a chronic housing shortage, where people want to live, where jobs are available, where there are transport links and where, as a consequence, land prices are slightly higher&mdash;are being starved of investment. That is a completely false economic argument. We must invest where the jobs and transport links are and where people want to live, not where those things do not exist.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" speakername="Karen Buck" colnum="79"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000039">
	<p pid="c.79.1/1">That is right. I can understand the logic of saying that we will not invest substantially in building social housing in the middle of Knightsbridge&mdash;that would be wholly sub-optimal in development terms&mdash;but it is critical that we provide social and affordable housing opportunities across London and that they are not concentrated purely in poorer areas. That is because, among other things, we are trying to get away from lower-income households being concentrated in lower-income neighbourhoods. Let me give two illustrations from my area, and I shall conclude by running through some of my priorities for action.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/2">Mrs. M sent me a letter:</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/3" class="indent">&quot;We are a family of five. We have been living in two single bedrooms since 1993. The boy is fifteen, the girl is nine and the little one 3, living, playing, studying and doing homework in the same room of 2.5 metres by 3 metres. The boy has learning difficulties, the mum has rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes... you cannot imagine how difficult it is to live with 3 kids in the same room.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/4">The father and husband of a second family wrote:</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/5" class="indent">&quot;As you will recall, our family of six&mdash;myself, my wife, two daughters and two sons&mdash;have been living in a flat with two single bedrooms since 2001. Both my wife's health and my own have deteriorated as a result of living here and my children, the oldest of whom is 14, should no longer be sharing a bedroom. Unfortunately, our landlord is indifferent to our situation... in their waiting lists we are placed in Category B along with 66 other people, and, as such, we can expect to wait for 12 years&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/6">that is, 12 years during which six people share two small bedrooms.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/7">Remember, that family are not even in category A. The transfer list for that social landlord in my borough says that the longest category A priority wait for a two-bedroomed flat is nine years; the longest category B wait is 16 years. Those are not my worst cases, which involve families of five in a single bedroom. However, at least those cases are defined as statutory overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/8">I come to my final example. Mrs. A and her husband are sharing a small two-bed with their three teenage children. Mrs. A's landlord, the Peabody Trust, told me last summer:</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/9" class="indent">&quot;She has been on the Trust's transfer list since March 1997... she is waiting for a 3 bed property and her case receives priority because of her medical circumstances and overcrowding. Unfortunately, last year, the Trust only let one 3 bed property in&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/10">the whole borough. The Peabody Trust continued:</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/11">&quot;Mrs. A refers to an empty 3 bed on the Dalgarno estate which needs work doing to it... The Trust has to make some difficult decisions when dealing with such properties and in this case, the property will be sold&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/12">Of course, the Peabody Trust is hugely engaged in selling property. Sales are also made by Genesis and a number of other registered social landlords in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/13">What is the solution? I do not often echo Ronald Reagan, but I shall in this instance: the solution is not easy, but it is simple. The issue is supply, supply, supply. We have to increase the supply of socially rented homes, especially those suitable for families, although genuinely affordable shared ownership options and greater availability of smaller units can also relieve pressures on families by offering opportunities to adult children. In the 2007 comprehensive spending review, we need to commit to meeting the Barker target as a minimum.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/14">The 2007 comprehensive spending review might give us more money to build, but we can also buy on the open market. That is my preferred emergency response to the crisis. We can support investment in conversions and extensions, such as loft conversions, of existing properties. One reason why that is hard to do is that many London boroughs, including my own, have taken a relative reduction in housing revenue accounts. On current trends, Westminster's housing revenue account will go into deficit in 2010. We need more assistance to enable such programmes to be carried out by the local authorities, the arm's length management organisations and us.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/15">We have to stop the sale of housing association properties, especially the desirable street properties, on the open market. We have to ensure that we do not promote home ownership at the expense of those in desperate need of affordable rented accommodation. Too much extra investment in recent years has gone on promoting ownership rather than on tackling need.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/16">We must not only make the concept of mixed communities a reality, but ensure that, as we rightly mix tenure in what are currently concentrations of social housing, we simultaneously mix social housing into areas that are overwhelmingly owner-occupied. To echo the points made by a number of my hon. Friends, we need social housing growth everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/17">We must invest more in tools that will help us to identify under-occupation, promote the cash incentive scheme and make mutual exchange work effectively. That will help us to make better use of existing housing stock. We have been extremely complacent about the effectiveness of such programmes. They can help, but are not sufficient and will not solve the problem on their own. They need proper incentives to match those offered by the right to buy and they need to case manage individuals through the system to encourage them to downsize and exchange.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/18">An estimated 160,000 households living in the social sector could buy in the intermediate market if that sector were providing family-sized accommodation. Intermediate housing tends to concentrate on one and two bedrooms, which is not what families need. The sector could provide this, and it should.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/19">I plead with my hon. Friend the Minister that we must not load the burden on to rents, as London already has the highest rates of child poverty in the country and research clearly shows that higher rents are a factor in work disincentives and poverty. Rising rents in London have already contributed almost&pound;90 million back to the Treasury, which is grossly unfair given the pressures London tenants are under.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/20">We should expand the pilot for turning temporary accommodation into permanent, which would be good value for money and hugely important for unsettled families. The &pound;20 million scheme that is in place is a drop in the ocean. Also, let us find alternatives to the property market as a means to develop assets for those who cannot realistically afford to buy.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/21">Finally, I wish to say something on council leaseholders. Hundreds of relatively low-income council leaseholders in my area, such as on the Warwick, Amberley, Church Street and Lisson Green estates, face major works bills, which can be as high as &pound;68,000 and which in some cases are substantially more than the purchase price of their property.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/22">Home ownership has turned out to have an enormous sting in the tail for many such families, and while right-to-buy discounts and rising property prices have to be seen as part of the context, the reality is that the bills are arriving now and many lessees are devastated by them. There is a further shift towards sub-letting, as families decide that the &pound;425 a week that they could make in housing benefit for renting their properties to homeless families might help to get them off the financial hook, but that does not make sense for the public purse or the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/23">It is essential that the Government find ways to support initiatives to help the lower-income households now getting caught in this trap and that they recognise that there are costs involved, such as in the form of funding cost caps, interest-free loans, deferred payments, tax breaks on savings schemes for major works, or in some cases funds for buy back.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/24">I apologise for my speech taking so long, although I hope that Members recognise that I have taken a number of interventions. I conclude by saying that social housing is the public service that has been left out in the cold for a quarter of a century, and in my view we are reaping the whirlwind. Please let us take this opportunity to start making radical reparations.</p>

Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> has made a powerful case for her constituency and for inner London. Also, it is good to see the Minister in her place, although I am a little concerned about her health and I hope she will last out the debate. As one who is still traumatised by Tottenham Hotspur being poisoned at the weekend, I am a bit concerned about everyone.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/2">The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North rightly talked about inner London, as that is where her constituency is, but may I take the House on to a shire district? In my district, we estimate that we need 700 new social homes each year just to keep up. The biennial Government grant&mdash;the grant under the 2004 comprehensive spending review&mdash;has meant that we in Cherwell can build only 288 new homes, which is a long way short of what is needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/3">We know from parliamentary questions and answers that delivery of affordable housing after 2007-08 will depend entirely on the 2007 comprehensive spending review and the future bidding round held by the Housing Corporation.</p>

	<p pid="c.82.2/1">I want to be brief and many of the hon. Gentleman's colleagues wish to speak. I do not want to get castigated for taking up time, and the points I want to make are of reasonably narrow compass.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/2">Let us look at what happened in respect of the 2004 comprehensive spending review. A press release issued by the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in July 2004 stated that this was one of the most generous spending deliveries ever, providing an extra 10,000 homes a year for social rent and, on top of that, delivering more than 40,000 homes for essential public sector workers and low-cost home ownership in areas of higher housing demand over a four-year period. The fact of the matter is that although that was a&pound;1.5 billion award, it did barely anything for shire districts such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/3">Ministers have recognised that there is an aspiration for home ownership. In a constituency such as mine, where we fortunately have zero unemployment, pretty much everyone who comes to see me at my constituency surgery and looking for housing is on a low income. They are in work and have almost always lived in the area all their life: having gone to school in Banbury and grown up there, they now work there. They want to get into housing and would aspire to own their own home if they could.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/4">The Government have put forward shared equity schemes, which are really exciting. My only concern is that under the proposals made by the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chancellor in their pamphlet &quot;Extending Home Ownership&quot;, the aspirant owner has to take on a mortgage of 75 per cent. of the value of the property. Hometrack has worked out that in Oxfordshire as in London, only about 2 per cent. of those on low incomes could afford a shared equity property on that basis. Practically none of the people on low incomes will be able to take up shared equity.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/5">In my patch, notwithstanding that we are likely to have it trumpeted that the settlement will be generous and so on, if it is anything like the 2004 settlement, practically nothing will happen. We will then be told that there is to be shared equity, but that will also be a false dawn because no one will be able to access it.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/6">I do not understand the economics of housing. Huge numbers of people in my patch are going into the private rented sector, so the state is paying private landlords considerable sums through rent and housing benefit. Housing benefit is still money from the taxpayer and I do not understand why more of the benefit cannot help to ensure that families can access home ownership. The proportion that a family on low income have to put up would be reduced and far more of those hard-working families in my constituency&mdash;often with husband and wife both working on low incomes&mdash;could access housing of their own rather than being trapped, as many of them are, in permanent shorthold assured tenancies.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/7">Many of my constituents are confronted by a dilemma: they either go to the district council and are told that they can be put in temporary accommodation for an indefinite period, and eventually one of the few new, affordable social homes might become available, or are told to go to the private sector. As soon as they go to the private sector, they are told that they are by definition adequately housed and they fall off the list.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/8">I make my plea to the Minister: over the next year or so, may we perhaps have a gathering of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, Ministers, the Housing Corporation and others to see how we can make shared equity schemes more accessible to a larger number of people? The Treasury should not simply, under a different pot, spend more and more on housing benefit and lock people into private rented tenancy in permanent shorthold assured tenancies that they really do not want.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.2/9">In a constituency such as mine, if we could make the finances of shared equity work better, we could lever in a lot more money from individuals, families and mortgage lenders. There seems to be a disconnect that I do not entirely understand, but something tells me that we could do a lot better.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.83.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="83"  time="009:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000076">
	<p pid="c.83.0/1">I shall be as brief as possible because it is important that all colleagues are able to get into the debate. It cannot have escaped your notice, Mrs. Dean, that the majority of Labour Members participating in this debate represent London constituencies; that is because of the nature of the housing crisis in London which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> outlined very well indeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/2">I represent an inner-London constituency where property prices are going through the roof all the time. Anyone wishing to buy a property in my constituency, such as a two-bedroomed flat above a shop on a main road, would need about &pound;200,000. I saw an ex-council, three-bedroomed flat on an estate advertised yesterday for &pound;350,000. So-called &quot;shared ownership&quot; properties are so expensive that the possibility of anyone on less than a head teacher's income getting one is remote. In reality, there is a massive housing crisis. Little is being built and some council property is still being sold, fortunately at a slightly lower rate than in the past.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/3">As my Friend said in relation to the choice-based letting scheme, people on the housing waiting list go into a bidding frenzy every Thursday when the local paper comes out. Most of them are sadly disappointed. People come to my advice bureau in tears saying that in two years they have managed to visit one property with 20 other families and did not even manage to get an offer at the end of that process. Such a cruelty goes on week in, week out.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/4">To some extent, I welcome the choice-based letting system. However, we should be careful because those who are not computer literate, whose first language is not English and who do not feel confident or comfortable using telephones often simply do not bid. Such people just wait, but they will wait for ever because they have no opportunity at all. While I am not against choice-based letting, we should be cautious because those whose first language is not English are, in my experience, in danger of losing out as a result of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> mentioned some of the problems in his area, and I have much sympathy with those, particularly the point he raised about the perverse levels of cost and the way in which investment can deal with the situation. I suspect that my local authority, Islington council, like most other London bodies, houses few people off the waiting list into any new development or vacant property. People tend to be directed into the private sector or into leased properties where the council or housing association take on the lease. Such leases are phenomenally expensive.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/6">Ex-council properties that have been sold under the right to buy are then bought up by property companies or housing associations, or they are leased. The rent for such properties is often up to &pound;300 a week. People in desperate housing need are put into them and the rent is paid by housing benefit; usually 100 per cent. of it is paid in that way, although that is not true in all cases. The family involved then often live in a poor quality property that is badly managed, very unsuitable and, in some cases, downright dangerous in my view. A huge rent is paid by the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/7">If any member of such a family then manages to get a job&mdash;clearly we want people to get jobs and careers&mdash;they cannot afford to take it, because they are suddenly saddled with a bill of &pound;15,000 a year in rent alone, and they have lost income support and other benefits. We are building a mad benefit trap that costs the public a huge sum to prevent somebody from working and keep them in a grossly substandard and inadequate form of accommodation. A lot of that money could be spent far more effectively on building new homes for rent for the people in desperate housing need throughout London.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/8">I shall just quickly make two or three points because I recognise that many other Members wish to speak. First, on planning issues, the Mayor of London has rightly said that he wants 50 per cent. of all major developments given over to what he terms &quot;affordable housing&quot;. I understand that aspiration, and I support it with one or two reservations. I do so because I want far more homes for rent to be available, but I do not like the use of the word &quot;affordable&quot; because the definition of it is loose. It means whatever anyone wants it to mean. Developers seem to think that something is very affordable when I do not think that that is the case. I would much rather say that we desperately need &quot;places for rent at a fixed level in the public sector&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/9">My local authority, Islington council, was controlled by the Liberal Democrats until last Thursday. Sadly from their point of view it now has no overall control, which represents an enormous step forward for Labour. One issue in the election was the Liberal Democrats' persistence on the policy that they would demand a proportion of social housing only on development sites of more than 14 units. In my borough there are few large development sites; most are very small. The Labour proposal was to go right down to the bottom and insist that all development sites have a proportion of social housing, which is eminently sensible. I hope that that is the new council's policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/10">With major developments, developers do not think about the housing needs of people who are desperate to be rehoused; they think of their profits. Arsenal stadium sadly closed last week and the football team is moving to the new stadium. The old stadium site is being redeveloped as Highbury square. The developers, with the agreement of the Liberal Democrat council, are going to put 711 one-bedroomed private flats on that site. That is crazy. There is a desperate need for family housing to keep communities together. What happens is that single people and couples move to one-bedroomed flats and then cannot move to anywhere else in that community, so we end up with a community of either childless couples or old people. Those with children are forced to move out of inner London. I am sure that that occurs in other inner-London constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/11">My last point is about the need to invest in development. The Library produced an interesting briefing for today's debate, which makes grim reading. The number of new council properties being developed throughout the country this year is somewhere around the zero mark, and the number of housing association properties being developed in the whole of London, which is at a record high for the past 10 years, is just 6,000. We need major investment in housing for rent either by housing associations or local authorities. We should give local authorities the freedom to invest in building properties for rent if that is what they want to do, not skew Government financing of housing investment so that it is impossible for local authorities to build for affordable rent.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/12">If we do not tackle this crisis in London&mdash;and it is a crisis&mdash;what will be the long-term effect? More homeless people, more people living in grossly overcrowded accommodation, and more children growing up in grossly overcrowded flats. Is it surprising that young people and teenagers who are forced to share bedrooms with their siblings&mdash;often siblings of different sexes&mdash;do not like to spend time at home because there is simply no space? Is it surprising that families break up? Is it surprising that those young people hang around in the streets because they do not want to be at home in the evening, and encounter all kinds of problems as a result? If we do not deal with the housing crisis in London urgently and invest in the needs of the people, we will be exporting the poor out of London, and creating social divisions and misery for those people who manage to find somewhere&mdash;often somewhere expensive and inadequate&mdash;to live.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/13">I hope that the Minister fully understands the crisis facing us in London, and the pain that we see across our desks at advice bureaux every week when people ask, &quot;Is it so unreasonable to want a decent flat with a bedroom for each of my children so that they can grow up like all the other children do?&quot; It is heartbreaking to hear what people go through. I hope that the Government will skew investment into new building rather than frittering it away on the profits of private landlords and property companies, which is what we are doing through the perversity of the housing benefit system.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.86.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="86"  time="010:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0074.htm#06051065000089">
	<p pid="c.86.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on securing the debate. She is an acknowledged expert in this field, and her constituency neighbours mine. I do not intend to repeat much of what she said, but I welcome the return of her forensic skills to this issue. The loss to aviation policy is great, but the gain to social housing in London is greater still.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/2">I also compliment the hon. Lady on the timing of the debate, which comes after a series of contentious local elections, for which many of us have spent the past six months knocking on doors in our constituencies. Actually, some of us have spent 18 months continuously doing that&mdash;to the extent that many of my constituents are probably seeking an injunction to stop my doing it again in the near future. Along with the cases that we hear of in weekly constituency surgeries, that brought home the real human tragedy caused by housing problems in inner London, particularly as we saw at first hand the conditions in which people live in London in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/3">My hon. Friend gave several examples of the problem. I shall not give details of cases but simply say that they range from the extreme&mdash;the consequences of a mother with four children living in a one-bedroomed flat are traumatic and almost unimaginable&mdash;to the more common situation, which is perhaps worse because of its chronic nature, in which a whole generation has grown up in overcrowded housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/4">It is normal in social housing in my constituency for parents to bring up two or three children in a two-bedroomed flat. The issue that they raise with me is the availability of housing now that their children are leaving college and want homes of their own. In other words, an entire generation has become accustomed to using living rooms as bedrooms, to children of different sexes sharing a bedroom, to daily life, whether it involves doing school work or enjoying recreation, in a space that is so confined that it does not allow for normal living.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/5">It could be said that that situation was common for our parents' generation, and that in fact the population density of inner London has decreased&mdash;although it is increasing again. However, there was always some hope in the past, as the market was far more flexible. Today, little hope can be offered to most of my constituents who live in crowded conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/6">The situation is highlighted against a background in which so many things are improving in housing. I cannot remember an election when I have had fewer complaints about housing repairs and conditions, or local authorities and their performance. All those things have improved markedly, and in large measure that is due not only to the local authorities but to the Government, particularly for their decent homes programme, which has transformed entire estates and individual properties and brought them up to a good modern standard after many years of neglect. Even though the programme is not complete, people can now be given a date on which they will have new kitchens and new bathrooms, or their homes will be made weather-tight and more efficient and cheaper to run.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/7">It is also true that several factors that in the past contributed to a lack of social housing have been addressed. One rarely hears about voids; that is, the amount of time it takes to re-let properties. There are initiatives on empty homes, and better allocation policies. Local authorities and housing associations, although they are a mixed bag, have taken action, in so far as they can.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/8">It is right to say that steps have been taken by the Government to introduce more innovative proposals, but not only the Government have been involved. The Mayor of London's policy that 50 per cent. of new units must be affordable is greatly to be welcomed. Indeed, the only thing that I would say against it is that the figure is too low. The move away from building one and two-bedroomed homes to building three-bedroomed and larger homes is also welcome, but as my hon. Friend said, it has not gone far enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/9">Proposals such as the relaxation of planning powers to allow extensions to be built on existing properties are often floated. They should be investigated further, as the solution to a problem is often as simple as providing an additional bedroom. I think of a family with an autistic child who lived in a good-quality pre-war council house with a garden. They loved the house and the area, and used the garden for the child's benefit, but they desperately needed an additional bedroom. The solution was staring us in the face, but planning powers at that time simply did not allow an extension.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/10">There are ways of approaching this issue laterally or obliquely, but in the end, as my hon. Friend says, we have to deal with it by supply. That is the only real solution. We know that 54 per cent. of overcrowded families and 60 per cent. of families in temporary accommodation are in London. I have raised that issue publicly and privately with the Minister and her colleagues, and when I ask questions about affordable social housing, I tend to get answers about affordable owner-occupation housing. That is an important issue for young couples who are forced to move out of London and for people who need some form of intermediate housing, but at the end of the day the human misery I see every day and every week in my constituency relates to the lack of supply of affordable rented housing, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am being prompted to sit down, and I shall do so shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/11">I shall conclude with something slightly more hopeful&mdash;and something less hopeful; let us not be too optimistic. One local authority that I know intimately because I was a councillor there for 20 years&mdash;until last week&mdash;is Hammersmith and Fulham. It has an extremely good record on this issue. It is a very small and congested inner London borough, but between 1998 and 2006, 2,000 units of affordable housing were constructed, which is 70 per cent. of all housing constructed in the borough, with another 1,000 units in the pipeline.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/12">In that borough, 99.3 per cent. of capacity was addressed, compared with 2.8 per cent. in Hillingdon, 3.5 per cent. in Bromley and 3.8 per cent. in Redbridge. Many councils either do not have the skills or the will to do that. They need to have their arms twisted to do it far more, but in the end there are some councils&mdash;I am afraid this often does come down to party politics&mdash;that are not prepared to do it.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/13">On behalf of my constituents who live in overcrowded conditions, I greatly regret that the control of Hammersmith and Fulham changed hands last Thursday. I looked back at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the debate that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> secured in this room on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March</phrase> on the subject of overcrowding, and a very intelligent speech was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, who was very supportive of many initiatives. He based that speech on a visit he had made to a housing development in Hammersmith and Fulham the day before, and said that it was welcomed by residents in the area and all political parties. Every single affordable housing development in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham was opposed by the Conservative party during the past 20 years. That does not bode well for what will happen there now. The reasons change, but every single development was opposed.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/14">Planning powers and Government intervention are required, but we are talking about not only individual human misery but social engineering. We are talking about the poor and those who live in social housing effectively being told that they are not welcome in the inner city or in areas that are otherwise prosperous. The gulf between the private sector&mdash;owner-occupation, and even private rented accommodation&mdash;and social housing is so great, it is impossible, even for those on two or three times the average income, to bridge.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/15">The driving need is for an increase in social rented housing and a form of intermediate social housing. Unless that need is addressed, particularly in London, we are not only condemning another generation to live in appalling and inhuman conditions but changing the nature of London as we know it: a multi-racial, multi-class and vibrantly mixed community. That is my fear, and that is why housing will be such an important issue during the next 10 years. It is a big issue. The solution, as my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North said, may be simple, but it is difficult to achieve. I hope that the Government will now give it the attention it deserves.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.89.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" speakername="Clive Efford" colnum="89"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0074.htm#06051065000104">
	<p pid="c.89.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on securing a debate on this important issue. I, along with other hon. Members, particularly from London, have raised this issue on a number of occasions, with questions to the Prime Minister and in Westminster Hall debates. We have tried to highlight the issue by consistently stating that it has been overlooked on the political agenda and in debates about what should be the Government's priorities.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/2">A number of people have made the point that the Government must be clear about what they mean by affordable housing. In the past, it has been interpreted as a need for schemes to assist people to purchase houses. However, for many people in London, even with the discounts available through various Government schemes, those homes are just not affordable. Often, they require a deposit that is out of the affordability range of most people in desperate housing need.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/3">I am relieved that people such as the Chancellor want to see a case made for affordable housing. I am delighted that we are starting to get some response to the debate, but I appeal to the Government to take it on board from us that the clear but unstated hatred of and lack of trust in local authorities to deliver in this vital area must stop. They are the vehicle for change, and they can deliver the social housing that will change communities and provide the opportunities that families are currently being denied. We must remove the roadblocks in the way of local authorities' delivery of that change.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/4">My hon. Friend is right when she says that supply is the issue. I gave figures for my local authority whereby housing applications for 2004-05 were running at similar levels to those of 1999. The acceptance rate was more or less the same, but the figures for those waiting for housing were up by almost 60 per cent. Demand is not growing and outstripping supply&mdash;it is the supply that is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/5">The figures in my area also mask the underlying problem of those who are trapped in their family homes. Every week, my surgery is full of examples of three generations of a family who live in a house that the Labour party built. The grandchildren and the parents of those grandchildren are trapped in that home, and they are unable to move into housing in the same way as their parents were before them. The grandparents are looking to the Labour party and saying, &quot;We want you to build houses for our children, so that they can have the opportunities that we had to bring up our families.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/6">We have seen right to buy decimate the supply of social housing, but the sad fact is that at the other end, we have not seen any investment in the stock&mdash;to the point at which local authorities are building almost no properties at all.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/7">There is also a problem with the way in which we construct the finance for building new social housing schemes, and I believe that we can release much of the equity in new-build for reinvestment in the public sector. Too often, when my local authority sells a parcel of its land to the private sector and then negotiates under section 106 a proportion of the development of that land for social housing, the developer walks away with a huge profit from the sale of the rest of the site. I have spoken to housing associations that say, &quot;We can manage those schemes from beginning to end; we can sell the properties, bring the profits back into the public sector and reinvest them in further schemes in the local area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/8">We are frittering away our resources through the way in which we set up the finances for the development of social housing. We must tell local authorities that we want them to be more innovative, with self-financing schemes in some respects. We could consider placing a proportion of the rents under a prudential scheme, so that they finance some of the interest that must be paid. We must consider those schemes urgently.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/9">Regeneration of the Kidbrooke area in my constituency will result in 4,400 homes where there are currently just under 2,000, and about 2,000 of them will be affordable. Some will be part buy, part rent and others will be for rent through the social sector. However, it is still not too late to have a greater proportion of social housing in that development. Most of the land is in public ownership, and the financing package could be reviewed to provide more social housing for local people who desperately need it.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/10">People in the eastern corridor of London see beautiful houses being built in the Thames gateway and are fed up that they and their children do not have access to those houses because they are priced out. They are frustrated, and demonstrated that frustration clearly in the recent local elections. That fuels the lies of extremists such as the British National party who want to exploit the situation and people's feeling of desperation. They have done that successfully because we left the opportunity open to them and failed to address the problem of housing demand and the people who desperately need housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/11">We must expand the housing stock and provide the opportunity for money to be invested in houses to accommodate larger families. In return, families may have to sign away their right to buy for a period or even in perpetuity so that investment in housing can be made with the confidence that it will not disappear from the public sector. We must look at such schemes.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/12">Overcrowding is fuelling antisocial behaviour and is a block to improving standards in education. Young children who are at school will not sit and watch &quot;EastEnders&quot; with their parents if they live in an overcrowded house and sleep in a bedroom with their younger sister or brother. They will go out on the streets with their friends. They have nowhere to do their homework. We must cut the vicious circle. Only a Labour Government will deal with the problem and people need to receive that message loud and clear. The Government's duty is to tell people that housing is a priority and that Labour will deliver for them once and for all.</p>

	<p pid="c.91.0/1">Time is short so I shall be brief. Irefer hon. Members to my Adjournment debate on<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-28">28 March</phrase> for comments about Hackney, where overcrowding contributes to a population churn of more than 40 per cent. in some areas, which has a disastrous effect on public services.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.0/2">I want to focus on some key points that I would like the Minister to address. Why is there no explicit measure of efficiency for the Housing Corporation based on the cost of people living in a home rather than the cost per house? That defies common sense and has an impact on all the issues that hon. Members have raised. Will she give a commitment that bid support in future will reflect the number of people living in a home rather than the cost per property?</p>
	<p pid="c.91.0/3">There is also a lack of targeting for large-bedroomed houses in the current London housing strategy and I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that also. Will she look at Housing Corporation funding rules, because we have the crazy situation locally where for every pound that a local authority provides to a housing association the Housing Corporation removes a pound? That defies common sense and needs to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.0/4">I must mention the test case in my constituency concerning the Haggerston West and Kingsland estate. We are hoping to receive good news about providing more three and four-bedroomed properties after a long campaign of more than 10 years by residents, myself and local councillors, particularly councillor Jamie Carswell, who have fought to ensure that residents receive the housing they need rather than the one and two-bedroomed properties that Treasury rules seem to impose on them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.91.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="91"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0074.htm#06051065000122">
	<p pid="c.91.1/1">Although my contribution will last only a minute so that the Minister can speak, everything that has been said applies to the rest of England. I stress that a massive housing shortage is building up in other parts of England. We must not assume that problems of low pay, special needs, inflation in the private sector and the inadequacies of that sector do not also apply to the rest of England; they do.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/2">I have three pleas for the Minister. One is that she should deal properly with overcrowding, and bring forward consultation on standards, because we cannot let the shortage of housing continue to force people to live in such unacceptable conditions of overcrowding; also, perhaps she could ensure that proper consultation takes place about special needs and the impact of that issue on housing standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/3">My second plea is that the Minister should again examine the preventing homelessness agenda. I believe that it is leading to a real problem of hidden homelessness. People are being diverted into private sector renting, and although they should be diverted after their needs have been assessed, they are being diverted as soon as they apply, so that they never appear on the figures. I am very concerned about that. I am also concerned about standards of training among some of the staff who do the work.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/4">My third plea is that the Minister should attend to what is happening in the growth areas, such as mine. Lots of new housing is being built in Northampton, but it is all private sector housing and developers are subject to a requirement to provide percentages of affordable, not social, housing. As part of the growth agenda we need to ensure that there are, built in, adequate supplies of social housing to rent, not just shared equity properties, about which something has already been said. It should be understood that there is an economic factor. We need a good housing mix in the new communities that are being built.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/5">I hope that the brevity of my remarks will not be taken to reflect my view of the severity of the problems.</p>

	<p pid="c.92.0/1">I shall try to keep my remarks short to allow the Minister as much time as possible to respond; I am aware that Labour Members may want to raise additional points during her response.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know that she has long had an interest in the issues, and has been raising them for some time. I also congratulate the Minister on keeping her post during the recent turbulent period for the Government. I am delighted that she is still speaking on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/3">Decent housing should be a right, particularly for children but also for all citizens of the country. Poor housing leads to poor health and decreased opportunities in education and employment. In the past century the supply of social housing meant that people who were unable to enter the private renting or home ownership sectors had a realistic chance of being housed. In a time of prosperity such as we are now enjoying, why are so many more people in the UK suffering from inadequate housing, or, indeed, homelessness?</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/4">The fact is that successive Governments have sold off the vital resource of social housing for rent, without replacing it. Capital has been moved from housing as capital receipts have disappeared into the Treasury; of &pound;5.5 billion realised from sales of council housing only &pound;3.3 billion was granted through the Housing Corporation in the 2004-06 grant round.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/5">The effects in human terms of housing shortages can be seen every day, and hon. Members have referred to individual cases from their constituencies. In rural areas such as my constituency of North Cornwall there is little prospect for most families of staying in their home village or small town. We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit Öpik">my hon. Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>, who is no longer in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">his place, and from the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase>, about instances in their areas. Despite excellent work by housing associations, local authorities and charities to raise the issues and to squeeze the maximum amount of affordable housing and social rented housing from new developments, the shortage of properties to rent is still keenly felt.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/6">In addition to the effect on individual families and households of such circumstances, communities become unsustainable. Vital services suffer, with falls in school rolls and closures of post offices and shops. Voluntary bodies such as the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the coastguard and retained fire services find it hard to recruit in the areas that they serve, as the age profile changes, with a bias in favour of the capital-rich who can afford to live there.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/7">That frustration is alienating people from the political process. Electors are losing faith in the Government's ability to deliver solutions. We have already heard how that alienation has had another dangerous effect in urban areas. In the recent local elections, we saw a small but significant rise in support for far-right organisations and representatives. In some areas, people who have traditionally lived in strong communities have found themselves unable to do so as the housing shortage pushes them away. Such people are looking for someone who will listen or at least be seen to be listening. They hear a message from an organisation that says that it will work outside the political establishment, which has patently failed to deliver. That offers a scapegoat in other communities that suffer from inadequate housing, as we have heard. My father's roots are in the east end of London and my grandfather worked in the docks for the whole of his working life, so I am familiar with the strong communities that exist in the east of London.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/8">The lack of replacement housing has also been felt in the type of social housing that remains. The right to buy has taken away the larger homes, as well as homes in areas with better transport links and areas that were desirable for all sorts of reasons. The choice-based letting system has reduced the choice for tenants. It has also reduced the flexibility for local authorities to allow for transfers in the system, and for moves up and down the ladder of dwelling size.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/9">The 2007 spending review must begin to address that problem in a more meaningful way. At the end of last year, the number of families waiting for a council house stood at more than 1.5 million, which is a 50 per cent. increase since Labour came to power in 1997. Figures provided by Shelter, in its excellent and shocking report &quot;Building Hope&quot;, show that 116,000 homeless children are trapped in temporary accommodation. The Government have set themselves the target of halving that figure by 2010, but the number of new social rented homes that will be delivered on current trends will not allow that to be achieved. Further research undertaken at the behest of Shelter by the Centre for Housing and Planning Research at Cambridge university says that we will need an extra 30,000 new social rented homes each year between 2008 and 2011 to meet that urgent need.</p>
	<p pid="c.92.0/10">The lack of accommodation is forcing people to move into inadequate housing in the private sector that is often entirely inappropriate to need. Rents there are higher and housing benefit cannot cover the cost. That puts pressure on the Treasury, and the hon. Member for Banbury asked whether that was a sensible use of Treasury money.</p>

	<p pid="c.93.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman also reflect on the fact that private sector tenancies do not provide security? For a single parent with two children to be homeless after six months in one of those short tenancies is a real problem.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.94.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" speakername="Daniel Rogerson" colnum="94"  time="010:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0074.htm#06051065000138">
	<p pid="c.94.0/1">Absolutely. The hon. Lady makes a good point. There was a case in my constituency recently in which a young family who had just celebrated the birth of their first child were served with a notice to quit their shorthold tenancy. That was an incredibly stressful time for them. Despite the council's best efforts to look after that family, they simply joined a list of so many people waiting for housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/2">The lack of accommodation pushes people into poverty and can also keep them reliant on relatives for temporary accommodation. We have heard from Labour Members about such situations. Such accommodation is called temporary but is, in effect, semi-permanent. Overcrowding is worsened, and that is not helped by antiquated definitions that do not take account of the real needs of children and parents for privacy and space to work and play. I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> for her Adjournment debate earlier in the year, about which we have already heard some comments.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/3">Future developments to increase the overall supply of housing may allow the capital-rich individuals and families to benefit further by taking advantage of new market housing or even moving into buy to let. Significant housing investment could have a dramatic effect on the lives of people and their communities. The letter from the Prime Minister to the new Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on her appointment says:</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Thirdly, you will need to deliver the Government's policy in response to the Barker review of housing supply. Helping hard working families and first time buyers get their foot on the housing ladder should be a key priority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/5">Obviously, it is good to hear the Government setting that out. Even if one is being generous to the Prime Minister and his comments&mdash;not many have been in recent days&mdash;that letter did not appear to say much about social rented housing; it discussed families getting a foot on the housing ladder. I would like the Minister to say more about the emphasis that will be placed on new housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/6">The hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, in her excellent opening speech, discussed creating a genuine mix of tenure to ensure the availability of social housing in all areas, urban and rural. She made some excellent points. Again, my party and I would agree that new investment must not be financed by rent hikes. The affordability of such properties is the key to their value in meeting the need. Several hon. Members have pointed out the difference between affordable housing and social rented housing, and I was glad to hear them do so because it is a key point.</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/7">In the 2007 comprehensive spending review, the Government have an opportunity to turn around years of underinvestment in affordable housing. The Treasury's website states that the review involves</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a more strategic approach to asset management and investment decisions, ensuring the UK is equipped with the infrastructure needed to support both public service delivery and the productivity and flexibility of the wider economy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.94.0/9">What could be a more important investment decision underpinning education, health, regeneration and the needs of the economy than setting forth an ambitious plan for new housing appropriate to the needs of the people? The Chancellor has spoken a great deal about renewal; this is his opportunity to act.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.95.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1764" speakername="Robert Syms" colnum="95"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0075.htm#06051065000145">
	<p pid="c.95.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on raising this topic. Every time I come to debates on housing, Members crowd in, trying to make a contribution. It strikes me that the subject ought to be debated on the Floor of the House, perhaps in a full-day debate. I know that the Whip is not in his place, but I hope that the Minister takes the message back that housing is a live issue. When Members of Parliament discuss housing, one can see that to them the subject is not just statistics; they talk about families sitting in front of Members in their surgeries. Nothing is more frustrating for us than to hear about the continuing need of families who want housing. We know that we will write letters, phone people up and follow up cases, but there is probably little hope of such people accessing the housing that they need. One of the worrying effects of the frustration that people feel was seen in the local elections&mdash;people voting for the British National party and so on.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.0/2">One of the least expected consequences of the 1997 election was that the building of social housing declined substantially. As a Conservative Member, I did not expect that to happen. Although the number of social housing completions is now picking up, the scale of the problem makes that a drop in the ocean. We know that there is a major problem. Owner-occupation, higher house prices and the world of equity withdrawal is one side of a coin that leaves many people who cannot afford to get into that world with difficulties in accessing housing. The homelessness figures and the fact that more than 100,000 families are in temporary accommodation show that there is a real problem. The number of first-time buyers has collapsed from a normal yearly average of about 500,000 to about 320,000 last year, and those who cannot afford to become owner-occupiers become those on the list for social housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.0/3">I am pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">my hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> joined the debate to provide the shire counties angle. There is no Member of this House who does not have housing problems in their constituency. One or two Members mentioned the economics of housing, but I am not sure that there are any; it simply seems to be a complicated and complex area. My hon. Friend's suggestion that we examine the whole issue in relation to the way in which housing benefit works is eminently sensible.</p>
	<p pid="c.95.0/4">Council housing has been little mentioned in today's debate. I remember a debate in Westminster Hall on council housing and the fourth way. Sometimes the former Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was a little more concerned about stock transfer than about dealing with council housing. One of the interesting things that I drew from the Library brief is that the demand for council housing has picked up substantially, by more than 50 per cent. In the south-east of England the relevant figure is 77 per cent. and in London it is 71 per cent. Despite that, there are 700,000 voids. Although a perfect system is not possible, if 1.5 million people are waiting for housing and there are 700,000 empty properties, it should be a great priority of public policy to fill the voids where possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.96.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman also support a move to allow local authorities to purchase private sector properties that are left vacant for a long time?

	<p pid="c.96.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has put his finger on the problem that many empty homes are not accessed by the local community. I am in the fortunate position of being a spokesman for a party with no policies&mdash;apart from on the environment&mdash;but we are undertaking a detailed policy review. We are also a very broad-based party, so if the hon. Gentleman has interesting ideas on housing that he wants to feed into that review, they will no doubt be taken into account. Given the pressures that we face, particularly in London, it is difficult for communities to be unable to access the many empty homes that they see. There are many initiatives to deal with the problem, including ones to bring flats over shops and elsewhere back into use.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.1/2">A lot more can be done on many of the estates that have been criticised. There could be more mixed tenure on some of them, and Castle Vale in Birmingham is an example of what can be done. If we manage estates and put a bit of tender care and investment into them, we can make them more attractive places for people to live. Design was also mentioned, and we cannot talk about housing without focusing on design and what can be done to improve some of the existing housing stock.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.1/3">There is a major problem, which needs substantially more debate. There are no easy answers, however, and public policy must include a range of measures to deal with the issue. None the less, all hon. Members are very much aware of the pressures faced by many families in our constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="c.96.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on securing the debate and on her tireless work on housing issues over many years. I certainly welcome the expertise and help that she has given me over the past year or so while I have been working on housing issues. I know that she will continue to campaign on them in the House and in her constituency.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/2">As hon. Members will know, the Chancellor said that social housing will be a priority in the coming spending review, so the debate is timely. They will also know that we have made it clear that we need to build more homes for the next generation. That means more social housing, more shared equity housing and more private housing. Although I shall talk mainly about social housing and the issues that hon. Members have raised, I should make it clear at the beginning that the need for more social housing to be built should not be met at the expense of the need for more shared equity housing and more private housing to be built. We need all three.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/3">We must be clear that the long-term, underlying problem&mdash;whether we are talking about social housing in London, affordability in Northamptonshire, or the issues that have been raised in respect of Banbury and other parts of the country&mdash;is the gap between housing demand and housing supply. In the past 30 years, we have seen a 30 per cent. increase in the number of households and a 50 per cent. drop in the level of new house building. That is unsustainable. Current projections show that about 200,000 new households will be formed each year as a result of an ageing, growing population and, primarily, as a result of more people living alone, but we build about 150,000 to 160,000 new homes every year. That gap is simply unsustainable, and if it persists, the proportion of 30-year-old couples who can afford their own home will decline from more than 50 per cent. today to nearer 30 per cent. in 20 years. If we think that there are pressures on social housing now, imagine what they will be like in 20 years if we do not build the additional homes that we need.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/4">Many people who are waiting for social housing would prefer to be able to buy their own home or a share of their own home, but they will not be able to afford to do so if long-term house prices keep rising beyond their reach. The wider issue, therefore, is that we need to build new homes for the next generation. That has been controversial in many parts of the country and with other political parties, but we must recognise the country's long-term needs and the huge and serious consequences in terms of the demand for social housing if we do not address them. There will be problems with overcrowding, affordability and constraints on people's aspirations for the next generation and the future if we do not address that long-term need.</p>
	<p pid="c.96.2/5">Clearly, we need to proceed in a sensible way. We must ensure that we fund the necessary infrastructure and increase environmental standards as we do so, but I say to local authorities across the country, including the London boroughs, that they need to recognise their critical role in the planning and housing systems and in supporting the new homes that we need for the future. That is why the Mayor wants to increase the number of new homes in London, and why the Thames Gateway development and other growth areas are so important.</p>

	<p pid="c.97.0/1">Is the Minister's Department prepared to intervene in major developments in London or elsewhere if there is insufficient housing for affordable rent included in the scheme, and to insist that there should be such housing? Is she prepared to ensure that major applications are called in for that purpose?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.97.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1762" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="97"  time="010:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0075.htm#06051065000159">
	<p pid="c.97.1/1">We have a call-in process, and on occasion we call in developments on that basis if there are concerns about the level of affordability not meeting the requirements of the local plan and national planning guidance. Although we have those powers, however, we think that responsibility for that lies primarily with local authorities. It is important to recognise that there is considerable flexibility within the planning system that many local authorities do not use. They should use their planning powers to support and promote development and good design, and to ensure that there is a proper mix of affordable housing, including social housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.97.1/2">I shall talk about social housing in particular, because that has been the main focus of the debate. As part of our preparation for the spending review we are conducting extensive analysis of the future need for social housing and considering not only overall supply and the level of need, but aspects such as mixed communities, the location of social housing, work incentives and the problems of high levels of worklessness in large social housing estates. Some work has been on that done by Kate Barker, and some by Cambridge academics and Shelter. We are also looking at the backlog of need for social housing and people in temporary accommodation and the need to ensure that they can have settled and secure accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.97.1/3">Hon. Members will be aware that we have increased investment and the number of new social homes by50 per cent. over a three-year period, and we have said that we need to go further. We must recognise that there have been major calls on housing capital investment, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase> said. In 1997 we inherited a &pound;19 million backlog of repairs and maintenance and there was a need for a massive programme of investment in our social and council housing across the country. Had we not introduced the decent homes programme, we would be here today debating hon. Members' constituency cases of people living in homes without central heating and with no prospect of getting it, or in homes in a shocking state of repair with the windows falling down and leaks in the roof, and no prospect of getting them repaired. We are not having those debates because we have invested so much in decent housing.</p>

	<p pid="c.98.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for giving way and for her comments so far. We talk about building 10,000 homes this year, but everyone knows that that will not be achieved; Barker suggested building 17,000 homes a year, and the Cambridge study suggested an additional 10,000. Can the Minister reassure Labour Members that the Department recognises that there is a substantial gap there? Until that issue is addressed, problem cases will continue to come to our surgeries, and, perhaps more important, housing will become a much larger political issue, and we may well face the consequences of that in the next general election.</p>

	<p pid="c.98.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point. We have said that we need to increase social housing. We are already increasing the level of new build of social housing, but we have made it clear that we need to go further and that that will be a priority for the spending review. We have taken Kate Barker's recommendations extremely seriously, but we are doing further work on the issue to assess what levels of investment will be needed in future. That is why I said the debate is timely: it can feed into the work not only in the Department but across the Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.99.0/1">On the point about central heating, there need to be clear specifications as to what is acceptable heating. I deal with many cases in which if people have storage heaters or if a previous tenant, perhaps an old person, said that they did not want central heating, the house is ring-fenced and does not get the improvements that it needs. There are still questions about what qualifies for some of the specifications, and the problems remain.</p>

	<p pid="c.99.1/1">We have set straightforward, decent homes standards, but I am happy to talk further to my hon. Friend about the detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.1/2">We must recognise that construction costs and, in particular, land costs have increased. Part of the reason why land costs have increased is that there is a rising housing market at a time when we are simply not making available enough land and building enough homes. The land costs feed into social housing costs, creating pressure on the social housing budget. That is why all these issues must be seen as part of a wider issue about making available land for new homes and tackling the pressures in the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.1/3">We recognise that we are left with significant challenges. We need to increase supply and consider social housing as well as shared equity and private housing. That requires investment, which creates serious challenges for Opposition parties, given their position on the third fiscal rule. Investment in infrastructure is also required, which is why the consultation on matters such as the planning gain supplement is such an important underpinning. Again, that is a challenge for Opposition parties.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.1/4">I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1571" name="Clive Efford">my hon. Friend the Member for Eltham (Clive Efford)</phrase> that we are hostile to the role of local councils. I have said before that I believe they play an important role in the planning system. I also believe that their role in housing is hugely important. I am not talking simply about the work that they can do through section 106 agreements and partnerships with registered social landlords. Clearly, there are wide differences between the levels of social housing that some local councils are able to achieve through section 106 agreements and those that others can achieve. However, let me say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> that most of central Government's funding for new homes goes through housing associations, because they can lever in additional independent investment so that we get up to 40 per cent. more homes for the same money. That is worth doing at a time when we need to increase supply.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.1/5">We could use local authorities far more to create more supply and we are considering a series of ways to do that, such as local authorities using their own land to support new homes&mdash;both social housing and shared equity housing, interestingly. We are working with some of the local authorities in London that were previously under Labour control. We hope that, although they have changed hands, they will continue to be interested in this issue, but we do not yet know whether they will be.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.1/6">We are also examining the use of housing benefit. Hon. Members asked about housing benefit and the fact that, particularly where people are in temporary accommodation in high-cost areas, a lot of money is paid through housing benefit. What more can we do to bring those costs down and use the savings to invest in increasing social housing? We are providing support for an interesting pilot programme in Newham, which involves, in effect, buying back properties to increase social housing over time to help people out of temporary accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="c.99.1/7">Several hon. Members referred to overcrowding, which we take very seriously. With my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North, I have visited families in very serious circumstances. We must do the consultation on the overcrowding standards, but that will not solve the problem. We must consider a much wider overcrowding strategy. Overcrowding is particularly a London issue, as we can see when we compare the figures for London with those for areas outside London. Overcrowding makes a big difference in London, which is why we are working with the Greater London authority to try to integrate approaches to overcrowding into homelessness intervention strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.101.3/1">I requested this debate because I am concerned that the Government's new proposals, part of the &quot;controlling our borders: making migration work for Britain&quot; programme, will have a devastating effect on migrant domestic workers, who make up one of the most vulnerable groups of workers in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/2">Unfortunately, I believe that the proposals will establish legal channels allowing migrant domestic workers to be brought into the UK for the purpose of exploitation. By removing even the most basic employment rights and leaving them powerless before abusive employers, they will effectively legalise trafficking, which I am certain the Government do not intend.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/3">In fact, the proposals are a complete reversal of the Government's previous policy, which was specifically intended to protect vulnerable workers. Migrant domestic workers are an exceptional category under immigration law. Since 1998, an employer has been able to apply for a migrant domestic worker to obtain a special visa. The rules of the visa allow the worker to change employer&mdash;a right that many other visa categories do not have. In order to qualify for the visa, migrant domestic workers must have been working with their employer for a minimum of one year outside the UK. When the employer applies for a tourist or a settlement visa, they can also apply for a migrant domestic worker visa for their employee. At present,80 per cent. of migrant domestic workers accompany tourists, and 20 per cent. accompany those with settlement visas. The law was introduced to encourage wealthy foreign nationals to come to the UK and help boost the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/4">About 10,000 migrant domestic worker visas were issued in 2003-04. If, as proposed, the visa were curtailed and became a six-month, non-renewable, non-transferable visa, the impact would be devastating. Migrant domestic workers who enter the UK accompanying their employer can leave that employer if they are abused or exploited. That gives them vital protection against violence, mistreatment and exploitation. They receive basic protection under UK employment law, and they are entitled to the national minimum wage, statutory holiday pay and a notice period. As a worker, their visa is renewed annually, and renewal is dependent on the migrant domestic worker being in full-time employment as a domestic worker in a private household. There is also a right to apply for settlement and for family reunification.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/5">Those rights were won after 10 long years of organising and campaigning by migrant domestic workers themselves, with the support of the labour movement, trade unions and the British public. When the Labour Government came to power, they did not forget the commitment that they made in opposition, bringing migrant domestic workers out of the shadows of illegality and into the light.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/6">Unfortunately, although the regulations provide some protection, they do not mean that employers stop abusing their domestic workers. Kalayaan, an organisation that helps migrant domestic workers and campaigns on their behalf, has documented the abuse that occurs within the relationship between migrant domestic workers and their employers. Among 114 workers registered at Kalayaan, during the two sample months of August 2004 and August 2005, 75 per cent. reported psychological abuse; 34 per cent. reported physical abuse; over 57 per cent. did not have their own room and reported sleeping in public spaces, such as the living room, kitchen or hallway or shared rooms with children, ensuring that they were always, &quot;on call&quot;; and 40 per cent. reported having to sleep on the floor. Kalayaan registers approximately 400 migrant domestic workers per year who have left their employers because of abuse. That is obviously just the tip of the iceberg. Many are unaware of the organisation, or their rights, and are too scared to seek help.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/7">Under the current system, those workers have been able to escape abuse by leaving their original employer, provided they find employment of a similar nature and are able to maintain their immigration status as a domestic worker. The Home Office paper on the points-based migration system, as it was presented to Parliament in March, does not include migrant domestic workers. However, the draft proposals presented to Kalayaan by the immigration and nationality directorate show that it will restrict domestic workers accompanying their employer to a maximum of six months, with no right to change employer and no route to settlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/8">The proposals raise the most serious concerns. First, they will effectively legalise trafficking. If these proposals come into force, migrant domestic workers will be outside the managed migration system. Instead, they will come to the UK as business visitors, tied to their employer for a maximum of six months. They will have no option to change employer during this time, or to renew their visa, which will make it virtually impossible to challenge any maltreatment or abuse. Indeed, it may encourage it. That is in direct contravention of the Home Office's stated policy to protect victims of trafficking, and to stop trafficking &quot;at source&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/9">Secondly, the proposals will lead to an increase in abuse and illegality. Taking away the provision to renew their visa or to change employers, as well as making the employer responsible&mdash;which it would&mdash;for ensuring that migrant domestic workers leave the UK at the end of their stay, will dramatically increase the power that the employer has over the worker. That will inevitably lead to increased levels of abuse and more migrant domestic workers will be forced underground where they will be further exploited by employers taking advantage of their irregular status.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/10">Finally, the proposals will remove full access to employment law. Despite the immigration and nationality directorate stating that migrant domestic workers will be recognised as workers under the new scheme, it cannot be possible in practice to access UK employment law within the six months allowed, without the right to find alternative employment. As soon as a migrant domestic workers leave an employer, they will be homeless and destitute with no right to support themselves in work. As I understand it, there is a belief in the Home Office that employers settling in the UK will probably keep their migrant domestic worker for six months until they find a new one in the UK. They will then send the migrant domestic worker back home. Whether they are sent back to the employer's country or their own is not yet clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/11">Many employers hold their workers' passports illegally. Last year, I introduced a Bill that would have made the retention of another person's passport illegal. It is not yet illegal here, and employers often hold their workers' passports. There is a danger that migrant domestic workers will not be sent home but will be held here, completely illegally, for much longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/12">Six months is not an effective time to mount a challenge under employment law if an employer is abusing staff. I am aware that the Home Office is seeking to identify abusive employers at the port of entry, which is excellent. However, migrant domestic workers have revealed in confidence to workers at Kalayaan that they are trained to answer such questions at United Kingdom embassies.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/13">Changes to the migrant domestic worker visa mean that employees would be completely tied to the employer. Many employers already believe that they have ownership of their staff, and withhold their passports or keep them locked away in their houses. Many migrant domestic workers are terrified when they seek help from Kalayaan or other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/14">Employers often tell such workers that they will be illegal if they leave their employer, that they will be deported, and that immigration will seek them out. Unfortunately, if the migrant domestic worker visa is not continued, that may well become true, and trafficking in such workers will effectively have been legitimised, leaving employers in complete control.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/15">In my experience, migrant domestic workers are among the most conservative groups of people one could ever meet. They want to do things correctly, to pay their taxes and to live within the rules. They are not scroungers. This ill-conceived policy will have a devastating impact if it is enacted as it stands.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/16">I fully accept that managed migration is in the interests of the UK and I support the Government's policy of delivering a system that they describe as firm but fair, simpler, more transparent and more rigorous&mdash;a system that will benefit our economy and protect our borders. However, over the generations migrant workers have enriched the UK both economically and culturally. We need to ensure that the UK economy can safely continue to benefit from the input of migrant workers, and that they can live here safely.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/17">The fact is that the abuse or exploitation of migrant workers, who have every right to live and work here, continues apace at the hands of unscrupulous employers. A major challenge for the Government is to ensure that those vulnerable workers receive the full protection of our employment law. I therefore request that the Government review their own evidence&mdash;evidence that resulted in changes to the existing immigration law in 1998&mdash;in order to afford protection to migrant domestic workers. As a minimum, the existing provisions that protect the human rights of that marginalised and vulnerable category of workers must be maintained.</p>

	<p pid="c.104.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/2">I welcome the opportunity to reply for the Government on this important subject. I take seriously my hon. Friend's concern, which she has expressed on a number of occasions. She raised some important points, which I wish to address.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/3">Before I respond to the debate, however, I shall begin with an overview of the Government's approach to managing migration to the United Kingdom and thus put in context the position of those who are the subject of the debate and who are provided for under current immigration rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/4">The Government are&mdash;and have been&mdash;very clear that migration makes a substantial contribution to economic growth. It helps to fill gaps in the labour market, including key public services, such as health and education. Migration also increases investment, innovation and entrepreneurship in the UK. Culturally, we are enriched by people with diverse backgrounds from other countries. With an expanded EU, an accessible and mobile work force are already contributing to our growing economy, closing many gaps experienced by employers. Our starting point is that employers should look first to recruit from the UK and the expanded EU before recruiting migrants from outside the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/5">Migration needs to be properly managed. It is understandable that people migrate to seek a better life for themselves and their families, but that can leave settled populations, including many in the UK, concerned about the impact on jobs, public services and their way of life. The system should therefore be focused primarily on bringing in migrants who are highly skilled, or bringing in migrants to do key jobs that cannot be filled from the domestic labour force or from the EU. The system should also be robust against abuse. Only those of benefit to the UK should be admitted, and once here they must comply with the conditions of their leave.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/6">That, then, is the underlying strategy. On that basis, we outlined our proposals for a five-tier managed migration system in the Command Paper &quot;A Points-Based System: Making Migration Work for Britain&quot;, which was presented to this House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. The new points-based system forms part of our five-year strategy for asylum and immigration, which was published in February 2004. A thorough consultation on the points-based system was undertaken following the publication of a consultation document, &quot;Selective Admission: Making Migration Work for Britain&quot;, and those proposals were generally well received by stakeholders and the media.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/7">The aim of the new system is to develop a more efficient and transparent migration system, which sets out clearly who is permitted to come to the UK and why. We want to design a system that is better able to identify and attract those migrants who have most to contribute to the UK&mdash;one that offers a more efficient, transparent and objective process and which improves compliance while reducing scope for abuse. As part of that work we have reviewed existing routes for employment, training and study with a view to identifying which are of most benefit to the UK. Underpinning the new migration system will be a five-tier framework replacing more than 80 work and study routes. That will help people to understand how the system works and will direct applicants to the category that is most appropriate for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/8">Tier 1 will cover those highly skilled individuals who can contribute to growth and productivity. Tier 2 will be for skilled workers with a job offer, who can fill gaps in the UK labour force. Tier 3 will provide forlimited numbers of low-skilled workers needed to fill temporary labour shortages. Tier 4 will accommodate overseas students and tier 5 will cover what we describe as youth mobility and temporary workers: people who are allowed to work in the UK for a limited period, primarily to satisfy non-economic objectives. Examples might be a teacher on an exchange scheme or a sportsperson coming here to take part in a charity event.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/9">We also intend to set up an independent body to identify employment shortages across all sectors of the economy, known as the skills advisory body. It will build on existing structures and expertise&mdash;in particular the skills for business network, which is funded in part by the Department for Education and Skills. Shortages identified by the skills advisory body will inform Government decisions on the use of migrant labour within tiers 2 and 3 of the points-based system.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/10">I shall turn now to the position of overseas domestic workers within this framework. Overseas domestic workers accompanying their employer to the UK are generally low-skilled. As I have explained, our policy under the points-based system is to phase out low-skilled migration in response to the number of workers available from the newly enlarged EU. We expect that in most cases EU countries should be able to provide us with adequate labour in this respect. However, as I said earlier, tier 3 of the points-based system may provide for limited numbers of low-skilled workers to fill specific temporary labour shortages where those are identified by the independent skills advisory body. We have also proposed that in the Command Paper.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/11">We do not currently have any evidence of a shortage of domestic workers. Were the skills advisory body to identify one, and were we to decide that immigration was the appropriate response, we could set up a quota-based, operator-led, time-limited route under tier 3 for overseas domestic workers with countries with which the UK has effective returns agreements. However, admission on that basis would be temporary. If employers want to employ low-skilled domestic staff on a long-term basis, they can look to the resident and EU labour market. There is evidence that that is what they are doing. More than 14,000 nationals of the new member states registered under the worker registration scheme as cleaners and domestic staff between May 2004 and <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-31">31 December 2005</phrase>. We will not therefore be providing a route for overseas domestic workers under the points-based system. Those who are skilled and can meet the relevant requirements may be able to come to the UK under tier 2. We will also be making very limited provision for those currently referred to as domestic workers to accompany another visitor to the UK in certain defined circumstances, under the arrangements for business visitors. An example of that might be where a family on holiday in the UK want to bring their nanny with them.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/12">We of course recognise that there are real concerns about abuse and exploitation of overseas domestic workers, and we will continue to make every effort to protect migrant workers in general from abuse while they are in the UK. Were domestic workers to be provided for under tier 3, we would of course need to ensure that they were not being exploited, and we would work with trade unions and others to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/13">My hon. Friend raised some specific points about abuse. It is important to state again that we recognise the concerns about abuse and exploitation of domestic workers in private households. However, immigration is not the way to deal with that. We are dealing with it in a number of ways. To understand how we are addressing matters such as abuse and trafficking, which my hon. Friend mentioned, it is important that what we are discussing today is seen in conjunction with other Government legislation. We have introduced legislation comprehensively to criminalise trafficking in human beings. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced wide-ranging offences covering trafficking into, within and out of the UK for any sexual exploitation. A new offence of trafficking people for exploitation covering forced labour, removal of organs and the trafficking of vulnerable people including children is included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. The maximum punishment for all these offences is 14 years' imprisonment. That shows the seriousness with which the Government view these types of offences to do with abuse and exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/14">We also have the Reflex joint taskforce, and with the establishment of the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the UK will continue to focus on targeting the organised crime groups that cause the most harm. We recently launched a public consultation on our strategy to combat trafficking and are committed to developing a national action plan to provide a comprehensive, end-to-end approach covering different elements, from prevention, including demand reduction, through investigating and prosecuting traffickers, to protecting and supporting victims.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/15">My hon. Friend mentioned interviews at port of entry. We are not in a position at present to insist that the national minimum wage is paid to certain categories of workers, within which overseas domestic workers would fall, but we do attempt through interview to establish terms and conditions that meet the requirements that we would expect for all domestic workers in the UK, not just overseas domestic workers.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/16">We are reviewing future requirements for admitting domestic workers to the UK and have already offered to liaise with Kalayaan, which has worked very hardon the issue. Options might include retaining theexisting requirement for employment to have existed for 12 months prior to coming to the UK, and insisting that the domestic worker is paid at least the national minimum wage. Those useful discussions would deal with points that my hon. Friend raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/17">On access to employment law, we are working with the Department of Trade and Industry on the protections that are available in respect of business visitors under UK employment law, but we must bear in mind that they will be covered by other aspects of UK legislation such as the Human Rights Act 1998.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/18">In conclusion, I hope that I have clearly set out the position for the House and addressed some of the concerns that my hon. Friend raised eloquently and with feeling. After a lengthy process of review and consultation, we have set out plans for winding up the quota-based schemes for admitting low-skilled workers for specific sectors, in light of the availability of labour from an expanded EU. Alongside that, we will not in the future provide a specific route for overseas domestic workers, who are generally low-skilled, under the points-based system.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.2/19">I hope that I have given some assurance to my hon. Friend about the Government's commitment to protect all workers from abuse and about our awareness of the issues that she raised. Furthermore, although we shall not pursue a policy of offering overseas domestic workers from outside the EU a route for settlement, we remain strongly committed to dealing with any abuse to which such workers could be subjected.</p>

	<p pid="c.108.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the subject of cancer services in south Essex, which is a subject that I have been working on over <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the past few months with my hon. Friends the Members for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase>, for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), co-ordinating some of the activity in south Essex on our collective behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/2">I am acutely aware that cancer is an emotive subject, with one in three people directly affected by it and virtually all of us indirectly affected. It was with some trepidation that I began to engage with the subject matter locally, but the bottom line is that, without being sensationalist, I genuinely believe that there will be a materially worse service in south Essex as a result of the changes that are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/3">Those changes are the merger of the South Essex cancer network with the Mid Anglia network. I shall give a bit of the history of what has been happening. As far back as the mid-1980s, there was a threat of merger, which disappeared following a local campaign. The Calman Hine report in 1995 rightly suggested introducing cancer networks, and a year later the South Essex cancer network was created. In 2001-02, the network came under threat and mergers were proposed across the whole of Essex. There was a lot of local debate, and a large campaign was run by the <i>Southend Echo</i> and a number of colleagues who were in the House at the time to keep hands off the cancer network and to leave it as it was.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/4">This morning, I was reading the papers from back then and Mike Richards, the cancer tsar, said that he could barely come to the House of Commons without someone mentioning Southend to him. He kindly agreed to come down to Southend and decided that it was right for south Essex and for cancer patients that the merger did not go ahead at that point. More recently, in December 2005, the strategic health authority started a consultation, which although it was extensive was fundamentally flawed and a bit of a sham. I will explain the distinction later and go into the consultation process in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/5">In terms of parliamentary activity, we have been doing an awful lot. We spoke in the Opposition day debate on cancer, have met the strategic health authority a number of times and a petition has gained about 5,000 signatures. Collectively and individually, we have made formal consultation submissions to the SHA and, of course, as one would expect, we have been corresponding with the main players and have visited the cancer centre a number of times. Unfortunately, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase> the SHA decided to press ahead with the change. Since then I have tabled a number of written questions and written to the Secretary of State. The Minister was kind enough to reply to those, and I shall go into those matters on which I was disappointed by the lack of detail in the reply and those on which I was looking to tease out whether the merger will be good for patients. The case has certainly not been proved and, on balance, would be adverse at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/6">In summary, the South Essex cancer network was created 10 years ago. I hope that the Minister will consider not effectively abolishing it through merger. The network covers a population of approximately 730,000 and the main hospitals of Southend and Basildon. In many ways, the merger has been brought about because of activities outside south Essex, specifically the decision by Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire to pull Ipswich out of the Mid Anglia network to the north. Crucially, the South Essex network had no involvement in that decision but was fundamentally affected by the knock-on effect.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/7">The South Essex and Mid Anglia networks are two of the three smallest cancer networks in the United Kingdom. I wrote to the Minister asking for details of the population size, but I could not get definitive figures, so perhaps she can correct me and give some figures on the smaller cancer networks.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/8">I want to prove, first, that there was no need for change, secondly, that one size does not fit all, in terms of cancer network sizes, and, thirdly, that the consultation was fundamentally flawed and that the decision had been taken well before the start of the consultation. I also have a number of questions that I hope that the Minister will answer either today or in writing, as she considers appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/9">There are things that I shall not touch on. Essex cancer services is a broad subject, and I shall focus primarily on the network and the merger. I shall not talk in detail about changes to upper gastrointestinal, urological and head and neck cancer services, although other Members may want to contribute on those subjects in more detail, as they are not uncontroversial. However, very few people are affected by those cancers, and the big issue for me is the network overall, rather than the merger of services for those specific cancers.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh, when introducing me to the subject, summarised the whole issue by saying, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; That is probably a fair reflection of the overall feeling in south Essex. The cancer network is doing a fantastic job. In fact, it is one of the leading cancer networks in the United Kingdom, and I would like to pay particular tribute to the lead clinician, Dr. Colin Trask, and the lead manager, Kevin McKenny, who I am sure will read the report of the debate with great interest. The service has a fantastic reputation not only locally, but among its peers. I could quote a whole series of barometer statistics about cancer care, but suffice it to say that statistically it does an excellent job.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/11">At the moment, most of the cancer care network, and most transport communications, in Essex go east-west, not north-south, because when people are treated in Essex and are looking for specialist services, they look to London. There are no significant patient flows north-south or south-north, so the merger is inappropriate, given the movement of people.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/12">Early on, our campaign talked about saving the cancer centre. A few people have called us sensationalist. It is true that the cancer centre will not close tomorrow, next week, next month or even next year, but I feel that this is a case of death by a thousand cuts. A salami-slice approach is being taken to reducing things&mdash;a little bit is taken off here, and a little bit is taken off there. There will be a reduction until a critical mass is reached, which will mean that Southend cancer centre will not be able to attract the excellent clinicians that it does at the moment and maintain its excellent reputation.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/13">Also, we are told that the change is purely administrative. If it is purely an administrative matter, then given that there is so much public opinion against the change in south Essex, and given that we are talking about only 20 or 30 people in terms of gastrointestinal cases, why press ahead with it? I have a sinister suspicion that the change is not purely administrative, but is a stepping stone to other changes, and I seek the Minister's reassurance that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/14">I need to be careful when talking about the Mid Anglia cancer network, because clearly we south Essex MPs are proud of our services, but perhaps I could quote what other people have said, rather than making a judgment on the network myself. Some people have told me that the Mid Anglia network is unstable at the moment, and others say that there are lots of problems with Ipswich having left. I recognise that there may be benefits for Mid Anglia in the merger, but there are certainly no benefits for my residents in Rochford and Southend, East, or for constituents generally across south Essex. Perhaps the strategic health authority is formulating an equation for the greater good of the residents of Essex, but the equation does not work for me. South Essex loses a little and Mid Anglia gains a lot. That may work overall, but it does not work for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/15">There is a feeling that bigger is better, but I am not sure that that is right when it comes to cancer networks. It seems from speaking to some patient groups and GPs that the opposite might be true and that some cancer centres may be too large. One of the greatest challenges is to identify cancer early at GP level and to refer patients to the correct person for a proper diagnosis. A closer relationship between the cancer networks and individual GP practices would be more easily facilitated if the networks were slightly smaller. I am suggesting not a radical change, but a change in direction, and it may be better to keep them as they are or to reduce them slightly.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/16">The cancer centre made the point that it is already working across boundaries in some cases and sharing best practice. I shall go into more detail about how one size does not fit all. I mentioned the 1995 Calman Hine report. It is 10 years old but is still relevant and still resonates. I want to draw attention to some quotes from the report. The first is about the size of the population and states:</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/17" class="indent">&quot;The size of a population served by a Cancer Unit cannot be inflexibly defined but will be determined by the number of cases of each cancer type being seen there&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/18">It is critical that a network is based on the number of cancer incidents rather than the population. South Essex has pockets of deprivation with, sadly, a higher incidence of cancer and demographically it has a much older population. Those were the two reasons given by the Government's cancer tzar for not going ahead with the decision to merge the network in 2002. Those reasons remain true today.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/19">Secondly, the report states:</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/20" class="indent">&quot;Decisions will have to be taken forward in the light of local circumstances and take account of the views of patients&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/21">patients do not want this&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/22" class="indent">&quot;and their carers as well as the professionals involved in providing care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/23">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/24" class="indent">&quot;The Group recognise that the development of the ideal pattern of service should build upon existing patterns of referral and care and should take account of geographical constraints.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/25">That is the opposite of what is happening. There are no existing patterns of referral north and south and there are transport constraints. It is normally quite difficult to travel around south Essex and people who need cancer care do not want to be stuck in traffic for hours before receiving important treatment.</p>

	<p pid="c.111.0/1">I apologise for interrupting my hon. Friend because he is making a good speech.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/2">To amplify what my hon. Friend said about the quota being under 1 million, when the network was established it was specifically given a derogation from the 1 million level because the NHS accepted that there was a higher than average number of elderly people and that actuarially, unfortunately, cancer would be slightly more prevalent in that population group. There was enough business to make a cancer network of 750,000 viable. The point that I want to stress is that that was built in from the day when the network was established. It was looked at from day one and accepted, so it should not be overturned.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.111.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" speakername="James Duddridge" colnum="111"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0077.htm#06051065000238">
	<p pid="c.111.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for raising that. He has been involved in the matter for a considerable period, more so than I have. I completely agree that the 1 million figure is largely arbitrary and inappropriate for the South Essex cancer network. It does not take account of the local situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/2">I explained why I found one of the replies to a written question unhelpful. I was trying to probe whether there was a statistical correlation between the size of the cancer network, the number of treatments and the success rate. I also asked the Secretary of State for the population catchment size for each cancer network in England and the Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Department does not hold the population catchment size for each cancer network. However, a typical cancer network services a population of around one to two million.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-18">18 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 385W.]</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/4">That statistic perhaps went into the first column of some form of analysis. The second column would have been the actual cancers identified each year. Around 3,500 cancers are identified in the South Essex cancer network. The following column would be an indicator of the success of those units&mdash;for example, long-term survival rates. I appreciate that that is a much harder figure to obtain, but nevertheless it is important. I seek the Minister's guidance on the exact measure that she could take within the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/5">The final column would be the statistical correlation between those first three numbers. Nowhere in my discussions, the circulated paperwork or the responses to my questions have I seen that statistical analysis for the cancer network. Following a meeting, the medical director of the strategic health authority kindly provided details for the three specific cancers, and although I cannot engage in the detail of the medical situation, there seemed to be a case that bigger might be better. However, no one has tried to prove, in anything that has been provided to us, that bigger is better for cancer networks, and many of us have been extensively involved in this subject for the past few months, and some of us for much longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/6">I am concerned that this is d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in respect of 2001-02. I feel embarrassed that back then, before I was an MP, colleagues were successful and that I do not seem to be getting a very good deal for my constituents. I worry about that, and I ask the Minister to give me a ray of hope, or at least an explanation. I do not want the cancer network 10-year birthday to be celebrated with effective abolition by merger.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/7">To call the consultation a sham would perhaps be unprofessional, and such language might be unparliamentary. I use those words in anger, because I was very upset by the way I was treated, not individually but as an MP&mdash;as a statutory consultee&mdash;and, more importantly, by the way all the patient groups were treated. There was overwhelming opposition, which I think is best summarised by the people at the front line who are running the network.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/8">The South Essex cancer network did not support the SHA's proposals to merge. It gave a number of reasons why: there</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/9" class="indent">&quot;is no demonstrable patient benefit&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/10">there is a great risk of losing the clinical cohesiveness and ownership that exists in south Essex; patient flows should determine network configurations, and there are virtually no patient flows from south to north or vice versa; current network arrangements meet national peer review measures already; the restructuring of cancer networks is not required to meet national cancer site-specific guidance, with south Essex plans already either approved or well advanced; the south Essex network currently has arrangements that are working perfectly well; and the merger will produce only marginal cost savings. Finally, the cancer network pinpoints a distinct lack of clarity about the future of the Mid Anglia cancer network based on current arrangements. Therefore, there is strong opposition from the people who actually run the network.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/11">Other key authorities also opposed the merger. The two primary care trusts within my constituency&mdash;Castle Point and Rochford PCT and Southend PCT&mdash;did so. The two local authorities in my area wrote to ask me to raise the matter. They did not just send in a consultation; they passed council motions saying that they did not want it, because it was bad for constituents. That view came from both Southend and Rochford. Patients' groups have also come to me both formally and informally and said that they oppose the merger.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/12">As I am an inexperienced MP, the petition that we put together was my first one. I sent it to a number of doctors' surgeries&mdash;about 20&mdash;as well as to a number of pharmacies in my area, because I thought that that would be a way of demonstrating the size of support to the Government. I am not sure what level of support I thought would be successful, but I was thinking in terms of a couple of hundred names, and that if there were more than 1,000 I would be celebrating. However, 5,000 people responded. There is a massive amount of local support and concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/13">I wrote to the Secretary of State. The Minister was kind enough to reply, saying that the merger was a local matter, that the Secretary of State would not intervene, and that I should raise any concerns with Essex SHA. In many ways I agree; it is a local matter, but I do not consider the SHA to be local. To me, local is Southend, Rochford and the wider cancer network. I find the strategic health authority somewhat out of touch in that regard, and in regard to other matters as well. I hesitate to go into more detail, but I do not think that it has a role as things progress. It certainly does not add value for my constituents. I want more people on the front line. However, I apologise, Mr. Atkinson, for going slightly off on a tangent, and I shall return to the subject of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/14">The Minister has a role. When the Government's cancer tsar last came to Southend and examined the problem it paid dividends. I do not demand, or even ask, that the Minister should come to Southend, although it would be very welcome. I am more concerned that she should review the matter. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friends are asking whether she will come; she would be more than welcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/15">What I said about the consultation being a sham involves a key point. When Ipswich left the Mid Anglia cancer network, the writing was on the wall. It was always going to be difficult to justify maintaining two smaller networks, if, indeed, it was Government policy and advice that 1 million-plus should be the population number. That has produced upwards leverage.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/16">Following the Minister's letter, I telephoned the strategic health authority to check that it had not been missed the letter in the post in early May, prior to the debate, and it kindly faxed its response to me this morning. In fairness, its representatives are disappointed that I consider the consultation to have been a sham, but not nearly as disappointed as I feel about the whole consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/17">I am not criticising a lack of activity in the consultation; there was lots of activity and lots of money was spent on it. However, I believe that the decision was taken well before the consultation. Several more seasoned&mdash;perhaps one could say more cynical&mdash;colleagues told me not to bother to get involved. They said, &quot;We see this time and again; consultations take place but the decision has already been taken.&quot; Furthermore, in the health sector locally there is some consultation overload. I was considering five or six NHS consultations in south Essex in January, so things are quite difficult. Also, in each case the questions being considered were mergers, and getting bigger. I cannot help thinking that there is an underlying philosophy that bigger is better, but I do not think that that is right. Both on the specific cancer issue and on other things, bigger may be considerably worse. We should reduce the size of some of our operating units.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/18">I said that I would try to include some questions to make it clear what I want to achieve in raising the debate. The best thing would be for the Minister to say, &quot;Ah, yes, there has been a terrible mistake and we shall sort it out.&quot; I do not imagine in my wildest imagination that that will happen, but a ray of hope for my constituents would be most appreciated. I should like to find out more about why change is needed. I think that I have demonstrated that the cost benefits will be marginal, that there are no demonstrable patient benefits and there will be much administrative disruption, and that there is much opposition.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/19">I should be interested to know more about the 1 million figure and why there is no flexibility, when the cancer tsar showed flexibility in 2001-02. Has there been a policy change since then, or has more information, of which I am not aware, become available? As to the tabular information, I do not ask the Minister to provide anything in that exact format. However, something a little more solid statistically, which correlates population numbers, cancer incidence and survival rates would be helpful to enable us to go forward. If the Minister is right that bigger is better, why should the figure be 2 million? Perhaps it should be 4 million? We need a strong evidence base to enable us to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/20">I hesitated before putting my questions, because the issue that they raise is, &quot;What if the merger does go ahead?&quot; I should like the Minister to confirm that what is happening is 100 per cent. about administration. The South Essex cancer network and the doctors in Southend would like a promise that there will be no patient movements south to north or north to south, other than in the three specialist cancer centres, without consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/21">I should also like more information about the consultation. I talked about the cancer centre suffering death by 1,000 cuts, and one concern is that smaller changes will happen below the radar, and without the involvement of local community leaders and community groups, once we are part of a bigger cancer network.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/22">Macmillan Cancer Relief raised the problem of the travel costs that would be involved should patient flows be significant. Bus routes are poor, and there are virtually no rail routes north and south&mdash;certainly not from my part of south Essex. The charity is concerned about the extra costs, and that is a valid concern, although time is also a great worry.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/23">I said that I would not talk in detail about upper GI, but I have had several letters from people in Basildon asking why there is no options appraisal for upper GI in Basildon. I simply throw that issue out to the Minister, and she might want to comment on it. That might be helpful for members of public in that part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/24">In summary, the merger of the South Essex and Mid Anglia cancer networks is opposed locally and represents a threat to the longer-term future of the Southend cancer centre. The case for the merger is weak at best and fundamentally flawed at worst.</p>

I gently ask her, therefore, to put out of her mind for a moment the thought that she will hear mainly from Conservative Members this afternoon. Instead, I ask her to consider carefully the advice that she is being given, because it was wrong four years ago, and nothing whatever has changed the argument today. I also hope that she will accept my hon. Friend's invitation to visit Southend, and I would be delighted to buy her a Rossi's ice cream, which I can thoroughly recommend, on our newly refurbished pier. She will, however, be very proud of the services that we enjoy.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/3">The Minister should know that there is great pride in cancer services in our part of Essex, and that is particularly clear from the support for local hospices. Last week, I was proud to accompany Vera and Ivan Heath, both of whom are 90. They have no children and little family, so they have decided to benefit others by giving their money to the local community now, rather than waiting until they die. I was honoured to be with Ivan at Little Haven hospice, which he presented with a cheque for &pound;250,000. I was also honoured to accompany him to St. Luke's hospice, which was opened by the late Princess Diana of Wales and the Duchess of Norfolk when I was the Member of Parliament for Basildon. Ivan gave St. Luke's &pound;50,000, which is a wonderful gesture.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/4">On Fridays, I sometimes go round my colleagues' constituencies. Last Friday, I was at Stock Brook Manor in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase>. I enjoyed a charity golf day, which was organised by the Donovan family, and a whole number of celebrities attended. The event raised in excess of &pound;60,000 for Little Haven hospice. I just want the Minister to appreciate, if she does not already, that there is an enormous amount of good will towards cancer services in Essex generally. In particular, we are very proud of the services at Southend hospital, which really is a true centre of excellence.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/5">In the debate in February 2002, to which a different Minister replied, I applauded the cancer plan, and I do so now. It is right that cancer, an illness that affects one in three people in the UK, should be given the priority status that it already enjoys in the national health service. However, as I said in that debate,</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/6" class="indent">&quot;As we have a first-class service and that is what the Government want, why change it?&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2002-02-06">6 February 2002</phrase>; Vol. 379, c. 1002.]</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/7">That is the issue, and it must not be clouded by anything else. We have a first-class service and it should not be changed, whatever briefing the Minister has been given.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/8">Professor Richards decided that, given the high number of cases treated by the centre and the high proportion of elderly residents in the area, the benchmark figure of 1 million inhabitants ought not to apply to the South Essex cancer network. I represent the constituency with the most people between the ages of 100 and 112 in the UK. For the reasons that I mentioned, Professor Richards decided to support the arguments advanced by my colleagues and me.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/9">The factors have not changed, so why, four years later, is the size of the network a reason for merging it with Mid Anglia? It seems absolutely implausible&mdash; how can the argument have changed in four years? So far, Essex strategic health authority has been totally unable to provide me and my colleagues with any evidence to show that small centres are less effective in treating certain sorts of cancer than larger ones.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/10">A press release issued by Essex strategic health authority on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-21">Tuesday, 21 February 2006</phrase>&mdash;still within the period of the public consultation&mdash;made the case for large specialist surgical centres. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/11">&quot;National guidance recommends that the surgical part of treatment of gynaecological, upper GI, urological and head and neck cancers should be provided in centres serving at least one million people. The national guidance is known as Improving Outcomes.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/12">The recommendation to replace what the release calls &quot;fragmented&quot; services with other clinical set-ups is made without statistical evidence to back up the assertion that bigger is better.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/13">The Essex strategic health authority consultation on the reconfiguration of cancer services was conducted from <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-12">12 December 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March 2006</phrase>, after which it was decided that the changes proposed in the document&mdash;that is, the merger of the cancer networks and the relocation of specialist cancer operations&mdash;should go ahead. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East asked, what was the point of the consultation? Members of Parliament and our constituents have been treated like complete idiots and I, for one, will put up with it no longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/14">If the strategic health authority had already made up its mind, what on earth was the point of going through the consultation? It was more of a gesture towards openness than real dialogue; it did not take into account the views of the south Essex hospitals, the South Essex cancer network, the 5,000 members of the public&mdash;who, as my hon. Friend mentioned, signed the petition&mdash;or the Members of Parliament and councillors who represent those people and all opposed the strategic health authority's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/15">The Minister values the work of the Health Committee, on which I am privileged to serve. She knows that it recently conducted an inquiry on the reorganisation of primary care trusts. Our report found that consultation was woefully inadequate, mainly because of the top-down nature of the process, which imposed change, even when it overrode the needs of local communities, to make financial savings.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/16">I say to my hon. Friends that that is what the issue is all about. It has nothing to do with best practice. The argument, accepted four years ago, is even stronger today.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/17">I end by saying that I had the pleasure of visiting, with a number of my hon. Friends, the Southend cancer centre at Southend hospital on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase>. We were absolutely in awe of the quality of the services; the centre is meeting not only its targets for breast and cervical screening, but the national cancer waiting times: 100 per cent. of its patients receive their first appointment within two weeks and their first treatment 31 days after the decision to treat. I know that the Minister, when she replies to the debate, will congratulate the hard-working staff on their achievements.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/18">Waiting times and clinical targets are, however, only half the story of cancer treatment. Macmillan Cancer Relief has been making the case for a more comprehensive cancer plan than the one that the Government launched in 2000. The plan would provide for vital supportive and palliative aspects of cancer care as well as diagnosis and treatment. The additional investment in specialist palliative care at Southend cancer centre is already making a difference in that area, along with an agreed framework for implementing the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidance on supportive and palliative care and for establishing a network user partnership group and a network patient information project.</p>
	<p pid="c.114.0/19">I could go on, but I hope that my hon. Friends will catch your eye, Mr. Atkinson. I ask the Minister again to consider very carefully the arguments that she is hearing this afternoon and to reflect again on the advice that she appears to be receiving at the moment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.117.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="117"  time="015:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0078.htm#06051065000278">
	<p pid="c.117.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on making a very measured, well thought out contribution and on leading the drive to save the cancer centre in south Essex. He has done a wonderful job and shown that he has a lot of energy. Whether or not he is successful is no measure of his abilities and potential in this place.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/2">I declare an interest: my son is a neurosurgeon who practises in London, and often in south Essex, treating cancers and such like, and he will do so in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/3">South Essex cancer service is an excellent clinical network. I am a Conservative because I believe in cherishing what is good. That is why I am speaking in the debate and supporting my hon. Friend. At the start of the process, the question should have been, will merging South Essex cancer network with Mid Anglia cancer network help or hinder the continued improvement that we have seen in the South Essex service? For me as an MP, the question was, what will it mean for the people of Castle Point, whom I have a duty to represent, and for my area of south Essex? This is not mindless nimbyism. I have a duty to look after the interests of my constituents, and if I do not no one else will. That is why they send me to this place. I therefore hope that the Minister will forgive me if I speak from the viewpoint of south Essex, rather than the overall viewpoint. It is her duty to look after that, and I know she does so carefully.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/4">What is wrong with our cancer service that requires it to be merged with Mid Anglia and what benefits will we get in return for the merger? What benefits will we get to match the costs and risks of that change? Let me set out some facts about what we are achieving in south Essex. Merging with the relatively not-so-high-achieving Mid Anglia will, some claim, weaken the South Essex cancer network and the service that it is able to provide for our constituents. Merging will certainly disrupt its excellent progress, although I accept that Mid Anglia has many good points and I am sure that excellent staff work in that service, too. I would not in any way bad-mouth them. It must be said, however, that South Essex is reputed to be one of the best services in the country, notwithstanding its smaller size. In fact, its success might be a result of its size; we certainly have no evidence to convince us otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/5">There are excellent staff at all levels at South Essex, and I pay tribute to them. They are hard working, dedicated, professional and very caring people, as I am sure the staff are at Mid Anglia cancer network.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/6">South Essex is meeting national targets for screening, particularly for breast cancer and cervical cancer,as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase>, whose speech I am delighted to follow, pointed out. However, we need dramatically to improve our screening in those areas and to continue to make advances. We are cutting waiting times from diagnosis to treatment, which is one of the most important factors in achieving successful outcomes. We need to make dramatic improvements, and we are doing that in south Essex, but those improvements might be jeopardised by the change and disruption of the merger.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/7">Our patient outcomes are improving and are now much better than those in many cancer centres in the UK; they are said to be better than those in the mid-Anglia area. We have extremely good financial controls, management and peer reviews, and, added to all that, the convenience of access to a local service. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East pointed out, at length, the natural flow of movement in the health economy, which is east to west&mdash;certainly not north to south. There are good reasons for that, not least the infrastructure and the difficulty that people have travelling north to south.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/8">Those who were consulted in my area said that the merger plan was against the best interests of patients in south Essex and the excellent staff who work in that area. It certainly lacks clarity of purpose and any detail about defined, discernible, demonstrable benefits, or even a set of properly laid-out costs. It also lacks any schedule as to how those changes are to be achieved, and detail on what the timing and costs will be. I shall return to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/9">If we put all those considerations together, we see why the objection to the merger was both hostile and comprehensive, certainly in south Essex, if not the north of the county. The objectors included most of the relevant bodies of opinion, including the south Essex MPs&mdash;we have ample evidence of their interest this afternoon. Many excellent councillors and good councils supported our stand on this, as did the hospitals, patient groups, South Essex cancer network and, probably most importantly, the public. Their support is demonstrated in the petitions. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East, that was not my first petition. The media certainly support our side of the argument on behalf of the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/10">The anecdotal evidence confirms that the public are very much on our side. I spoke to around 1,000 people&mdash;some of whom I questioned and some of whom questioned me on this matter&mdash;in the run-up to the recent local elections, and they opposed the merger almost to a person. We have massive evidence that the groups that should have been and were consulted strongly oppose the merger. I hope that if we are to push forward with the change&mdash;if it is going to happen anyway&mdash;we are all proved wrong, but I do not have any evidence to support that.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/11">I see that the Minister is listening carefully. In a nutshell, it seems that the merger will bring disadvantages, disruption and little demonstrable benefit. It brings unquantified risk without proper weighing of the costs and could set back the steady improvements that we have been achieving in the South Essex cancer network. I accept that it could accelerate improvements in the north, but that is not what I am here to talk about. I am here to represent my constituents, and the Minister is perfectly aware of that.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/12">If the merger is not handled well, it could impede the plans of South Essex and progress on treatments and outcomes, cutting cancer waiting times, delivery on top targets, improving patient information and care, and improving services to the community. It might also affect links with primary care networks, our excellent local GPs and the wonderful Macmillan nurse network in south Essex, to which we all pay tribute.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/13">The Government and the SHA have failed to make any coherent or decisive case for the merger, certainly to the public. That is largely due to the consultation period of three months&mdash;I believe that it ended on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-13">13 March</phrase>&mdash;which was said by some to be a sham. I am a moderate man in my language, so one would not expect me to make that claim. The public were angry about the consultation. They felt that they had been steamrollered by the strategic health authority towards a decision that had already been taken, and that there was an element of deceit and pretence in the consultation. In some ways, I feel sorry for the SHA, because it tried to proceed professionally and comprehensively. I do not bad-mouth the SHA, but I heavily deprecate the Government. The SHA was unfortunate, because its consultation was judged against the backdrop of the recent consultation on the police mergers, which was a sham. I say that even though I am careful with my language.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/14">There was evidence that views were not properly considered but simply cast aside. It is easy for us in the south, who were against the merger, to say that and to ignore those in the north, whose views are obviously valid as well. The Minister has to make a balanced decision on that, and will do. In any event, the consultation document was claimed to be a shambles. A powerful letter from the patient and public involvement in health forum for Basildon and Thurrock hospitals, addressed to the Secretary of State and dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-03">3 April</phrase>, states:</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/15" class="indent">&quot;We made it very clear to the SHA that we had concerns that the documentation was not fair, honest, and was biased towards Bloomfield Hospital Chelmsford&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/16">The words</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/17" class="indent">&quot;not fair, honest, and biased&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/18">were underlined.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/19">The results of the consultation&mdash;although not clear, at least as far as the south was concerned&mdash;were taken by the SHA, which steamed ahead in the opposite direction. It made few arguments, to me anyway, for the benefits of change to the south and gave me little in the way of estimates of costs. Those are not just the financial costs, but the human costs, the operational costs and the costs in terms of patient outcomes. The problem for the SHA is that the Government have stopped listening to the people and the people perceive that. The SHA is judged against that backdrop and in the shadow the mistrust that the public hold for public bodies. However, that is not the fault of the SHA; I lay the blame for that at the Government's door.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/20">The merger proposal looks very much like part of the Government's now not-so-secret regionalisation agenda, which is hitting local democracy and removing local accountability. Their agenda covers things as diverse as police, planning, health, economic development and so much else. It is a Big Brother agenda, the people have tumbled it and action will be taken at the polls to reverse it.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/21">Experience shows that such mergers typically cost much more than was anticipated at the outset. They typically fail to deliver the anticipated benefits or results&mdash;not that I see net benefits for my constituents from the merger in any event. Such mergers disrupt and set back progress towards important delivery improvement targets. The plan must be carefully controlled if it goes ahead and we should ensure that we achieve the targets that we set out to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/22">The Government seem to be obsessed with reorganisation for its own sake. Yet again, we see them shuffling the deckchairs on the NHS deck. They should focus on tackling improvements, such as removing postcode prescribing and making better treatments and drugs available&mdash;for example, temozolomide and Gliadel implants for brain cancers and Herceptin for certain stages of breast cancer&mdash;as well as spreading the good practice that we see in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/23">I ask the Minister to rethink the proposal, even at this late stage. It is never too late to accept that the case for merger has not been made, as it certainly has not in this example.</p>

	<p pid="c.120.0/1">I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on securing this debate and on introducing it so ably and comprehensively. I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">my hon. Friends the Members for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> and for Southend, West (Mr. Amess) on their contributions. I understand that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">my hon. Friend the Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> may yet be hoping to catch your eye, Mr. Atkinson, so that he can have a few minutes before the winding-up speeches.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/2">It is a pleasure to see on the Conservative Front Bench <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase>, who will reply for our party. This is very much an Essex production, from our perspective.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/3">Some of us have been around this loop before. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East said in his introductory remarks, there was a campaign several years ago when the Government unfortunately came up with proposals to transfer some cancer operations away from Southend to as far afield as Ipswich. They caused tremendous disquiet in south-east Essex and local Members of Parliament chipped in and lobbied the cancer tsar and Ministers. As we heard, the cancer tsar came to Southend and considered the issue in detail. Importantly, as an expert, as the Government's adviser on cancer, he decided to leave well alone. He was not a politician but an expert on cancer. As a result of his review, there was transfer of some local operations&mdash;just a few&mdash;between Southend and Basildon hospitals, but in essence the operations remained in south Essex and the South Essex cancer network remained intact.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/4">The Government's adviser on cancer came to Southend, looked at things on the ground, as they say in modern parlance, and having done that, decided that it was best to leave well alone. I suggest to the Minister in all seriousness&mdash;this is not a partisan point&mdash;that that is a very powerful consideration in this context.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/5">There is no debate about the quality of care for cancer patients at Southend. There are various problems in the national health service. The Minister has had many letters from me about problems with dentistry and, most recently, clinical dental technicians&mdash;I take the opportunity briefly to remind her of them&mdash;but no one is saying that there is a problem with clinical outcomes at Southend. It is not as if the service there is deficient.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/6">Several of us had a meeting with the medical director of the Essex strategic health authority some weeks ago, and we pressed him repeatedly on this point. We asked him to provide clinical evidence that there was something wrong with the outcomes at Southend. As my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East said, we have still had no conclusive evidence from the Essex SHA or from anyone else that there are poor outcomes at Southend that would necessitate a merger. We do not believe that there is a compelling clinical rationale to undertake the move. If there is, we genuinely are not aware of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/7">Moreover, it is important to note that the cancer tsar accepted the case for derogation below the 1 million figure. As I said in an intervention, that derogation was there from the start of the network. The matter was considered when the network was set up, and it was considered again by the cancer tsar a few years ago. Both times, the answer was that it was all right at 750,000 for all the reasons that have already been given. Now, suddenly, that is being overturned, and I do not believe that that is wise.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/8">I too am a moderate man, but I shall say it: the consultation was a complete sham. In fact, because of the shape of my constituency, I have responded to seven NHS consultations in the past few months. Briefly, they were on proposals to merge the Essex SHA in a regional SHA, to abolish the Essex ambulance trust and make it a regional ambulance trust, to reduce the number of primary care trusts in Essex, to turn the two mental health trusts in Essex into foundation trusts&mdash;that I actually support&mdash;to relocate the non-cancer head and neck services to Broomfield, and lastly, this one to abolish the South Essex cancer network. For each of those seven consultations, the recommended option was adopted&mdash;every time. It is difficult indeed not to become cynical about such exercises when it seems, particularly in the NHS, that proposals are put out to consultation but the decisions have long been taken. The Government go through a consultation exercise only because it is a statutory requirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/9">That is even more galling because the policy of the Department of Health is to encourage local decision making, to push such decisions down to local level. I am sure that we will hear that in the Minister's summing-up speech. If the Government are going to do that, they should be consistent. If they are putting decision making at the local level so that when things get difficult Ministers can say, &quot;It wasn't my fault, guv&quot;, the flip side is that they should listen to what local people say.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/10">If there is local consultation and 5,000 people sign the petition and the local councils and many of the local medical professionals say, &quot;We don't want this,&quot; that should be acknowledged. It is pointless to go through sham consultations if local people are ignored. I am afraid that that is exactly what has happened in this instance. If I sound angry about it, it is because I am.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/11">We are worried about the thin end of the wedge argument, and we are worried that whatever may be said today, the issue will be revisited and reconsidered in a few years' time, a few more operations will be moved away, it will be reconsidered again, and eventually the centre at Southend will be under threat. We are not making it up, because the centre was under threat some years ago. We are genuinely concerned about that, and it is partly why we are taking part in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/12">I reiterate to the Minister that the network was given a specific derogation below the 1 million quota when it was set up. That derogation was reaffirmed by the Government's own cancer tsar&mdash;not someone from Conservative central office, Labour party headquarters or the Liberal Democrats. The Government's own cancer tsar considered it and reaffirmed the 1 million derogation, which it is now proposed to overturn. There is no compelling clinical evidence to back up that decision; it is done simply for administrative convenience to fit in with the figure of 1 million and make it neat. Local people were consulted, they said that they did not want it, and they were systematically ignored.</p>
	<p pid="c.120.0/13">I believe that the Minister is a reasonable person. I have dealt with her before on other issues, and I mean this genuinely: she is a reasonable Minister and she is fair-minded. Not all her colleagues are, but she is. I make a genuine plea to her to reconsider the matter. If she wanted me to sum up the whole case, I would do it like this: Minister, it really ain't broke down in Southend. Please, please don't fix it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.122.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" speakername="Brooks Newmark" colnum="122"  time="015:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0078.htm#06051065000312">
	<p pid="c.122.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on securing the debate. It covers cancer services in Essex, as well as the proposed change. During the Opposition day debate on cancer services, the Health Secretary said that the decision on the future of cancer networks in Essex would be made locally. The emphasis on &quot;locally&quot; is what interests me. Do not my hon. Friends agree that the reason for the proposed change is the imposition of national requirements? One of the biggest challenges faced by my primary care trust in Braintree is the interference of central Government, often in the provision of services that really matter to my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/2">Witham, Braintree and Halstead primary care trust has received a five-star rating for vital cancer services such as cervical screening. However, it received that rating for the local services that it provides, not because of national impositions. It is not only acute and specialised services that are important in effective treatment of cancer; the early detection and easy access to primary services are essential, too. That is why I emphasise that localism and local services are important.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/3">Although the consultation said that the amalgamation would affect only a small number of complex surgical cases, what guarantees do we have that routine services will not be compromised by the proposed changes? Now that the Minister is in front of me, I should like to make a quick aside. People in my constituency are battling to secure the future of a new community hospital in Braintree, yet the Government still make strategic changes a priority over the improvement of basic local services. My constituents want a community hospital, they have been promised one by the Government, and they are still waiting for the Government to support that.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/4">My genuine concern is about meeting local needs. In a press release, I read with interest that the strategic health authority on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">29 March</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The board of Essex strategic health authority today agreed a recommendation to create a new cancer network&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/6">about which we heard earlier&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/7" class="indent">&quot;covering south-east, south-west, mid and north-east Essex. It was one of four key decisions about cancer services made by board members&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/8">The press release continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Speaking after the meeting, Dr. Paul Watson&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/10" class="indent">the strategic health authority medical director&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/11" class="indent">said: 'The main aim in making these decisions is to ensure that Essex cancer patients have access to high quality services that meet national requirements'&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/12">not local requirements. Local people want local services to meet local requirements. They do not want a national diktat.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/13">I share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase>, who has said that cancer survival rates in this country are worse than those in Albania. That is a shocking statistic. While we must acknowledge that more people are being diagnosed with cancer, waiting times for surgery and radiotherapy have been getting longer. That is of tremendous concern to me. How will the merger improve survival rates, diagnosis and early detection? Any restructuring should ideally be about such things.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/14">I have always been supportive of the Schumpeter principle that small is beautiful. On the proposed merger of the cancer networks that co-ordinate treatment in south Essex and mid-Anglia, my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East has said:</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/15" class="indent">&quot;It is important that south Essex keeps its cancer network as it is.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/16">I agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/17">Our shadow Health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, said that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East has made a cogent case on behalf of south Essex MPs about the cancer network and the appropriate size of the South Essex cancer care centre, considering local conditions. He added that he hoped that people at both national and local decision-making levels have taken due account of that strong and well made case. In that context, I find it difficult to understand why the Government are pursuing a merger that is unpopular, unnecessary and likely to be ineffective in meeting local patients' needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on securing the debate and on having introduced it in a reasoned and sensible fashion.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/2">I labour under the disadvantage of not being familiar with Essex's facilities, geography or history. Therefore, I shall confine myself to making some general remarks about cancer provision and the difficulties of locating it. In my youth, cancer was considered to be a certain death sentence and was discussed in hushed tones of horror. Now it is seen as treatable, curable and liveable with. There is no secret to that: there have been advances in knowledge, both scientific and among the public, and there has been early screening and detection, more sophisticated treatment and skilled intervention. For that reason, people will travel far to exercise their right to the best clinical outcome. The &quot;best&quot; often means the most specialised, because such units, by and large, have the best outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/3">I shall draw a parallel with my constituency, although it does not resemble Essex in any way. There is sincere and justified outrage in it about accident and emergency facilities not being available for children, but my constituents travel, not with joy but with a degree of equanimity, to places such as Clatterbridge hospital. They go through Liverpool, cross the Mersey and through the Wirral because they know that Clatterbridge hospital has specialised, effective and very skilled treatment.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/4">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence argues that centres of excellence should have catchment areas that contain about 1 million people, though I note in passing the remarks made about the derogation; I assume that the Minister is in a position to respond to that. When people come up against that fact they immediately come up against two problems in any area. Where will the centres of excellence be? What can be done to minimise travel for all concerned?</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/5">On the &quot;where&quot;, everybody would ideally want the specialised unit&mdash;in fact, every such unit&mdash;to be in their town. We know that that is not possible, so a decision must be made. There have been many complaints from the Members who represent Essex constituencies about how the decision was made and the calibre of that decision making. Such a decision should be made openly, in an unbiased fashion and on agreed criteria. Although I accept what hon. Members said about the strategic health authority's decision-making process, I note from its website that it publishes seemingly objective criteria, and one can consider the outcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/6">I share the feeling about consultation in the NHS. It is normally dire, formal and pretty unproductive, and it normally results in what the authorities had already thought of. Perhaps someone can clarify the matter, but I see that one or two earlier options were dropped during the consultation process. The website states that option this or option that were considered during the informal process but were abandoned. It may have led to the inevitable result, but it was not simply a rubber-stamping process&mdash;unless, of course, that was the initial intention.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/7">We know that the results of such a process will not be universally liked. However, there should be a degree of professional and public support. I am concerned that, as Essex Members have pointed out, the merger does not seem to have professional support, any more than it has the support of the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/8">In areas other than Essex, such decisions are not so contentious, largely because they have centres of clinical excellence with form and an established reputation, and there are often clear candidates for specialisms. Even then, conflicts can sometimes be caused by regional loyalties. For instance, large centres of population or even centres of excellence might be on the periphery of a region, which can create additional travelling difficulties. In fact, change always creates difficulties. People do not normally welcome change in their local health facilities, and the matter is complicated if a degree of political rivalry is added.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/9">The second problem that dogs the idea of centres of excellence is that of travel. It is recognised that although some treatments need to be undertaken in centres of excellence, many do not. Out-patient appointments, diagnostic processes, check-ups and even chemotherapy can take place elsewhere in the clinical network, and somewhere nearer home. That is justified; it is a serious attempt to minimise patient travel and the cost to patients and relatives. Patients like their relatives to be with them, because cancer is intrinsically an extremely stressful process, and they need the support of the family and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/10">Networks need to be designed properly, and consultation is part of the process. It should be genuine to get the fit absolutely right. Things can be blown apart if factors other than clinical matters are taken into consideration, such as administration or finance. I wonder how the Government's drive for all NHS facilities to have a degree of financial independence and autonomy will fit with the drive for effective and decent clinical networks for cancer or for anything else.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.0/11">The Government's strategy is not wrong in principle, and the Minister will, I am sure, say that we should be alert to the commendable results in cancer treatment. I am not certain that they have the template right for Essex. I can pass no judgment on that. I have listened to what other hon. Members have said, but I am not in a position to judge. However, it is possible to get it right with adequate consultation and the adequate sharing of appropriate evidence. My fear is that administrative, financial and other considerations may prevent a good template from emerging for Essex.</p>

	<p pid="c.126.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on introducing the debate, on the comprehensive, thorough and incisive way in which he introduced it, and on his campaign to prevent the merger of the South Essex and Mid Anglia cancer networks. I also commend him for his excellent and heartfelt contribution. I hope that the Minister takes the time&mdash;I shall ensure that she has the time&mdash;to answer the points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/2">We know that cancer networks have played an important role in developing cancer services since their inception 10 years ago, following the Calman Hine report commissioned by the last Conservative Administration. The proposed merger is important, as it would create a new organisation covering a population of approximately 1.4 million. I am sure that the Minister is aware of that. Although such a change relates primarily to the management and administrative arrangements for planning cancer services, I hope that from the heartfelt contributions to this debate that she appreciates the real concern that the needs of south Essex will be overlooked by a larger and more remote network. She should not take that concern lightly.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/3">In Essex as a whole we have had a spate of reorganisations of services, including those relating to PCTs, SHAs, the ambulance service and cancer networks. The common theme seems to have been a desire to create ever-larger, more regional organisations. The concern for many people, as expressed in the debate, is that those structures will become more remote and less responsive to the needs of local residents. I do not believe that that concern is fully appreciated by those making such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/4">In my constituency, for example, people were particularly vexed about the proposal to scrap Essex police and our local PCTs, and we campaigned accordingly. Given the importance of Southend hospital to the structure of the South Essex cancer network, my hon. Friends are rightly continuing to raise their concerns about the cancer reorganisation. They have made the case against the merger in detail, but I want to highlight one or two points in the hope that they will be addressed by the Minister when she winds up.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/5">Will the Minister explain why a merger of cancer networks is so vital in the east of England at this time? As she heard from almost every contribution, South Essex cancer network has a good reputation&mdash;an excellent reputation, in fact&mdash;for planning and commissioning cancer services. Naturally, there is confusion about why arrangements are now being thrown up in the air. If the argument is about population size and the need for networks to correspond to areas of between about 1 million and2 million people, what does the Minister make of the point&mdash;made on several occasions&mdash;that was conceded by the cancer tsar Mike Richards four years ago when he said that due to its age profile and areas of relative deprivation, the cancer case load in south Essex at least makes up for the shortfall in population?</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/6">During the past four years, the population in south Essex has probably grown faster than most other areas, which raises the question of why we have to tinker with the current arrangement at all when it works so well. If the Minister has formed a different opinion, perhaps she could explain to us on what evidence she has done so because it is not clear to my hon. Friends why that should be the case. They have made a powerful argument to keep things as they are.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/7">What is more, the small population of the Mid Anglia cancer network seems to have been brought about by the withdrawal of Ipswich, a decision taken by Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire SHA. It seems somewhat unfair, to put it mildly, that south Essex should effectively lose its cancer network on account of a decision taken by a different health authority, a point made by several of my hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/8">Another concern is that current patient flows do not argue in favour of an enlarged network. Consultants in south Essex are not in the habit of referring patients to centres further afield, and I have seen no evidence of any sudden, recent, increased desire to do so. It simply does not exist. In those cases where patients will have to travel further for treatment as a result of the merger, what financial assistance is the Government going to provide for their travel costs, given that cancer treatment often involves a number of visits to hospitals or other centres? The point has been raised before, but the Minister would do well to dwell on it because, in some cases, we are talking about quite increased distances of travel. That should receive urgent consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/9">There is naturally a degree of confusion about the motivation for the change. It appears that the SHA is putting a desire for administrative neatness, and reorganisation for reorganisation's sake, over and above the concerns of local people. I would reiterate one point to the Minister. The consultation on the merger appears to have been inadequate, lasting only a few months and ignoring strong opposition from my hon. Friends, councillors, hospitals and many residents, including the 5,000 who signed the petition. To many, it appears to have been a sham, designed to give a veneer of credibility to a decision that had already been made, without reference to people's concerns. That comes on top of many other consultations, such as those on primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and police reorganisations, which have led to a growing view that people's concerns are not addressed.</p>

	<p pid="c.127.1/1">As my hon. Friend says, the feeling is that residents' concerns are ignored.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.1/2">As I mentioned, in my part of the county people were particularly vexed at the thought of losing their local PCTs. However, despite the concerns expressed by those PCTs, the local MPs&mdash;both Labour and Tory&mdash;and many residents, our views were ignored and the original proposal, chosen prior to the consultation, was taken up. Such fig-leaf consultations have sorely tested the patience of people in south Essex. The consultation that we are concerned with in this debate seems to be yet another example of that.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.1/3">The SHA does not even have the support of the South Essex cancer network for the proposal. The network has argued that a merger runs the risk of compromising the clinical cohesiveness and ownership in the region. Much progress has been made recently on implementing the national cancer plan and improving services in the community. The network is understandably wary of accommodating the challenges and difficulties of the Mid Anglia cancer network because the people who will suffer if it goes wrong will be the patients.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.1/4">I would welcome the Minister's explanation of why the merger is going ahead. She will notice that I have given her additional time to respond, in the hope that she will be generous, both in dealing with the concerns raised by my hon. Friends, and in taking their interventions.</p>

	<p pid="c.128.0/1">I add my congratulations to those that have been offered to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">the hon. Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on securing the debate. As hon. Members said, he put his case eloquently on behalf of his constituents. There were some extremely relevant contributions, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the remarks of the hon. Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase> about the excellent work of the hospice movement.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1488" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> talked about the success of staff in his area in meeting targets. I, too, want to thank and congratulate the dedicated and committed staff in the area, who have achieved massive changes to mortality rates, among other things, thanks to extra investment, which has led to increased staffing. Of course, increased investment is nothing without strong input from the staff and a willingness to embrace some of the changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.0/3">I want to respond to several issues that were raised by, for example, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1772" name="Mark Francois">the hon. Member for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois)</phrase>, particularly with respect to the comments made by Mike Richards, and the evidence on some of the changes that have been made. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" name="Brooks Newmark">The hon. Member for Braintree (Mr. Newmark)</phrase> asked how the changes would fit with other services. I hope to touch on that too. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh)</phrase> acknowledged that specialist treatment is an important consideration in the wider debate, and talked about how to deal with the fact that not every service can be available in every hospital. Those are some of the issues that we must grasp. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">The hon. Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase> spoke from the Front Bench about travel costs&mdash;I shall refer to that&mdash;and about the point that was made by Mike Richards.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.0/4">As I said, we approach the subject against a background of improvements in the treatment of cancer. That is clear when we consider the situation in Essex, where there is an increased number of cancer consultants, diagnostic radiography staff and therapeutic radiography staff. That has made real changes to the way in which cancer care is delivered. However, it is also important to recognise that many of the improvements took place because of the establishment of cancer networks, which started a number of years ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.0/5">We have to be absolutely clear what we are talking about when we consider cancer networks. They are about professionals, patient representatives and other organisations, perhaps from the voluntary sector&mdash; hon. Members referred to the work of Macmillan nurses in their areas&mdash;getting together and considering how services can best be delivered over a whole area. It is important that we take note of how that local delivery is considered to be best shaped. In my area, there are often intense arguments about whether a service should be moved from one trust to another, and local people often deeply resent services being changed, but we also have to recognise&mdash;this is a crucial part of the debate, and a number of hon. Members raised the point&mdash;the evidence on whether the population coverage for specialist treatments and centres makes a difference.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.0/6">I challenge many of the assertions made by Opposition Members about there being no evidence. There is evidence from the improved outcomes guidance and other national guidance which shows that when it comes to treating some specialist cancers, it is important to have a larger population. We are talking not about just providing a convenient service, but about saving lives. The evidence is very clear: it is obvious that if people, particularly consultants, do not see a certain number of patients every year with those specialist cancers, they cannot be expected to have as great an expertise in them. There is very clear evidence, and we should accept that.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.0/7">Hon. Members talked about south Essex and their constituents, but it is important that we think wider than that, because Members of Parliament have a responsibility for all members of the public, who are all possible patients, and who may be affected by decisions that we make.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.129.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" speakername="James Duddridge" colnum="129"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0079.htm#06051065000355">
	<p pid="c.129.0/1">I agree that there is a case for saying that bigger is better for some very specialist cancers. There is some evidence for that, in terms of evaluating specifically upper GI, gynaecological, urological and head and neck cancers. I know that there is a debate about those. However, we are saying that absolutely no evidence has been put before us to show a statistical correlation between larger cancer networks and better clinical outcomes. We are talking about network sizes, not specific cancers. Those specific cancers relate to only 20 or 30 people; we are talking about 3,500 people who are affected in south Essex.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.129.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1544" speakername="Rosie Winterton" colnum="129"  time="015:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0079.htm#06051065000356">
	<p pid="c.129.1/1">But we are talking about the ability of a network to plan for a specific population base, and that is where the statistics and the evidence come into it. I absolutely understand what the hon. Gentleman says about Southend cancer centre, and this is no slur at all on its ability&mdash;I will come to that&mdash;but we are talking about the ability of a wider cancer network to make plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.1/2">I will not go into great detail on the reason for the consultation, because that has already been stated&mdash;it is the withdrawal of east Suffolk from the Mid Anglia cancer network. However, I want to address some of the points that were made. It is worth noting that all other clinical networks in Essex&mdash;cardiac, neonatal, critical care, pathology and neurosciences&mdash;are configured on an Essex-wide basis. That is important in terms not only of achieving outcomes, but of providing a stable foundation for those who enter the medical profession. For example, it is important that networks can provide a proper population base and a high level of expertise to ensure that consultants who want to specialise in a chosen field develop professionally.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.1/3">I also want to give some reassurance. Essex SHA is not planning to close the cancer centre in Southend. Indeed, the position is quite the opposite, and the SHA is committed to supporting a thriving cancer centre in Southend. That includes the provision of out-patient care, diagnostic tests, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, palliative care and some specialist surgery. The only services to be moved from Southend to Chelmsford will be those for people with head and neck cancers. That move has the overwhelming support of senior clinical staff and will affect approximately 20 to 30 people a year in Southend. It will mean that patients who must have surgery for those less common cancers will have access under one roof to consultants and surgeons who are experts in oral and maxillofacial surgery, ear, nose and throat, and plastic surgery. Ultimately, it makes sense for those services to be together, because those cancers might require other treatments, such as plastic surgery. There is also the question of whether people will have to travel and whether their expenses would be covered. That is addressed by the hospital costs travel scheme, and people below a certain income level would qualify for that. Those are the only changes that will be made.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.1/4">It is important to stress that there are no plans to downgrade services at Southend hospital. Indeed, as many hon. Members said, services have increased, and the hospital is now a cancer centre for south Essex, providing neurological and gynaecological cancer surgery services. Yesterday, I met Dr. Paul Watson, the medical director of Essex SHA, who assured me that there are no plans to reduce any other services currently offered at Southend hospital, and I understand that he has said that publicly.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.1/5">Finally, the issue of Mike Richards's last visit to the area was raised. There was no derogation that he would have given in those circumstances, although he obviously gave some advice. I shall not ask him to overturn a decision that has been made on very reasonable grounds, and I stress again that we are talking about saving lives in many instances. However, I shall ask him to look at the operational framework, which is due to be introduced in October, so that we can reassure hon. Members that the changes have fitted in exactly with what I have said.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.1/6">I hope that that gives hon. Members some comfort. As I said, I am not asking Mike Richards to overturn the decision, but I would like him to look at the operational plans to ensure that the decision will improve services in the local area, and I would like them to be reassured of that.</p>

	Identity Card Scheme
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.131.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="131"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0079.htm#06051065000362">
	<p pid="c.131.1/1">I am glad to have secured this debate on an important matter, especially as the Identity Cards Bill received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/2">ID cards are a controversial topic. The Government were defeated five times in the other place before the legislation finally passed after the Government's concession to delay the scheme until 2009. Public support for ID cards is falling sharply, from about80 per cent. in 2003 to just under 50 per cent. today.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/3">The public are concerned about the introduction of identity cards for many reasons. There are real fears about the erosion of civil liberties and much confusion about what problem ID cards are suppose to solve. The suggestion that they will somehow prevent terrorism stands up to no scrutiny when the 9/11 and Madrid bombers held valid ID and the Home Office admitted that ID cards would have done nothing to prevent the<phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> bombings last year in London.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/4">Today I would like to focus on another cause of concern, which is the cost of the ID card scheme. The debate is set against the backdrop of a six-month countdown that started when the Bill received Royal Assent, and as each day passes until <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> we come closer to the date on which the Government will have to reveal to Parliament the estimated likely cost of the identity card scheme over the next 10 years. How that will work in practice with <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> falling on a Saturday during recess, I am yet to discover, but I am sure that many of my party colleagues are looking forward to receiving the report. It will hopefully contain more information about the cost of the scheme and with any luck we might get some information from the Minister today.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/5">Back in 2002 initial Government proposals suggested that an entitlement card scheme would cost &pound;1.3 billion over a period of 13 years, which would include the three years that it would take to set up the necessary systems and the 10 years in which the first cards would be valid. In November 2003, the then Home Secretary made a statement in the House in which he stated that the cost of an ID card would be &pound;35. That changed again and by April 2005 the Government estimated that the cost of an ID card would be &pound;15 with a fee of &pound;85 for a joint passport and ID card application. However, that figure changed once again after the Identity Cards Bill was introduced after the general election a year ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/6">The previous Minister, now Minister of State in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the Department of Health, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, stated in the Identity Cards Bill debate on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase> that the cost of a stand-alone ID card would be &pound;30 and the cost of a biometric passport &pound;63, so the combined cost would be &pound;93. It could be argued that the number is only valid for the first year of the scheme, which will not be up and running until 2009.</p>

	<p pid="c.132.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the problem is compounded in rural areas? In Wales, four facilities to renew passports have been announced. From October, the renewal of those passports will involve the collection of personal data. There are four new passport offices in an incredibly rural area and the cost to individual householders will be far greater than the cost of the application.</p>

	<p pid="c.132.2/1">Absolutely. My hon. Friend is right to mention the additional travel costs that individuals will face when they go to have their details processed. For many people, those costs might end up well in excess of &pound;93. In addition, how can we be certain that the cost will remain at &pound;93, given that it has already escalated on several occasions?</p>
	<p pid="c.132.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">My hon. Friend the Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase> questioned the Home Office on how much money had been spent on the Government's ID card scheme from April 2003 to December 2005. He was informed that &pound;32 million had already been spent by the Government on the scheme before the legislation was passed by Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.2/3">The former Home Secretary made the House aware that a small contribution from public funds would be required towards the running costs of the scheme. However, we have never had much clarity on the interpretation of &quot;a small contribution&quot;. That is a rather ambiguous phrase, and it leaves a great deal to changes in circumstances and the patterns of take-up of the card. Now that ID cards are on the way, I ask the Minister whether the Home Office has any firm figures so that we can be aware of how much this small contribution from public funds might be.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.2/4">The Government have consistently refused to publish their estimate of the set-up costs of the database design of the national identity register. They argue that that might jeopardise the procurement of the contracts for the database. The London School of Economics has tried its best to make up for the Government's lack of clarity with several extensively researched reports published in the past 12 months, most recently a report on the Home Office accounting of the ID cards scheme in March. The previous Home Office Minister, the hon. Member for Leigh, in his best defence of the Government, suggested that the LSE figures for the ID card scheme were designed to confuse and frighten people. A lack of any financial preparation for the national identity register is far more confusing and frightening for the taxpayer when no estimates are being put forward by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="c.132.3/1">Does my hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.133.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="133"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0079.htm#06051065000377">
	<p pid="c.133.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. I will return later in my speech to the issue of the Government's handling of IT systems and their ability to deliver. I accept that there are many projects that taxpayers' money could be better spent on&mdash;regardless of whether the amount is &pound;3 billion or &pound;5 billion, or &pound;10 billion or &pound;19 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/2">For clarity, let me remind Members of the supposed aims of the ID card scheme according to the Home Office regulatory impact assessment which it published in November 2004: to reduce illegal migration and illegal working; to enhance the UK's capability to counter terrorism and serious and organised crime; to reduce identity fraud; and to implement a more efficient and effective delivery of public services. On all these points the Government are weak in both clarity and their hoped-for delivery. After last July, the terrorist attacks blew out of the water the suggestion that the counter-terrorism side of the card's purpose would be effective. The country is all too aware that a piece of plastic will not act as a deterrent or as a tool against terrorism. There is strong evidence that terrorists do not hide their identity. The release of the foreign national prisoners which unseated the former Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, also suggests that an ID card scheme would not have helped. The problem was not the identity of most of the foreign prisoners; the immigration and nationality directorate and the Prison Service knew the identity of most of them. The problems arose because the two parts of the Home Office were not communicating with each other. That poses a lot of questions, and does not bode well for the national identity register.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/3">The Home Office's current estimate of the cost of introducing and implementing the biometric passport and ID card scheme is &pound;584 million each year for the next 10 years; the total cost of that is &pound;5.8 billion. However, that figure does not provide a true picture of the total cost of the ID card scheme. There are a variety of hidden costs in respect of ID cards.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/4">The Government have consistently refused to say how much the plans will cost other Departments, despite several parliamentary questions on this matter. I hope the Minister will enlighten us; if he is unable to do so, perhaps he will undertake to consult his ministerial colleagues in other Departments so that they can present to the House a realistic estimate of the overall cost to the Government of implementing the scheme, rather than simply the cost to the Home Office. If we do not have the full, total figures, it is impossible for the people and the taxpayers to make a realistic assessment of whether this is good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/5">Some of the hidden costs, other than the costs to other Departments, include the cost of designing the database, which, as I have said, the Government will not reveal. One would expect that it will be a complex and technologically sophisticated database, and security measures will need to be incredibly robust given the nature and the quantities of data that will be stored on the database. Therefore, this is unlikely to be a piece of software that comes cheaply. There is also the cost of the scanners and the readers. Many problems have been reported in trials with the accuracy of some of the reading equipment. That varies in terms of the different types of biometrics used. People with disabilities have reported problems with using some of the biometric readers; for such cases, more than one type of scanning equipment may be required at sites where the ID cards will be used.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/6">An individual card reader is estimated to cost about &pound;275, and a card and fingerprint reader about &pound;500. However, many people, such as manual labourers, cannot use the fingerprint reader with great accuracy because their fingers are often worn down. Facial scanners would cost &pound;750 and iris scanners, which are the most accurate, are very costly at &pound;3,500.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/7">The aims of the project were about delivering better public services, but if the costs I have mentioned are multiplied across the various Government Departments, hospitals and police stations up and down the country, they soon start to escalate, and the costs to other Departments should be borne in mind.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/8">I am also concerned that some of the costs of the scheme are being concealed in other budgets. A large part of the money being used for the scheme is said to be going only towards the upgrade of the UK Passport Service, as if all the biometric data were absolutely necessary for that. We must scotch that myth. Under international regulations, all the different forms of biometric data do not need to be stored on the cards. Yes, we have to have facial recognition, but fingerprinting and iris scanning are optional, not mandatory. No other country has as many biometric details stored in their ID cards or passport systems; this project is far more ambitious than the others, and the Government would do well to rethink it.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/9">We also have to consider the cost of replacing the cards. Currently, it is estimated that once every 10 years will be sufficient. However, biometric data diminish over time; people's appearance changes and as time passes, the scans&mdash;particularly those for facial recognition&mdash;become less accurate. The operator of the national fingerprint information system, Northrop Grumman, argues that cards may need to be replaced as often as every three years; even if it were necessary only every five years, that would significantly increase the cost of the scheme and increase the figure of&pound;584 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/10">Taking into account various of those factors, the London School of Economics report estimates the true cost to be anywhere between &pound;10.6 billion and&pound;19.2 billion. Even at the optimistic end of that range, the costs would be almost double those projected by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/11">In assessing the costs of such a scheme, it is also important to compare them with any expected benefits. Given the Government's track record on IT projects, already mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase>, such benefits may be dubious.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/12">Hong Kong has a widely praised ID card scheme. In the <i>Sunday Herald</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-28">28 November 2004</phrase>, the consultant responsible for implementing it said of the UK scheme:</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/13" class="indent">&quot;'Saying you're going to introduce a nationwide identity card is easy. Making it happen is a different matter...This would be the most ambitious IT project in UK history, an enormously complex system involving untried technologies, and success seems unlikely when you consider the public sector's abysmal track record in this area.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/14">For example, EDS was the company responsible for developing the tax credits database. I am sure that in the past few years, most Members have had contact with constituents who have been on the receiving end of that flawed system because of overpayments, underpayments or administrative failures. EDS has negotiated a &pound;71.25 million settlement with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to compensate for the IT failures that have plagued the system since its inception. Yet that very company has been awarded another Government contract&mdash;to revamp Ministry of Defence systems. Unlike other contracts, which have been worth tens of millions of pounds, that contract is worth &pound;4 billion. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me and the taxpayer, first, that the national identity register contract will not necessarily cost that much&mdash;an estimate of how much he thinks it will cost would be very much appreciated&mdash;and secondly, that careful consideration will take place before an IT contractor is chosen, particularly if a company such as EDS is placing a bid.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/15">The Home Office's own report shows that for other Government Departments to take up and benefit from the ID card scheme, there will need to be high levels of take-up. For example, the Department for Work and Pensions and Revenue and Customs are unlikely to get large benefits until 80 per cent. of the population are using the scheme. When does the Minister expect us to reach a level of 80 per cent. take-up with a voluntary scheme?</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/16">In their manifesto, the Government said that they would introduce a voluntary scheme. We have had many debates on whether requiring people who have passports to have ID cards complies with the assertion that it is a voluntary scheme. I would argue that that represents a great degree of compulsion. I still believe that 80 per cent. is a fairly optimistic level to achieve in a short space of time. Although 80 per cent. of people have passports&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="c.135.0/1">I hope that the hon. Lady will forgive me for intervening. I have listened carefully to her detailed and cogently argued speech, but I would like her to clarify something before she sits down. This matter is of great concern to my constituents. I receive a lot of correspondence on this matter supporting both sides of the case. It is unclear to me whether her opposition to ID cards, such as I take it, is on a matter of principle or practice. We have to accept that the relevant costs are variable and will inevitably be imprecise at this stage, but is there a cost at which the implementation of ID cards would be acceptable to her?</p>

	<p pid="c.135.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. As a Liberal, I have a principled objection to ID cards. We do not need the system, and no evidence has been presented to the House to suggest that it is necessary. However, as the debate is about the cost of the scheme, I have focused on those particular arguments.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.1/2">The hon. Gentleman's point is well made. I am opposed to ID cards in principle, as are many people. I am sure that some of his constituents have written to him voicing that view. Hon. Members might know that there is a strong campaign at renewforfreedom.org, which is encouraging people to renew their passports before the ID cards database comes into effect. I wonder whether the Minister thinks that that will have an impact on the likely take-up of the scheme and, therefore, when the anticipated benefits might be achieved by Government Departments.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.1/3">However, I am keen to press on. The cost of the project has spiralled, and it has been characterised by a complete lack of clarity about what it is intended to achieve. The stated aim of the project has changed from anti-terrorism to tackling benefit fraud, to making things easier for Government Departments, to making it easier to prove one's identity without having to take one's passport out with one, but we have not heard a strong argument for introducing ID cards. The likely cost is incredibly worrying, and we can expect it to increase further because not all aspects of the scheme have been included in the projections. The scheme offers poor value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.1/4">I understand that the Treasury has asked for an annual review of the scheme's cost. I hope that the Minister will tell us when that review will be undertaken. Will it be published in front of the House? If the costs escalate, on the annual review basis, at what point would the Government reconsider the merits of the scheme and review its implementation? Are they committed to implementing ID cards no matter how high the costs and how small the benefits?</p>

	<p pid="c.136.0/1">I hesitate to say t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">his because the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire(Jo Swinson)</phrase> has been in the House for only a year and her reputation is strong and growing, but, with the best will in the world, I have never listened to such clich&eacute;-ridden tosh since the last time I heard a Liberal speak on ID cards. That is a shame because there are serious and substantive matters of practicality rather than principle that we now need to consider. This is such an important debate, regardless of where one started from in terms of the Bill, which means so much to the country, that it demands slightly better than a clich&eacute;-ridden rehash of the arguments of the past two or three years. I say that with real regret.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/2">The hon. Lady is wrong in so many instances that I am not sure that I could go through them all in 10 or15 minutes, but let me start at the beginning. She is wrong to suggest&mdash;I do not want anyone to be misled in this regard&mdash;that somehow by <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase>, as a result of amendments to the Bill accepted by the Government, there will be a full and detailed cost breakdown of every single aspect of the project. There will not. That was not the substance of the Lords amendment that we quite rightly accepted, which was that we should report to the House progress on the project, including costs, on a six-monthly basis. It is entirely right and proper that the House should know such things.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/3">I suspect that the paucity of intellect in many of the hon. Lady's arguments comes from a complete lack of understanding&mdash;God knows, I do not understand it entirely&mdash;of how government works. The Liberals seem to think that we have thought of a number and doubled it, and that is the apparent cost of the ID cards. Whatever the Government, internal governmental processes and accountability simply would not allow that. She is quite right to quote the figure of &pound;584 million; she is quite wrong to ascribe that in full or in part to ID cards, with a little bolt-on for the new biometric passport scheme. It was the other way around. We have said throughout that about 70 per cent.-plus of those costs are for the biometric passport.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/4">I had a look, and never have I found in this House&mdash;admittedly before the hon. Lady became a Member of the House&mdash;any peep, any whisper from the Liberal Democrats countering the introduction of biometric passports. Nothing. By the bye, I did not find anything from the official Opposition either. That is right and proper. The consensus was that we must have a far more secure international travel document than we have had hitherto.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/5">The hon. Lady is right&mdash;in a fourth-form sort of way&mdash;to suggest that what we are seeking goes far beyond international requirements in international agreements. They require facial recognition and fingerprints, but not the all-singing, all-dancing 13 biometrics that we suggest. That is not a critique of where we are going with the project, because I guarantee her and the House that everybody else internationally will get to where the UK is starting from. It is not sufficient to suggest that somehow there is a flaw in the entire project because we are going for an absolutely copper-bottomed gold standard biometric system for passports and ID cards. As far as I am aware, apart from the rumbling around the edges, there is continuing support for a biometric passport.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/6">I accept in full <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the point made by the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> about our network of offices and application by interview. I appreciate that it will cause difficulties in rural areas. It was discussed at length during the last Committee sitting of the Bill and previously, but the interview is a necessary part of obtaining a biometric passport, and those matters must be overcome. By the bye, it was probably the most far-flung Liberal Democrat, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, who made that point, and given his constituency, he can make it in far stronger terms than anyone else. It is an issue, there are 70 offices, and we may need to consider mobile facilities and others in more detail, and we have said that we will; but there is no other way to capture people's biometrics, even for the first phase for the new passport, other than through application by interview. It is a fair point, and one that we are addressing.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/7">On the hon. Lady's points&mdash;again, clich&eacute;d, I am afraid&mdash;about the trials thus far, there has not been in substance a mock-up of every aspect of capturing people's biometrics. She knows that; she has read the reports. They are, for the individual, about physicality, ergonomics and all the other elements of having one's biometrics captured; no more than that. The trials did not use the tip-top, state-of-the-art biometric capture technology that exists for passports and will exist when ID cards come in. One cannot say from a series of tests about the ergonomics and physicality of the process of having one's fingerprints, irises and everything else captured, that the incumbent and subsequent flaws in many aspects of it are due to flaws in the technology. One simply cannot say that, and the hon. Ladyknows it.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/8">But let us return to cost, which is what the debate is principally about. I cannot remember who said it, but I agree, in response to the hon. Lady's question, that saying we will introduce ID cards is easy, but making it happen is a different matter. I agree with that in spades, given the complexity of the project. However, it is not the case that we should simply think of a number and double it. Nor is it the case&mdash;there is a fundamental flaw in the argument&mdash;that all that money could be spent on so many other things. Much of the set-up costs will already need to be in place for the biometric passport system, with which everyone broadly agrees. Beyond that, the only moneys available are, as the hon. Lady correctly says, the &pound;30 fee for a stand-alone ID card or the &pound;93 fee for the combination ID card and passport. There is no other money.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/9">As I said earlier, unless the hon. Lady is suggesting that we scrap the Bill and scrap any notion of going forward with the ID card project, but keep in place the &pound;30 per head and the &pound;93 per head&mdash;she is clearly not saying that&mdash;then there is no additional pot of money for all those mythical policemen, security services and others. It is a complete and utter fallacy to suggest that there is, but that is what has been said on countless leaflets&mdash;during the general election, before the Bill came to the House and subsequently. The net result in Harrow was one Liberal Democrat councillor, which is one too many. None the less, that flaw demeans the nature of public policy debate in the House. There is no additional money, unless the hon. Lady is suggesting that we should keep that little tax of &pound;30 or &pound;93&mdash;which is about &pound;30 more than is now charged for passports&mdash;and she clearly is not suggesting that.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/10">It is equally facile to suggest&mdash;as the official Opposition and the Liberal Democrats did at length&mdash;that if we cannot come clean about the set-up costs, we must be trying to hide something. That shows a fundamental lack of understanding about basic public procurement, whether under a Labour or Tory Government or anyone else.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/11">The hon. Lady wants a degree of financial transparency and prudence, and a cost base that works&mdash;entirely praiseworthy ambitions&mdash;but one cannot do that by giving a blank cheque to all potential IT procurers without exposing every aspect of the architecture of the database and the commercial structure. It is easy to say that because the Government are hiding behind commercial confidentiality, they must have something to cover up. It is an interesting point, but a fourth-form one.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/12">The Government stand by the regulatory impact assessment for the Bill and the costs therein. In January 2006, the Office of Government Commerce carried out a gateway zero review of the overall programme and we were advised that we can proceed to the next stage. That internal process continues. There must be rigour and probity. It is not in the Government's interests for costs to spiral as the hon. Lady suggests. The review team has full access to our business case for the setting up and the issuing of cards, including on the anticipated use of the scheme in the public and private sectors.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/13">What the hon. Lady said about the durability of biometrics was entirely wrong. What she said about Northrop Grumman happened in 2002. I freely admit that the development of the technology improves by leaps and bounds year after year. It is wrong to compare smartcards with highly developed biometric cards.</p>
	<p pid="c.136.0/14">It is a canard to say so&mdash;I have said it myself of other projects&mdash;but as and when there is time, the Government and the public sector are getting rather good at large IT projects. Invariably, past failures have been the result of a big-bang instant roll-out&mdash;rather like the passports. That will not be the case for ID cards. We think that the cost structure is robust. We are absolutely certain that the country needs ID cards. I do not know when the next cost review will be published, given that <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> is the six-month deadline. Whether we go for July or slip into October, once we are ready I will be more than happy to discuss the review in detail with the hon. Lady.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.140.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1732" speakername="Jessica Morden" colnum="140"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0080.htm#06051065000413">
	<p pid="c.140.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to have this debate, and I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for being here to respond. I make no excuses for being parochial and talking about a hugely successful recycling scheme, which is a model of best practice, based in my constituency. I ask my hon. Friend to look at that scheme, which we can all learn from, and to listen to points raised by community recycling groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/2">In the race to avoid being buried under a mountain of landfill, and facing hefty penalties, local authorities are in danger of grasping at easy waste options, often ignoring community enterprises such as Wastesavers in my constituency, which offers cheaper, cleaner systems and added benefits for the local area. It is relevant that we are discussing this matter today. The waste strategy consultation closed just yesterday, and this major national debate is one that normally enjoys significant cross-party agreement.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/3">We all understand the need to reduce landfill, and to recycle and reuse our precious resources. We all produce waste&mdash;that is a fact. We create 100 million tonnes of industrial, commercial and household waste annually, and it is growing at a rate of 3 per cent. each year. The Government have rightly introduced stringent targets backed up by a punitive landfill tax that will increase by &pound;3 per tonne in 2005-06 and by at least &pound;3 per tonne in subsequent years to a rate of&pound;35 per tonne by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/4">Newport city council, which partly covers my constituency, has developed a highly innovative partnership with a provider of waste services in the area&mdash;a community enterprise called Wastesavers, which handles dry recycling and furniture. It isdifficult to ignore the recent achievements of Newport Wastesavers. It provides the most cost-effective recycling scheme in Wales, and arguably in the UK. With the support of the council, it has scooped prizes at the resource awards and the national recycling awards, and collected the prestigious Marks and Spencer award for a community recycling project in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/5">Eighty per cent. of households in Newport participate in recycling. The partnership between the council and Wastesavers has resulted in Newport doing far better than the Welsh average. It recycled or composted 27 per cent. of total municipal waste last year.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/6">With a sustained partnership with the council and a determined and dedicated group of people, Wastesavers has moved from humble foundations and now occupies a purpose-built clean-stream resource recovery centre in my constituency. It employs more than 50 people who provide kerbside collection services for recyclable material and a furniture reuse project that helps disadvantaged families in Newport. Operating since 1985, it takes pride in being a true recycler&mdash;it does not do waste but aims to make everything reuseable or recyclable in any way possible. Over the years, it has innovated and expanded its range of services in Newport, and in the process has demonstrated that the community sector is capable of delivering economic efficiencies as well as environmental benefits.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/7">I visited Wastesavers in Newport. What comes across is its enthusiasm and professionalism, and most of all the simplicity of an operation that achieves the lowest costs and highest participation rates that I have come across. So what makes it successful?</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/8">First, Wastesavers works in partnership with the council and the community. The council took the radical and difficult decision to reduce collection of traditional black-bag waste to a fortnightly service while Wastesavers collected the recycling weekly. Therefore, recycling became the default waste action. In areas where that system operates, the rate of households participating has risen to a staggering90 per cent. The model has been so successful that it is being rolled out into more areas of Newport, and it has generated much enthusiasm for recycling among the public, including those residents who were sceptical when the fortnightly refuse collections started.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/9">Secondly, Wastesavers is efficient and therefore cheaper. Newport pays only &pound;41 a tonne for recycling, which is only a few pounds higher than its cost of landfill. I understand that charges in other authorities are at least several times that cost, and anecdotally I have heard of authorities being charged up to &pound;400 a tonne. The &pound;41 rate is not subsidised by grants but is a reflection of the true cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/10">Thirdly, Wastesavers separates at source so that it can command higher returns. Residents separate, wash and sort the materials themselves and put them out in kerbside boxes. The result is clean, contaminant-free materials for collection. Those valuable products command the highest prices from customers who are prepared to pay for the highest-quality materials. I used to live in an area where all recyclables were collected in green bags and I often wondered how all that was recycled; did it not just get all squashed together and mixed up? The answer seems to be that it is squashed together and mixed up and much of it does not end up being recycled. The high level of contamination of materials collected in that way means that they have to be incinerated or sometimes they even find their way into landfill.</p>
	<p pid="c.140.1/11">Wastesavers keeps things simple, investing in people, not machines. Clean, sorted material comes in, because people sort it themselves, so the Wastesavers depot has no need of big, expensive sorting machines. It invests in training and developing its people and it provides opportunities for the whole community, with employment possibilities for people on probation and people with learning difficulties. Fifty per cent. of people who come on placements become permanent employees, and 80 per cent. of the employees were previously unemployed. That is a testament to true social enterprise.</p>

	<p pid="c.141.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing this important debate. Does she agree that the organisation to which she is referring and ones such as the Bradford Area play association and the Windhill community furniture store in my constituency bring not only waste management and recycling benefits&mdash;that is important enough&mdash;but community benefits, which she is also mentioning? That is the crucial part of why such organisations should be supported.</p>

	<p pid="c.142.0/1">I agree and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I congratulate him on the successful scheme in his constituency&mdash;may it go from strength to strength. I agree that it is the community benefits that we get from such schemes that add value. They are not just commercial operations; they are adding something to the community.</p>
	<p pid="c.142.0/2">Wastesavers looks to the future and educates the next generation of recyclers. A not-for-profit organisation, it runs fantastic educational programmes on recycling, and the results are everywhere. Yesterday, pupils of Llanmartin primary school visited me in the House of Commons and spoke enthusiastically about their school recycling programme, which was inspired by Wastesavers. Wastesavers provides a model of good practice that is efficient, effective and economic.</p>

	<p pid="c.142.1/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. She is a powerful advocate for both her constituency and the scheme. What advice would she give people such as me, in my constituency? Swindon borough council has made recycling a relatively low priority. We have only 0.24 recycling points per 1,000 of population, compared with the national average of 0.41 per cent. I am struck by the contrast between Swindon borough council and Newport borough council, which seems to have played a very entrepreneurial and constructive role. How would my hon. Friend advise people such as me? I want Swindon to do better on recycling and to follow the good practice that she is outlining.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.142.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1732" speakername="Jessica Morden" colnum="142"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0080.htm#06051065000428">
	<p pid="c.142.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for raising that point. One success of the Wastesavers scheme is the strong partnership that it has had with a committed local authority. I am sorry to hear that he does not have a successful recycling scheme in his area. I suggest that he speak to Community Recycling Network UK, which I am sure can suggest a way forward for him and his local council.</p>
	<p pid="c.142.2/2">As I said, just yesterday pupils of Llanmartin primary school visited me and talked enthusiastically about their programme. The educational benefits and the will of Wastesavers to do such work with the community are great. Is it really simple to be so economic, effective and efficient? It is, but what annoys Wastesavers and similar organisations represented by Community Recycling Network UK is that the potential for community enterprises to do even more seems to be slightly ignored in planning for the future.</p>

	<p pid="c.142.3/1">I share the optimism in the hon. Lady's speech; I share also the frustration of some community organisations. Does she agree that sometimes we have had difficulties with the Environment Agency's interpretation of licensing exemptions, particularly for small recycling schemes? In my rural area, small community schemes find, for instance, a &pound;6,000 charge for a licence prohibitive of future recycling work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.143.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1732" speakername="Jessica Morden" colnum="143"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0080.htm#06051065000431">
	<p pid="c.143.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an interesting point. I think that Wastesavers is entitled to an exemption because the materials are sorted at source&mdash;residents sort the materials themselves&mdash;so perhaps one answer for the residents of Ceredigion would be to consider that type of operation. I am sure that the Minister will respond to the point and I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.0/2">Many councils take a mechanical approach to recycling and, threatened by rising targets and penalties, are willing to sign up to long-term contracts for treating waste, sometimes for up to 30 years. Such contracts are likely to involve thermal treatment, incineration or anything that keeps waste out of landfill. Machine-based systems to sort or treat waste are costly to install and can produce low-grade recyclable materials or even destroy a valuable resource. Crucially, we end up paying more for materials to be destroyed than we do to have them recycled, with all the economic benefits that that brings to the community and the environment. Something simple is being made complicated and more expensive.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.0/3">Committing to a 30-year contract for incineration of up to 60 per cent. of waste might solve a landfill problem for a local authority in the short term but will prevent the expansion of the community recycling model, which would add the social benefits and the ability to deal with the long-term problem, as I have outlined.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.143.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="143"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0080.htm#06051065000434">
	<p pid="c.143.1/1">Is my hon. Friend aware of the work of the furniture re-use network, which has its national headquarters in my constituency? It promotes the reuse of 1.5 million items of furniture a year and does some incredibly good work throughout the country. There are also local organisations in Bristol, such as the SOFA project and Emmaus, which reuse more than 10,000 items a year, most of which go to low-income households. Does my hon. Friend agree that the issue is not just about environmental concerns but, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1816" name="Philip Davies">the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> said, about tackling social exclusion? Such organisations have an important role to play in that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.143.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1732" speakername="Jessica Morden" colnum="143"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0080.htm#06051065000435">
	<p pid="c.143.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. Wastesavers also has a furniture recycling project that adds much to the community in Newport, so I commend the projects that she has mentioned. We are fundamentally ignoring the principles and the success demonstrated by community recycling schemes such as Wastesavers, which have been run throughout the country. Such schemes are rapidly increasing the tonnage that they recycle and therefore reducing waste to landfill at the same rate.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.2/2">Anecdotally, some Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs officials have indicated to the community recyclers that they believe that it would only ever be possible to divert 40 per cent. of household waste to recycling. However, Wastesavers and its colleagues in the community recycling networks think that that is not an ambitious enough target. They think that they can do a lot better and believe in striving towards a state of zero waste. However, that takes time and will require us to look at the issue from the other side, creating a service designed around recycling, rather than modifying the existing waste services.</p>
	<p pid="c.143.2/3">In the short term, it is vital that we do not hamper progress towards the goal of reducing and recycling all waste by committing to very long-term contracts that prevent the growth of other models. I look forward to seeing the evidence and the outcomes of the waste strategy review, which closed yesterday. In the meantime, I ask the Minister to take note of the excellent alternative systems on offer&mdash;perhaps by visiting Wastesavers with me and meeting representatives of the networks that support them, such as Community Recycling Network UK and its Welsh counterpart Cylch. I also suggest that a comparative study be commissioned to evaluate the wide variety of systems on offer, the range of costs and the various social and environmental outcomes that can be achieved. Without that information, we could find ourselves in an expensive recycling trap.</p>

	<p pid="c.144.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1732" name="Jessica Morden">my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Jessica Morden)</phrase> on securing this debate and on her excellent speech. It is encouraging to see such a high level of interest from all three major parties&mdash;that is not always the case in shorter Adjournment debates&mdash;and all hon. Members who have intervened have made important points.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/2">As my hon. Friend pointed out, we have just finished a major public consultation on the review of our waste strategy. In the renewed strategy, which we will publish later this year, the Government are determined to see an enhanced role for the community and voluntary sector. We have made considerable progress in recent years, which all hon. Members recognised, although it has been ra<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">ther patchy, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> pointed out. We have trebled the amount of municipal waste that we recycle or compost and we are on course to hit our targets. It is not every Department that can say that about all its targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/3">That is partly the result of the excellent work of local authorities, working in collaboration with the private sector and the community and voluntary sector. It is also the result of the work of our public, who are increasingly aware of the importance of sustainable waste management; that subject is rising up in the public consciousness. If people are asked in opinion polls, for example, whether they think it is important to recycle, about 90 per cent. say yes; but only about 45 to 50 per cent. recycle regularly. We must close that gap. As my hon. Friend pointed out, one of the best ways to do that is by providing a high-quality kerbside recycling service for the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/4">Those services have increased hugely in recent years and my hon. Friend has rightly&mdash;not just in this Adjournment debate but several times in DEFRA questions&mdash;drawn attention to the Wastesavers project in her constituency of Newport, which, as she says, is a beacon for the rest of the country. In partnership with the excellent local council and her constituents, it has achieved a tremendous increase in the percentage of recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/5">It is interesting that my hon. Friend used a slightly different figure from the one that I have heard cited previously for the cost per tonne achieved by Wastesavers in Newport. Getting the cost down so low is an incredible achievement. She will, I am sure, appreciate that part of the explanation is that the organisation is community-based and that some of those involved are volunteers. They work efficiently and well, but she is right to point out that there are wide variations in the costs not only of recycling and kerbside collection but of waste management by local authorities as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/6">My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that the Government are considering that issue, not just as part of the review of our waste strategy but as a result of the Gershon report in 2004, which identified potential for considerable savings in our waste management and collection systems. We should be interested in studying the experience of Wastesavers, which one of my officials has already visited. I should be delighted to take my hon. Friend up on her invitation; she can show me around. I am keen, in the months ahead, following the closing of the consultation yesterday, and before the publication of our renewed waste strategy, to examine best practice and ensure that we get the strategy right.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/7">We need to do that&mdash;my hon. Friend has, again, made the point well&mdash;because although we have made dramatic improvements in this country in recent years we have an awful long way to go. We still use landfill far too much. Landfill, as everyone recognises, is the least environmentally friendly way of managing our waste. We need to get our recycling and recovery levels up to those of continental Europe and our landfill levels down.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.145.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" speakername="Kerry McCarthy" colnum="145"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0081.htm#06051065000445">
	<p pid="c.145.0/1">Is the Minister aware that one of the problems of current landfill policy&mdash;according to Bristol city council, which, again, does not have a good record on recyling&mdash;is that it is more economically viable to recycle heavier objects? When I have tried to encourage the council to recycle plastics, it has replied that that is not cost-effective, because plastic does not weigh as much.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.145.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="145"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0081.htm#06051065000446">
	<p pid="c.145.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. It is depressing, when some local authorities are as good as Newport and are doing so well on recycling, that others, such as Bristol and Swindon, do so badly. There is no excuse for it, and my hon. Friends may want to take a stark warning back to their constituents and local authorities. Their constituents will pay the price for poor performance on recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/2">As the landfill tax escalator hits in as one of the major financial incentives, council tax payers in Bristol and Swindon will pay the price for the poor performance of their local authorities. In recent years, the ratcheting up of the system has been made even more effective by the introduction of the landfill allowance trading scheme, which is rather like the emissions trading scheme, one of the mechanisms used to deal with climate change. Local authorities that perform badly can buy extra landfill allowance from other local authorities, but, again, that will involve a cost to council tax payers. It is not merely good for the environment to recycle, reuse and compost; it is, in the long run, also cheaper for council tax payers.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> is right about the importance of community recycling network schemes. I know of the headquarters in her constituency, and in fact I met the chief executive, or whatever he calls himself, fairly recently. He has had some very constructive meetings with my officials to make sure that those schemes are not forgotten in our consideration of our new waste strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East, is absolutely right to point to the perverse incentives in our waste policy under the weight-based system. That system sometimes incentivises local authorities to collect heavy waste for recycling, because that boosts their recycling rates, and waste that is easy to collect. I shall give her a good example: hon. Members may have noticed that recently many local authorities have rapidly expanded their so-called green waste collections of garden waste. That has been a very easy way for local authorities to increase their recycling rates, but of course it is much easier for local authorities in leafy suburbs and rural areas to do that than it is for local authorities in some inner-city areas. There is a real problem with the incentives in the current weight-based system, and we are actively considering that as part of the waste review.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/5">My hon. Friend may also be interested to know that my officials are working with Wastesavers in her constituency to look into how it achieves what it does, and to get it to be an exemplar for other social and community-based recycling and waste management organisations across the country. That is because we want a lot more successful, social and community-based, voluntary-based organisations involved in how we manage our waste, for the very reason touched on by a number of hon. Members: we are not just talking about a sensible, efficient and environmentally friendly way of managing waste; the issue is also about getting community action and community spiritedness on the whole issue of managing waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/6">If people based in, and coming from, the community are running such organisations and providing the sort of opportunities to which my hon. Friend referred&mdash;opportunities for disadvantaged people, people coming out of prison who want to rehabilitate themselves, people with learning disabilities and so forth&mdash;that is a fantastic contribution that they can make. Also, people benefit enormously from the sort of work that that involves, and as my hon. Friend rightly says, it is often a stepping-stone by which they can re-enter the full-time employment market, so it is a virtuous circle.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/7">We would like enterprises such as Wastesavers in Newport to expand. There are examples of other bodies that have expanded and gone to other places, but my understanding is that Wastesavers is quite happy staying the size it is, and as a result it has agreed to share its business plan with anyone who is interested. My hon. Friend has already established herself in the House as a great ambassador for sustainable waste management and for Wastesavers in her constituency. May she go far afield, singing its praises and suggesting that people in other parts of the country talk to Wastesavers&mdash;a process that we will certainly encourage&mdash;to see whether they can replicate elsewhere its wonderful practices in Newport.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> is absolutely right to say that in the past there have been issues to do with prohibitive licence costs for composting and recycling organisations. Community composting organisations raised that with me very soon after I took on the waste brief, just under a year ago. They were worried that they would be put out of business by some of the new charges coming in. We shelved those charges, and over the past 12 months we have undertaken a review of them. I am confident that in the next few weeks we will come forward with a revised system that will benefit the sorts of recycling and composting organisations to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and that should be cheaper for the Environment Agency. I am absolutely determined not to put barriers in the way of those sorts of very sensible and effective community organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/9">I should have said at the beginning of my speech that everything that I have said about visiting and so on is with the slight caveat that I remain the Minister responsible for such matters. Hon. Members will understand that DEFRA has become an almost completely new Department and the portfolios may be switched around.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/10">I hope that I retain that responsibility because I very much enjoyed seeing the waste review through. There is huge and growing interest in the matter, as the debate has illustrated, and it will be a huge environmental challenge for the country. If we fail to get it right in the next few years, not only will the environmental consequences be extremely serious, because we will continue to produce methane through landfill&mdash;hon. Members know that it is one of the most damaging greenhouse gases&mdash;but the country and individual local authorities will become liable to swingeing fines from the European Commission for failing to meet our landfill targets.</p>
