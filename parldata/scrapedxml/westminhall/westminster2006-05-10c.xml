	<p pid="c.75.4/1">I totally endorse what my hon. Friend says. I fear that Barnet is doing no favours to its own people, and it is also failing to make a wider contribution.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.4/2">I am saying to the Government that the opportunity afforded by the Chancellor's stated interest in the case for social housing to be included in next year's spending review is almost a last chance to put right the failures of the past. It was comforting to hear the new Secretary of State in this Department emphasise the importance of social housing. I hope that people's ears are open to the case that needs to be made.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.4/3">Many good things have been done by the Government on housing since 1997, of which the decent homes initiative is the most important. Thousands of my constituents have benefited from the major improvements and renovations that have taken place under that programme, which are much to be welcomed. However, the overall failure to address the problem of housing supply, most especially but not entirely in London and the south-east, has not only caused untold misery for those families rendered homeless or trapped in chronically overcrowded accommodation, but has been a false economy to the public purse. It has shifted much of the cost, such as for temporary accommodation, on to housing benefit; contributed to the destabilising of communities; and, sadly&mdash;this is why the debate is so relevant&mdash;stoked the racism that is a consequence of the competition for scarce resources in an ethically mixed and fast-changing city.</p>
	<p pid="c.75.4/4">As the director of Shelter rightly said yesterday, the shortage affordable homes has led to a &quot;blame culture&quot; in which people turn on each other in their frustration and despair. Although the consequences might have been seen most graphically in Barking and Dagenham, we should be under no illusion that such sentiments are confined to one area.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.83.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="83"  time="009:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0073.htm#06051065000522">
	<p pid="c.83.0/1">I shall be as brief as possible because it is important that all colleagues are able to get into the debate. It cannot have escaped your notice, Mrs. Dean, that the majority of Labour Members participating in this debate represent London constituencies; that is because of the nature of the housing crisis in London which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> outlined very well indeed.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/2">I represent an inner-London constituency where property prices are going through the roof all the time. Anyone wishing to buy a property in my constituency, such as a two-bedroomed flat above a shop on a main road, would need about &pound;200,000. I saw an ex-council, three-bedroomed flat on an estate advertised yesterday for &pound;350,000. So-called &quot;shared ownership&quot; properties are so expensive that the possibility of anyone on less than a head teacher's income getting one is remote. In reality, there is a massive housing crisis. Little is being built and some council property is still being sold, fortunately at a slightly lower rate than in the past.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/3">As my Friend said in relation to the choice-based letting scheme, people on the housing waiting list go into a bidding frenzy every Thursday when the local paper comes out. Most of them are sadly disappointed. People come to my advice bureau in tears saying that in two years they have managed to visit one property with 20 other families and did not even manage to get an offer at the end of that process. Such a cruelty goes on week in, week out.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/4">To some extent, I welcome the choice-based letting system. However, we should be careful because those who are not computer literate, whose first language is not English and who do not feel confident or comfortable using telephones often simply do not bid. Such people just wait, but they will wait for ever because they have no opportunity at all. While I am not against choice-based letting, we should be cautious because those whose first language is not English are, in my experience, in danger of losing out as a result of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">The Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> mentioned some of the problems in his area, and I have much sympathy with those, particularly the point he raised about the perverse levels of cost and the way in which investment can deal with the situation. I suspect that my local authority, Islington council, like most other London bodies, houses few people off the waiting list into any new development or vacant property. People tend to be directed into the private sector or into leased properties where the council or housing association take on the lease. Such leases are phenomenally expensive.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/6">Ex-council properties that have been sold under the right to buy are then bought up by property companies or housing associations, or they are leased. The rent for such properties is often up to &pound;300 a week. People in desperate housing need are put into them and the rent is paid by housing benefit; usually 100 per cent. of it is paid in that way, although that is not true in all cases. The family involved then often live in a poor quality property that is badly managed, very unsuitable and, in some cases, downright dangerous in my view. A huge rent is paid by the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/7">If any member of such a family then manages to get a job&mdash;clearly we want people to get jobs and careers&mdash;they cannot afford to take it, because they are suddenly saddled with a bill of &pound;15,000 a year in rent alone, and they have lost income support and other benefits. We are building a mad benefit trap that costs the public a huge sum to prevent somebody from working and keep them in a grossly substandard and inadequate form of accommodation. A lot of that money could be spent far more effectively on building new homes for rent for the people in desperate housing need throughout London.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/8">I shall just quickly make two or three points because I recognise that many other Members wish to speak. First, on planning issues, the Mayor of London has rightly said that he wants 50 per cent. of all major developments given over to what he terms &quot;affordable housing&quot;. I understand that aspiration, and I support it with one or two reservations. I do so because I want far more homes for rent to be available, but I do not like the use of the word &quot;affordable&quot; because the definition of it is loose. It means whatever anyone wants it to mean. Developers seem to think that something is very affordable when I do not think that that is the case. I would much rather say that we desperately need &quot;places for rent at a fixed level in the public sector&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/9">My local authority, Islington council, was controlled by the Liberal Democrats until last Thursday. Sadly from their point of view it now has no overall control, which represents an enormous step forward for Labour. One issue in the election was the Liberal Democrats' persistence on the policy that they would demand a proportion of social housing only on development sites of more than 14 units. In my borough there are few large development sites; most are very small. The Labour proposal was to go right down to the bottom and insist that all development sites have a proportion of social housing, which is eminently sensible. I hope that that is the new council's policy.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/10">With major developments, developers do not think about the housing needs of people who are desperate to be rehoused; they think of their profits. Arsenal stadium sadly closed last week and the football team is moving to the new stadium. The old stadium site is being redeveloped as Highbury square. The developers, with the agreement of the Liberal Democrat council, are going to put 711 one-bedroomed private flats on that site. That is crazy. There is a desperate need for family housing to keep communities together. What happens is that single people and couples move to one-bedroomed flats and then cannot move to anywhere else in that community, so we end up with a community of either childless couples or old people. Those with children are forced to move out of inner London. I am sure that that occurs in other inner-London constituencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/11">My last point is about the need to invest in development. The Library produced an interesting briefing for today's debate, which makes grim reading. The number of new council properties being developed throughout the country this year is somewhere around the zero mark, and the number of housing association properties being developed in the whole of London, which is at a record high for the past 10 years, is just 6,000. We need major investment in housing for rent either by housing associations or local authorities. We should give local authorities the freedom to invest in building properties for rent if that is what they want to do, not skew Government financing of housing investment so that it is impossible for local authorities to build for affordable rent.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/12">If we do not tackle this crisis in London&mdash;and it is a crisis&mdash;what will be the long-term effect? More homeless people, more people living in grossly overcrowded accommodation, and more children growing up in grossly overcrowded flats. Is it surprising that young people and teenagers who are forced to share bedrooms with their siblings&mdash;often siblings of different sexes&mdash;do not like to spend time at home because there is simply no space? Is it surprising that families break up? Is it surprising that those young people hang around in the streets because they do not want to be at home in the evening, and encounter all kinds of problems as a result? If we do not deal with the housing crisis in London urgently and invest in the needs of the people, we will be exporting the poor out of London, and creating social divisions and misery for those people who manage to find somewhere&mdash;often somewhere expensive and inadequate&mdash;to live.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.0/13">I hope that the Minister fully understands the crisis facing us in London, and the pain that we see across our desks at advice bureaux every week when people ask, &quot;Is it so unreasonable to want a decent flat with a bedroom for each of my children so that they can grow up like all the other children do?&quot; It is heartbreaking to hear what people go through. I hope that the Government will skew investment into new building rather than frittering it away on the profits of private landlords and property companies, which is what we are doing through the perversity of the housing benefit system.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.86.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="86"  time="010:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0074.htm#06051065000523">
	<p pid="c.86.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1777" name="Karen Buck">my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North (Ms Buck)</phrase> on securing the debate. She is an acknowledged expert in this field, and her constituency neighbours mine. I do not intend to repeat much of what she said, but I welcome the return of her forensic skills to this issue. The loss to aviation policy is great, but the gain to social housing in London is greater still.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/2">I also compliment the hon. Lady on the timing of the debate, which comes after a series of contentious local elections, for which many of us have spent the past six months knocking on doors in our constituencies. Actually, some of us have spent 18 months continuously doing that&mdash;to the extent that many of my constituents are probably seeking an injunction to stop my doing it again in the near future. Along with the cases that we hear of in weekly constituency surgeries, that brought home the real human tragedy caused by housing problems in inner London, particularly as we saw at first hand the conditions in which people live in London in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/3">My hon. Friend gave several examples of the problem. I shall not give details of cases but simply say that they range from the extreme&mdash;the consequences of a mother with four children living in a one-bedroomed flat are traumatic and almost unimaginable&mdash;to the more common situation, which is perhaps worse because of its chronic nature, in which a whole generation has grown up in overcrowded housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/4">It is normal in social housing in my constituency for parents to bring up two or three children in a two-bedroomed flat. The issue that they raise with me is the availability of housing now that their children are leaving college and want homes of their own. In other words, an entire generation has become accustomed to using living rooms as bedrooms, to children of different sexes sharing a bedroom, to daily life, whether it involves doing school work or enjoying recreation, in a space that is so confined that it does not allow for normal living.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/5">It could be said that that situation was common for our parents' generation, and that in fact the population density of inner London has decreased&mdash;although it is increasing again. However, there was always some hope in the past, as the market was far more flexible. Today, little hope can be offered to most of my constituents who live in crowded conditions.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/6">The situation is highlighted against a background in which so many things are improving in housing. I cannot remember an election when I have had fewer complaints about housing repairs and conditions, or local authorities and their performance. All those things have improved markedly, and in large measure that is due not only to the local authorities but to the Government, particularly for their decent homes programme, which has transformed entire estates and individual properties and brought them up to a good modern standard after many years of neglect. Even though the programme is not complete, people can now be given a date on which they will have new kitchens and new bathrooms, or their homes will be made weather-tight and more efficient and cheaper to run.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/7">It is also true that several factors that in the past contributed to a lack of social housing have been addressed. One rarely hears about voids; that is, the amount of time it takes to re-let properties. There are initiatives on empty homes, and better allocation policies. Local authorities and housing associations, although they are a mixed bag, have taken action, in so far as they can.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/8">It is right to say that steps have been taken by the Government to introduce more innovative proposals, but not only the Government have been involved. The Mayor of London's policy that 50 per cent. of new units must be affordable is greatly to be welcomed. Indeed, the only thing that I would say against it is that the figure is too low. The move away from building one and two-bedroomed homes to building three-bedroomed and larger homes is also welcome, but as my hon. Friend said, it has not gone far enough.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/9">Proposals such as the relaxation of planning powers to allow extensions to be built on existing properties are often floated. They should be investigated further, as the solution to a problem is often as simple as providing an additional bedroom. I think of a family with an autistic child who lived in a good-quality pre-war council house with a garden. They loved the house and the area, and used the garden for the child's benefit, but they desperately needed an additional bedroom. The solution was staring us in the face, but planning powers at that time simply did not allow an extension.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/10">There are ways of approaching this issue laterally or obliquely, but in the end, as my hon. Friend says, we have to deal with it by supply. That is the only real solution. We know that 54 per cent. of overcrowded families and 60 per cent. of families in temporary accommodation are in London. I have raised that issue publicly and privately with the Minister and her colleagues, and when I ask questions about affordable social housing, I tend to get answers about affordable owner-occupation housing. That is an important issue for young couples who are forced to move out of London and for people who need some form of intermediate housing, but at the end of the day the human misery I see every day and every week in my constituency relates to the lack of supply of affordable rented housing, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am being prompted to sit down, and I shall do so shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/11">I shall conclude with something slightly more hopeful&mdash;and something less hopeful; let us not be too optimistic. One local authority that I know intimately because I was a councillor there for 20 years&mdash;until last week&mdash;is Hammersmith and Fulham. It has an extremely good record on this issue. It is a very small and congested inner London borough, but between 1998 and 2006, 2,000 units of affordable housing were constructed, which is 70 per cent. of all housing constructed in the borough, with another 1,000 units in the pipeline.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/12">In that borough, 99.3 per cent. of capacity was addressed, compared with 2.8 per cent. in Hillingdon, 3.5 per cent. in Bromley and 3.8 per cent. in Redbridge. Many councils either do not have the skills or the will to do that. They need to have their arms twisted to do it far more, but in the end there are some councils&mdash;I am afraid this often does come down to party politics&mdash;that are not prepared to do it.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/13">On behalf of my constituents who live in overcrowded conditions, I greatly regret that the control of Hammersmith and Fulham changed hands last Thursday. I looked back at <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the debate that my hon. Friend the Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> secured in this room on <phrase class="date" code="">28 March</phrase> on the subject of overcrowding, and a very intelligent speech was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1858" name="Michael Gove">the hon. Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove)</phrase>, who was very supportive of many initiatives. He based that speech on a visit he had made to a housing development in Hammersmith and Fulham the day before, and said that it was welcomed by residents in the area and all political parties. Every single affordable housing development in the borough of Hammersmith and Fulham was opposed by the Conservative party during the past 20 years. That does not bode well for what will happen there now. The reasons change, but every single development was opposed.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/14">Planning powers and Government intervention are required, but we are talking about not only individual human misery but social engineering. We are talking about the poor and those who live in social housing effectively being told that they are not welcome in the inner city or in areas that are otherwise prosperous. The gulf between the private sector&mdash;owner-occupation, and even private rented accommodation&mdash;and social housing is so great, it is impossible, even for those on two or three times the average income, to bridge.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.0/15">The driving need is for an increase in social rented housing and a form of intermediate social housing. Unless that need is addressed, particularly in London, we are not only condemning another generation to live in appalling and inhuman conditions but changing the nature of London as we know it: a multi-racial, multi-class and vibrantly mixed community. That is my fear, and that is why housing will be such an important issue during the next 10 years. It is a big issue. The solution, as my hon. Friend the Member for Regent's Park and Kensington, North said, may be simple, but it is difficult to achieve. I hope that the Government will now give it the attention it deserves.</p>

	<p pid="c.91.0/1">Time is short so I shall be brief. Irefer hon. Members to my Adjournment debate on<phrase class="date" code="">28 March</phrase> for comments about Hackney, where overcrowding contributes to a population churn of more than 40 per cent. in some areas, which has a disastrous effect on public services.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.0/2">I want to focus on some key points that I would like the Minister to address. Why is there no explicit measure of efficiency for the Housing Corporation based on the cost of people living in a home rather than the cost per house? That defies common sense and has an impact on all the issues that hon. Members have raised. Will she give a commitment that bid support in future will reflect the number of people living in a home rather than the cost per property?</p>
	<p pid="c.91.0/3">There is also a lack of targeting for large-bedroomed houses in the current London housing strategy and I should be grateful if the Minister would comment on that also. Will she look at Housing Corporation funding rules, because we have the crazy situation locally where for every pound that a local authority provides to a housing association the Housing Corporation removes a pound? That defies common sense and needs to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.0/4">I must mention the test case in my constituency concerning the Haggerston West and Kingsland estate. We are hoping to receive good news about providing more three and four-bedroomed properties after a long campaign of more than 10 years by residents, myself and local councillors, particularly councillor Jamie Carswell, who have fought to ensure that residents receive the housing they need rather than the one and two-bedroomed properties that Treasury rules seem to impose on them.</p>

	<p pid="c.91.1/1">Although my contribution will last only a minute so that the Minister can speak, everything that has been said applies to the rest of England. I stress that a massive housing shortage is building up in other parts of England. We must not assume that problems of low pay, special needs, inflation in the private sector and the inadequacies of that sector do not also apply to the rest of England; they do.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/2">I have three pleas for the Minister. One is that she should deal properly with overcrowding, and bring forward consultation on standards, because we cannot let the shortage of housing continue to force people to live in such unacceptable conditions of overcrowding; also, perhaps she could ensure that proper consultation takes place about special needs and the impact of that issue on housing standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/3">My second plea is that the Minister should again examine the preventing homelessness agenda. I believe that it is leading to a real problem of hidden homelessness. People are being diverted into private sector renting, and although they should be diverted after their needs have been assessed, they are being diverted as soon as they apply, so that they never appear on the figures. I am very concerned about that. I am also concerned about standards of training among some of the staff who do the work.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/4">My third plea is that the Minister should attend to what is happening in the growth areas, such as mine. Lots of new housing is being built in Northampton, but it is all private sector housing and developers are subject to a requirement to provide percentages of affordable, not social, housing. As part of the growth agenda we need to ensure that there are, built in, adequate supplies of social housing to rent, not just shared equity properties, about which something has already been said. It should be understood that there is an economic factor. We need a good housing mix in the new communities that are being built.</p>
	<p pid="c.91.1/5">I hope that the brevity of my remarks will not be taken to reflect my view of the severity of the problems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.101.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1471" speakername="Chris McCafferty" colnum="101"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0076.htm#06051065000543">
	<p pid="c.101.3/1">I requested this debate because I am concerned that the Government's new proposals, part of the &quot;controlling our borders: making migration work for Britain&quot; programme, will have a devastating effect on migrant domestic workers, who make up one of the most vulnerable groups of workers in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/2">Unfortunately, I believe that the proposals will establish legal channels allowing migrant domestic workers to be brought into the UK for the purpose of exploitation. By removing even the most basic employment rights and leaving them powerless before abusive employers, they will effectively legalise trafficking, which I am certain the Government do not intend.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/3">In fact, the proposals are a complete reversal of the Government's previous policy, which was specifically intended to protect vulnerable workers. Migrant domestic workers are an exceptional category under immigration law. Since 1998, an employer has been able to apply for a migrant domestic worker to obtain a special visa. The rules of the visa allow the worker to change employer&mdash;a right that many other visa categories do not have. In order to qualify for the visa, migrant domestic workers must have been working with their employer for a minimum of one year outside the UK. When the employer applies for a tourist or a settlement visa, they can also apply for a migrant domestic worker visa for their employee. At present,80 per cent. of migrant domestic workers accompany tourists, and 20 per cent. accompany those with settlement visas. The law was introduced to encourage wealthy foreign nationals to come to the UK and help boost the UK economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/4">About 10,000 migrant domestic worker visas were issued in 2003-04. If, as proposed, the visa were curtailed and became a six-month, non-renewable, non-transferable visa, the impact would be devastating. Migrant domestic workers who enter the UK accompanying their employer can leave that employer if they are abused or exploited. That gives them vital protection against violence, mistreatment and exploitation. They receive basic protection under UK employment law, and they are entitled to the national minimum wage, statutory holiday pay and a notice period. As a worker, their visa is renewed annually, and renewal is dependent on the migrant domestic worker being in full-time employment as a domestic worker in a private household. There is also a right to apply for settlement and for family reunification.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/5">Those rights were won after 10 long years of organising and campaigning by migrant domestic workers themselves, with the support of the labour movement, trade unions and the British public. When the Labour Government came to power, they did not forget the commitment that they made in opposition, bringing migrant domestic workers out of the shadows of illegality and into the light.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/6">Unfortunately, although the regulations provide some protection, they do not mean that employers stop abusing their domestic workers. Kalayaan, an organisation that helps migrant domestic workers and campaigns on their behalf, has documented the abuse that occurs within the relationship between migrant domestic workers and their employers. Among 114 workers registered at Kalayaan, during the two sample months of August 2004 and August 2005, 75 per cent. reported psychological abuse; 34 per cent. reported physical abuse; over 57 per cent. did not have their own room and reported sleeping in public spaces, such as the living room, kitchen or hallway or shared rooms with children, ensuring that they were always, &quot;on call&quot;; and 40 per cent. reported having to sleep on the floor. Kalayaan registers approximately 400 migrant domestic workers per year who have left their employers because of abuse. That is obviously just the tip of the iceberg. Many are unaware of the organisation, or their rights, and are too scared to seek help.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/7">Under the current system, those workers have been able to escape abuse by leaving their original employer, provided they find employment of a similar nature and are able to maintain their immigration status as a domestic worker. The Home Office paper on the points-based migration system, as it was presented to Parliament in March, does not include migrant domestic workers. However, the draft proposals presented to Kalayaan by the immigration and nationality directorate show that it will restrict domestic workers accompanying their employer to a maximum of six months, with no right to change employer and no route to settlement.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/8">The proposals raise the most serious concerns. First, they will effectively legalise trafficking. If these proposals come into force, migrant domestic workers will be outside the managed migration system. Instead, they will come to the UK as business visitors, tied to their employer for a maximum of six months. They will have no option to change employer during this time, or to renew their visa, which will make it virtually impossible to challenge any maltreatment or abuse. Indeed, it may encourage it. That is in direct contravention of the Home Office's stated policy to protect victims of trafficking, and to stop trafficking &quot;at source&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/9">Secondly, the proposals will lead to an increase in abuse and illegality. Taking away the provision to renew their visa or to change employers, as well as making the employer responsible&mdash;which it would&mdash;for ensuring that migrant domestic workers leave the UK at the end of their stay, will dramatically increase the power that the employer has over the worker. That will inevitably lead to increased levels of abuse and more migrant domestic workers will be forced underground where they will be further exploited by employers taking advantage of their irregular status.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/10">Finally, the proposals will remove full access to employment law. Despite the immigration and nationality directorate stating that migrant domestic workers will be recognised as workers under the new scheme, it cannot be possible in practice to access UK employment law within the six months allowed, without the right to find alternative employment. As soon as a migrant domestic workers leave an employer, they will be homeless and destitute with no right to support themselves in work. As I understand it, there is a belief in the Home Office that employers settling in the UK will probably keep their migrant domestic worker for six months until they find a new one in the UK. They will then send the migrant domestic worker back home. Whether they are sent back to the employer's country or their own is not yet clear.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/11">Many employers hold their workers' passports illegally. Last year, I introduced a Bill that would have made the retention of another person's passport illegal. It is not yet illegal here, and employers often hold their workers' passports. There is a danger that migrant domestic workers will not be sent home but will be held here, completely illegally, for much longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/12">Six months is not an effective time to mount a challenge under employment law if an employer is abusing staff. I am aware that the Home Office is seeking to identify abusive employers at the port of entry, which is excellent. However, migrant domestic workers have revealed in confidence to workers at Kalayaan that they are trained to answer such questions at United Kingdom embassies.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/13">Changes to the migrant domestic worker visa mean that employees would be completely tied to the employer. Many employers already believe that they have ownership of their staff, and withhold their passports or keep them locked away in their houses. Many migrant domestic workers are terrified when they seek help from Kalayaan or other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/14">Employers often tell such workers that they will be illegal if they leave their employer, that they will be deported, and that immigration will seek them out. Unfortunately, if the migrant domestic worker visa is not continued, that may well become true, and trafficking in such workers will effectively have been legitimised, leaving employers in complete control.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/15">In my experience, migrant domestic workers are among the most conservative groups of people one could ever meet. They want to do things correctly, to pay their taxes and to live within the rules. They are not scroungers. This ill-conceived policy will have a devastating impact if it is enacted as it stands.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/16">I fully accept that managed migration is in the interests of the UK and I support the Government's policy of delivering a system that they describe as firm but fair, simpler, more transparent and more rigorous&mdash;a system that will benefit our economy and protect our borders. However, over the generations migrant workers have enriched the UK both economically and culturally. We need to ensure that the UK economy can safely continue to benefit from the input of migrant workers, and that they can live here safely.</p>
	<p pid="c.101.3/17">The fact is that the abuse or exploitation of migrant workers, who have every right to live and work here, continues apace at the hands of unscrupulous employers. A major challenge for the Government is to ensure that those vulnerable workers receive the full protection of our employment law. I therefore request that the Government review their own evidence&mdash;evidence that resulted in changes to the existing immigration law in 1998&mdash;in order to afford protection to migrant domestic workers. As a minimum, the existing provisions that protect the human rights of that marginalised and vulnerable category of workers must be maintained.</p>

	<p pid="c.108.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the subject of cancer services in south Essex, which is a subject that I have been working on over <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">the past few months with my hon. Friends the Members for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase>, for Castle Point (Bob Spink) and for Rayleigh (Mr. Francois), co-ordinating some of the activity in south Essex on our collective behalf.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/2">I am acutely aware that cancer is an emotive subject, with one in three people directly affected by it and virtually all of us indirectly affected. It was with some trepidation that I began to engage with the subject matter locally, but the bottom line is that, without being sensationalist, I genuinely believe that there will be a materially worse service in south Essex as a result of the changes that are taking place.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/3">Those changes are the merger of the South Essex cancer network with the Mid Anglia network. I shall give a bit of the history of what has been happening. As far back as the mid-1980s, there was a threat of merger, which disappeared following a local campaign. The Calman Hine report in 1995 rightly suggested introducing cancer networks, and a year later the South Essex cancer network was created. In 2001-02, the network came under threat and mergers were proposed across the whole of Essex. There was a lot of local debate, and a large campaign was run by the <i>Southend Echo</i> and a number of colleagues who were in the House at the time to keep hands off the cancer network and to leave it as it was.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/4">This morning, I was reading the papers from back then and Mike Richards, the cancer tsar, said that he could barely come to the House of Commons without someone mentioning Southend to him. He kindly agreed to come down to Southend and decided that it was right for south Essex and for cancer patients that the merger did not go ahead at that point. More recently, in December 2005, the strategic health authority started a consultation, which although it was extensive was fundamentally flawed and a bit of a sham. I will explain the distinction later and go into the consultation process in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/5">In terms of parliamentary activity, we have been doing an awful lot. We spoke in the Opposition day debate on cancer, have met the strategic health authority a number of times and a petition has gained about 5,000 signatures. Collectively and individually, we have made formal consultation submissions to the SHA and, of course, as one would expect, we have been corresponding with the main players and have visited the cancer centre a number of times. Unfortunately, on <phrase class="date" code="">29 March</phrase> the SHA decided to press ahead with the change. Since then I have tabled a number of written questions and written to the Secretary of State. The Minister was kind enough to reply to those, and I shall go into those matters on which I was disappointed by the lack of detail in the reply and those on which I was looking to tease out whether the merger will be good for patients. The case has certainly not been proved and, on balance, would be adverse at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/6">In summary, the South Essex cancer network was created 10 years ago. I hope that the Minister will consider not effectively abolishing it through merger. The network covers a population of approximately 730,000 and the main hospitals of Southend and Basildon. In many ways, the merger has been brought about because of activities outside south Essex, specifically the decision by Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire to pull Ipswich out of the Mid Anglia network to the north. Crucially, the South Essex network had no involvement in that decision but was fundamentally affected by the knock-on effect.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/7">The South Essex and Mid Anglia networks are two of the three smallest cancer networks in the United Kingdom. I wrote to the Minister asking for details of the population size, but I could not get definitive figures, so perhaps she can correct me and give some figures on the smaller cancer networks.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/8">I want to prove, first, that there was no need for change, secondly, that one size does not fit all, in terms of cancer network sizes, and, thirdly, that the consultation was fundamentally flawed and that the decision had been taken well before the start of the consultation. I also have a number of questions that I hope that the Minister will answer either today or in writing, as she considers appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/9">There are things that I shall not touch on. Essex cancer services is a broad subject, and I shall focus primarily on the network and the merger. I shall not talk in detail about changes to upper gastrointestinal, urological and head and neck cancer services, although other Members may want to contribute on those subjects in more detail, as they are not uncontroversial. However, very few people are affected by those cancers, and the big issue for me is the network overall, rather than the merger of services for those specific cancers.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh, when introducing me to the subject, summarised the whole issue by saying, &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; That is probably a fair reflection of the overall feeling in south Essex. The cancer network is doing a fantastic job. In fact, it is one of the leading cancer networks in the United Kingdom, and I would like to pay particular tribute to the lead clinician, Dr. Colin Trask, and the lead manager, Kevin McKenny, who I am sure will read the report of the debate with great interest. The service has a fantastic reputation not only locally, but among its peers. I could quote a whole series of barometer statistics about cancer care, but suffice it to say that statistically it does an excellent job.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/11">At the moment, most of the cancer care network, and most transport communications, in Essex go east-west, not north-south, because when people are treated in Essex and are looking for specialist services, they look to London. There are no significant patient flows north-south or south-north, so the merger is inappropriate, given the movement of people.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/12">Early on, our campaign talked about saving the cancer centre. A few people have called us sensationalist. It is true that the cancer centre will not close tomorrow, next week, next month or even next year, but I feel that this is a case of death by a thousand cuts. A salami-slice approach is being taken to reducing things&mdash;a little bit is taken off here, and a little bit is taken off there. There will be a reduction until a critical mass is reached, which will mean that Southend cancer centre will not be able to attract the excellent clinicians that it does at the moment and maintain its excellent reputation.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/13">Also, we are told that the change is purely administrative. If it is purely an administrative matter, then given that there is so much public opinion against the change in south Essex, and given that we are talking about only 20 or 30 people in terms of gastrointestinal cases, why press ahead with it? I have a sinister suspicion that the change is not purely administrative, but is a stepping stone to other changes, and I seek the Minister's reassurance that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/14">I need to be careful when talking about the Mid Anglia cancer network, because clearly we south Essex MPs are proud of our services, but perhaps I could quote what other people have said, rather than making a judgment on the network myself. Some people have told me that the Mid Anglia network is unstable at the moment, and others say that there are lots of problems with Ipswich having left. I recognise that there may be benefits for Mid Anglia in the merger, but there are certainly no benefits for my residents in Rochford and Southend, East, or for constituents generally across south Essex. Perhaps the strategic health authority is formulating an equation for the greater good of the residents of Essex, but the equation does not work for me. South Essex loses a little and Mid Anglia gains a lot. That may work overall, but it does not work for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/15">There is a feeling that bigger is better, but I am not sure that that is right when it comes to cancer networks. It seems from speaking to some patient groups and GPs that the opposite might be true and that some cancer centres may be too large. One of the greatest challenges is to identify cancer early at GP level and to refer patients to the correct person for a proper diagnosis. A closer relationship between the cancer networks and individual GP practices would be more easily facilitated if the networks were slightly smaller. I am suggesting not a radical change, but a change in direction, and it may be better to keep them as they are or to reduce them slightly.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/16">The cancer centre made the point that it is already working across boundaries in some cases and sharing best practice. I shall go into more detail about how one size does not fit all. I mentioned the 1995 Calman Hine report. It is 10 years old but is still relevant and still resonates. I want to draw attention to some quotes from the report. The first is about the size of the population and states:</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/17" class="indent">&quot;The size of a population served by a Cancer Unit cannot be inflexibly defined but will be determined by the number of cases of each cancer type being seen there&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/18">It is critical that a network is based on the number of cancer incidents rather than the population. South Essex has pockets of deprivation with, sadly, a higher incidence of cancer and demographically it has a much older population. Those were the two reasons given by the Government's cancer tzar for not going ahead with the decision to merge the network in 2002. Those reasons remain true today.</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/19">Secondly, the report states:</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/20" class="indent">&quot;Decisions will have to be taken forward in the light of local circumstances and take account of the views of patients&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/21">patients do not want this&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/22" class="indent">&quot;and their carers as well as the professionals involved in providing care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/23">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/24" class="indent">&quot;The Group recognise that the development of the ideal pattern of service should build upon existing patterns of referral and care and should take account of geographical constraints.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.108.1/25">That is the opposite of what is happening. There are no existing patterns of referral north and south and there are transport constraints. It is normally quite difficult to travel around south Essex and people who need cancer care do not want to be stuck in traffic for hours before receiving important treatment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.111.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" speakername="James Duddridge" colnum="111"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0077.htm#06051065000549">
	<p pid="c.111.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for raising that. He has been involved in the matter for a considerable period, more so than I have. I completely agree that the 1 million figure is largely arbitrary and inappropriate for the South Essex cancer network. It does not take account of the local situation.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/2">I explained why I found one of the replies to a written question unhelpful. I was trying to probe whether there was a statistical correlation between the size of the cancer network, the number of treatments and the success rate. I also asked the Secretary of State for the population catchment size for each cancer network in England and the Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The Department does not hold the population catchment size for each cancer network. However, a typical cancer network services a population of around one to two million.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-18">18 April 2006</phrase>; Vol. 445, c. 385W.]</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/4">That statistic perhaps went into the first column of some form of analysis. The second column would have been the actual cancers identified each year. Around 3,500 cancers are identified in the South Essex cancer network. The following column would be an indicator of the success of those units&mdash;for example, long-term survival rates. I appreciate that that is a much harder figure to obtain, but nevertheless it is important. I seek the Minister's guidance on the exact measure that she could take within the Department.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/5">The final column would be the statistical correlation between those first three numbers. Nowhere in my discussions, the circulated paperwork or the responses to my questions have I seen that statistical analysis for the cancer network. Following a meeting, the medical director of the strategic health authority kindly provided details for the three specific cancers, and although I cannot engage in the detail of the medical situation, there seemed to be a case that bigger might be better. However, no one has tried to prove, in anything that has been provided to us, that bigger is better for cancer networks, and many of us have been extensively involved in this subject for the past few months, and some of us for much longer.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/6">I am concerned that this is d&eacute;j&agrave; vu in respect of 2001-02. I feel embarrassed that back then, before I was an MP, colleagues were successful and that I do not seem to be getting a very good deal for my constituents. I worry about that, and I ask the Minister to give me a ray of hope, or at least an explanation. I do not want the cancer network 10-year birthday to be celebrated with effective abolition by merger.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/7">To call the consultation a sham would perhaps be unprofessional, and such language might be unparliamentary. I use those words in anger, because I was very upset by the way I was treated, not individually but as an MP&mdash;as a statutory consultee&mdash;and, more importantly, by the way all the patient groups were treated. There was overwhelming opposition, which I think is best summarised by the people at the front line who are running the network.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/8">The South Essex cancer network did not support the SHA's proposals to merge. It gave a number of reasons why: there</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/9" class="indent">&quot;is no demonstrable patient benefit&quot;;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/10">there is a great risk of losing the clinical cohesiveness and ownership that exists in south Essex; patient flows should determine network configurations, and there are virtually no patient flows from south to north or vice versa; current network arrangements meet national peer review measures already; the restructuring of cancer networks is not required to meet national cancer site-specific guidance, with south Essex plans already either approved or well advanced; the south Essex network currently has arrangements that are working perfectly well; and the merger will produce only marginal cost savings. Finally, the cancer network pinpoints a distinct lack of clarity about the future of the Mid Anglia cancer network based on current arrangements. Therefore, there is strong opposition from the people who actually run the network.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/11">Other key authorities also opposed the merger. The two primary care trusts within my constituency&mdash;Castle Point and Rochford PCT and Southend PCT&mdash;did so. The two local authorities in my area wrote to ask me to raise the matter. They did not just send in a consultation; they passed council motions saying that they did not want it, because it was bad for constituents. That view came from both Southend and Rochford. Patients' groups have also come to me both formally and informally and said that they oppose the merger.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/12">As I am an inexperienced MP, the petition that we put together was my first one. I sent it to a number of doctors' surgeries&mdash;about 20&mdash;as well as to a number of pharmacies in my area, because I thought that that would be a way of demonstrating the size of support to the Government. I am not sure what level of support I thought would be successful, but I was thinking in terms of a couple of hundred names, and that if there were more than 1,000 I would be celebrating. However, 5,000 people responded. There is a massive amount of local support and concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/13">I wrote to the Secretary of State. The Minister was kind enough to reply, saying that the merger was a local matter, that the Secretary of State would not intervene, and that I should raise any concerns with Essex SHA. In many ways I agree; it is a local matter, but I do not consider the SHA to be local. To me, local is Southend, Rochford and the wider cancer network. I find the strategic health authority somewhat out of touch in that regard, and in regard to other matters as well. I hesitate to go into more detail, but I do not think that it has a role as things progress. It certainly does not add value for my constituents. I want more people on the front line. However, I apologise, Mr. Atkinson, for going slightly off on a tangent, and I shall return to the subject of cancer.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/14">The Minister has a role. When the Government's cancer tsar last came to Southend and examined the problem it paid dividends. I do not demand, or even ask, that the Minister should come to Southend, although it would be very welcome. I am more concerned that she should review the matter. <i>[Interruption.]</i> My hon. Friends are asking whether she will come; she would be more than welcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/15">What I said about the consultation being a sham involves a key point. When Ipswich left the Mid Anglia cancer network, the writing was on the wall. It was always going to be difficult to justify maintaining two smaller networks, if, indeed, it was Government policy and advice that 1 million-plus should be the population number. That has produced upwards leverage.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/16">Following the Minister's letter, I telephoned the strategic health authority to check that it had not been missed the letter in the post in early May, prior to the debate, and it kindly faxed its response to me this morning. In fairness, its representatives are disappointed that I consider the consultation to have been a sham, but not nearly as disappointed as I feel about the whole consultation process.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/17">I am not criticising a lack of activity in the consultation; there was lots of activity and lots of money was spent on it. However, I believe that the decision was taken well before the consultation. Several more seasoned&mdash;perhaps one could say more cynical&mdash;colleagues told me not to bother to get involved. They said, &quot;We see this time and again; consultations take place but the decision has already been taken.&quot; Furthermore, in the health sector locally there is some consultation overload. I was considering five or six NHS consultations in south Essex in January, so things are quite difficult. Also, in each case the questions being considered were mergers, and getting bigger. I cannot help thinking that there is an underlying philosophy that bigger is better, but I do not think that that is right. Both on the specific cancer issue and on other things, bigger may be considerably worse. We should reduce the size of some of our operating units.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/18">I said that I would try to include some questions to make it clear what I want to achieve in raising the debate. The best thing would be for the Minister to say, &quot;Ah, yes, there has been a terrible mistake and we shall sort it out.&quot; I do not imagine in my wildest imagination that that will happen, but a ray of hope for my constituents would be most appreciated. I should like to find out more about why change is needed. I think that I have demonstrated that the cost benefits will be marginal, that there are no demonstrable patient benefits and there will be much administrative disruption, and that there is much opposition.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/19">I should be interested to know more about the 1 million figure and why there is no flexibility, when the cancer tsar showed flexibility in 2001-02. Has there been a policy change since then, or has more information, of which I am not aware, become available? As to the tabular information, I do not ask the Minister to provide anything in that exact format. However, something a little more solid statistically, which correlates population numbers, cancer incidence and survival rates would be helpful to enable us to go forward. If the Minister is right that bigger is better, why should the figure be 2 million? Perhaps it should be 4 million? We need a strong evidence base to enable us to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/20">I hesitated before putting my questions, because the issue that they raise is, &quot;What if the merger does go ahead?&quot; I should like the Minister to confirm that what is happening is 100 per cent. about administration. The South Essex cancer network and the doctors in Southend would like a promise that there will be no patient movements south to north or north to south, other than in the three specialist cancer centres, without consultation.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/21">I should also like more information about the consultation. I talked about the cancer centre suffering death by 1,000 cuts, and one concern is that smaller changes will happen below the radar, and without the involvement of local community leaders and community groups, once we are part of a bigger cancer network.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/22">Macmillan Cancer Relief raised the problem of the travel costs that would be involved should patient flows be significant. Bus routes are poor, and there are virtually no rail routes north and south&mdash;certainly not from my part of south Essex. The charity is concerned about the extra costs, and that is a valid concern, although time is also a great worry.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/23">I said that I would not talk in detail about upper GI, but I have had several letters from people in Basildon asking why there is no options appraisal for upper GI in Basildon. I simply throw that issue out to the Minister, and she might want to comment on it. That might be helpful for members of public in that part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.1/24">In summary, the merger of the South Essex and Mid Anglia cancer networks is opposed locally and represents a threat to the longer-term future of the Southend cancer centre. The case for the merger is weak at best and fundamentally flawed at worst.</p>

	<p pid="c.117.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on making a very measured, well thought out contribution and on leading the drive to save the cancer centre in south Essex. He has done a wonderful job and shown that he has a lot of energy. Whether or not he is successful is no measure of his abilities and potential in this place.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/2">I declare an interest: my son is a neurosurgeon who practises in London, and often in south Essex, treating cancers and such like, and he will do so in the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/3">South Essex cancer service is an excellent clinical network. I am a Conservative because I believe in cherishing what is good. That is why I am speaking in the debate and supporting my hon. Friend. At the start of the process, the question should have been, will merging South Essex cancer network with Mid Anglia cancer network help or hinder the continued improvement that we have seen in the South Essex service? For me as an MP, the question was, what will it mean for the people of Castle Point, whom I have a duty to represent, and for my area of south Essex? This is not mindless nimbyism. I have a duty to look after the interests of my constituents, and if I do not no one else will. That is why they send me to this place. I therefore hope that the Minister will forgive me if I speak from the viewpoint of south Essex, rather than the overall viewpoint. It is her duty to look after that, and I know she does so carefully.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/4">What is wrong with our cancer service that requires it to be merged with Mid Anglia and what benefits will we get in return for the merger? What benefits will we get to match the costs and risks of that change? Let me set out some facts about what we are achieving in south Essex. Merging with the relatively not-so-high-achieving Mid Anglia will, some claim, weaken the South Essex cancer network and the service that it is able to provide for our constituents. Merging will certainly disrupt its excellent progress, although I accept that Mid Anglia has many good points and I am sure that excellent staff work in that service, too. I would not in any way bad-mouth them. It must be said, however, that South Essex is reputed to be one of the best services in the country, notwithstanding its smaller size. In fact, its success might be a result of its size; we certainly have no evidence to convince us otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/5">There are excellent staff at all levels at South Essex, and I pay tribute to them. They are hard working, dedicated, professional and very caring people, as I am sure the staff are at Mid Anglia cancer network.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/6">South Essex is meeting national targets for screening, particularly for breast cancer and cervical cancer,as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1829" name="David Amess">my hon. Friend the Member for Southend, West (Mr. Amess)</phrase>, whose speech I am delighted to follow, pointed out. However, we need dramatically to improve our screening in those areas and to continue to make advances. We are cutting waiting times from diagnosis to treatment, which is one of the most important factors in achieving successful outcomes. We need to make dramatic improvements, and we are doing that in south Essex, but those improvements might be jeopardised by the change and disruption of the merger.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/7">Our patient outcomes are improving and are now much better than those in many cancer centres in the UK; they are said to be better than those in the mid-Anglia area. We have extremely good financial controls, management and peer reviews, and, added to all that, the convenience of access to a local service. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East pointed out, at length, the natural flow of movement in the health economy, which is east to west&mdash;certainly not north to south. There are good reasons for that, not least the infrastructure and the difficulty that people have travelling north to south.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/8">Those who were consulted in my area said that the merger plan was against the best interests of patients in south Essex and the excellent staff who work in that area. It certainly lacks clarity of purpose and any detail about defined, discernible, demonstrable benefits, or even a set of properly laid-out costs. It also lacks any schedule as to how those changes are to be achieved, and detail on what the timing and costs will be. I shall return to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/9">If we put all those considerations together, we see why the objection to the merger was both hostile and comprehensive, certainly in south Essex, if not the north of the county. The objectors included most of the relevant bodies of opinion, including the south Essex MPs&mdash;we have ample evidence of their interest this afternoon. Many excellent councillors and good councils supported our stand on this, as did the hospitals, patient groups, South Essex cancer network and, probably most importantly, the public. Their support is demonstrated in the petitions. Unlike my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East, that was not my first petition. The media certainly support our side of the argument on behalf of the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/10">The anecdotal evidence confirms that the public are very much on our side. I spoke to around 1,000 people&mdash;some of whom I questioned and some of whom questioned me on this matter&mdash;in the run-up to the recent local elections, and they opposed the merger almost to a person. We have massive evidence that the groups that should have been and were consulted strongly oppose the merger. I hope that if we are to push forward with the change&mdash;if it is going to happen anyway&mdash;we are all proved wrong, but I do not have any evidence to support that.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/11">I see that the Minister is listening carefully. In a nutshell, it seems that the merger will bring disadvantages, disruption and little demonstrable benefit. It brings unquantified risk without proper weighing of the costs and could set back the steady improvements that we have been achieving in the South Essex cancer network. I accept that it could accelerate improvements in the north, but that is not what I am here to talk about. I am here to represent my constituents, and the Minister is perfectly aware of that.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/12">If the merger is not handled well, it could impede the plans of South Essex and progress on treatments and outcomes, cutting cancer waiting times, delivery on top targets, improving patient information and care, and improving services to the community. It might also affect links with primary care networks, our excellent local GPs and the wonderful Macmillan nurse network in south Essex, to which we all pay tribute.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/13">The Government and the SHA have failed to make any coherent or decisive case for the merger, certainly to the public. That is largely due to the consultation period of three months&mdash;I believe that it ended on <phrase class="date" code="">13 March</phrase>&mdash;which was said by some to be a sham. I am a moderate man in my language, so one would not expect me to make that claim. The public were angry about the consultation. They felt that they had been steamrollered by the strategic health authority towards a decision that had already been taken, and that there was an element of deceit and pretence in the consultation. In some ways, I feel sorry for the SHA, because it tried to proceed professionally and comprehensively. I do not bad-mouth the SHA, but I heavily deprecate the Government. The SHA was unfortunate, because its consultation was judged against the backdrop of the recent consultation on the police mergers, which was a sham. I say that even though I am careful with my language.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/14">There was evidence that views were not properly considered but simply cast aside. It is easy for us in the south, who were against the merger, to say that and to ignore those in the north, whose views are obviously valid as well. The Minister has to make a balanced decision on that, and will do. In any event, the consultation document was claimed to be a shambles. A powerful letter from the patient and public involvement in health forum for Basildon and Thurrock hospitals, addressed to the Secretary of State and dated <phrase class="date" code="">3 April</phrase>, states:</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/15" class="indent">&quot;We made it very clear to the SHA that we had concerns that the documentation was not fair, honest, and was biased towards Bloomfield Hospital Chelmsford&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/16">The words</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/17" class="indent">&quot;not fair, honest, and biased&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/18">were underlined.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/19">The results of the consultation&mdash;although not clear, at least as far as the south was concerned&mdash;were taken by the SHA, which steamed ahead in the opposite direction. It made few arguments, to me anyway, for the benefits of change to the south and gave me little in the way of estimates of costs. Those are not just the financial costs, but the human costs, the operational costs and the costs in terms of patient outcomes. The problem for the SHA is that the Government have stopped listening to the people and the people perceive that. The SHA is judged against that backdrop and in the shadow the mistrust that the public hold for public bodies. However, that is not the fault of the SHA; I lay the blame for that at the Government's door.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/20">The merger proposal looks very much like part of the Government's now not-so-secret regionalisation agenda, which is hitting local democracy and removing local accountability. Their agenda covers things as diverse as police, planning, health, economic development and so much else. It is a Big Brother agenda, the people have tumbled it and action will be taken at the polls to reverse it.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/21">Experience shows that such mergers typically cost much more than was anticipated at the outset. They typically fail to deliver the anticipated benefits or results&mdash;not that I see net benefits for my constituents from the merger in any event. Such mergers disrupt and set back progress towards important delivery improvement targets. The plan must be carefully controlled if it goes ahead and we should ensure that we achieve the targets that we set out to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/22">The Government seem to be obsessed with reorganisation for its own sake. Yet again, we see them shuffling the deckchairs on the NHS deck. They should focus on tackling improvements, such as removing postcode prescribing and making better treatments and drugs available&mdash;for example, temozolomide and Gliadel implants for brain cancers and Herceptin for certain stages of breast cancer&mdash;as well as spreading the good practice that we see in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="c.117.0/23">I ask the Minister to rethink the proposal, even at this late stage. It is never too late to accept that the case for merger has not been made, as it certainly has not in this example.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.122.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1443" speakername="Brooks Newmark" colnum="122"  time="015:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0078.htm#06051065000553">
	<p pid="c.122.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on securing the debate. It covers cancer services in Essex, as well as the proposed change. During the Opposition day debate on cancer services, the Health Secretary said that the decision on the future of cancer networks in Essex would be made locally. The emphasis on &quot;locally&quot; is what interests me. Do not my hon. Friends agree that the reason for the proposed change is the imposition of national requirements? One of the biggest challenges faced by my primary care trust in Braintree is the interference of central Government, often in the provision of services that really matter to my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/2">Witham, Braintree and Halstead primary care trust has received a five-star rating for vital cancer services such as cervical screening. However, it received that rating for the local services that it provides, not because of national impositions. It is not only acute and specialised services that are important in effective treatment of cancer; the early detection and easy access to primary services are essential, too. That is why I emphasise that localism and local services are important.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/3">Although the consultation said that the amalgamation would affect only a small number of complex surgical cases, what guarantees do we have that routine services will not be compromised by the proposed changes? Now that the Minister is in front of me, I should like to make a quick aside. People in my constituency are battling to secure the future of a new community hospital in Braintree, yet the Government still make strategic changes a priority over the improvement of basic local services. My constituents want a community hospital, they have been promised one by the Government, and they are still waiting for the Government to support that.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/4">My genuine concern is about meeting local needs. In a press release, I read with interest that the strategic health authority on <phrase class="date" code="">29 March</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The board of Essex strategic health authority today agreed a recommendation to create a new cancer network&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/6">about which we heard earlier&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/7" class="indent">&quot;covering south-east, south-west, mid and north-east Essex. It was one of four key decisions about cancer services made by board members&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/8">The press release continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Speaking after the meeting, Dr. Paul Watson&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/10" class="indent">the strategic health authority medical director&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/11" class="indent">said: 'The main aim in making these decisions is to ensure that Essex cancer patients have access to high quality services that meet national requirements'&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/12">not local requirements. Local people want local services to meet local requirements. They do not want a national diktat.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/13">I share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1409" name="John Baron">the concern of my hon. Friend the Member for Billericay (Mr. Baron)</phrase>, who has said that cancer survival rates in this country are worse than those in Albania. That is a shocking statistic. While we must acknowledge that more people are being diagnosed with cancer, waiting times for surgery and radiotherapy have been getting longer. That is of tremendous concern to me. How will the merger improve survival rates, diagnosis and early detection? Any restructuring should ideally be about such things.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/14">I have always been supportive of the Schumpeter principle that small is beautiful. On the proposed merger of the cancer networks that co-ordinate treatment in south Essex and mid-Anglia, my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East has said:</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/15" class="indent">&quot;It is important that south Essex keeps its cancer network as it is.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/16">I agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="c.122.0/17">Our shadow Health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">my hon. Friend the Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, said that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East has made a cogent case on behalf of south Essex MPs about the cancer network and the appropriate size of the South Essex cancer care centre, considering local conditions. He added that he hoped that people at both national and local decision-making levels have taken due account of that strong and well made case. In that context, I find it difficult to understand why the Government are pursuing a merger that is unpopular, unnecessary and likely to be ineffective in meeting local patients' needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.126.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> on introducing the debate, on the comprehensive, thorough and incisive way in which he introduced it, and on his campaign to prevent the merger of the South Essex and Mid Anglia cancer networks. I also commend him for his excellent and heartfelt contribution. I hope that the Minister takes the time&mdash;I shall ensure that she has the time&mdash;to answer the points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/2">We know that cancer networks have played an important role in developing cancer services since their inception 10 years ago, following the Calman Hine report commissioned by the last Conservative Administration. The proposed merger is important, as it would create a new organisation covering a population of approximately 1.4 million. I am sure that the Minister is aware of that. Although such a change relates primarily to the management and administrative arrangements for planning cancer services, I hope that from the heartfelt contributions to this debate that she appreciates the real concern that the needs of south Essex will be overlooked by a larger and more remote network. She should not take that concern lightly.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/3">In Essex as a whole we have had a spate of reorganisations of services, including those relating to PCTs, SHAs, the ambulance service and cancer networks. The common theme seems to have been a desire to create ever-larger, more regional organisations. The concern for many people, as expressed in the debate, is that those structures will become more remote and less responsive to the needs of local residents. I do not believe that that concern is fully appreciated by those making such decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/4">In my constituency, for example, people were particularly vexed about the proposal to scrap Essex police and our local PCTs, and we campaigned accordingly. Given the importance of Southend hospital to the structure of the South Essex cancer network, my hon. Friends are rightly continuing to raise their concerns about the cancer reorganisation. They have made the case against the merger in detail, but I want to highlight one or two points in the hope that they will be addressed by the Minister when she winds up.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/5">Will the Minister explain why a merger of cancer networks is so vital in the east of England at this time? As she heard from almost every contribution, South Essex cancer network has a good reputation&mdash;an excellent reputation, in fact&mdash;for planning and commissioning cancer services. Naturally, there is confusion about why arrangements are now being thrown up in the air. If the argument is about population size and the need for networks to correspond to areas of between about 1 million and2 million people, what does the Minister make of the point&mdash;made on several occasions&mdash;that was conceded by the cancer tsar Mike Richards four years ago when he said that due to its age profile and areas of relative deprivation, the cancer case load in south Essex at least makes up for the shortfall in population?</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/6">During the past four years, the population in south Essex has probably grown faster than most other areas, which raises the question of why we have to tinker with the current arrangement at all when it works so well. If the Minister has formed a different opinion, perhaps she could explain to us on what evidence she has done so because it is not clear to my hon. Friends why that should be the case. They have made a powerful argument to keep things as they are.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/7">What is more, the small population of the Mid Anglia cancer network seems to have been brought about by the withdrawal of Ipswich, a decision taken by Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire SHA. It seems somewhat unfair, to put it mildly, that south Essex should effectively lose its cancer network on account of a decision taken by a different health authority, a point made by several of my hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/8">Another concern is that current patient flows do not argue in favour of an enlarged network. Consultants in south Essex are not in the habit of referring patients to centres further afield, and I have seen no evidence of any sudden, recent, increased desire to do so. It simply does not exist. In those cases where patients will have to travel further for treatment as a result of the merger, what financial assistance is the Government going to provide for their travel costs, given that cancer treatment often involves a number of visits to hospitals or other centres? The point has been raised before, but the Minister would do well to dwell on it because, in some cases, we are talking about quite increased distances of travel. That should receive urgent consideration.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/9">There is naturally a degree of confusion about the motivation for the change. It appears that the SHA is putting a desire for administrative neatness, and reorganisation for reorganisation's sake, over and above the concerns of local people. I would reiterate one point to the Minister. The consultation on the merger appears to have been inadequate, lasting only a few months and ignoring strong opposition from my hon. Friends, councillors, hospitals and many residents, including the 5,000 who signed the petition. To many, it appears to have been a sham, designed to give a veneer of credibility to a decision that had already been made, without reference to people's concerns. That comes on top of many other consultations, such as those on primary care trusts, strategic health authorities and police reorganisations, which have led to a growing view that people's concerns are not addressed.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.1/1">I am glad to have secured this debate on an important matter, especially as the Identity Cards Bill received Royal Assent on <phrase class="date" code="">30 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/2">ID cards are a controversial topic. The Government were defeated five times in the other place before the legislation finally passed after the Government's concession to delay the scheme until 2009. Public support for ID cards is falling sharply, from about80 per cent. in 2003 to just under 50 per cent. today.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/3">The public are concerned about the introduction of identity cards for many reasons. There are real fears about the erosion of civil liberties and much confusion about what problem ID cards are suppose to solve. The suggestion that they will somehow prevent terrorism stands up to no scrutiny when the 9/11 and Madrid bombers held valid ID and the Home Office admitted that ID cards would have done nothing to prevent the<phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> bombings last year in London.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/4">Today I would like to focus on another cause of concern, which is the cost of the ID card scheme. The debate is set against the backdrop of a six-month countdown that started when the Bill received Royal Assent, and as each day passes until <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> we come closer to the date on which the Government will have to reveal to Parliament the estimated likely cost of the identity card scheme over the next 10 years. How that will work in practice with <phrase class="date" code="">30 September</phrase> falling on a Saturday during recess, I am yet to discover, but I am sure that many of my party colleagues are looking forward to receiving the report. It will hopefully contain more information about the cost of the scheme and with any luck we might get some information from the Minister today.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/5">Back in 2002 initial Government proposals suggested that an entitlement card scheme would cost &pound;1.3 billion over a period of 13 years, which would include the three years that it would take to set up the necessary systems and the 10 years in which the first cards would be valid. In November 2003, the then Home Secretary made a statement in the House in which he stated that the cost of an ID card would be &pound;35. That changed again and by April 2005 the Government estimated that the cost of an ID card would be &pound;15 with a fee of &pound;85 for a joint passport and ID card application. However, that figure changed once again after the Identity Cards Bill was introduced after the general election a year ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.131.1/6">The previous Minister, now Minister of State in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the Department of Health, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, stated in the Identity Cards Bill debate on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-13">13 February</phrase> that the cost of a stand-alone ID card would be &pound;30 and the cost of a biometric passport &pound;63, so the combined cost would be &pound;93. It could be argued that the number is only valid for the first year of the scheme, which will not be up and running until 2009.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.133.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="133"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0079.htm#06051065000568">
	<p pid="c.133.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for those comments. I will return later in my speech to the issue of the Government's handling of IT systems and their ability to deliver. I accept that there are many projects that taxpayers' money could be better spent on&mdash;regardless of whether the amount is &pound;3 billion or &pound;5 billion, or &pound;10 billion or &pound;19 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/2">For clarity, let me remind Members of the supposed aims of the ID card scheme according to the Home Office regulatory impact assessment which it published in November 2004: to reduce illegal migration and illegal working; to enhance the UK's capability to counter terrorism and serious and organised crime; to reduce identity fraud; and to implement a more efficient and effective delivery of public services. On all these points the Government are weak in both clarity and their hoped-for delivery. After last July, the terrorist attacks blew out of the water the suggestion that the counter-terrorism side of the card's purpose would be effective. The country is all too aware that a piece of plastic will not act as a deterrent or as a tool against terrorism. There is strong evidence that terrorists do not hide their identity. The release of the foreign national prisoners which unseated the former Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the right hon. Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, also suggests that an ID card scheme would not have helped. The problem was not the identity of most of the foreign prisoners; the immigration and nationality directorate and the Prison Service knew the identity of most of them. The problems arose because the two parts of the Home Office were not communicating with each other. That poses a lot of questions, and does not bode well for the national identity register.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/3">The Home Office's current estimate of the cost of introducing and implementing the biometric passport and ID card scheme is &pound;584 million each year for the next 10 years; the total cost of that is &pound;5.8 billion. However, that figure does not provide a true picture of the total cost of the ID card scheme. There are a variety of hidden costs in respect of ID cards.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/4">The Government have consistently refused to say how much the plans will cost other Departments, despite several parliamentary questions on this matter. I hope the Minister will enlighten us; if he is unable to do so, perhaps he will undertake to consult his ministerial colleagues in other Departments so that they can present to the House a realistic estimate of the overall cost to the Government of implementing the scheme, rather than simply the cost to the Home Office. If we do not have the full, total figures, it is impossible for the people and the taxpayers to make a realistic assessment of whether this is good value for money.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/5">Some of the hidden costs, other than the costs to other Departments, include the cost of designing the database, which, as I have said, the Government will not reveal. One would expect that it will be a complex and technologically sophisticated database, and security measures will need to be incredibly robust given the nature and the quantities of data that will be stored on the database. Therefore, this is unlikely to be a piece of software that comes cheaply. There is also the cost of the scanners and the readers. Many problems have been reported in trials with the accuracy of some of the reading equipment. That varies in terms of the different types of biometrics used. People with disabilities have reported problems with using some of the biometric readers; for such cases, more than one type of scanning equipment may be required at sites where the ID cards will be used.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/6">An individual card reader is estimated to cost about &pound;275, and a card and fingerprint reader about &pound;500. However, many people, such as manual labourers, cannot use the fingerprint reader with great accuracy because their fingers are often worn down. Facial scanners would cost &pound;750 and iris scanners, which are the most accurate, are very costly at &pound;3,500.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/7">The aims of the project were about delivering better public services, but if the costs I have mentioned are multiplied across the various Government Departments, hospitals and police stations up and down the country, they soon start to escalate, and the costs to other Departments should be borne in mind.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/8">I am also concerned that some of the costs of the scheme are being concealed in other budgets. A large part of the money being used for the scheme is said to be going only towards the upgrade of the UK Passport Service, as if all the biometric data were absolutely necessary for that. We must scotch that myth. Under international regulations, all the different forms of biometric data do not need to be stored on the cards. Yes, we have to have facial recognition, but fingerprinting and iris scanning are optional, not mandatory. No other country has as many biometric details stored in their ID cards or passport systems; this project is far more ambitious than the others, and the Government would do well to rethink it.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/9">We also have to consider the cost of replacing the cards. Currently, it is estimated that once every 10 years will be sufficient. However, biometric data diminish over time; people's appearance changes and as time passes, the scans&mdash;particularly those for facial recognition&mdash;become less accurate. The operator of the national fingerprint information system, Northrop Grumman, argues that cards may need to be replaced as often as every three years; even if it were necessary only every five years, that would significantly increase the cost of the scheme and increase the figure of&pound;584 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/10">Taking into account various of those factors, the London School of Economics report estimates the true cost to be anywhere between &pound;10.6 billion and&pound;19.2 billion. Even at the optimistic end of that range, the costs would be almost double those projected by the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/11">In assessing the costs of such a scheme, it is also important to compare them with any expected benefits. Given the Government's track record on IT projects, already mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2016" name="Mark Hunter">my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mark Hunter)</phrase>, such benefits may be dubious.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/12">Hong Kong has a widely praised ID card scheme. In the <i>Sunday Herald</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-28">28 November 2004</phrase>, the consultant responsible for implementing it said of the UK scheme:</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/13" class="indent">&quot;'Saying you're going to introduce a nationwide identity card is easy. Making it happen is a different matter...This would be the most ambitious IT project in UK history, an enormously complex system involving untried technologies, and success seems unlikely when you consider the public sector's abysmal track record in this area.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/14">For example, EDS was the company responsible for developing the tax credits database. I am sure that in the past few years, most Members have had contact with constituents who have been on the receiving end of that flawed system because of overpayments, underpayments or administrative failures. EDS has negotiated a &pound;71.25 million settlement with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs to compensate for the IT failures that have plagued the system since its inception. Yet that very company has been awarded another Government contract&mdash;to revamp Ministry of Defence systems. Unlike other contracts, which have been worth tens of millions of pounds, that contract is worth &pound;4 billion. I hope that the Minister will be able to assure me and the taxpayer, first, that the national identity register contract will not necessarily cost that much&mdash;an estimate of how much he thinks it will cost would be very much appreciated&mdash;and secondly, that careful consideration will take place before an IT contractor is chosen, particularly if a company such as EDS is placing a bid.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/15">The Home Office's own report shows that for other Government Departments to take up and benefit from the ID card scheme, there will need to be high levels of take-up. For example, the Department for Work and Pensions and Revenue and Customs are unlikely to get large benefits until 80 per cent. of the population are using the scheme. When does the Minister expect us to reach a level of 80 per cent. take-up with a voluntary scheme?</p>
	<p pid="c.133.0/16">In their manifesto, the Government said that they would introduce a voluntary scheme. We have had many debates on whether requiring people who have passports to have ID cards complies with the assertion that it is a voluntary scheme. I would argue that that represents a great degree of compulsion. I still believe that 80 per cent. is a fairly optimistic level to achieve in a short space of time. Although 80 per cent. of people have passports&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="c.144.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1732" name="Jessica Morden">my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East (Jessica Morden)</phrase> on securing this debate and on her excellent speech. It is encouraging to see such a high level of interest from all three major parties&mdash;that is not always the case in shorter Adjournment debates&mdash;and all hon. Members who have intervened have made important points.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/2">As my hon. Friend pointed out, we have just finished a major public consultation on the review of our waste strategy. In the renewed strategy, which we will publish later this year, the Government are determined to see an enhanced role for the community and voluntary sector. We have made considerable progress in recent years, which all hon. Members recognised, although it has been ra<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">ther patchy, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> pointed out. We have trebled the amount of municipal waste that we recycle or compost and we are on course to hit our targets. It is not every Department that can say that about all its targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/3">That is partly the result of the excellent work of local authorities, working in collaboration with the private sector and the community and voluntary sector. It is also the result of the work of our public, who are increasingly aware of the importance of sustainable waste management; that subject is rising up in the public consciousness. If people are asked in opinion polls, for example, whether they think it is important to recycle, about 90 per cent. say yes; but only about 45 to 50 per cent. recycle regularly. We must close that gap. As my hon. Friend pointed out, one of the best ways to do that is by providing a high-quality kerbside recycling service for the public.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/4">Those services have increased hugely in recent years and my hon. Friend has rightly&mdash;not just in this Adjournment debate but several times in DEFRA questions&mdash;drawn attention to the Wastesavers project in her constituency of Newport, which, as she says, is a beacon for the rest of the country. In partnership with the excellent local council and her constituents, it has achieved a tremendous increase in the percentage of recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/5">It is interesting that my hon. Friend used a slightly different figure from the one that I have heard cited previously for the cost per tonne achieved by Wastesavers in Newport. Getting the cost down so low is an incredible achievement. She will, I am sure, appreciate that part of the explanation is that the organisation is community-based and that some of those involved are volunteers. They work efficiently and well, but she is right to point out that there are wide variations in the costs not only of recycling and kerbside collection but of waste management by local authorities as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/6">My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that the Government are considering that issue, not just as part of the review of our waste strategy but as a result of the Gershon report in 2004, which identified potential for considerable savings in our waste management and collection systems. We should be interested in studying the experience of Wastesavers, which one of my officials has already visited. I should be delighted to take my hon. Friend up on her invitation; she can show me around. I am keen, in the months ahead, following the closing of the consultation yesterday, and before the publication of our renewed waste strategy, to examine best practice and ensure that we get the strategy right.</p>
	<p pid="c.144.0/7">We need to do that&mdash;my hon. Friend has, again, made the point well&mdash;because although we have made dramatic improvements in this country in recent years we have an awful long way to go. We still use landfill far too much. Landfill, as everyone recognises, is the least environmentally friendly way of managing our waste. We need to get our recycling and recovery levels up to those of continental Europe and our landfill levels down.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-05-10c.145.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1580" speakername="Ben Bradshaw" colnum="145"  time="016:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060510/halltext/60510h0081.htm#06051065000584">
	<p pid="c.145.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. It is depressing, when some local authorities are as good as Newport and are doing so well on recycling, that others, such as Bristol and Swindon, do so badly. There is no excuse for it, and my hon. Friends may want to take a stark warning back to their constituents and local authorities. Their constituents will pay the price for poor performance on recycling.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/2">As the landfill tax escalator hits in as one of the major financial incentives, council tax payers in Bristol and Swindon will pay the price for the poor performance of their local authorities. In recent years, the ratcheting up of the system has been made even more effective by the introduction of the landfill allowance trading scheme, which is rather like the emissions trading scheme, one of the mechanisms used to deal with climate change. Local authorities that perform badly can buy extra landfill allowance from other local authorities, but, again, that will involve a cost to council tax payers. It is not merely good for the environment to recycle, reuse and compost; it is, in the long run, also cheaper for council tax payers.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1455" name="Kerry McCarthy">My hon. Friend the Member for Bristol, East (Kerry McCarthy)</phrase> is right about the importance of community recycling network schemes. I know of the headquarters in her constituency, and in fact I met the chief executive, or whatever he calls himself, fairly recently. He has had some very constructive meetings with my officials to make sure that those schemes are not forgotten in our consideration of our new waste strategy.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, East, is absolutely right to point to the perverse incentives in our waste policy under the weight-based system. That system sometimes incentivises local authorities to collect heavy waste for recycling, because that boosts their recycling rates, and waste that is easy to collect. I shall give her a good example: hon. Members may have noticed that recently many local authorities have rapidly expanded their so-called green waste collections of garden waste. That has been a very easy way for local authorities to increase their recycling rates, but of course it is much easier for local authorities in leafy suburbs and rural areas to do that than it is for local authorities in some inner-city areas. There is a real problem with the incentives in the current weight-based system, and we are actively considering that as part of the waste review.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/5">My hon. Friend may also be interested to know that my officials are working with Wastesavers in her constituency to look into how it achieves what it does, and to get it to be an exemplar for other social and community-based recycling and waste management organisations across the country. That is because we want a lot more successful, social and community-based, voluntary-based organisations involved in how we manage our waste, for the very reason touched on by a number of hon. Members: we are not just talking about a sensible, efficient and environmentally friendly way of managing waste; the issue is also about getting community action and community spiritedness on the whole issue of managing waste.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/6">If people based in, and coming from, the community are running such organisations and providing the sort of opportunities to which my hon. Friend referred&mdash;opportunities for disadvantaged people, people coming out of prison who want to rehabilitate themselves, people with learning disabilities and so forth&mdash;that is a fantastic contribution that they can make. Also, people benefit enormously from the sort of work that that involves, and as my hon. Friend rightly says, it is often a stepping-stone by which they can re-enter the full-time employment market, so it is a virtuous circle.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/7">We would like enterprises such as Wastesavers in Newport to expand. There are examples of other bodies that have expanded and gone to other places, but my understanding is that Wastesavers is quite happy staying the size it is, and as a result it has agreed to share its business plan with anyone who is interested. My hon. Friend has already established herself in the House as a great ambassador for sustainable waste management and for Wastesavers in her constituency. May she go far afield, singing its praises and suggesting that people in other parts of the country talk to Wastesavers&mdash;a process that we will certainly encourage&mdash;to see whether they can replicate elsewhere its wonderful practices in Newport.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">The hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> is absolutely right to say that in the past there have been issues to do with prohibitive licence costs for composting and recycling organisations. Community composting organisations raised that with me very soon after I took on the waste brief, just under a year ago. They were worried that they would be put out of business by some of the new charges coming in. We shelved those charges, and over the past 12 months we have undertaken a review of them. I am confident that in the next few weeks we will come forward with a revised system that will benefit the sorts of recycling and composting organisations to which the hon. Gentleman referred, and that should be cheaper for the Environment Agency. I am absolutely determined not to put barriers in the way of those sorts of very sensible and effective community organisations.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/9">I should have said at the beginning of my speech that everything that I have said about visiting and so on is with the slight caveat that I remain the Minister responsible for such matters. Hon. Members will understand that DEFRA has become an almost completely new Department and the portfolios may be switched around.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/10">I hope that I retain that responsibility because I very much enjoyed seeing the waste review through. There is huge and growing interest in the matter, as the debate has illustrated, and it will be a huge environmental challenge for the country. If we fail to get it right in the next few years, not only will the environmental consequences be extremely serious, because we will continue to produce methane through landfill&mdash;hon. Members know that it is one of the most damaging greenhouse gases&mdash;but the country and individual local authorities will become liable to swingeing fines from the European Commission for failing to meet our landfill targets.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/11" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.145.1/12" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at four minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
