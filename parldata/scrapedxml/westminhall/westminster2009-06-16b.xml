<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-16b.4.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" speakername="Adam Afriyie" colnum="4"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090616/halltext/90616h0001.htm#09061627000446">
	<p pid="b.4.6/1">That is right. My right hon. Friend brings me to a key point that I will be making in a few moments. Without serious consideration of the alternatives of the past couple of years&mdash;not 10 years ago&mdash;the Government's bulldozing through of the proposal can be taken more as an act of political positioning, which might be backfiring on them, rather than a genuine search for the best solution for our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/2">There is no doubt that Heathrow is in the wrong place. Were we to start today, I am sure that we would not put a major airport with 480,000 flights a year right in the heart of a populated area. If we were starting now with a new project for an international airport that might arguably be a hub, we would look to position it somewhere where noise levels would not disturb people, in a location more easily accessible by high-speed rail or existing road infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/3">I note that France's main airport was moved twice in a period of 20 years. I am not suggesting at all that we should move London Heathrow, because so many jobs depend on it, but it shows a lack of ambition that the Government cannot envisage or even entertain the concept that a new airport could be forthcoming elsewhere, in a better location linked by high-speed rail to existing airports and city centres.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/4">I must celebrate on behalf of my constituents in Windsor. I am delighted that the Cranford agreement is no longer in existence. I will not dwell on that point, as I recognise that if BAA decides that it wishes to rebalance flights across the area, that simply means that other areas may well be adversely affected by larger numbers of flights. I suspect that the Transport Secretary's announcement is a trap by the Government. I think that he is hoping that the unity of 2M and of MPs around the south-east will be broken if Windsor begins to argue that the abolition of Cranford should be implemented immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/5">I do not think that we will fall into that trap. I shall certainly be pressing BAA as to what its plans are to implement it&mdash;I have been doing so on behalf of my constituents and will continue to do so&mdash;but there is no way that I will break the unity of the campaign against the third runway, for two reasons. A prisoner may be tempted from his cell with the question, &quot;Would you like to stretch your legs, sir? That's a nice benefit,&quot; only to realise a little later that he has been let out in order to be hanged at the gallows. In a way, the announcement could be seen as part of a plan of creeping encroachment to put the criteria for the third runway in place. The other thing to bear in mind is that even if the abolition of Cranford were implemented fully, any benefits would be negated immediately by the extra 220,000 flights a year. We must be careful what we hope for while working in our constituents' interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/6">I shall run briefly through the criticisms of the Government's case, because on every count the case falls over or is at least deeply questionable. The Government have argued that there is support from the entire business community. As we have seen, businesses are not united in the desire for a third runway at Heathrow. Indeed, business men have been bold in putting their heads above the parapet to say that they are not in favour of it at all. At best, the Government can argue that some businesses&mdash;I suspect that BAA might be on the list&mdash;are interested in a third runway at Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.4.6/7">The second count is an environmental one. The Government say that they have put conditions in place so that the third runway cannot be used to full capacity unless the environmental concerns&mdash;they involve nitrogen dioxide more than CO2&mdash;are met. However, that seems absolutely bizarre. If they are saying that the third runway cannot be used to full capacity initially, that completely undermines the economic case, or would if there were one. A partially used third runway will not deliver the benefits that the Government argue, on the basis of the Oxford Economic Forecasting report, will be delivered. There is no doubt that hitting nitrogen dioxide targets will be a stretch even in existing circumstances, and any reasonable person who looks through the numbers and projections will recognise that a third runway would merely add to the problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.7.1/1">Absolutely; this is a fascinating story is it not? It is bizarre that every Government who wish to appear to be caring and to work in the interests of the economy and people's quality of life fail to consider the health impacts. I hope that the Minister has a sensible and reasonable answer as to why the Government do not wish to look into the health of people in and around the airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/2">I return briefly, as we have already covered it marginally, to the concept of hubs. I have spoken to BAA and BA, I have scoured the internet and I have researched the issue as best I can to try to work out mathematically and logically, on whichever calculation should be used, what constitutes a hub and whether the five airports can be considered to be part of a hub. So far, I have failed to come up with anything other than people's bold assertions that if we have two or three fewer destinations, the whole thing will crumble. However, with the projections for just the existing two runways, we are already hitting the flight limit of 480,000 flights, so the evidence does not seem to be there.</p>
	<p pid="b.7.1/3">There is also the issue of transit passengers and what contribution they make to the UK economy. I do not have the quote to hand, sadly, but several notable people have pointed out that simply having the wheels touch down and people transit to another country does not add much to the UK's gross domestic product. Indeed, it does not add a vast amount to BAA's revenue. One must consider that BAA is merely one company of thousands in the UK, and one has to look at its profits and revenue in the light of those of other organisations.</p>

	<p pid="b.8.6/1">That is a fair observation, but if we look at various different places around the world, we could make all sorts of observations&mdash;for example, the Government have tried to harangue and make light of the idea of having an airport offshore somewhere. However, Hong Kong has managed very well to have such an airport. That should certainly inform our debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.8.6/2">There is also a world trend towards point-to-point travel, but if one looks at the examples in the United States we see a different picture. That is why the issue of aviation is not as simple as the Government try to make out, why a hub is difficult to define and why no one has managed to come up with a proper tangible or robust definition.</p>

	<p pid="b.9.3/1">Okay. As I said, no one is arguing for Heathrow to be closed down, and I do not want the debate to be characterised in that way. We are happy with the level of employment there and we hope that the levels of noise and pollution are reduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.3/2">The Government have not studied the alternatives properly in light of the developments in technology and the proposals put forward for high-speed rail. Various different models have been put forward and it is time for the Government to step back and give them consideration. The Government have not properly looked at the alternative of having a new airport. If air travel is to double over the next 20 or 30 years, none of the airports will be able to take that level of capacity, so surely now is the time to have a bit of vision and look towards the long-term rather than the short-term goal.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.3/3">Briefly, I have the following questions for the Minister. We are going through a massive economic downturn at the moment and air travel has been declining&mdash;I think there was an 8 per cent. reduction in the last month of 2008. That buys us a window for decision making and, on that basis, I urge the Minister to step away and perhaps give us a chink of light&mdash;a possibility that the Government will reconsider the matter. Is the Minister honestly confident that the Government can meet pollution targets if we have a third runway at Heathrow? Is he genuinely confident of that? Have the Government recently&mdash;not five or 10 years ago&mdash;looked seriously at the alternatives to expansion at Heathrow? If I go back to the ancients, I think the Greeks said that we can win the argument or get our way by force, trickery or persuasion. I have seen a lot of force and a little bit of trickery in the Government's argument. Will the Minister now resort to the means of persuasion, rather than using more brutal methods?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-16b.9.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="9"  time="010:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090616/halltext/90616h0002.htm#09061627000466">
	<p pid="b.9.4/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> for initiating the debate. I agree with him: we should use the debate as a progress report and as an opportunity to consider some of the issues again so that we will perhaps get some assistance from the Government on how we can move forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.4/2">The hon. Gentleman has covered the economic arguments. The intervention of the business sector&mdash;the representatives who came out against the expansion&mdash;was catastrophic for the case of the Government and BAA. May I update him on the union side? During the past week, we gained another union when the Communication Workers Union came out against the third runway at its conference. There is mounting trade union pressure against the development of the third runway. On the economic arguments, it is interesting to note that the Government and others are preparing alternatives in terms of high-speed rail&mdash;there is the Government's HS2 development study and, obviously, 2M is now looking at the high-speed north link. Those matters have moved on.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.4/3">On the environmental impact, the Committee on Climate Change will look at reducing the CO2 emissions of aviation to below 2005 levels by 2050, and it will be reporting in December. Again, that study will look at the modal shift and&mdash;exactly as the hon. Gentleman has requested&mdash;will provide the Government with the opportunity to stand back at that stage and see whether the target of reducing emissions can be achieved with the expansion of Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.4/4">On noise, BAA's plans on the reduction of the noise impact are now being produced in a consultative form. Having looked at the draft, I know that much of what has been said in the draft proposals is not much different from what is happening at the moment. Many of us cannot see what the visible impact will be as a result of the plans being introduced. In addition, there has not really been any movement on air quality because it now seems that Heathrow will remain an air quality hotspot into 2010. The Government will look for a derogation from the EU limits that come into force at that stage, and yet no quantifiable measures have been put forward to mitigate the air quality problems in our area. If the Government are to seek a derogation, they must at least put forward some form of a plan. However, there does not seem to be anything forthcoming.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.4/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> made a point that has also been made by hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall) and me when meeting the local primary care trust: we have had no information about the health impact assessment that is supposed to be undertaken by the Government. That was promised to us on the Floor of the House by the Secretary of State. The PCT has not been approached, and there has been no consultation or discussion. We thought that, at least at this stage, we would be examining the brief for that health impact assessment because our constituents need some assurances about that matter. We have seen the issues that have come from the Chicago study with regard to cancer and we have had survey after survey in the areas around Heathrow about the respiratory conditions from which our constituents suffer. It behoves the Government to come rapidly into discussions with the PCT and bring forward the proposals on the health assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.4/6">On the question of who will cover the cost of the expansion of Heathrow, the situation gets worse. Demand for air travel is plummeting at the moment and the aviation industry is, in some sectors, in crisis. It does not inspire confidence that there was a story in <i>The Guardian </i>business pages over a week ago that BAA has approached the Government to talk about what happens if it goes into administration. It has asked for the arrangements to be changed so that the Government no longer appoint the administrator&mdash;it has asked for it done by BAA or whoever its successor is in terms of ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.4/7">As I say, that does not inspire confidence, but it also worries me because it raises fears that the Government will be forced to subsidise this development. We know that, if the development goes ahead, the Government will have to pay for the collateral damage that will impact on local communities&mdash;the shifting of populations, the new schools that will be needed and the creation of new communities elsewhere for people to live in. We now believe that there will be direct subsidy as a result of BAA's precarious financial position and the precarious position of Grupo Ferrovial globally, and that the development itself&mdash;the construction of the runway and the terminal&mdash;will have to be subsided. Again, I do not think that that information was available to Members when the decision was made by the Government earlier this year. I say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>, who is not in his place at the moment&mdash;I know that he has other business&mdash;that if we have to intervene on any significant scale to subsidise the expansion of Heathrow, it will impact on the Government's transport investment programme for the next decade.</p>
	<p pid="b.9.4/8">On the legal challenge, letters of action have gone in and we will know the decision on whether a judicial review will take place in the next few weeks. I believe that it will take place and that we will be in court in the autumn. That case will inevitably drag on for a time. I say to the Government that the information that will come out will not expose not only their argument, but the collusion that has gone on between BAA and the Government at various levels. On the planning process, we are now told that BAA will not even be in a position to put forward proposals about what could be laid before a planning inquiry until late 2010 at the earliest.</p>

	<p pid="b.11.0/1">Is this not the nub of the issue: by the time we have a national policy statement it could be 10 years from when the White Paper on aviation was published, yet that is still the key document on which everything is based? What has been said today has shown that so much has changed and therefore surely we need an independent review of aviation policy, on which the planning process can be based.</p>

	<p pid="b.11.1/1">That is exactly the point. It has been made on a cross-party basis repeatedly over the last few months as we have come to know more clearly not just how the aviation White Paper will be converted into some form of national policy statement but also the fact that we will have no say about it on the Floor of the House. There will be no vote on the national policy statement itself. We have been told that it may be ready for consideration by April 2011 at the earliest.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/2">The process that we are involved in now is an absolute pig's breakfast. There is mounting unrest and protest, and people are not accepting the Government's decision because they do not believe that they have in any way participated in consenting to it. In Iran, demonstrations have resulted in even the Supreme Leader getting the message. Perhaps we could take a message back to our supreme leader, Lord Mandelson, the First Secretary of State, that we have a problem here. Perhaps that message could go out from this debate, because we need rationally to stand back and see where we are.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/3">Let me briefly outline what the uncertainty, which is worsening, is doing to my constituents. The uncertainty and blight mean that they cannot plan for their future. They live under the threat of the loss of their home and the destruction of their community. They cannot plan the basics of life. Their homes are threatened with demolition, but they cannot plan where they will live in the long term. Those in Sipson and other parts of the area where it has been confirmed that BAA's plans will involve demolition have been offered a bond scheme to pay for relocation&mdash;not compensation but simply payment for relocation&mdash;but it will be implemented only when the planning application is submitted. That could result in another year or more of uncertainty for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/4">BAA refused to attend a public meeting that I convened. I spoke to the then Secretary of State, and BAA eventually decided to come. It told us at that meeting that it wants to bring forth implementation of the bond scheme. We were told that that would be done in weeks, but residents associations at the meeting said that they had been told that six months earlier. We have heard nothing further. Why? Because BAA is dependent on individual airline industry companies standing to cover the liabilities of the bond scheme if it is implemented earlier, and it cannot get agreement among them.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/5">For those who live in the other villages of Harmondsworth, Harlington, Longford, Cranford Cross and, yes, parts of Hayes itself, there is no scheme on offer whatsoever to pay or compensate for relocation. People do not know where the final boundaries of the airport will be or even whether their homes are threatened with demolition. They do know that their homes will be rendered unliveable as a result of noise and air pollution, but they have not been offered a penny except for limited amounts of support for additional insulation, which will fail to protect them.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/6">Because schools are to be demolished or rendered unusable, families cannot plan the education of their children. Because there is no binding commitment on whether a road will go through our local cemetery at Cherry Lane, we cannot even plan where we bury our dead at present. Local businesses, some of which are small businesses, will be affected. Jacqui Clarke, the local hairdresser who lives above her shop, will get nothing; there is no compensation for her. Several local businesses are in a precarious position because they cannot plan for long-term investment in their businesses, and that will impact on local employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/7">We know from the Government's figures that 2,000 people will be relocated, but more likely it will be 10,000&mdash;the largest evacuation of people in living memory, given what we know from studies done in the 1990s. The Government's response up until now has been that it is up to individuals themselves to plan their future. The then Secretary of State said that at a public meeting that we had with local residents. Well, they cannot. The alternative is that it is up to local authorities, Hillingdon in particular, to plan for the development of new communities and the relocation of individuals, but local authorities have had no guidelines from the Government. There has been no consultation or extra resources for Hillingdon to enable it to start the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/8">My constituents have been left in limbo. Most want to remain, but they want to know what their position will be in the future. They want a secure future. Some inevitably have to move&mdash;families grow up, or the elderly may want to relocate to live with their families elsewhere&mdash;but they are trapped because the bond scheme cannot be implemented, the Government's decisions have been so tentative, and the process is so long-winded and insecure.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/9">Residents are protesting. They resent how they have been treated as a result of their peaceful protests. They have been harassed by police, and photographs and films have been taken of them. They want the evidence that has been collected to be given to them or destroyed. They are not criminals; they have simply been involved in peaceful protests. The use of anti-terrorist legislation to stop people photographing homes that will be demolished is extraordinary behaviour and an inappropriate use of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/10">Yes, there is anger at the Government's decision&mdash;of course there is&mdash;but people are worried about their future. That is fuelling a growing fury at the way in which the whole process has been handled by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.11.1/11">Finally, we still have not had a single Government Minister visit any of the villages to meet local residents. That is an abrogation of ministerial duty and the Government's responsibility to my constituents. We will continue to fight the proposal, but we expect to be treated in a manner that respects people's concerns about their future. We will continue to protest and to demand a change in Government policy, and I make it clear that at the next election, whatever is in the Labour party's manifesto, I shall stand on a manifesto that opposes the expansion of Heathrow. The democratic wishes of the population around Heathrow should be respected.</p>

	<p pid="b.14.1/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman about the Secretary of State. He was always courteous and helpful when he was a Schools Minister, and he is very much a fan of rail travel. I find that encouraging, particularly as that seems to be the way in which the argument is going.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.1/2">There is no need for me to repeat in the limited time left all the arguments that we have heard. All I will say about the situation is that it is exactly the same in my constituency. My constituents, particularly those in West Drayton, are suffering exactly the same problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.1/3">I just cannot get my head around the fact that we are constantly being told that climate change is the greatest threat facing the planet, yet here we have a Government who are proposing something that will not reduce emissions but actually increase them. I can never get an answer from the Government on how they can justify that. It is absolutely appalling.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2038" name="Bob Spink">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> has done his usual trick of making an intervention and whizzing off, but I would say to him that I am opposed to any development in the Thames estuary. I have said from the outset that if we oppose in our area the expansion of Heathrow, the traffic should not go somewhere else; for example, to Gatwick or Stansted. It is not fair to dump the problem on somebody else. We as a nation have to tackle the problems of aviation, including its increase, because nobody wants an airport in their back garden. We have had that happen in Heathrow. I have to say to the Minister that I get fed up with people&mdash;not necessarily the Government&mdash;saying, &quot;People who move there know it was there.&quot; That does not apply to lots of my constituents, including my family. My mother was born in the constituency a long time ago, when Heathrow was just a market gardening area. So it is wrong to say that we knew what was going to happen. We have lived with it in our back garden and now it is at the back door. That is what is really so galling for us.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.1/5">The Government keep talking about listening to people and going on about how they want to change everything and get people involved. This is an ideal opportunity for them. The argument is falling away rapidly. If they could bring themselves to be brave and courageous enough to say, &quot;This is not the time. We cannot go ahead with it. We got some of the arguments wrong,&quot; I would salute them. But, unfortunately, I know that they will not, because I can see that, given the way they have run this country for the last 12 years, they do not listen to the people.</p>
	<p pid="b.14.1/6">There is one message. We should have an election and let people make their own minds up about whether they want this Government and whether they want this third runway.</p>

	<p pid="b.16.1/1">Okay, if one looked at the matter seriously and decided that it would be a good idea to have another airport elsewhere&mdash;I take my hon. Friend's point that he did not say that he wanted one&mdash;the idea presumably would be to have one. Looking at the rest of the world, in Montreal, for example, where they have done just that, the new airport is now being closed because the old one is still open and everybody uses it. In Hong Kong, which I have mentioned, and in Denver, the old airports were shut and the business was transferred. That is the way that a new airport can be made to work. Let us not hop about. A new airport somewhere else replaces Heathrow: it does not complement it.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/2">On using runways to full capacity, we did not get a definition of &quot;full capacity&quot;. At the moment, we are running at 99 per cent. capacity, which is causing problems. The airports elsewhere, which are Heathrow's competitors, are running at about 75 per cent., which they think is about the capacity that is justified to offer a decent service. The same argument applies at Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/3">Carbon emissions are mentioned regularly. Yes, if the world can come to an agreement that everywhere will do something about carbon emissions, that is a case to follow. However, if one says, &quot;We unilaterally will do something that will harm the British aviation industry while everybody else doesn't bother,&quot; why should we want to undermine our own economy and watch other people benefit from that point of view?</p>
	<p pid="b.16.1/4">On high-speed rail, the best figure that I have, which is recent, shows that no more than 11 per cent. of transfer passengers using Heathrow are domestic passengers. If we take 11 per cent. as the only number involved, not all of them will use a high-speed rail link, so not many people will not take flights and will instead get there by train. That would be an awfully big investment to make to solve nothing much of a problem.</p>

	<p pid="b.17.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> on securing this debate. I speak on behalf of the Liberal Democrats, and also my constituents in Richmond Park, who are utterly determined to continue to resist the third runway. They are glad that Members of Parliament are continuing to find different mechanisms to ensure that the matter remains on the public agenda, and that Ministers continue to answer their questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.2/2">We have had a change of Secretary of State for Transport and the complete ministerial team, and I hope that that will be an opportunity to rethink past decisions, particularly as some key members of the team have a track record and expertise in transport, which could not be said of the previous Secretary of State, whose speeches about Heathrow were described as disgraceful, and rightly so. I hope that the change will be a new opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.2/3">I am glad that we have had a statement from the Conservative party on its policy on a Thames estuary airport. The local prospective parliamentary candidate in my constituency has written to the papers arguing for the closure of Heathrow and its replacement with an estuary airport. That would definitely be a wrong decision. An estuary airport would have four runways, the climate change implications would be phenomenal, and the impact on the surrounding area and the loss of jobs would be dramatic. I am glad that we have had clarification on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.2/4">Several hon. Members referred to financing and it was pointed out that the recent economic recession has changed the picture. Obviously, the impact of BAA's financial condition on its parent company has raised genuine concern. The recession has hit the aviation industry extremely hard, but I hope that the new administration that is examining transport issues will consider the financing issue more closely. The various statements to justify rejecting most of the comments and protests during the Heathrow consultation suggested that environmental safeguards had been put in place to limit use of the third runway to half capacity or, if the appropriate aircraft were not available, to prevent it from opening. I see no way in which any financial institution would fund around &pound;16 billion in construction and financing costs with that possibility on the horizon without Government guarantees or letters of comfort plastered all over it.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.2/5">I have received letters from the Department saying that that has not been discussed or even contemplated, and that it would never happen, but we need reassurance. All those issues are reinforced by the current financial pressures that the aviation industry and BAA specifically are facing. I was interested to hear that our one voice so far in support of the third runway is concerned about public money and resources being pumped into the third runway proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.2/6">Many of the comments that have been made, particularly those from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, covered the issues that I would like to cover, so I shall limit my speech and align myself with those. The blight that faces the hon. Gentleman's constituency is totally unacceptable. There is great anxiety among my constituents after suddenly learning that the national policy study for aviation will not appear in draft before 2011. My constituents fear that that will leave a period in which BAA may make an application and ask for it to be dealt with under a different regime, which might be much more favourable to a yes answer, rather than raising even relatively weak questions that would arise in an aviation national policy statement.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.2/7">Residents living under the flight path need a lot of clarification on the process. The timetables that we have been able to download from various Government websites seem to be completely irrelevant to trying to understand what the procedures will be. Serious local concerns arose from the residents' meeting with the former Secretary of State for Transport, and the current Secretary of State in his then role as Minister with responsibility for railways, which failed to address local traffic issues. That contributes greatly to air pollution in the area, but the answer in every case was, &quot;We are not considering that; it for local authorities to do so.&quot; That was extremely disturbing because we will almost double the number of passengers at Heathrow, and consequently the number of people trying to reach Heathrow, many of them by road. Business leaders have been courageous in finally coming forward and exposing the hollowness of many of the arguments, and I associate myself with all those.</p>
	<p pid="b.17.2/8">I am conscious that other hon. Members want to speak, and I am anxious to hear the Minister. I reiterate my party's ongoing opposition on grounds of climate change, and the impact of noise and air pollution on local communities. A final request to the Minister is that he tells us at some point what will happen with the application for derogation from air quality. I again congratulate the hon. Member for Windsor on raising the issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.19.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on his excellent contribution on a matter of great concern to all hon. Members here. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">the Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> on their typically robust comments about their constituents' concerns, which were echoed by the Liberal Democrats' spokesman. If there were a contest between the bulldozers and my hon. Friend the Member for Uxbridge, I know whom I would back in a straight contest.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.0/2">I shall endorse rather than repeat the various plaudits for the environmental groups, trade unions, and businessmen who have stepped out of line with what was briefly consensus among the business community to speak out against the project, which we believe will inflict devastating damage on the environment and the quality of life of millions of people in London and the western home counties. The Conservative party plans to make Heathrow a better airport, rather than a bigger one.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.0/3">Three arguments are usually made in favour of a third runway at Heathrow: the UK plc argument and two aviation-specific ones. Despite a number of voices, including that of the CBI, the UK plc argument is extremely weak. It has been heavily based on one study&mdash;the Oxford Economics study, which has nothing whatever to do with Oxford university, whose transport unit takes a different line. The study is full of one-sided assumptions. It prices none of the downside of expansion, apart from carbon, and even ignores road congestion. It centres its calculations on assumptions mostly at the extreme favourable end of each scale. It bizarrely includes aviation tax as a net gain to the UK economy, and it assumes that BAA will be allowed to continue to operate one of the stingiest schemes for noise insulation in the world. However, that document is still the only major study behind the UK plc side of the argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.19.0/4">Even before the recession, BAA admitted that only 36 per cent. of passengers travelling through Heathrow were business passengers. If we remove the transit ones, barely one quarter of the passengers going through Heathrow are British business men or people coming to do business in Britain.</p>

	<p pid="b.21.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1929" name="Adam Afriyie">the hon. Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie)</phrase> on securing the debate and allowing an opportunity for the issues to be raised again; no doubt they will be raised in further debates in the ensuing months. We are talking about the important issue of meeting the aviation demands of our country, whether that relates to private travellers, travelling for leisure purposes or to visit friends, or to travel that is necessary to have a successful and thriving economy as part of UK plc.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.0/2">I have been particularly interested to listen to all the comments that have been contributed to the debate by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Windsor, my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> and the hon.

Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">the right hon.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase>. I have listened particularly to the comments of Front-Bench spokesmen and women with regard to meeting the challenges and making the hard decisions that have had to be faced by those in government. I shall run through some of those points now.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.0/3">First, let me make it clear that although there may have been a change of team to an extent, I was present in March when the hon. Member for Windsor accompanied a delegation from his constituency, along with other representatives, including in this Room today, to discuss the issues with the then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon)</phrase>. I noted the comments from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1783" name="Susan Kramer">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Susan Kramer)</phrase> that the contributions by the former Secretary of State were outrageous. I suspect that the reason for her saying that was that his comments did not find favour with her view. As I said, I attended that meeting with hon. Members and other representatives and I listened with interest to many of the views that were expressed by local residents&mdash;views that were clearly held firmly and expressed robustly. I am happy to confirm that information on a number of the points raised at that meeting has now been posted on the Department for Transport website. I am talking about issues that were raised at the meeting but could not be fully answered in that forum. I want to make it clear that those are on the Department's website.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-16b.29.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" speakername="Brian Iddon" colnum="29"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090616/halltext/90616h0005.htm#09061627000504">
	<p pid="b.29.1/1">It is a factor, and I shall comment on what the hon. Gentleman said later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/2">Codeine is more abundant in the latex obtained from the poppy papaver somniferum than from its most desirable constituent, morphine, which is turned into heroin using acetic anhydride. The all-party group received evidence to suggest that those addicted to codeine-containing products are taking between 30 and, amazingly, as many as 70 tablets every day. One woman who gave evidence to our inquiry described how the 48 to 60 tablets she was taking every day gave her a &quot;lift&quot; and &quot;helped her along&quot;, and a male respondent told us how much he enjoyed the feeling of &quot;calmness, happiness and control&quot; that his 32 tablets brought him.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/3">Unless the codeine is separated from co-medications such as ibuprofen, those dose levels can cause medical complications such as serious internal bleeding, which often results in death. The codeine can be easily separated from the co-medication, and the methods to achieve this separation can be obtained from the chatrooms regularly used by young people.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/4">The stereotypical addict of codeine-containing products is a middle-aged female. However, more and more people are becoming addicted to them as a result of treating of chronic pain by using codeine-containing drugs and in the absence of an adequate pain management strategy by local clinicians. It would seem that a significant number of codeine addicts also have a co-morbid mental health problem. Some addicts also have a poly-drug problem, involving, for instance, alcohol or other prescription drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/5">Mark Edwards became addicted to codeine following complications arising from an operation that left him with chronic pain. If he had received help to manage his pain, he would probably not have become an addict. Following his experience, he established &quot;codeinefree.me&quot;, an online site to support those who have problems with over-the-counter medicines, especially those that contain codeine products.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/6">People who regularly suffer headaches and who self-medicate with codeine-containing products may develop a symptom that has been termed medication overuse headache. When they are enabled to give up the products, the headaches disappear. The overuse of codeine, of course, desensitises the pain receptors, particularly those in the brain.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/7">People who become addicted to over-the-counter medicines believe that the products that they are buying without prescription are safe and therefore that they cannot become addicted to them. Similarly, patients who receive prescriptions from their doctors believe that they will be protected from serious side-effects, and they too cannot believe that they might become addicted or at least physically dependent on a product prescribed by their GP.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/8">With both tranquilliser and codeine addiction, we found that most GPs either do not recognise the problem that their patients have or are at a loss to know how to deal with them. The plain fact is that it is probably easier today for an illegal drug user to get a referral to a drug and alcohol action team&mdash;a DAAT&mdash;than it is for those having problems with legal drugs, other than alcohol, to get treatment for their condition.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/9">Our report contains 24 recommendations. They include the adequate training of medical professionals; raising awareness of the problem; proper prescribing and the monitoring of patients; more research to establish the scale of the problem; and, most important, recognition of those patients with problems and the ability to refer them to an appropriate treatment centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/10">It is vital that all who work in the health care field, especially nurses, doctors and pharmacists, receive training in substance misuse as well as good prescribing practice. We live in an era of a pill for every ill, yet many patients require only to be listened to and perhaps referred on; for example, to a cognitive behavioural therapist.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/11">The pharmaceutical industry and the patient both have responsibilities, the former to make patients aware of potential problems such as physical dependence or addiction&mdash;for instance, in the patient information leaflet or PIL&mdash;and the latter to ensure that they read the PIL or listen to the advice given by their doctor or pharmacist. Trade organisations, such as the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, also have responsibilities to ensure that the products produced by their member companies are safe at the point of sale, as does the MHRA, which licences and monitors the sale of medicines in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/12">All those bodies should raise awareness of the dangers of buying products on the internet. The MHRA works with internet service providers to close down websites found to be operating illegally, but it has jurisdiction only in the UK. In the past five years, however, it has been successful in 18 prosecutions of operators of websites trading medicines illegally in the UK. Primary care trusts also have a responsibility to ensure that benzodiazepines and zed drugs are prescribed responsibly, that general practitioners who prescribe outside the guidelines justify that behaviour to them and that the patients affected are monitored adequately so that the problems described this morning do not develop.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/13">Our all-party group believes that codeine-containing packs should contain no more than 18 tablets and that all sales should be accompanied by appropriate advice on the addictive potential of these medicines. In some countries, the advertising of codeine-containing products has been banned and, in others, such as the USA, they have been made prescription-only medicines&mdash;POMs. However, we would not wish to burden doctors any more than they are already, and, in any case, there is a move in this country towards self-medication, with a greater role for pharmacists in advising patients. I welcome that. A 2006 study conducted in Northern Ireland concluded that, on average, a pharmacist would see about two over-the-counter medicine misusers a week, but a 2001 study conducted in Scotland put the figure a little higher&mdash;at an average of five per pharmacy per week. So the problem is not unknown in pharmacy shops.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/14">The National Treatment Agency was set up in 2000 and has been very successful in treating those referred to it who are addicted to controlled&mdash;or street&mdash;drugs. However, we believe that it is not geared up to treating those with the problems that I have been describing. The stigma associated with controlled drug addiction, and the shame associated with those who have become involuntarily addicted to prescription and over-the-counter medicines, means that such patients are hardly likely to volunteer for referral to the facilities provided by DAATs. In our report, therefore, we have recommended that the Department of Health provide centres for treatment within the NHS, but separate from those provided by DAATs. Throughout our report, we stress the importance of voluntary organisations in helping patients, but their resources have become extremely stretched in recent years. I plead with the Government to support them more.</p>
	<p pid="b.29.1/15">Finally, it is important that the Department of Health commissions research to measure the extent of these problems and monitor future prescribing and sales of the problem medicines. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister&mdash;I am glad that he is answering this debate&mdash;can persuade the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" name="Gillian Merron">the Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron)</phrase> to meet me with a small delegation to discuss these problems in more depth and to seek a sensible way forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-16b.33.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="33"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090616/halltext/90616h0006.htm#09061627000506">
	<p pid="b.33.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1432" name="Brian Iddon">the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon)</phrase> on his years of service on the all-party group on drug misuse. He will be sadly missed when he leaves. He has brought to that group a scientific rigour from his professional background that has been a continual challenge to the evidence-free policies on drugs, including medicinal drugs, by a succession of Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/2">I had a striking contribution yesterday from someone whom we will call &quot;John&quot; who illustrated vividly how society has been conditioned to believe that there is a pill for every ill. His 11-year-old daughter was asked in school to make a list of 10 medicines that she had taken, or that she knew about. Coming from a family who do not use medicines for ordinary complaints&mdash;they allow the ordinary diseases of life to take their course&mdash;she could only manage to write down one medicine while the rest of the class had no difficulty in writing down 10 that they had taken themselves. The school was so alarmed by that that it contacted my correspondent and asked him whether he belonged to a particular religious sect and whether he wanted his daughter withdrawn from the class because he might have objections to drugs. A parent who takes a purely rational approach to drugs, to the great health of their children, is treated as someone who is so exceptional that they have to be asked whether their children should be taken out of the class.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/3">However, such drug taking is not a new phenomenon. If any of us had gone to see Dr. Freud in Vienna, he would have prescribed for us the drug that he took himself. He gave it to all of his family and every one of his patients in the belief that it was greatly beneficial and harmless. That drug was cocaine. A generation later, the drug of use for what we would now call depression or mild exam sickness was bromide, which created its own psychosis.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/4">Going on from that, in the '50s and '60s, we had the dibenzodiazepines. Following that came the tricyclics and then the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. When those drugs were introduced, they were all said to be beneficial, which they rarely were, and it was said that they would not create dependency, which they did. In fact, they all did a great amount of harm, so it is not something that is just happening now. None the less, the examples quoted are striking and important. The pharmaceutical industry has done a great deal of good. In many ways, it has produced miracles of science. On BBC 2 tomorrow night at 9 o'clock there is a programme called &quot;The Price of Life&quot;, which I recommend everyone to watch. It looks at the way in which medicinal substances are marketed, created and sold. Behind the many good things that are done is a greedy, self-absorbed market that puts its profits as its highest goal.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/5">We must look at the way in which lives have been damaged by our belief that for every moment of boredom, distress, grief, pain or discomfort, there is an answer in a pill; it is not true. I should like to talk at great length about the problems of pain. Pain is a construct, and the least successful way of dealing with it is to take a pill. There are much more sophisticated ways in which to deal with pain. I constantly say that if Beethoven had been on painkillers or Michelangelo had been on antidepressants, we would never have heard of them. Such pills are the antidote to the creative process. There are other ways in life in which we can deal with the affliction of pain. Often, the least successful and most dangerous way to do it is through using drugs that are vastly overused to the detriment of the happiness and health of millions of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.0/6">I commend the all-party report. I had the great privilege of being invited to chair one of the group's evidence session. I learned a great deal from it. I saw how people had had their lives deeply affected by the overuse and misuse of medicinal drugs. On the evidence of this report, I hope that my hon. Friend will hear that there will be a meeting with Ministers and that there can be a major advance in the way in which we dispense drugs.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.1/1">As with many question on this matter, we do not know the answer&mdash;it is important to say that&mdash;but we clearly agree that the solutions must be research based. On labelling, we must be mindful of the danger that the hon. Gentleman described, but we could deal with that problem by talking about the dangers in an appropriate way.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.1/2">This is an important debate. I thank the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East for introducing it and the all-party group for its report. I would like to think that we will come back, perhaps in a year, to see how much of the report the Government have taken up. I hope that the matter will be taken very seriously by the Minister and that we see progress on this difficult but very important issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-16b.44.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1512" speakername="Phil Hope" colnum="44"  time="012:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090616/halltext/90616h0007.htm#09061627000519">
	<p pid="b.44.0/1">My hon. Friend raises an excellent point about comparisons between strategies that work in different countries. These matters are never quite comparable, but I shall certainly draw his concerns about the efficacy of the yellow card scheme to the attention of the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" name="Gillian Merron">the Member for Lincoln (Gillian Merron)</phrase>, who has responsibilities for public health and this area of policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/2">Several hon. Members have expressed concerns about the internet and how people obtain prescription drugs. We know that some people obtain benzodiazepines and other medicines through internet pharmacies, from abroad and by other illicit means. The MHRA continues to monitor internet activity and takes action against any identified breaches of legislation, where possible. The safety, quality and efficacy of medicines purchased via the internet cannot be guaranteed, and their effects on patients cannot be monitored, which is why we control tightly the supply of medicines and prescription-only medication in the UK. The MHRA has warned that online supplies of medicine may well pose risks to consumer health, and recommends that prescription-only and pharmacy-only medicines should be obtained through registered pharmacies.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/3">Action is also being taken through designated internet days of action, which are organised and conducted on a number of dates during the year. They involve working alongside international regulators with the specific aim of taking down websites that act illegally. More such days of action are planned throughout 2009 and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/4">On the question of prescribing and monitoring, we are using a number of mechanisms to promote and support high-quality, clinically effective prescribing and medicines management right across the NHS to ensure patient safety and to help improve patient care and service delivery. We have made sure that prescribers have access to a wide variety of impartial, trustworthy information resources to support their prescribing, including resources from the British National Formulary, National Prescribing Centre information and advice, and guidance from the independent National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Such resources will assist prescribers in making clinically cost-effective prescribing decisions. A wealth of information is available through the National Library for Health and various academic and professional journals. NHS prescribers also have access to advice from the network of local drugs and therapeutics committees, and from PCT pharmaceutical advisers.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/5">It is an obvious thing to state, but no medicine is 100 per cent. risk free. However, we expect individual prescribers to be aware of the potential for addiction and to ensure that medicines are prescribed appropriately depending on a patient's individual needs. In exercising their professional and clinical judgement, prescribers should always consider the available guidance and the best practice that is shared within the prescribing community. At a more local level&mdash;this has been raised in the debate&mdash;pharmaceutical advisers, who are mainly pharmacists, are employed by strategic health authorities or primary care trusts with the common aim of encouraging and securing rational and cost-effective prescribing and providing a source of advice and support for prescribers in their area. There are now more than 1,200 advisers, many of whom conduct face-to-face reviews with GPs and carry out reviews of prescribing activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/6">In this country, primary care trusts and their pharmaceutical advisers have very effective electronic information systems for prescribing in general practice. They routinely monitor detailed prescribing information and can easily identify unusual or excessive prescribing by individual doctors. Such a system further supports the monitoring of the quality and safety of prescribing and is another important factor that contributes to improving practice in this area. The General Medical Council has produced guidance for doctors to ensure that proper standards in the practice of medicine are maintained, including in relation to the prescribing of medicines. If the proper standards are not maintained, the General Medical Council has the power to remove a doctor's right to practise medicine.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/7">A fourth area mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East was research. The 2008 drug strategy highlighted the importance of further research in the drugs field to boost our understanding of addiction and to identify opportunities for new forms of treatment or prevention. Since then, work has been under way to develop a cross-Government research programme on drugs. Our analysis in the Department of Health has revealed&mdash;I think that my hon. Friend pointed this out&mdash;the need for additional information about dependence on prescribed drugs and over-the-counter drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/8">I am pleased to have this opportunity to let the House know that, starting next month, resources have been identified in the Department to undertake a review of the information that we already have. That review will identify the key gaps in data and consider what additional work needs to be taken in hand, and it will take the points made in the report of my hon. Friend's all-party group on drugs misuse very seriously; indeed, it will also take seriously the points made by him and other hon. Members today.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/9">On treatment, in line with what my hon. Friend seeks, primary care trusts are responsible for deciding on the provision of treatment and services that reflect local needs and priorities, including in relation to tranquilliser addiction.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/10">I also want to talk about the availability of other treatments in providing support for mental health problems. In response to the point made by the hon. Member for Boston and Skegness, I can tell the House that the Government are investing significantly in the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme&mdash;IAPT, as it is known&mdash;to widen the range of treatment available for people with common mental health problems. The hon. Gentleman was critical of the funding and the support that has been provided for mental health services. Let me tell him that mental health services have received a 44 per cent. increase in funding and only a few months ago&mdash;just before Christmas&mdash;the World Health Organisation commended highly the strategy for mental health services in England and said that it was one of the best in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/11">I will not accept any criticism from the hon. Gentleman and his party about the work that we have been doing to support and invest in mental health services. IAPT offers a range of NICE-approved therapies, including guided self-help, counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, behavioural activation and exercise. Annual funding is rising to &pound;173 million in the third year&mdash;2010-11&mdash;to train 3,600 extra therapists and treat 900,000 more people in those three years. This Government are proud of that record of investment and progress, which will make a real difference to supporting people with mental health problems. Those services can be provided in primary care, secondary mental health services or secondary substance misuse services depending on need.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/12">The current range of measures that I have described might, in part, explain the fall that we have seen in benzodiazepine prescribing over the last decade. I am grateful to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East for noting that in the all-party group's report. In terms of over-the-counter medicines abuse, it is likely that the range of measures and safeguards that we have established in the UK have contributed to our having fewer problems than other countries. I recognise that, considering the size of these problems, the evidence is limited and I assure my hon. Friend that I am not complacent about such an important issue. I will, of course, draw to the attention of the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Lincoln my hon. Friend's request for a meeting with him and other officers of the group to present the findings of the report. I am sure that she would be delighted to meet him&mdash;although it is a bit naughty of me to say so on her behalf because she is not here&mdash;to learn about and discuss these issues in more depth.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.0/13">I hope that what I have highlighted today reassures my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East and, indeed, the whole House that, as a Government, we are determined to do all in our power to minimise drug dependency in all its forms. This debate has been very useful in highlighting these important matters, and I congratulate the all-party group and my hon. Friend on securing the debate and presenting the finding of the group's report here today.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.1/1">I am enormously pleased to have secured this debate in the ballot because, as I will come to in the course of my comments, this issue is not just about athletes, but about the way that we treat people with hearing disabilities generally. I am also pleased to have secured the debate because, until a couple of years ago, we had a remarkable school called Hawkswood school in my constituency. It was a school for the hearing impaired and profoundly deaf, and although we fought long and hard to keep it open, sadly, we failed&mdash;although we secured other special needs schools. I will come back to the issue of why that particular school ended up going when we were able to save other special needs schools, because that matter has a bearing on the nature of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/2">In essence, this is about a constituent called Ollie Monksfield. I want to set out the particular and rather personal story of Ollie because it illustrates the problem of a group of young men and women who have aspirations like everybody else to compete on behalf of their country, but who will find doing so impossible or so difficult that it is a scarring experience. Ollie Monksfield is profoundly deaf but he was selected to play for the British football squad at the deaf Olympics in September. He was part of the team that won gold at the last deaf Olympic games in Melbourne. I do not think that the deaf Olympics has ever been broadcast across the media but, none the less, I hope that we are proud of it&mdash;we certainly should be.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/3">Interestingly, like many people with hearing disabilities, Ollie was not born profoundly deaf. He became deaf at about nine months when he was diagnosed with meningitis C. Ollie has always excelled at football. Interestingly, he was selected for trials for a major club. I was astonished on hearing that upon learning of his disability, the club refused him a place despite his obvious and impressive talent on the pitch. The Minister, who is on the other side of the House but is a good friend of mine in footballing terms, would be appalled by that, but that is another story. However, it illustrates what I am saying.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/4">The point I wish to make today is that Ollie has managed, under a great deal of pressure, to raise some money towards fulfilling his dream of helping Team GB successfully defend its title in Taipei, but he and the others need to raise much more money. He personally has to raise another &pound;1,000 by <phrase class="date" code="2009-06-30">30 June</phrase> but is hitting brick wall after brick wall to secure his place. When I speak to him, he tells me that there is now every chance that he may not be able to go because he will not raise the money. Frankly, that would be a tragedy for him and the others.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/5">I raised this debate because I am concerned that Ollie and his team mates should ever have been put in such a position. In a funny way, they are the little group that has been swept under the carpet without&mdash;I hope&mdash;anyone quite realising what was happening. I have never met anyone with disabilities who wants to rely on handouts, and these people are legitimately proud. They are proud particularly as athletes of what they have achieved in their own right.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/6">I am enormously pleased&mdash;I know that the Minister is as well&mdash;to see how the Paralympics and other competitions have grown in the public's imagination. It is a sign of a just and decent society that we find a place for people with huge difficulties, not necessarily caused by anything that they had done to them during the course of their lives. That is a matter to be proud of.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/7">It is almost as though the group has been cast aside. Ollie does not want to rely on handouts. He is a secondary school physical education teacher who works very hard every day. The decision to withdraw funding for the team to go out to compete in Taipei sends the wrong message. We should be doing all that we can to support all people with any disability, not just some while leaving others out.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/8">I know, Mr. Wilshire, that we are not meant to refer to people in the gallery. None the less, I shall refer to someone who is not here. Ollie is too busy at school, but also, in conversations with him, he told me that he was concerned that he may not have been able to following proceedings. That, too, illustrates my point.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/9">The fact is that the UK Sport grant of &pound;42,000&mdash;that is all&mdash;to UK Deaf Sport was withdrawn, with effect from April 2008. The reason for withdrawing the funding is that UK Sport is apparently focusing mainly on the successful delivery of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics. I shall come to the budget later, but I ask now why that &pound;42,000 had to be withdrawn from the deaf Olympic group. I find that rather strange.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/10">UK Sport attempted to justify the cut, or reduction&mdash;whichever term one wants to use&mdash;by claiming that it needs extra funds to support British elite athletes in their goal to meet the target medal haul set for 2012. Like every other citizen of this country, I was proud of what our athletes achieved at the last Olympics and Paralympics, and I hope that they do better next time around, but UK Sport has given a poor excuse to justify taking away that small sum of money. That cut clearly suggests that UK Sport does not value the success of all athletes, including those who do not have specific disabilities that are often in the public eye and, as a result, obvious, as well as well as mainstream athletes.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/11">It appears that since the withdrawal of the money, no specific guidance has been given by anyone to Deaflympic athletes as to how they should go about raising alternative funds. Little consideration has been given to the communication difficulties that many of them have. I remind hon. Members that they have particular problems in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/12">I raise money for an organisation beyond politics, and for charities generally. Raising money requires a massive ability to communicate using the media, telephones and conversation, which makes things much more difficult for these athletes. There has been little or no support or help to pave the way for them to find money. After all, they never required a huge sum of money to go. I shall come on to the figure in a second. How are athletes with speech impediments and hearing difficulties supposed to raise funds effectively, when the majority of fund-raising practices involve one-to-one contact with potential donors, possibly even by telephone?</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/13">I understand that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has said that deaf athletes are eligible for funding through the Paralympics, but I cannot believe that a majority of deaf athletes cannot join the Paralympic games because there is a shortage of international deaf athletes to compete against. Perhaps the Minister has not been told about that. Theirs is a peculiar and particular problem. I did not know about it when I first had Ollie in my surgery talking about the matter. Once it was explained to me, I could understand how the problem may have been swept out of sight. No one has focused on this particular, necessarily small but none the less remarkable group of people.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/14">It seems unfair that the UK Deaflympic team now does not receive any form of funding when the Paralympic team is in receipt of such funding, and in sizeable amounts. I shall come back to that in a second. The loss of funding means that each member of the Deaflympic squad will have to raise thousands to pay for their flights and accommodation. I do not understand how we got ourselves here, and I hope that the Minister is big enough&mdash;I know him personally and believe that to be the case normally&mdash;to think again about this and to find a way through.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/15">I remind hon. Members of the history of the situation. The Deaflympic football team won gold at the last games in Melbourne in 2005. What a remarkable feat&mdash;I hope that we are all proud of it. What is also remarkable is that the team may now not be able to get to the next games to defend its title. It would be a matter of shame for us all if a group of athletes who have struggled and trained so hard were not able to assume their rightful place at the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/16">The figures speak loudly. UK Sport has pledged some &pound;292 million&mdash;it is worth emphasising the figure, because it is so large&mdash;for the 2012 games to ensure that Team GB finishes fourth in the medal table. I hope that it finishes higher. The British Deaflympic team has not received anything like that level of consideration over the years.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/17">In comparison, it would cost UK Sport approximately &pound;500,000 in total, all done, to send the British Deaflympic squad to the games in Taipei this September. It is interesting that the cost per medal for a Deaflympic athlete amounts to &pound;1,400, if one bases it on the last Olympics, as compared with the cost of funding an Olympic medal, which is about &pound;1.6 million. We live in an age with much talk of value for money. That speaks loudly to me about value for money. I would suggest that another good reason for considering this group is that it tends to return the money invested in it many times over. It is worthy of major consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/18">Sadly, in May 2009, the independent appeals panel rejected UK Deaf Sport's appeal against UK Sport's decision not to help deaf athletes with funding. I hope that the Minister will not fall back on that as some kind of justification for the failure. The panel was fundamentally wrong and misguided, and I have no hesitation in saying that I hope that it realises what it was doing when it made that decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/19">In the last few minutes before I conclude and give the Minister a chance to talk about what is happening, I want to raise a general issue. I would like to return to the subject of Hawkswood school, which is no longer in being. When it was closed, we were told that the children, many of whom signed and did not lip-read, would be fine because local secondary schools would cope with them when they went to those schools. After all, they were only hearing impaired, were they not? However, many of them did not lip-read and they had to learn a whole new culture of communication, which is a major change.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/20">I do not know how many people listening to the debate or reading the report would be able to undertake such a change a reasonably short notice. More than that, I have since discovered that even those who lip-read have been in major difficulty&mdash;in a culture that, as is so often forgotten, sets deaf people apart from others&mdash;because teachers, for example, do not realise simple little things about children with profound hearing difficulties in their class. For example, the teacher may carry on with their normal routine of turning to face the white board while talking about what they are writing. However, the moment they break visual contact, that child is isolated from the rest of the class. Or teachers may do what they have done down the generations and walk to the back of the class while carrying on talking, leaving everybody looking at the white board. In those circumstances, deaf children who rely on lip-reading do not know what the teacher is saying. These little things are forgotten about because that child looks just like every other child in the class.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/21">Too often, many deaf children are isolated and are mocked because they sound strange when they talk, which is often interpreted as their being stupid, although they are not. These children are sometimes definitely, as the play once said, regarded as children of a lesser god; they are people with severe disabilities, but nobody quite recognises that or feels comfortable in that recognition.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/22">How galling for deaf sports people to find that, right now, essentially for a paltry sum of &pound;42,000 a year, their hopes and aspirations are likely to be tossed aside. Other athletes who are perhaps more visually disabled&mdash;we can see and understand that they have suffered and struggled to get to their position as athletes&mdash;receive all our plaudits. These other athletes sometimes receive the sympathy of society far more easily than those who have a hearing impairment. Other disabled athletes have essentially been granted the &pound;47 million and the rest of the athletes receive the &pound;256 million, which, as I said, is a sizeable sum on which the Government and others should be congratulated. But people should remember that all the deaf athletes were asking for was a small sum to make it back to defend their title and compete successfully in the Olympics, as I believe they would have done.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.1/23">No wonder, then, that deaf athletes too often see themselves as being shunted out of sight and out of mind. I plead with the Minister, who I know is a reasonable individual, simply to review this situation and recognise that no matter what happens, these athletes deserve a better deal than the one they have had. Society cannot simply shunt them off into a corner. These young men and women deserve the chance to reach their full potential, whether in football teams or in the Paralympics. It is time for us to change our attitude to people with a hearing impairment and give them the opportunity to play a fuller part in society and to receive the plaudits that they are their due when they compete successfully.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.0/1">It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Wilshire. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> on securing this debate and for the spirit in which he has put forward the case for his constituent, Ollie Monksfield, to whom I send my regards and best wishes on his career. I was appalled to hear what happened to him in respect of the football club and I am happy to speak to the right hon. Gentleman afterwards to talk about that. It is appalling that that happened to somebody with Ollie's talents.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/2">I am aware of the long and proud history of the Deaflympics, which held its first summer games in Paris in 1924. Both the summer and winter Deaflympics are sanctioned by the International Olympic Committee. Although I acknowledge that the Deaflympics is not a contest between nations and that there is no classification at national level in the transcript of results, it would be remiss of me not to add my congratulations to the team on its success in Melbourne 2005, when it won 16 medals in eight sports&mdash;more than the host nation, Australia. I take great delight in our teams beating Australia at so many things, as the right hon. Gentleman knows.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/3">I understand UK Deaf Sport's disappointment with the decision to cease funding the football team from this year. I should like to clarify why this difficult decision has been taken. That is not just a decision made in respect of UK Deaf Sport: nine sports were affected by UK Sport's decision. I will write to the right hon. Gentleman, setting out the details of those sports.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/4">As the right hon. Gentleman said, UK Sport's primary goal is to support our ambitious targets for places in the top four on the medal table at the London Olympics and for second place in the Paralympics. This is clearly set out in the formal funding agreement between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and UK Sport. As a result, UK Sport has focussed its investment on providing funding support to our very best Olympic and Paralympic sports and athletes through their world class performance programme. This focusing of investment&mdash;this no-compromise approach&mdash;helped the Olympic team to achieve its best performance in 100 years in Beijing and it is why the Paralympic team maintained its second position in the medal table, despite an increasingly competitive field.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/5">UK Sport's policy does not discriminate against deaf or hard-of-hearing athletes. Deaf athletes who meet the criteria for UK Sport's world class performance programme in either an Olympic or Paralympic sport will be supported. There are currently three athletes on the programme who are deaf or have declared a hearing impairment. In the past, that programme included the diver Antonio Ally, who competed in the 2004 Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/6">UK Sport has taken a hard look at all its funding over the past few years to align it with its Olympic and Paralympic goals in the lead-up to London 2012. UK Deaf Sport has been impacted by this review, but it is not the only organisation to be affected. Neither I nor UK Sport revels in these difficult decisions that disappoint people, but we need to take them and to decide where best to place our resources to make the biggest impact on our goals. The outcome of this consideration is a focus of our resource on Olympic and Paralympic sports and athletes, but even these sports are not immune to the current financial restrictions. That is why we have tasked UK Sport with leading on a project to develop a permanent private sector funding stream for Olympic and Paralympic sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/7">I should also like to put on the record that I am satisfied that UK Sport has treated UK Deaf Sport fairly during this difficult process. It provided a one-off payment of &pound;75,000 to support our team at the 2005 Deaflympics in Melbourne. In addition, it committed to provide funding of &pound;42,000 per year for the three-year period from <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-01">1 April 2005</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March 2008</phrase>. At the time, UK Sport made it clear that this funding was being provided to help UK Deaf Sport develop its organisational structure and other streams of revenue and that such funding would cease after 31st March 2008. This position has been reaffirmed to UK Deaf Sport on a number of occasions since then. As the right hon. Gentleman said, UK Deaf Sport appealed against UK Sport's decision to an independent panel chaired by a Queen's counsel. The panel dismissed the appeal, finding in favour of UK Sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/8">I want to continue in the spirit in which the right hon. Gentleman raised this matter. It is right and proper for me, as Minister with responsibility for sport, to outline the Government's wider commitment to improving equality of opportunity from the grassroots up. The right hon. Gentleman will know that Sport England has recently made awards totalling &pound;480 million over the next four years to 46 national governing bodies. For the first time, this includes funding for four Paralympic sports&mdash;boccia, goalball, wheelchair basketball, and wheelchair rugby&mdash;with awards worth in excess of &pound;2 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/9">All NGBs have been challenged to come up with plans that deliver participation growth right across the community. The criteria on which plans were assessed included their ability to deliver for priority groups. Those willing and able to do more are able to access more funding and, as a result, several sports are adopting challenging participation targets in this area. I was interested to notice that the right hon. Gentleman did not mention the Football Association. I am not sure whether the FA is contributing to deaf football, so perhaps we need to discuss that further afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/10">Direct support is also provided through the English Federation of Disability Sport, which includes UK Deaf Sport amongst its affiliates. The EFDS was provided with more than &pound;1 million of core Exchequer funding last year, with additional lottery grants to support disabled participation in sport. As part of the new award process, Sport England will also be offering new two-year funding settlements to its national partners from a &pound;10 million pot. That is open to the EFDS and other organisations such as Sporting Equals and the Women's Sport and Fitness Foundation. The EFDS is working on its bid and how it will make connections into the NGB delivery system. I encourage UK Deaf Sport to work closely with the EFDS and its other members to ensure the best outcome for deaf sport.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/11">Hon. Members should be aware that we have committed a further &pound;4 million over the next four years to the EFDS and partner governing bodies to work with Sport England, the Youth Sport Trust and Paralympics GB to role out the new playground-to-podium programme. That will ensure that our young disabled people in the community and schools are exposed to the highest quality development programmes, and that talent is given a chance to shine through. That will, of course, benefit young deaf athletes who want to progress to UK Sport's world-class pathway programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/12">The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that the Government are also investing more than &pound;780 million through the PE and sport strategy for young people over the next three years. The strategy has equity at its heart and will reach out to all groups of young people who have been historically underrepresented in sport, including young people with disabilities. For example, by 2011 we will have in place a new network of 450 multi-sport clubs for young disabled people. The clubs will provide high-quality participation alongside competitive opportunities, as well as a focus on progression through high-quality coaching in a variety of sports. As importantly, we will provide schools and teachers with appropriate assistance and support to make those clubs successful. I fully understand UK Deaf Sport's disappointment and frustration, but these are difficult times, and we want to support our elite athletes for the London 2012 cycle. On behalf of the right hon. Gentleman's constituent, I am happy to explore the football element of his problem and to see what could be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.0/13">The thrust of what we are trying to do is to ensure that EFDS puts itself aside from the main interest of each disability and tries to find a co-ordinated response on disability sport. We must give weight to the EFDS, which is the organisation to ensure that it can get to the NGBs, to which we have given funds. The bureaucracy has gone from Sport England, and the money goes straight to the NGBs.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.0/1">That is a fair point, and I will speak not just to UK Sport, but to Sport England and the Youth Sport Trust when such situations arise. I am hoping that the English Federation of Disability Sport will become a stronger advocate for disability sport with the national governing bodies. One element of the support for governing bodies is that they have varying capacity to deal with certain issues. I want to set a standard for governing bodies, and to support those that do not reach that standard through no fault of their own&mdash;perhaps because they are run by volunteers or because of their capabilities. I am encouraging Sport England to examine each governing body to see what can be done to raise their capacity, and to consider where the gaps are in their whole sport plans, which each national governing body has submitted, and their priorities of how to reach hard-to-reach groups, of which disability sport is a key element.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/2">I will take away some of the issues that the right hon. Gentleman has raised. I cannot make any promises about UK Deaf Sport and other sports that lost funding, but I hope that the EFDS review will be more forthcoming in the longer term. The right hon. Gentleman was right to raise the matter, and I will consider what can be done for the individual to whom he referred.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-16b.55.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1535" speakername="Mark Todd" colnum="55"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090616/halltext/90616h0009.htm#09061627000524">
	<p pid="b.55.2/1">This subject is familiar to me. Insomniacs will find that I have spoken on it in the past and that I led an Adjournment debate on it some years back. I will explain why there is an interest in my constituency in the subject, but first I shall set out a basic principle. I regard the consumption of food supplements in the same way as I regard the consumption of foods. It is largely a matter for the individual consumer to decide what they eat, based on advice from the Government about safety and an appropriate balance in the diet. Therefore, the key driver in this area should be the determination of safe levels of supplements that people should be entitled to consume. I am a libertarian in this matter and always have been.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/2">However, the approach in this country differs from that taken in many other member states in the European Union, with which we are attempting to reach agreement on how to regular the sector. Our approach is not common elsewhere in the European Union. Here, supplements can be purchased in a wide range of places: supermarkets, high street retailers, pharmacies and online. In some member states that take particularly restrictive approaches, these items, if available at all&mdash;many cannot be obtained at the dose level available in this country&mdash;are obtainable only through a pharmacist.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/3">Therefore, when the European Union decided that we should seek to produce a single market for the products, it was entirely predictable that it would be hard to achieve that goal and impossible to achieve it through total consensus. I should make it clear that nevertheless I support the efforts to achieve that goal. It should be possible for a consumer in any part of the European Union to be assured of receiving a quality product and to be able to purchase it freely. That should be possible whether they are in our country or any other part of the Union. Furthermore, that would benefit companies operating in the UK&mdash;manufacturers and retailers&mdash;that are experienced in selling these quality products to consumers and that would welcome the opening up of opportunities elsewhere in the Union. It is certainly not my view that we should resist that process. However, I want to ensure that we do not sacrifice important UK consumer freedoms in achieving that goal.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/4">As I said, I have a local interest in the matter. Although the company has gone through a variety of owners in my time as a Member of Parliament, it remains a substantial manufacturer in my area, and is now owned by Brunel Healthcare. Its site in Swadlincote is the No. 1 supplier of private-label vitamins and mineral supplements in the UK. It employs 180 staff. The impact on that business of the manufacturing of generic products, although by no means immaterial, will be relatively small. However, the parent company owns a collection of specialist health food brands that would clearly suffer from some of the possible consequences of the regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/5">The critical points that now need to be resolved&mdash;we are part-way through this process&mdash;are the maximum permitted levels of nutrients to be provided within supplements. The first test is safety: what is safe for a human being to consume? That is not an entirely straightforward question to answer. We have had difficulties in the past with the debate about vitamin B6. That has shown that achieving a degree of scientific consensus is not easy in an area that perhaps has not been subject to as much scientific scrutiny as others. Nevertheless, a reasonable body of research is available and it should be possible to produce a degree of certainty in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/6">The European Food Safety Authority has produced a list of safe levels for nutrients as part of the exercise. Understandably, however, that is not the whole answer, because those levels have to be moderated to take account of the quantities of nutrients present in other food sources and then assessed against the typical diets of European citizens. Those of us who travel reasonably freely will find that diets vary quite a lot across Europe. One might hope to be able to reach a standard position that says, for example, &quot;This is how much fish oil might be consumed.&quot; However, it is by no means obvious that that is common across the European Union; nor is access to sunlight, which is a critical issue in deciding on vitamin D, for example. It is necessary to take account of a range of factors. In relation to the kind of nutrients that a particular diet should contain, there are also important ethnic characteristics to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/7">Producing a solid set of recommendations with firm certainty about them will not be possible; there will be substantial variances. Therefore, the culture of how that is done is quite important. The temptation, which the industry feels people will give in to, is to set the limits at the lowest conceivable level, taking into account all the variables that might be present and disregarding the consumer's own wish to make many of their own judgments. It is felt that one outcome would be to bar quite a number of products that British consumers have been used to having access to for a very considerable time, without any side effects that have concerned them up to now. It is not desirable for us to take that chance, so how we represent the UK position to the Commission is vital.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/8">The Government, after a somewhat sleepy start a few years back, have been vigorous in arguing for the sector's interests and discussing with the sector the implications of possible models of regulation. However, we must face the fact that we have relatively few allies. As I said, much of Europe operates on a different model for the distribution of the products. Out of self-interest perhaps or, to put it more charitably, genuine anxiety at the lack of familiarity with the availability of such products in their countries, many countries will be inclined towards setting very low maximum levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/9">I want to suggest some ways through the situation. We should prepare the way for a solution that permits some UK exceptions to the maximum levels that may be agreed. We have had the intellectual argument&mdash;I strongly endorse it&mdash;as to the principles of how the regulation should be set. However, it is reasonably clear that we shall not be able to assemble a blocking vote to support our position, so how do we ensure that we proceed in a way that will not harm our industry or the interests of UK consumers?</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/10">First, clear communication to consumers about the function of supplements in any diet can help. The Government already promote the use of supplements in certain circumstances. Advice is given on the supplements that a woman ought to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding. However, we also give advice in respect of those whose sun exposure may be very low, children in certain circumstances and those of particular ethnic origins who may need to supplement their diet in certain ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/11">The UK national diet and nutrition surveys of 1998 and 2003 showed various deficiencies in diet, on which any Government could provide proper advice. The surveys showed that 86 per cent. of UK adults consumed less than five portions of fruit and vegetables and that adults generally consumed less than one third of the recommended levels of fish oil. Dosages in the UK can be set in the context of robust information, permitting UK departures from any limits that vary materially from our current approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/12">As I have discussed with industry participants, eating five portions of fruit and vegetables a day and consuming the correct amounts of various items&mdash;the perfect balanced diet&mdash;is how we should aspire to provide the nutrients that we need, but given the complex lives that many of our citizens lead, and the conflicting advice that some of them feel they receive about what they should eat, many of our aspirations will be thwarted. We must be realistic. Stronger communication can be provided about how to supplement inadequacies in diet.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/13">Secondly, our northern location should, in any case, justify higher limits for certain supplements, such as those based around vitamin D. Clearly, we are different from Greece and southern Italy, and it is simply crazy to set a measure that ignores our climate and our geography.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/14">Thirdly, we should ensure that the industry attaches appropriate warnings to items whose dose levels might be higher than the recommended maximum levels that emerge from the Commission process. Consumers should be allowed reasonable discretion based on a stronger knowledge of the place that a supplement might have in a diet. Part of the package that I am suggesting is more robust communication of any remaining risks, although, to be honest, such risks would be small, given the way in which we regulate the sector. Nevertheless, such measures would provide some reassurance to our European partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/15">Finally, and generally, any limits that are set should permit revision based on new research and new models of consumer behaviour. Diet changes over time, and so, too, does sunlight. We must therefore accept a variety of factors as part of the matrix in determining policy. Any limits should not, therefore, be set in stone; there should be a process for revising them and bringing them closer to the reality of life in the day in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/16">I turn now to the industry's role. The industry must be realistic. Simply opposing the setting of maximum dosage levels and implicitly resisting the directive cannot be effective in the long term. We simply do not have the votes to carry that position, because the UK has few allies on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/17">At some point&mdash;the expectation is that it will be early next year&mdash;the Commission will press ahead with its initiative. If the industry can agree a combination of a distinctive UK market difference, leading to derogation in certain aspects and backed by clear obligations, and some minor concessions on dosage levels&mdash;that important qualification will not be welcomed by the whole industry&mdash;a deal can perhaps be struck.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/18">One difficulty has been the understandable unwillingness to define where the priorities lie in protecting the ramparts. Protecting everything that is currently available may not be a realistic position, but it may be possible to make some small concessions. If we do not take that approach, we will be forced to accept a position that will disadvantage our consumers and disable our manufacturers, who would otherwise be well placed to exploit single-market opportunities. Not taking such an approach will also distort a currently very diverse sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/19">Major UK manufacturers will face a short-term, relatively minor loss and then, we hope, enjoy the benefit of a larger marketplace. Generally, it will be the smaller specialist retailers and manufacturers who suffer and whose distinct offerings will be removed. One large retailer with a strong higher-dose product range will also face major damage and challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.2/20">The industry and the Government have not always managed to work well together. We need a determined effort over the next six months to produce a sustainable UK position that protects what we have. Such steps do not suggest that we have lost the argument, and I myself powerfully expound the argument that safety is the bottom line in what we are doing. As I said at the start, I firmly believe that our approach has been right and that our sector is vigorous and competitive and that it serves consumers, but we must face the reality that others do not accept our philosophy and we must construct an appropriate and robust plan B.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-16b.62.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="62"  time="013:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090616/halltext/90616h0010.htm#09061627000530">
	<p pid="b.62.1/1">I am pleased that we can start a little early, which may enable us to dwell at greater length on the subject of the debate, which is the potential of aerosol technology to play a major role in tackling some issues relevant to climate change. I see the debate as having a six-fold objective: first, to highlight a technology that could assist in the battle against climate change; secondly, to highlight a technology that I believe could be a world leader, and therefore of huge benefit to UK plc; thirdly, to draw attention to the work of Mike Garrett MBE, who is the innovator with respect to the technology; fourthly, to give the Minister an opportunity to set out the Government's position on this important issue; fifthly, perhaps to secure a meeting with the Minister and her officials, at a later date, to discuss the matter in greater detail&mdash;particularly with reference to what assistance the Government may be able to give; and, finally, to clarify what action the UK Government can take at European level to promote the type of technology in question.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/2">Before I go into detail about the technology, it may be worth recognising that with respect to climate change the Government have taken some significant steps, most recently with the Climate Change Act 2008. The Minister will be very familiar with the legally binding targets in that measure, which also set up the carbon budgeting system, with its caps on emissions over five-year periods, and created the Committee on Climate Change. I acknowledge that the Government have taken action to date.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/3">It is also worth dwelling on the fact that perhaps the best example of international action on CFCs that directly affected aerosols was the Montreal convention. Only when the international community identified the problem&mdash;the hole in the ozone layer&mdash;and finally decided that it had the will to do something about it was it possible to address that serious environmental problem. I acknowledge that the Montreal protocol has not completed the job, but 190 countries and the European Community have ratified it. By 2005, the parties to that protocol had phased out the production and consumption of more than 95 per cent. of all the chemicals controlled by the protocol, and we are now beginning to see a reversal in the damage being done to the ozone layer. The protocol's provisions should ensure that the ozone layer will return to pre-1980 levels by 2050 or 2075. I refer to that only to show that when a decision is taken to do something it is possible to achieve a global change.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/4">I turn to the meat of the debate. KBIG is the company driving the challenge. I have no interest to declare other than the fact that the business is based in my constituency. I have met people from the company on a couple of occasions, and I believe that it is doing work of great value. It was co-founded by Mike Garrett, who invented the Vitox oxygen dissolver. I hope that the Minister will not ask me to give a precise explanation of what it does.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/5">Vitox is a market leader. It is used for the highly efficient addition of oxygen to polluted and waste water treatment plants. That is my understanding of what it does; it clearly plays an important role. Many such units are operating throughout the world&mdash;for instance, in reclaiming polluted waters in Hong Kong harbour and in emergency use on the River Thames. Indeed, many here today will be familiar with the Thames Bubbler, which runs along the river putting oxygen back into the water. It is one example of the work being done by Mike Garrett on aerosol technology, which I am about to outline in some detail. It is a creditable product, which has been rolled out worldwide. As an inventor, Mr. Garrett should be credited with identifying and developing new products.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/6">I now come to a more detailed description of the aerosol technology, which I believe could make a substantial difference to climate change. I do not apologise for the technicality of the description; it is necessary to demonstrate that the technology is viable, well researched and is not lacking in credibility or substance.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/7">KBIG's technology provides a new form of propellant for use in delivering products, especially in aerosols&mdash;a propellant that is more environmentally safe than conventional liquid gas. Given concerns over CO2 emissions, it is important that it is recovered from existing industrial processes. It is not newly created CO2, but is recovered from other industrial processes.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/8">It works by using an activated carbon adsorbent. The properties of the propellant are modified to produce a low pressure drop from a full to an empty canister as the product is dispensed. The pressure change is lower than that of a liquid propellant subjected to the typical variations caused by changes in ambient temperature. Furthermore, the pressure drop can be largely tailored to a value commensurate with the required properties of the canister in use. For those familiar with aerosol products, the technology is particularly suitable for use with internally bagged products. The aerosol contains a bag with the propellant, so it is commercially viable but cost neutral as against petroleum-based products.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/9">Members will know that liquefied gas propellants have been used in aerosols for many decades, although everyone will be familiar with some of their drawbacks. They contribute to major environmental damage. Aerosol cans should not be put on a fire as they are flammable, and explosive when mixed with air. Aerosols also feature in solvent abuse&mdash;something that all Members will want to reduce. Members may not be aware, however, that aerosols can cause allergic reactions; and important to the manufacturer and retailer is the fact they can introduce undesirable odours into the canister product</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/10">Pressure changes in liquefied gas propellants caused by changes in the ambient temperature can lead a complete loss of propellant effect in cold weather. One solution to this is the use of permanent gases such as air or carbon dioxide; the pressure alters less in response to temperature changes but it is rapidly lost as the contents of the canister are expelled. A propellant system is required that captures the better features of both systems&mdash;one that is not dangerous but one that will ensure that the aerosol does not experience the significant drop in pressure that makes the remainder of the product redundant.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/11">The sort of propellant developed by KBIG was first proposed decades ago. However, until recently no viable commercial implementation had been secured. KBIG developed the product, asking manufactures and others to challenge it and say whether it would do the job, and then refined the process to ensure that the product was commercially viable and functioned as the manufacturers wanted. A programme to achieve this was initiated by KBIG in 2003, with a number of industrial partners. Solutions were tested and refined to enable the technology to meet the exacting criteria necessary for commercialisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/12">I have a physics degree, but I do not know what the Minister's background is. However, although I understand something of how the propellant works, some of it required a little explanation from Mr. Garrett. Adsorption is the phenomenon of gas molecules becoming reversibly attached to a surface of a material by the interaction of molecular forces. The number of molecules held on the surface is dependent on the surface area, the temperature, the pressure, and the nature of the gas and the surface. Normally the adsorption is not very evident, but some materials have a porous or layered structure that results in much larger surface area. In case it was not understandable, I shall illustrate the important point: given the nature of the element, 2 ml of activated carbon has a surface area of 1,500 sq m. Considering that 2 ml is smaller than the inside of the circle that I am making with my finger, to have a surface area of 1,500 sq m is quite dramatic. That is why activated carbon is so useful in providing the propellant capacity needed for aerosols.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/13">Workers attempting to incorporate activated carbon as an aerosol propellant encountered problems. For example, initially, the heat generated was sufficient to melt the plastic components in the canister, and other difficulties were encountered in ensuring consistent performance. Also, a priority was to ensure a product without impurities, which&mdash;I guess&mdash;reduce the level of absorption and, therefore, the efficacy of the propellant. However, various ways of reducing and eliminating such problems were identified.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/14">I must now get very technical again on the manufacturing of aerosols. However, I am sure that if my technical description is inadequate, the representatives of KBIG here today will set me right. The system is designed to be incorporated into existing bag-on-valve gassing and filling lines. To keep out impurities, the activated carbon granules are added under an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. The source material for the carbon granules is coconut shell. This widely available waste product has the advantage of providing both the activated carbon and the energy source for firing the furnaces needed to create it in the first place. It is a very environmentally friendly process fired by carbon already created through the process of generating the activated carbon. The carbon granules are then absorbed by the aerosol, and as the aerosol is used and the product expelled, creating a vacuum within the aerosol, the gas caught in that 1,500 sq m of surface area can be released into the aerosol. It will maintain the pressure and ensure that the product continues to work. That is a layman's explanation of how it works.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/15">KBIG thinks that this technology will be attractive to fillers&mdash;it is already in discussions, but I shall mention no names&mdash;because adding the granules to the production line, and placing them in the canisters, is a very simple process. Very little, if anything, is required for the re-tooling of manufacturing lines to put that into operation. The inertness of carbon dioxide, combined with its non-flammability&mdash;there are no worries about putting the aerosol on a fire&mdash;makes it a good replacement for LPG-type propellants. Given the flammable nature of existing propellants, it will also ensure a lower risk of incident within the manufacturing environment.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/16">I hope that I have given the Minister a reasonable feel for this technology, how it works and why it has significant and very positive environmental implications. However, in case I have not already convinced her, and to illustrate my point further, I shall give some figures. She will be aware that, between 1990 and 2006, UK emissions from volatile organic compounds fell by 62 per cent. However, as of 2006, it is estimated that solvent and other product use accounts for 44 per cent. of VOC emissions. That will have a climate change impact. Providing an alternative type of propellant and doing away with LPG-type propellants will reduce those emissions and have the associated and very positive climate change benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.1/17">I hope that the Minister will agree that this type of product has the potential to be a world leader and of huge benefit to UK plc, and KBIG is certainly willing to put its product to any test that interested companies or bodies want to put it to. I also hope that the Minister has noted the work done by Mike Garrett MBE on the product. I would now like to give her the opportunity to set out the Government's position on aerosols, climate change and, perhaps, on this particular technology. Is she willing to meet with those involved, should it be thought helpful? I also hope that she will set out the action that the UK Government can take to ensure that this type of technology is promoted within the European Union, which is considering the issue of aerosols, gases and so on. There might be an opportunity to push for these measures in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> on securing this useful debate. I can assure him, as a science graduate myself, that I was able to follow his technical explanations. This debate raises an important environmental issue with implications for addressing climate change. It is certainly helpful to consider possible alternatives to the use of volatile organic compounds in aerosol propellants.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/2">The UK aerosol industry is a dominant player in the European market, producing 25 per cent. of all the aerosols used in Europe. The UK produces 1.4 billion aerosols annually, of which more than 50 per cent. are exported, and consumes about 600 million units across the different application sectors. The aerosol industry has reacted responsibly to past environmental issues. After chlorofluorocarbons&mdash;CFCs&mdash;were found to be the ozone-depleting substances causing the so-called &quot;ozone hole&quot; over the Antarctic, the industry voluntarily removed CFCs from consumer aerosols 20 years ago&mdash;ahead of the ban under the Montreal protocol.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/3">Hydrofluorocarbons&mdash;or HFCs&mdash;were then found to be greenhouse gases, and a voluntary restriction on HFC use in aerosols has been in place since 1995. The aerosol industry has worked with the European Commission to revise the 2008 aerosol dispensers directive to try to solve issues associated with the use of compressed gas as a propellant. It is important that the industry continues to keep developments in propellant technology under review, in relation to both environmental and application issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/4">The hon. Gentleman mentioned that it is usual to use propane and butane as the main propellant in aerosol products for most applications, as it enables them to meet the efficacy and high-level performance required from these products. The VOCs utilised in aerosols serve three main functions: first, they generate good quality sprays; secondly, they are quick-drying solvents that allow the product to be applied in the correct proportions; and finally, they keep the pressure in the can constant, so that the aerosol stays in an effective state until it is finished. Consequently, these sprays emit VOCs into the atmosphere. However, it is worth noting that they are only one of a number of emission sources of man-made VOCs. There are also natural and biogenic volatile organic compounds that are emitted from trees and vegetation, particularly in the summer. As a result, VOCs from aerosol sprays account for a very small amount of all VOCs emissions and, where feasible, the industry has developed products so that they contain the minimum amount. To put this in context, inventory estimates show that total anthropogenic emissions of VOCs in the UK in 2007 were 940,000 tonnes, of which about 6 per cent. were estimated to be from aerosols.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.1/1">I could not agree more. Having just set the world's first carbon budget in this Parliament I am more than aware of just how stretching our targets are. It is important to get the context and to see what the contribution might be, which is what I am currently doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/2">A reaction with nitrogen oxides in the lower atmosphere produces ground-level ozone and other photochemical oxidants. It is worth bearing in mind that we have identified around 200 different VOCs that can contribute to ozone formation. Some are more reactive and so cause more ozone to form than others. If present at high enough levels, ozone can be harmful to human health and damage vegetation. Ozone is also a greenhouse gas, so VOCs have an indirect, though small, effect on the resultant warming of the atmosphere. The hydrocarbons in LPG have a low global warming potential, owing to their indirect effects on ozone and also methane, but the warming caused by VOC emissions from aerosols is only slight. Although their environmental impact is relatively small, the Government welcome any further reductions in aerosol emissions of VOCs into the atmosphere. We are willing to hear direct from any company that has developed aerosol products that are potentially beneficial to the environment, such as those based on alternative propellant systems using compressed gas, so that we can consider whether to factor them in to our environmental policy as appropriate. We are interested in being informed about the activated carbon and carbon dioxide propellant system to which the hon. Gentleman referred in this debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.0/1">Indeed we do, as does the European Union, which has been progressing discussions on how to reduce the level of VOCs that people are exposed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.0/2">As a result of hearing about this technology, my officials have contacted the company concerned to find out more about the product, and to provide details of relevant contacts in both my Department and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. As for the question about whether a meeting could be facilitated, I am more than happy for that to happen, and I am sure that the officials will be delighted, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.0/3">I have noted from the hon. Gentleman's comments that this particular technology is claimed to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. He made the point that it was the use of existing CO2 that was coming from waste products. Clearly, any use of CO2 causes concerns as does whole life cycle analyses. When he talks about producing activated carbon and using furnaces to do that, there has to be a whole life cycle analysis to make proper comparisons. We would need to be convinced that there is such a benefit, despite this apparent contradiction&mdash;CO2 being our major greenhouse gas&mdash;and that using CO2 in that way would not produce the problems that were encountered when replacing CFCs and then getting a gas that in itself was even more problematic. If this technology does indeed have the net effect of removing some CO2 from the atmosphere, then it would certainly be welcomed. However, the efficacy of such so-called &quot;green&quot; propellant systems is also a key factor to consider, as well as their overall carbon footprint. My understanding is that although the aerosol industry&mdash;both in the UK and worldwide&mdash;has a strong interest in developing compressed gas systems, which offer a similarly high level and consistency of performance as liquefied gas systems, so far they have had only limited applicability. Clearly that is another factor that needs to be considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.67.0/4">On a broader point, perhaps more consideration should also be given to alternatives to aerosols. I stress that point because behaviour change is one of the keys to reaching our carbon targets, and there are many means by which people can dispense the products that they seek to use, particularly when it comes to products such as deodorants and antiperspirants that do not require the use of aerosols themselves.</p>
