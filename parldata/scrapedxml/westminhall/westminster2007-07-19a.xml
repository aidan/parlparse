<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.138.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" speakername="John Mann" colnum="138"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0001.htm#070719106000307">
	<p pid="a.138.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for those comments. It is not parliamentary terminology to call him my hon. Friend, but he certainly is a good and close friend from our work on this issue, which demonstrates the importance of cross-party co-operation. The involvement of Northern Ireland was certainly a vital factor, as was the fact that Members who had no describable vested interest participated in the process, thus giving it authenticity and creating a benchmark. One could argue with the details&mdash;one always can&mdash;but the benchmark exists for the future. People can look at the work and ask, &quot;What is Parliament saying on anti-Semitism?&quot; or &quot;What is Parliament's view on what is happening in the outside world, and what should be done about it?&quot; That benchmark can be used by us and others and will exist for years to come. It is a vital tool, which will allow us to hold the Government to greater account.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/2">Albert Einstein said that</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/3" class="indent">&quot;implementation is the vehicle of genius&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/4">Implementation is the difficult part with any such report. Identifying the problems is one issue&mdash;and there are many, because anti-Semitism is a growing problem&mdash;but implementing recommendations from the report in respect of which there is dialogue with the Government is a far greater one. I do not intend to spend any time going through the report, because both it and the Government's response are available to read, and I shall not waste Parliament's time by going through those issues again, although other hon. Members will need to home in on some of the specifics in their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/5">I want to address two points in detail, the first of which concerns civic society and its institutions. The report gave a message beyond Parliament about what society should be doing about anti-Semitism. I shall give two examples of where there could be progress, on which I shall be interested to hear the Minister's views. Secondly, there are some specifics about Government implementation that I would like the Minister to clarify or repeat.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/6">The examples from civic society include what I consider to be priorities&mdash;the worlds of sport and football. Yesterday, I convened a meeting of the football world about anti-Semitism in football, as a starting point. There is clearly a role for the Government regarding anti-Semitism in football, but not a leading role because the football authorities and the football world itself must deal with those problems. At the meeting, we discussed in detail the growth of anti-Semitism in community football and football across the country. We also discussed the problems in the professional game, in which there is anti-Semitism on the terraces and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/7">There was one major, encouraging factor and one negative factor at the meeting. The encouraging factor was the involvement of the England supporters associations. A range of active England supporters from official supporters' bodies were at the meeting, some of whom are stewards at local clubs, such as Millwall and Southampton. They gave good examples of best practice when dealing with racism and anti-Semitism in professional football. They are prepared, as volunteers and spectators within the sport, to participate with intelligence. The number of England fans who attended was one of the most encouraging things I have seen since I have been involved in chairing the all-party group in the past two years. It gave a powerful message that many people are our allies in dealing with racism: people beyond the normal, expected sources&mdash;out there in the world we know well. I hesitate to use the term &quot;ordinary world&quot;, but I am talking about the world outside. The practical suggestions from there were incredibly valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/8">The negative thing was that some football clubs chose not to attend&mdash;I know that they must be very busy. I agreed at the meeting and put it on the record that I would write to those clubs offering them the opportunity to participate in the debate. Representatives of Arsenal football club, West Ham United and Chelsea, who were unfortunately too busy to attend yesterday's meeting&mdash;unlike the Football Association, Tottenham Hotspur, the England fans and many others&mdash;will get the opportunity to participate in a debate. They have been written to, as has Leeds United, which I know well and which has been mentioned on a number of occasions. Those four clubs have been written to today to entice them into the debate on anti-Semitism. Given that that is now on the record, I am sure that they will be keen to participate. We are looking for an important section of civil society to take the lead. We as parliamentarians can play our role in assisting that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/9">The second example from civic society is the universities. I know that others will want to talk about the universities' so-called boycott. Of course, there is no boycott and there will be no boycott; it is a misnomer given by a group of people who have time on their hands. They have nobody to negotiate on the real issues affecting their work force, which is perhaps why their membership seems to be going down rather than up and will continue to do so if they choose to pick on the frivolities of life, such as intellectual debates, rather than the real stuff of life, such as the terms and conditions of their members.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.0/10">Without question it is the role of university leaders to ensure that every student, including every Jewish student, can work in an atmosphere on campus that encourages study. We can get hung up on statistics. I do not look for violent attacks to quantify the problem on campus&mdash;I assess the smell and sight on campus, what people hear there, and what we in the community call antisocial behaviour. Those are not things that, in themselves, would ever warrant police involvement, and &quot;atmosphere&quot; is probably the best word to describe them. The accumulation of such elements means that people are not happy in what they are doing, or are making choices because of what they perceive they will have to go through. That is a growing problem on our university campuses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.142.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1529" speakername="Tim Boswell" colnum="142"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0001.htm#070719106000314">
	<p pid="a.142.0/1">I thank my colleague who is, in this context, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> for his contribution. I also thank the colleague whom I call for this purpose my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> for leading our inquiry. There are times in this place&mdash;we all understand them&mdash;when confrontation, rude noises and lively debate are entirely appropriate. We should have the lively debate about this subject, but confrontation is not appropriate. We were surprised by the coincidence of view that we established during the four-part inquiry, which enabled us to produce an agreed report.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/2">In terms of teeth, my hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has set the Government some challenges, which I echo rather than repeat. It is important, as I shall signal at the end of my remarks, that we do not just have this process, walk away from it and let nothing very much happen. I want to make a number of comments about different aspects of the report, rather than speaking abut the whole thing, and I hope that we shall build up a picture of some of the problems that we identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/3">In the history of racially driven, religiously driven and other sorts of hate crime, anti-Semitism must be the oldest. We cannot absolve ourselves of our record in English mediaeval history, and during the 20th century there were emanations of the most unimaginably appalling hate crime in western Europe. We owe it to the history of anti-Semitism to explore it, to be alert, and to look at the matter seriously. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw outlined our thought process when examining it, and I want to stress that at all times we came to the subject as what might be described in diplomatic language as non-aligned persons. I do not have an exclusive brief from either side of the Israel-Palestine issue. I do not have Jewish ancestry, or a significant Jewish population in my constituency. The issue is not a political one for me, but it is an issue for the country and for Parliament, and I echo what my hon. Friend said.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/4">We can set an example by calling the nation's attention to the matter, and polishing our own act when that is appropriate. For example, as political parties, we must get on with the job of ensuring that our candidate selection is not biased in that respect, and that there is no preference in working people's clubs and so on that discriminates against Jewish or other people. We should be able to speak out about local incidents of anti-Semitism, and I hope give exemplary voice to international incidents. The words that come to mind are: sunlight is the best disinfectant. The source is not precisely tied down, but I think those words came from an American Chief Justice, and they informed our process. Let us find out what the problem is, publish it and do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/5">The Committee was balanced in its conclusion on the nature of anti-Semitism. I would be the last to minimise the danger of the traditional far right, because it is still there, and it is extremely unacceptable. It is as difficult for a Conservative party as it is for a centre left party, and we have no time for it. There has been a change on the political left, and I shall draw a distinction between that and another element. I sense from outside&mdash;other hon. Members may want to comment on this&mdash;a move away from political support for Israel as the imaginative and innovative democratic state of the early years of its inception towards a closer identification with the Palestinian cause or otherwise, or a distaste for the current Israeli Government, but I leave that as a matter of speculation. I do not think I can remember during my political career quite such organised distaste on the left that, however hard it is covered up&mdash;sometimes it may be genuinely motivated for political rather than racist reasons&mdash;comes out as anti-Semitism all too often. There has been press comment to that effect recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/6">The third element&mdash;I do not know whether it is the middle way, but it is certainly not acceptable&mdash;is that of Islamic radicalism, which reflects the boiling hatreds in the middle east. We saw that when we tracked overt incidents of anti-Semitism with reference to the state of the political climate, the inception of intifada and so on, which has undoubtedly contributed to the problem. On the other hand, I would not want to signal to anyone that it has anything to do with the political argument in the middle east, because I do not believe that it has. Many Jewish people and I, as a non-Jewish person, have reservations about the conduct of some aspects of the Israeli Government, and clearly I share that with much of the population in that democratic country. We are not debating the middle east this afternoon, but we must acknowledge that it plays into a situation with underlying tensions, all of which are unacceptable, and must be faced and put down.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/7">A point that we did not bring out in the report, but which underlies some of the concerns, is that the Jewish community was traditionally the most significant and distinct religious and ethnic minority in the United Kingdom, but with large-scale immigration from the new Commonwealth since the second world war that has changed, and the Islamic population is perhaps six times that of the Jewish population. That situation is likely to give rise to tensions in certain localities, but more typically to tensions in a detached environment such as a university&mdash;particularly a university that recruits locally from the underlying population and has a high concentration of Islamic students. That situation adds to the threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/8">On the actual state of play, it is fair to refer briefly to paragraph 5 of our report, which mentions the Chief Rabbi's immensely impressive oral evidence. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/9" class="indent">&quot;If you were to ask me is Britain an antisemitic society, the answer is manifestly and obviously no. It is one of the least antisemitic societies in the world&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/10">That is an entirely fair comment, but the paragraph then reports the oral evidence of the president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, with whom I also concur. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/11" class="indent">&quot;There is probably a greater feeling of discomfort, greater concerns, greater fears now about antisemitism than there have been for many decades.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/12">The issue is not about people being immediately subjected to violence or persecution, but about the feeling of discomfort&mdash;a very good word&mdash;that is not acceptable in a free democracy. None of our citizens should be put in that invidious position, and if nothing else, we must take action on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/13">My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw implied that it is difficult to legislate against a negative. It is difficult, because people do not normally go around with a banner saying, &quot;I am anti-Semitic and I am going to murder you.&quot; Sometimes they do, but they do not normally advertise it like that; there is usually&mdash;not always&mdash;either a kind of hole-in-the-corner, smutty scurrilousness, or it is not advertised. However, just because it is not in our face every minute does not mean that we should not do anything about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/14">We must consider the components of the issue. Incidents do take place: I have mentioned that incidents have arisen because of the intifada, and the Community Security Trust does invaluable work by logging such incidents and providing advice. There is a serious passage in the report about the need for better awareness and a reporting structure and protocol from the Association of Chief Police Officers. The Government must be pressed to get on with that work so that we can implement any measure at any time.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/15">The report is fair and balanced, because it says that we must also take account of diffuse anti-Semitism. We should not only record incidents such as a gravestone being overturned or some other horrible act; we should take account of what goes on behind people's hands, and what contributes to the feeling of discomfort that I have mentioned. That is why the most important parts of the report are forward-looking and about good practice in our society, which we must foster. The Government have rightly been set a limited number of challenges, but we understand that this is a job not just for them. It would be wrong to interpret our report as saying, &quot;Over to you, get on with it.&quot; It is a wake-up call to the nation and to all the different parts of our diverse society, so that we might deal with a diverse problem. We do not ask for a one-off Government response, but for everyone to consider what they can do to meet those responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/16">I shall emphasise two or three points. I would say this, as a former Education Minister, but much of the issue starts at school. The Government have welcomed the report's suggestion about twinning schools. One might consider the Northern Ireland sectarian context. It is important to ensure that while schools may have strong faith backgrounds, they do not turn their backs on each other, but actively seek to know and speak about each other. By sheer coincidence, I was having lunch with a high commissioner from Malaysia today, and we were talking about the ethnic and religious complexities of his country and the interesting way in which they wish to restructure their schools. They wish to retain faith schools, as we would call them, but to place them into clusters so that there is social and educational interaction. We must all consider how we can make the situation more effective.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.149.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" speakername="Denis MacShane" colnum="149"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0002.htm#070719106000328">
	<p pid="a.149.6/1">I wonder if I might make a little more progress, because I am conscious that other hon. Members want to speak, and if I keep giving way I may take up more time than I should.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/2">To return to my account, Mr. Husain met Mr. Inayat Bunglawala, and off they went for their meetings&mdash;young men in their 20s, a decade ago:</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/3" class="indent">&quot;Inayat would pick me up and drop me off after a session of Koran recitation, religious discussion and anti-Semitism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/4">He adds:</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/5" class="indent">&quot;Jew-bashing was an acceptable part of the Islamist curriculum.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/6">Mr. Husain's final and important comment is:</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/7" class="indent">&quot;What dumbfounded us was the fact that the authorities on the campus never stopped us.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/8">That is in a sense the most killing statement in the book. Of course, a huge part of the report was devoted to saying that it is time to attend to the matter of British universities and colleges&mdash;I think that the real problems start there, as adolescents of 15, 16 or 17 are perhaps not really ready to imbibe an evil anti-Jewish, Israel-hating and Jew-bashing ideology, but at college and university that can happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/9">We invited the university campuses to take action against the phenomenon. However, the opposite has happened. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw has mentioned that the vice-chancellors do not seem willing fully to engage with the question. The union representing university and college lecturers has taken frankly the most extraordinary decision in the history of the British trade union movement. For the first time in British history since the abolition of the anti-Jewish discrimination laws in the 19th century, a college union is saying that there should be discrimination against Jews. There is no call for a boycott against people from universities in other countries where state practices are infinitely more odious than those undertaken by some agents of the Government of Israel. There is no call for a boycott of Arab professors or students in Israeli universities. The call is directed expressly at Jews. I find it unbelievable that there was not a greater upsurge of outrage in our country about that call.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/10">My hon. Friend has rightly said that Sally Hunt, the union general secretary, has come out clearly against that call, that it will not come into effect and that most university lecturers are ashamed at their new union's decision, but none the less it still stands. I spend some time as a Member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe discussing, in the course of political work in many different European cities, what the British Government are doing. Again and again this summer I have had the question put to me, &quot;What on earth is going on? This is the first time any European trade union has sought to organise any kind of boycott against Jews.&quot; It is no use saying, &quot;No, it is because they work in Israel and are associated with Israeli universities.&quot; It is because they are Jews that people are to be picked out. That is why it is so important that my hon. Friend the Minister should ask the new Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills what its action will be in the coming period in response to that grave problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/11">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills must take a lead. It is not right that the Department for Communities and Local Government should be the sole Department involved in the matter. My right hon. Friend must take a clear lead. I invite the Minister to write to me when he returns to his Department, outlining the views of his right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and what action he will take before the academic term starts in the autumn. We do not need to see another outbreak of anti-Semitism on campus, followed by action; we need pre-emptive, preventive action now.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/12">My hon. Friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education has made clear in the media and on a visit to Israel the Government's repugnance to the call for a boycott by the universities union, but now that the Department for Education and Skills has been broken up, it behoves the Secretary of State responsible to take a clear lead. We must go further. We need an action programme signed by each vice-chancellor explaining what they will do to ensure that academic freedom is not threatened by calls from any country for boycotts against Jews.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/13">I invite the Minister&mdash;I do not know how cash-strapped his budget is, but it always surprises those of us with any connection to Government how poor and lacking in resources any Department is until it decides to do something&mdash;to send Ed Husain's book to every vice-chancellor and ask them all to read it over the summer holidays, so that never again can anybody say, &quot;What dumbfounded us was the fact that the authorities on campus never stopped our anti-Jewish hate campaigns.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/14">We must understand the extent of the dismay, particularly throughout Europe&mdash;that is the part of the world in which I have the most contacts and do some work&mdash;at such decisions. Our universities should understand the extent to which European parliamentarians&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase>, a distinguished former Member of the European Parliament, might want to comment&mdash;members of the Council of Europe from the Parliaments of the 46 member states and the European Commission are concerned about the boycott calls and the reports of anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel on British university campuses. UK universities receive a great deal of funding and support from the European Commission and other European institutions. If vice-chancellors are not seen to take clear action against anti-Semitism and anti-Jewish behaviour on campus, the question will arise whether that funding will be quite as automatic as it has been.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/15">This is not simply about odious acts of violent hate; it is about a culture of sneering and contempt. Too many of our Jewish students, as we found on our travels to talk to university and sixth-form students, feel afraid. That is a terrible thing. Islamophobia exists, as do snarls and snide comments at times about people of many different faiths, including Irish Catholics&mdash;I could tell stories from my mother's side&mdash;but we found something quite different. Some young British men and women simply are not 100 per cent. happy going to university, as my children will be. That is quite wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/16">I turn to the problem of foreign policy. The Minister must feel that he is carrying the burden for rather more Departments than he should, but the question of what Britain says and does about international anti-Semitism must be integrated into the work of our international policy Departments. To begin with, we must consider the role of the internet as the publisher of the most odious anti-Semitic material, as well as material written to inflame global Islamist opinion against Israel and the defence of democracy anywhere in the world. It is not too much to describe the net as a contemporary version of <i>Der St&uuml;rmer,</i> the notorious anti-Jewish Nazi newspaper published in the Hitler years. One can easily read Islamist propaganda anywhere just by logging on.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/17">We must discuss the issue with the United States in particular, because America is the biggest source of internet service providers and America, alas, allows unacceptable amounts of pornography, the commercialisation of sexual relations and other vile material, including anti-Semitic propaganda, on the net. In the cause of freedom of expression, American friends and colleagues in politics and public life are reluctant to talk about dealing expressly with such things. Obviously criminal sites can easily be shut down, but the problem goes well beyond that. We must have a discussion about the deontology of the net and what action can be taken to prevent it from being accessed in order to poison minds with propaganda against Jews.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/18">I am not talking about the religion of Islam. I have no problem with any preacher talking about his faith. It is not necessarily my cup of tea&mdash;I do not believe that any type of religious fundamentalism is a great help in these troubled times&mdash;but I respect and admire enormously the commitment to faith of my 10,000 Muslim constituents, who are the Muslims I know best. It is the ideology of Islamism&mdash;not the faith but the ism&mdash;that must be confronted.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/19">We have seen preposterous examples of what can be easily accessed on the net. Islamist organisations such as the Muslim Council of Britain condemned the suicide bombings in the tube two years ago, the failed car bombings a few weeks ago and the attacks on the twin towers, but that was the easy part. The real test is to condemn suicide bombings in the middle east, Iraq, Kashmir or Afghanistan. A dead man in a London tube or a Manhattan office tower is an innocent victim of evil terrorism, but to read much of the material written by Islamist ideologues, a dead Jewish child or granny in a Tel Aviv bus is a legitimate target for what almost appears to be good or acceptable terrorism. Dressing the matter up with talk of resistance or freedom fighting is sheer hypocrisy, as is making comparisons with Nelson Mandela when South African apartheid was overthrown by peaceful means, or Mahatma Gandhi when the one thing that he taught the world in freeing his country from British rule was to shun violence rather than embrace it.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/20">Until the Muslim Council of Britain condemns all terrorist violence at all times and places, I shall take its condemnation of terrorism in our country as an expression of piety rather than a willingness to join the great mass of UK citizens, including all the Muslims I know, who detest terrorists and their ideological gurus who make hatred of Jews and Israel a key element of Islamism. We must continually spell that out to our international partners and friends. We are doing so through the Council of Europe, but we must also take the message to those countries that would find what I just said completely unacceptable or nonsense. One can walk through too many streets in Istanbul and buy &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;<i>; </i>television channels in Egypt and Jordan broadcast films based on blood libels or &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;<i>.</i> Such countries are part of the problem and not yet part of the solution. The British Council should do more&mdash;in addition to interfaith dialogue, in which I am a complete believer&mdash;to encourage theological discussion between Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologians, all children of the great Abrahamic religions. Indeed, we need to invite theologians&mdash;theologians in the purest sense&mdash;to discuss whether any part of their religions can endorse evil action; that includes the Christian religions.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/21">The fundamental point that the Foreign Office must start to consider is what it is doing through formal diplomatic means, d&eacute;marche, and its sponsorship of the British Council, the BBC World Service and BBC World TV, to make clear our concerns about anti-Semitism. Let nobody misunderstand the points to be drawn from our report and the points made by the Government in their strong response. What we are discussing is part of a new global ideology, which is a nihilist renunciation of everything that people have fought for, since Galileo through to Spinoza and the years of the enlightenment, the great advances in freedom of expression and religious freedom in the 19th century and today's human values as expressed in the European convention on human rights and the United Nations charter, to which we all sign up.</p>
	<p pid="a.149.6/22">That ideology is a denial of what is best and most important for all human beings. That is why I hope that our modest report, which has produced a fine response from the Government, is not seen as a closing down of the discussion in the House of Commons. It should be seen as the beginning of a wider fightback until anti-Semitism and hatred of Israel is extirpated once and for all and seen as part and parcel of the thinking of only a tiny fringe&mdash;the extreme, idiot minority, whom we can never get rid of, but who should no longer be allowed air time on the BBC. They should not be treated as serious interlocutors for the great faith of Islam and the vast majority of British Muslims, who repudiate the evil ideology that is expressed, in a perverted way, in the name of their faith.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.153.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" speakername="Christopher Huhne" colnum="153"  time="015:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0003.htm#070719106000329">
	<p pid="a.153.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir John. I add my penn'orth to those of other Members who have appreciated the Government's efforts to respond to the all-party parliamentary inquiry's report. I was honoured to be the Liberal Democrat member of the inquiry, and I pay tribute to the dedication of our research staff and to our chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase>, for guiding us through a good route march of research and thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/2">This debate is crucial, not just to the Jewish community in this country but to all minority communities. In some basic sense, we are all minorities in one way or another: in our tastes, beliefs, enthusiasms and views. We must defend that diversity. We have to champion and celebrate it, or we will lose it&mdash;at our peril. Today, the Jewish community faces the challenges that we are discussing, but the Muslim community may well face them tomorrow and some other community may face them the day after.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/3">Having been involved in the inquiry and report, I was shocked that a minority community in modern Britain should suffer problems such as those suffered by the Jewish community. Thank heavens, there has been no direct attack on a Jewish community building since the bombing in 1994 of Balfour house, the headquarters of the Joint Israel Appeal and other UK Jewish charities. However, that cast a long shadow over many activities of the community. I shall give one example, which I found striking and is in the report. It relates to the King David school, which has 1,000 Jewish pupils. Under the advice of the local police and the Community Security Trust, it now has CCTV, anti-shatter glass and reinforced walls. There are just two access points to the school, and they are controlled by security guards. It all comes at a cost of &pound;130,000 annually&mdash;with, I have to say, very little, if any, support from the British state as yet. A similar school in France suffering similar problems gets a major contribution towards costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/4">At one end of the spectrum are issues of potential criminal damage, threats to the person, bomb and firebomb attacks&mdash;although as I said, those latter have not happened recently in the UK. We have heard from other hon. Members that the softer problems can be just as intrusive and limiting. The development of anti-Semitic discourse in Britain is worrying; we found it worrying as we took our evidence. Given the frequent lazy confusion of Jewish with Israeli, and Israeli with the Israeli Government, it is easy to slip into something that to any Jewish person can seem&mdash;indeed, is&mdash;a discriminatory set of remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/5">It is worth mentioning the definition of anti-Semitism in the report which we adopted from the EU monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia. The definition is not perfect; I am sure that the debate will go on. However, it is a good working definition of what we have to deal with. It simply states:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/7">We have to be aware of that and deal with it; the right hon. Member for Rotherham rightly set that out in quoting from the Ed Husain book.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/8">Underlying that definition of anti-Semitism is a fundamental and old battle against any type of human behaviour that seeks to stereotype us as other than individuals and to depict our behaviour as being in some sense determined by the group of which we are a part. Such behaviour does not treat our individual views and beliefs as worth while in themselves, but as part of a collective view or belief. For any liberal, that is deeply shocking. Criticism in that context, as that definition sets out, constitutes anti-Semitism&mdash;for example, when it applies double standards to Israel that are not applied elsewhere, when it requires a standard of behaviour from Israel not demanded elsewhere, or when it holds Jews collectively responsible for the behaviour of the state of Israel. Israel, after all, is a democratic state with a vigorous tradition of a free press&mdash;often an opposition press&mdash;and of free Opposition parties. Moreover, as people often forget, it has a substantial Arab minority, which has full political rights and exercises them in its representation in the Knesset.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/9">I recognise that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1529" name="Tim Boswell">the hon. Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase> and the right hon. Member for Rotherham in particular have already mentioned this issue, but I should like to extend some of the points about the academic boycott, which I feel is total folly. Its adherents and proponents have set it out in terms that are counter-productive as well as illiberal. I also share the dismay about the motion passed at the annual conference of the University and College Union. Although I can hear the weasel words transmitted to us by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>, the thrust of that motion&mdash;its political understanding&mdash;was that it was to be seen as a support for a boycott of Israeli universities. The academic boycott essentially treats the individual, once again, as someone who is responsible for the behaviour of their group&mdash;not as an individual, but as part of a collectivity for which they cannot conceivably share responsibility. Two wrongs cannot and do not make a right.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/10">The boycott would be counter-productive, even in the terms of those who are pressing for it, since many of those who are most critical of Israeli Government policies are to be found in the universities, think-tanks and institutes within Israel. Jonathan Freedland was absolutely right when he wrote recently in the <i>Evening Standard</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/11" class="indent">&quot;For one thing, Israeli academics are disproportionately represented in Israel's 'peace camp.' The UCU will be boycotting the very people who have done most to draw the Israeli public's attention to the folly of the occupation, to the very people working to bring an end to this desperate conflict. By their actions, the UCU will embolden the Israeli right who will be able to say, 'Look, the world hates and isolates us: this is exactly why we have to be militarily strong.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/12">From the other side of the community divide, so to speak, Dr. Sari Nusseibeh, the president of al-Quds university&mdash;the only Arab university in Jerusalem&mdash;has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/13" class="indent">&quot;An international academic boycott of Israel, on pro-Palestinian grounds, is self-defeating: it would only succeed in weakening the strategically important bridge through which the state of war between Israelis and Palestinians could be ended and Palestinian rights could therefore be restored. Instead of burning that bridge, the international academy should do everything within its power to strengthen it including, foremost, through its own collaborative intervention.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/14">I welcome the idea from the right hon. Member for Rotherham that the new Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills should attempt to communicate the concern&mdash;in the hope that he shares it&mdash;to the vice-chancellors about the recent developments of this nature in those communities. It is important for us to remember the words of George Bernard Shaw, who once said that the English think that they are being tolerant when often they are merely being indifferent. We must not be indifferent; we have to be tolerant, and toleration sometimes requires a more active role than mere indifference. Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us on the action that the Government are taking to ensure that any academic boycott will not be implemented, and on whether university authorities might consider legal sanctions or derecognition against a UCU branch that supported a boycott. Could, for example, the Department for Communities and Local Government encourage UCU to conduct a race equality impact assessment over any boycott policy?</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/15">I said at the beginning that this is not an issue only for the Jewish community. There is an important line to be drawn and defended for all of us who care about the rights of our fellow citizens. Perhaps the best quotation that I could mention in this context, well-known though it is, is that from Pastor Martin Niem&ouml;ller, referring to the sad developments in Germany in the 1930s. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/16" class="indent">&quot;First, they came for the communists, and I did not speak out&mdash;because I was not a communist.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/17" class="indent">Then they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out&mdash;because I was not a socialist;</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/18" class="indent">Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out&mdash;because I was not a trade unionist.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/19" class="indent">Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out&mdash;because I was not a Jew.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/20" class="indent">Then they came for me&mdash;and there was no one left to speak for me&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.0/21">We let others encroach on the freedom of our fellow citizens to make their lives as they choose at our great peril. An attack on one of us is an attack on us all. With the attacks on the Jewish Community, the time has come to draw a firm line on behalf of us all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.155.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="155"  time="015:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0004.htm#070719106000330">
	<p pid="a.155.0/1">A wide range of material is covered in the inquiry and has been covered in the debate. As a member of the inquiry panel, I wanted to touch again on some of the experiences reported to us by adults and young people at the hearing in Manchester that was part of the inquiry, and to relate them to the Government's responses and some of the report's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/2">Let me touch briefly on the context. I am bearing it in mind that the Minister responding to the debate was not involved in those earlier stages. Clearly, Greater Manchester was an important part of the inquiry because it has the second largest Jewish population in the UK, second only to London and numbering somewhere between 22,000 and 35,000. Salford, my local authority, has a quarter of that population, but most of it is not in my constituency. Like some other Members, I am reflecting not a constituency interest but a general area interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> said, we visited Manchester and held hearings there, which occupied most of a day, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> and I visited the King David school. That was an important aspect of the inquiry, because that school educates about 1,000 Jewish children and young people. We have to regard those whom we encountered there as an important sample of the total population of Jewish children and young people in Greater Manchester, which, as I said, has the second largest such population in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/4">As has been mentioned, we saw first hand at the school security measures that are now considered necessary, based on the advice of police and the Community Security Trust. Reinforced fencing and CCTV could, in some urban areas of Manchester and Salford, be accepted and possibly even be standard. However, that is not the case for things such as anti-shatter glass and reinforced walls, controlled access to the school site, security guards and a necessary security rota of parents. How would parents at other schools feel if they were required to take part in a security rota to cover the school? Fire drills are, we hope, standard in schools, but not the bomb drills that they have at the King David school. As the hon. Member for Eastleigh said, those security measures cost &pound;130,000 per annum, but because such support was not forthcoming from the then Department for Education and Skills, the parents are being asked to contribute that sum.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.0/5">Looking back on the report, we should look to other countries, particularly France. If that school was in Paris, the French Government would contribute to the security that is judged necessary, so that those children could be educated.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.156.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19b.156.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.156.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="156"  time="015:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0004.htm#070719106000332">
	<p pid="a.156.1/1">Indeed. As I looked back on what was reported to us in preparation for the debate, I was struck by the inordinate level of financial and physical involvement that those parents are required to have in the school's security, in order to protect their children. We said a number of times during the inquiry that certain things there would not be acceptable to any other group in our communities. If they were Sikh or Catholic parents, they would complain to their MPs. However, we did encounter such a situation and I, like many other Members, was very surprised by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/2">The majority, if not all, of the children and young people whom we spoke to had been threatened or abused because of their Jewish faith. The example was readily given to us of a car being driven directly at a female Jewish pupil at the school by a female adult. The boys reported that they were abused daily as they went to and from school on public transport. They had such things as &quot;Jew!&quot; and &quot;Get out of our country&quot; shouted at them.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/3">In the recent past, there was a local campaign to prevent the King David primary school from relocating and building a new primary school in an open area. The British People's party produced a leaflet saying, &quot;Defend our English park&quot;. There was a sense of &quot;This is our country. It's our England. You are not part of it&quot;, which is a terrible thing to be faced with day in, day out. It was clear to me from talking to the students at King David school that that was directed at them and their families as part of their daily lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/4">Let us imagine it. There were examples of students experiencing verbal abuse going to and from school, or when playing football with other schools. I guess that football is trying to face down the problem, but teams at other schools would ritually verbally abuse the students before they started playing. One girl, quite tellingly, explained what happened when she attended a drama group. Out-of-school activities are important to young people, but when it was discovered that she was Jewish, she was spat at and abused. She left the group because the teacher would not intervene on her behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/5">We got an overall view of the level of anti-Semitism. When we asked young people whether they felt that it had got worse, they said that they were noticing it more. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham touched on, the key thing is the extent to which it affected their choice of university. They got advice from older students already at university, and they were choosing where they wanted to go not on the basis of, for example, selecting a course, but at which university they would be safest.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/6">Schools should not have to pay a lot of money for extra security. It would horrify us if other schools needed reinforced walls and anti-shatter glass. On the whole, schools should not have to employ security guards just to allow their pupils an education. As I said, most schools have fire drills, but this one has bomb drills. We will all realise that that must add to the sense of tension and fear felt by someone who has to go through that regularly. Schools and families should not have leaflet campaigns of hatred directed at them when they want to build a new primary school in a community. The school is long-established in the area, not new to the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/7">There have been serious incidents in communities in Salford and Manchester, including stabbings and other extreme forms of violence. A young person being attacked with a baseball bat was one example. It is important that, beyond the school environment, families and adults are able to attend synagogue in their communities and express their religious faith without the fear of being attacked. In the afternoon session held with adults, councillors and the police, people reported that they had been attacked, spat at and verbally abused, and, again, had had cars driven at them when they were attending synagogue.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/8">The level of anti-Semitism on campus is high, and in some places the situation seems to be worsening. I attended Salford university, which, happily, seems to have one of the better track records in the family of universities in Greater Manchester. We even heard that at Manchester medical school, people of the Jewish faith are not progressing in their careers as they might, which they do at Salford. The report and the evidence that we took showed a correlation between the situation in the middle east and the tensions there, the experiences of student bodies on campuses and school pupils, and the intimidation and harassment of Jewish students.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/9">I keep coming back to the importance of people having to factor into their decisions their safety from attack or intimidation. This week, there was a statement to Parliament about the priorities of Ministers for Women. If any other group of people picked out a university or other educational institution to attend, based only on how safe they would feel, we would all be horrified. Yet the examples that we heard were unsurprising, given the history of my local universities. The university of Manchester students union proposed a motion in 2002 that anti-Zionism or criticism of Israel was not anti-Semitism, and called for a boycott of Israeli goods. We saw a leaflet that quoted neo-Nazi propaganda, reproducing historical anti-Semitic slander describing Jews as vampires and calling for them to be expelled.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/10">On the activities of far-right parties, I have talked about the British People's party's campaign against the establishment of a new Jewish primary school in Heaton park, but we know that the British National party also campaigns in overtly anti-Semitic ways. Nick Griffin calls the holocaust a hoax and a &quot;profitable lie&quot;&mdash;an anti-Semitic act in itself. In local elections this year, the BNP campaigned more widely. It always stood one candidate in Salford, in the university ward, but, as in other parts of the country, its campaign has developed this year. It stood in six different wards across the three constituencies in Salford in May 2007. The hatred and anti-Semitic rhetoric of Nick Griffin is spreading through our communities and I, for one, as a Salford MP, find that disturbing, given that we have one quarter of the Jewish population of Greater Manchester's 10 areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/11">I wish to touch briefly on the work of the Holocaust Education Trust, which is an important counter to the rhetoric and hatred of the BNP. Young people from sixth forms and colleges can visit Auschwitz on a one-day trip and take part in seminars reflecting the lessons of the holocaust for their generation. Given what I have said about what is happening in Salford, I hope that a school from my constituency will take part in that scheme later this year. I hope that we are all promoting it, now that the finances allow it to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/12">It seems worrying that, of 600 anti-Semitic incidents recorded in the UK in 2006, a quarter took place in Greater Manchester. On the face of it, it is worrying for Greater Manchester to have a quarter of the incidents but only 10 per cent. of the Jewish population. Within those figures, almost half the incidents of assault or extreme violence in the UK took place there. I have detailed the experience of students at King David school and some unacceptable incidents in our community.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/13">However, I wish to record my own feelings after our day of inquiry in Greater Manchester and after the writing of the report. We can draw a different conclusion: it should be understood that Greater Manchester police is probably exemplary in how it records and monitors anti-Semitic incidents and co-operates with the Community Security Trust. As was mentioned in the Chamber today, sometimes an increase in the number of incidents is a sign not that things are getting worse, but that such incidents are being reported. That is the first step to things getting better. I would not want, through detailing what we found in Manchester, Salford and elsewhere in Greater Manchester, to leave the impression that things are terrible there. The work of the police there is very good.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/14">There were further important examples of good practice in Manchester. The former Lord Mayor, Councillor Mohammed Afzal Khan, a Muslim, took a lead in his mayoral year on promoting inter-faith dialogue, and was joint chair of the Manchester Muslim-Jewish Forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/15">Having said what I have, I add that there is much to welcome in the Government's response to our all-party parliamentary inquiry. I wish to mention some particular things relating the Manchester hearings. The Government's response condemns the rise in the number of such incidents and states that people should be able to live their lives free from verbal or physical attack, which they clearly are not doing. It rightly points out that anti-Semitism is starting to be accepted instead of condemned, which is an important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/16">On anti-Semitism on campuses, about which a number of Members have spoken, there is an important recognition that Jewish students feel threatened and that, as we said in the report, the response of vice-chancellors is patchy. We really should start to insist that they take a more active role. I keep coming back to the fact that the young people to whom we talked cannot choose the university that they want to go to, the place where they want to live or the course they want to do; they have to consider their safety. That is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/17">On the monitoring and recording of anti-Semitic incidents, if Greater Manchester police can do it, other areas can, too. The largest part of the Jewish population lives in London, and the statistics from London look ludicrous in comparison with those from Manchester. It can be done, and the recommendation that the Home Office research and report annually to Parliament is key. The other exemplary aspect in Manchester is the working together of the police and the Community Security Trust, which is vital. It was also important that the Crown Prosecution Service accepted that the low number of prosecutions of anti-Semitic incidents was not acceptable, and we should, as MPs, continue to review its plans in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/18">The Government's response says that the Home Office and the Department for Communities and Local Government have a cross-government group of officials working on the matter. It is important that DCLG continues to work on it&mdash;it did not commit to it&mdash;and that it commissions an annual survey on attitudes and tensions. We cannot keep investigating in detail, as we did for the Manchester hearings, but it is important that a Government Department continue to work on the matter. The new single equality body, the Commission for Equality and Human Rights, has a key role to play in the months ahead. It is important that we feed information to it as it establishes itself and takes up that key role.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/19">The step of promoting inter-faith programmes and leadership programmes for young Muslims and Jews was fully supported by the Government in their response. I mentioned the good example of the former mayor of Manchester. People in civic leadership positions such as the mayor of Manchester&mdash;who, in that case, was a Muslim&mdash;have an important role to play. The significance of their role could be promoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/20">The Government's response details further events involving leaders of major faith communities and the work of the Faith Communities Consultative Council, which are important. In March, there was an event for rabbis and imams and another for Muslim and Jewish women. Such leadership events must continue to be promoted. I should also mention that ITV Granada has a programme to build links in the community between different faiths and cultures. As a media body, it has taken on that role. I did not know about that previously, but I commend its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/21">Finally, given everything that I have said about schools, and that other Members have said about the reported difficulties at King David school, we should look again at the idea in our report on twinning schools and communities. It is clearly wrong that students from one school cannot play football with pupils from another school without experiencing verbal prejudice. The idea of twinning schools of different faiths should be strongly encouraged and promoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/22">I have dealt mainly with school, campus and community. It is important that we work toward people understanding these issues when they are younger, and, most importantly, toward Jewish children and young people being able to receive their education at school and university free from physical or verbal attack. Although there are some important steps in the Government's response, it is clear that continued action and, perhaps, extra focus will be required in the future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.161.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="161"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0004.htm#070719106000334">
	<p pid="a.161.0/1">It is a privilege to be able to speak in this debate on behalf of the Liberal Democrats. I believe that I am the first speaker in the debate who does not have either of the two qualifications that other speakers have had. I did not serve on the commission nor do I have a Jewish background. For that matter, neither do I have a significant Jewish community in my constituency. Perhaps I can look on the subject of the debate and the debate so far from slightly outside the perspective of some of those who have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/2">The all-party group's inquiry is a moving piece of work. It is thorough and measured, and, for me, it was revelatory in many ways. I hope that it serves to be revelatory in so far as policy making goes, but not just Government policy making. Several speakers made it clear that overcoming the problem that the inquiry brought out will require changes in other parts of civic society.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/3">This is a unique occasion. I understand that it is the first time that an all-party group's report has been the subject of a debate and an official response from the Government. Indeed, I believe that it set you one or two procedural issues to deal with at the beginning of the debate, Sir John.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/4">I welcome the Government's response, which is a good first shot at a response, but, as has been made clear in the debate, is very much a case of work in progress with far more to come. The report has sounded the alarm, but we all understand that there is far more to be done before we can say that we have responded properly to the alert that has been given.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/5">The report set a good precedent for co-operation between parties. As the first of the Front-Bench speakers, I can say that it is my party's intention to offer full co-operation with the Government, on a party basis, on ensuring that the recommendations are not just implemented but vigorously pursued. We need to remind ourselves on occasions that just as we urge ethnic and faith groups in the outside world to work together towards common objectives and to promote social cohesion, there are occasions when political parties have to do the same. In dealing with this matter, my party is ready to do that formally and informally.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/6">We also need to recognise&mdash;perhaps this is the first of the outsider's viewpoints&mdash;that we can get very wrapped up in recognising what the problem is but not face up to the fact that there are legitimate and deeply held differences within society and between faiths and ethnic groups. We must accept that at every phase we need to work together to achieve common objectives while recognising the right of others to have different views and to express them robustly on occasion. I want to place it on the record that we believe that the common values on which we need to work together are the preservation of a free and fair society in this country, and the protection of minorities and of minority rights. That is right ethically and, for some of us, is right from a religious perspective. In addition, on a much more utilitarian basis, a safer, more prosperous and secure society for everybody can only be delivered through such an approach. In other words, we are driven by both a pragmatic and an ethical response.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/7">I want to say clearly that nothing can justify hate crime, whether that constitutes terror attacks at one end of the spectrum or sending people to Coventry at the other. It is quite right for the law and society to put measures in place that punish and deter people from hate crimes and avoid such situations occurring. A foundation for that has been put in place by the report when it mentions adopting a common and widely understood definition of what discrimination is. It says that the methodology of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry should be adopted and that it is what appears to be discriminatory to the victim that counts. I was very impressed by the inquiry's report of the work of the Community Security Trust, of which I was not previously aware. I was also impressed by what the trust has done&mdash;perhaps not deliberately&mdash;to rebut one of the criticisms of such an approach to a definition of discrimination, which is that if discrimination is defined according to the eyes of the victim, that may provoke a lot of groundless complaints based on other causes. The evidence is there for that in the report and it should be put on the record that the Community Security Trust is rigorous in weeding out complaints that are not in fact about anti-Semitism. I hope that those who might be inclined to criticise that process will take note of that as it is an important rebuttal.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/8">I come now to recording, which is the first matter that I want to ask the Government about. The report states that only seven of the 43 police forces in England have effective ways of recording anti-Semitic incidents. The Government's response to recommendation 7 is pretty faint-hearted. It does not say anything about changing things, but simply states that they are in favour of things getting better. I would like the Minister to say in plain terms what he plans to do about the recording of incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/9">My second question is, to which Minister should I address my remarks? We might have expected the Minister who deals with local government and cohesion to respond to this report, but perhaps the Minister will tell us that he deals with that and everything is fine. However, I notice that according to the Government's response it was the former Minister for Local Government, now the Minister for the Environment, who dealt with the issue. I want an assurance that the seniority and importance that was given to this matter will be carried forward in the new departmental arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/10">Will the Minister say something about exactly what area he is responsible for? Is it England; England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; or sometimes one and sometimes the other? What is his area of responsibility when it comes to tackling this issue? That does not in any way imply a criticism that the approach might be different in different places. A different policy approach in different parts of the United Kingdom is not a bad thing; in some respects it is a positively good thing. For instance, the Government's response to the issue of the protection of Jewish property points out that the Scottish Executive has already set aside a fund of &pound;1 million to deal with synagogues in Scotland. That is obviously a good thing and I would not want a United Kingdom-wide new initiative to blot that out. We should ensure that if there is good practice in one part of the United Kingdom, we borrow and import it into other parts of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/11">My third question&mdash;if it is not in fact the fourth&mdash;is whether the Government intend to actively manage a programme or whether they simply plan to tick a few boxes. For instance, the Government response refers to the fact that the Commission on Integration and Cohesion will be producing a report. The timing of the writing of the Government's response meant that it came before that report was produced. The commission has now reported and it would be good if the Minister could say what the implications of its report are on the programme that the Government intend to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/12">I wish to say clearly that nothing justifies hate crimes, discrimination against individuals and their property, or discrimination against a whole religion or ethnic group. At the risk of being boring and repetitious, I wish to make the point that anti-Semitism is wrong. I make that point because a central matter of contention is whether the behaviour of a nation state&mdash;good or bad&mdash;can or should legitimise such behaviour or discrimination. I wish to say clearly that it does not. Discrimination is real and, in preparation for this debate, a briefing was provided to me by a senior Jewish member of the Liberal Democrats. I want to quote a couple of points that he put to me. He reminded me that the British Muslims who were convicted in the Crevice trial had a list of synagogues in their possession as a possible target. He went on to say that every</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Jewish community in the UK takes this threat so seriously that it is spending &pound;3million, via the CST, to bomb-proof the windows of every Jewish building in the country.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/14">That is &pound;3 million and I note that the Scottish Executive has allocated &pound;1 million. It would be a powerful signal if the Minister said that the Government are prepared to allocate the other &pound;2 million for the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/15">I do not want to make a partisan point, but it is important for us to recognise that political parties have a role that we are not yet fully playing. Another point put to me by a senior Jewish member of the Liberal Democrats was:</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Many of us experienced personal anti Semitism. In my last Parliamentary campaign the Labour team canvassed on behalf of 'the Christian Gentleman' to show that I was not 'acceptable'... I lost by a very small margin&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.161.0/17">I emphasise that that is not a partisan point and I am well aware that it would be quite possible for people to intervene on me and draw my attention to Liberal Democrats who have behaved in an inappropriate way. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">The hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> was quite right and frank in what he said and I want to be quite right and frank in what I say. None of us can say that we are without fault in this; we all have work to do to improve our approach to this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.0/1">I accept with all seriousness the points that the hon. Gentleman is making. Is he aware that during the last general election in Rochdale, the then Member for Rochdale, Lorna Fitzsimons, reported that the Muslim Public Affairs Committee distributed a leaflet that claimed that she was Jewish, which she is not, as a reason for not voting for her? Does he think that there should have been a stronger disassociation of a political party from that leaflet put out during that campaign?</p>

	<p pid="a.165.0/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair, Sir John. Like the Minister, I have been translated from the great spaces of the Finance Bill into community cohesion. I have not yet had the chance to welcome him to his new position, which I now do. I suppose that this is my debut in this field.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/2">I should like to pick up on a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase>. I think that we should all like to have some clarity about who ultimately is responsible in this area. Is it the Minister present or another refugee from the Finance Bill, the Minister for Local Government? I am sure that the Minister present will answer that question when he responds to this debate, which has been a very fine one. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1390" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> on the way in which he introduced it and on commissioning the report. I congratulate also <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">the right hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase> on chairing the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/3">I have a number of particular interests: my background is Jewish, although it is not the religion that I try to practise. Furthermore, I have the largest percentage of Muslim constituents of any official Opposition MP. So there is never a dull moment. I think that I can say fairly, therefore, that I see several angles on the issues involved. The debate has been a model for other debates on the violation of human dignity, whether that violation is based on ethnicity or religion. I, certainly, would welcome similar debates on, for example, Islamophobia.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/4">I want to make it clear that I agree with the hon. Member for Hazel Grove that this is an area for an all-party consensus, and I welcome much of the Government's response, although, as all Ministers know, there is always more to do. I shall come to that point in a moment. I think that the hon. Member for Bassetlaw was absolutely right to intimate that all racism is evil. There is a particular horror of anti-Semitism for people with roots in western Europe as a result of the holocaust. I think that it has to be acknowledged that the roots of anti-Semitism in western Europe lie partly in Christian replacement theology, from which, thankfully, the Roman Catholic Church and a number of others have now distanced themselves, since Vatican II.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/5">Against the, in some cases, horrifying pictures painted this afternoon by hon. Members, particularly some of the alarming information given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase>, it is important to set what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1529" name="Tim Boswell">the Member for Daventry (Mr. Boswell)</phrase> quoted the Chief Rabbi as saying when he gave evidence, which was that, by and large, Britain is not an anti-Semitic country. In general, and certainly compared with other countries, I believe that Britain has been a good home for Jews, as well as for people of many other ethnic backgrounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/6">I am trying to respond to a few themes only and to draw them together in this way: I think that it has emerged from the debate that organised anti-Semitism, until relatively recently, has been monopolised by British neo-Nazis and elements of the indigenous left and right. Government Members were courageous to sign up in the report to the statement quoted by my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry. We have heard evidence that contemporary anti-Semitism in Britain is found more commonly on the left than on the right. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">The hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> referred to the <i>New Statesman</i> cover, which was an alarming manifestation of that trend, although I should say in return that all parties have their own sinister corners. However, I admire the way in which members of the commission faced and signed up to that statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/7">It has emerged also that that monopoly has been broken in recent years by separatist extremists who claim to act in the name of Islam. It is important, right at the start, to stress, as did the right hon. Member for Rotherham, that those separatists do not represent the Islamic mainstream, which in my constituency is represented by bodies such as the Wycombe Islamic Mission and Mosque Trust, and that there is much local co-operation on the ground up and down Britain between Jews and Muslims. I am nervous of citing examples from Manchester, because hon. Members present know more about it than I do, but the Community Security Trust has cited in a brief the Muslim-Jewish forum in Greater Manchester. There are, of course, others.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/8">At best, the separatists are opposed to terrorism in Britain, but they regard Jews, Christians and members of other religions and none as kufr, which is a derogatory term for non-Muslims and which in itself contrasts with the authentic Islamic view of both Jews and Christians as &quot;people of the Book&quot;. At worst, the separatists support terrorism in Britain, as we have seen from a procession of events, from the Dhiren Barot plot, which, significantly, took place before the invasion of Iraq, all the way through to the most recent attack, on Glasgow airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/9">It is vital to emphasise&mdash;the Liberal Democrat spokesman, the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, picked up this point very acutely&mdash;that synagogues and other Jewish targets in Britain are potential terrorist targets. There is a long list of such attacks abroad. The House will remember the bombing of the synagogue in Istanbul. It is significant, as the hon. Gentleman said, that the Crevice trial convicts were found with a list of synagogues in their possession.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/10">Having established that what I described as a monopoly has been broken and having time to respond to only a few themes, I shall question the Minister about the Government's response to the abuse of universities, which have come up a great deal in the debate, and prisons, which have not come up so much, as potential incubators of anti-Semitism by extremists.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/11">Let me deal first with universities. The Minister will be aware of claims by Professor Anthony Glees of Brunel university that extremist groups or terror groups are active in up to 30 British universities. Some of those, by the way, are BNP or what are traditionally known as extreme-right groups. If he has read Ed Husain's book &quot;The Islamist&quot;&mdash;he is being urged this afternoon by hon. Members on both sides of the Chamber to do so&mdash;he will be aware that it is the practice of extreme groups such as Hizb ut-Tahrir, of which Ed Husain was a member, to operate in that way, and that at least one member of a university Islamic society has been charged with terrorist offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/12">Does the Minister agree with Trevor Phillips that the response of vice-chancellors to anti-Semitic activity has been &quot;patchy&quot;&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry referred to that&mdash;and will he commend universities such as Birmingham, which the report identified, that have very strong safeguards in place in relation to visiting speakers? What practical steps are the Government taking to ensure that a working group comprising Universities UK and a committee of vice-chancellors is set up on the issue? The hon. Member for Bassetlaw made it pretty clear that there has been an element of institutional resistance and that that perhaps continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/13">On the vexed question of the proposed so-called boycott, will the Minister pick up the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> about the Government encouraging the University and College Union to conduct a race equality impact assessment on any boycott policy?</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/14">I asked the Secretary of State for Education and Skills a while ago, before I was moved to my current duties, how many faculties, chairs and other facilities in relation to Islamic studies in universities were funded from abroad. Obviously, we have no objection in principle to funding coming to universities from abroad. However, we are concerned about funding from separatists whose mode of thought is, among other things, anti-Semitic. I received the following answer:</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/15" class="indent">&quot;This information is not collected centrally&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2007-06-11.792"><i>Official Report</i>, 11 June 2007; Vol. 462, c. 792W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/16">I should like to know why not.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/17">In the current circumstances, prisons are equally a cause of concern. The Minister, like other hon. Members, will be aware that there is a claimed link between prisons and separatist and therefore terrorist indoctrination. Richard Reid, the attempted shoe bomber, is alleged to have been radicalised in Feltham young offenders institution. Muktar Said Ibrahim, the leader of the 21/7 gang, is alleged to have been indoctrinated in Feltham or Aylesbury young offenders institutions, or in both. It is claimed that imams at both institutions were suspended in 2002 amid fears that they were preaching extremism.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.0/18">Like the hon. Member for Hazel Grove, I am sorry to bombard the Minister with questions that might properly be directed at the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills or the Home Department, but bombarding him with these questions illustrates the point that this issue goes right across Departments. I should be obliged if, as well as furnishing the right hon. Member for Rotherham with the information from the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills that he requested, he could obtain a reply from the Home Office on some of the points that I am raising.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.3/1">I thought that the right hon. Gentleman might say something like that.</p>

	<p pid="a.169.3/4">Although I am a bit happier with the written answers that I am receiving from the Government than a Government Member and ex-Minister is, I am not completely satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/5">Again, picking up the lead of the right hon. Gentleman, I shall say a few words about the Government, Muslim partners and anti-Semitism. Clearly, Governments work with faith-based organisations of all religions and none as partners, and that is entirely proper. The Muslim Council of Britain was, for a long period, the main Muslim partner of Conservative and Labour Governments. The legend is, and I have no reason to doubt it, that the MCB was partly put together by my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1587" name="Michael Howard">the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard)</phrase> when he was the Home Secretary. The MCB has always opposed terrorism in Britain, but the former Communities and Local Government Secretary, who is now the Secretary of State for Transport, was none the less sufficiently concerned about separatist tendencies within the MCB to announce that the Government's</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/6" class="indent">&quot;strategy of funding and engagement must shift significantly towards those organisations that are taking a proactive leadership role in tackling extremism&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/7">which, of course, includes anti-Semitism&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/8" class="indent">&quot;and defending our shared values.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/9">She was also the main speaker at a Sufi Muslim Council Mawlid in the House of Commons earlier this year, which was hosted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1417" name="Khalid Mahmood">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Perry Barr (Mr. Mahmood)</phrase> and me.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/10">I return to Mr. Bunglawala. It is a matter of record that he has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/11" class="indent">&quot;The Jews consider themselves to be God's chosen people&mdash;although the blessed prophet Jesus called them the children of the devil&mdash;and so can do...whatever...they like&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/12">He is also on record as saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/13" class="indent">&quot;The chairman of Carlton Communications is Michael Green of the tribe of Judah. He has joined an elite club whose members include fellow Jews Michael Grade...and Alan Yentob. The three are reported to be 'close friends'...so that's what they mean by a free media&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/14">I was going to quote from the &quot;The Islamist&quot;, but the ever-attentive right hon. Member for Rotherham has beaten me to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/15">I gather that Mr. Bunglawala has since repented of those views, just as he has repented of his description of Osama bin Laden as a freedom fighter. None the less, all that is a reminder of how careful all political parties have to be when selecting partner organisations to work with. Does the Minister believe that the MCB is taking the necessary leadership role? Will the shift that was announced by the last Secretary of State continue under the new one?</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/16">I conclude by reflecting on the nature and implications of anti-Semitism. To the social historian, Christianity grew at least partly out of Judaism, just as&mdash;again to the social historian&mdash;Islam drew on the Jewish experience. Therefore, anti-Semitism is not simply a repudiation of one group on the ground of ethnicity, barbarous though that is and represented as it is by the obscenity of the holocaust. It is also, by implication and extension, a repudiation of the institutions, culture and values of the western world in general and, for us as parliamentarians, of Britain in particular. Those values are ultimately founded on the inviolable dignity of the human person.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.3/17">I am grateful to have had the opportunity to participate in the debate, and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.173.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="173"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0006.htm#070719106000352">
	<p pid="a.173.3/1">I understand that that will be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1948" name="Paul Goodman">the hon. Member for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman)</phrase> for his presence, although I was expecting the Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1421" name="Helen Goodman">the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase>. That is a private joke from our consideration of the Finance Bill&mdash;I shall not bore you with the details, Sir John.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/3">The hon. Member for Wycombe congratulated me on my coming to the Treasury Bench, so may I congratulate him on his move? He made some excellent points. I was particularly struck by the one about extremism in prisons. Given the nature of the prison system, community engagement is limited mainly to the resettlement of prisoners. Work is ongoing in the Prison Service and the National Offender Management Service to provide assistance to prisoners during their time in prison and in order to rehabilitate them into their community.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/4">I particularly want to draw the attention of hon. Members to the extremist prisoners working group. Peter Atherton, deputy director-general of the Prison Service, has chaired a series of seminars to consider the strategic policy and operational issues surrounding radicalisation and extremism in the specific context of prisons. A report setting out the current working practices, issues to be resolved and an implementation and action plan is being produced, and it is anticipated that it will be published at the end of October. That directly answers the hon. Gentleman's point and I hope that he can take reassurance from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/5">One of today's other themes has been an almost universal concern about the rise of anti-Semitism, both in this country and across Europe. That concern is shared by the Government. It is unfortunately well founded, given the fact that the CST recorded 594 anti-Semitic incidents in 2006&mdash;that is the highest annual total since the CST began recording in 1984. Of those incidents, 112 were violent anti-Semitic assaults, four of which were potentially life-threatening. There were 70 incidents of damage and desecration to Jewish property, which included nine desecrations of Jewish cemeteries. Of major concern is the fact that Jewish schools or schoolchildren were targeted in 59 incidents, so I fully take on board the point made eloquently by my hon. Friend the Member for Worsley. In 25 cases, the incidents took place against Jewish schoolchildren on their journey to or from school. So we are not necessarily talking about incidents on school estates themselves, and that also might need to be examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/6">In the light of all this, it is important that we recognise that anti-Semitism has not been taken as seriously as other forms of hatred in some parts of our society. That is simply not acceptable and it is right that we take concerted steps to deal with the situation. Whether anti-Semitism comes from the far left, the far right or from so-called Islamist extremists, it must be understood for what it is and condemned. It should be dealt with promptly and effectively through the law. We must do everything that we can to prevent anti-Semitism occurring.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/7">Britain has a strong legislative framework to protect people from harassment and hate, and I should like to mention some of the legal safeguards at length later in my contribution. We cannot be complacent and allow things to happen. We need to have a zero tolerance approach and ensure that the powers on the statute book are complied with and enforced. I hope that everyone will take away that important point.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/8">I reiterate the Government's commitment to tackling all forms of hate crime and racial intolerance, including anti-Semitism, wherever it exists. We have one of the world's strongest legal frameworks for protecting people from discrimination and persecution on the basis of race or faith, and that has been significantly tightened in recent years. It is also important to note that the UK leads the way on the recording and monitoring of racist crime, including anti-Semitism. The UK's excellent example has been acknowledged in successive reports by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, now the Fundamental Rights Agency. As hon. Members have said, we recall more than seems to be the case, and it looks as if we are a more racist or anti-Semitic country than we are, but we are taking the matter seriously. I hope that other countries will follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/9">I am pleased to see wider progress away from the focus on criminal acts. The report noted concern about the tone of the general discourse, for example. Open and public debate is one thing, but rhetoric with an undercurrent of hate and racism is quite another. We need practical ways to tackle that rhetoric. That is why I remain concerned about recent calls in academia to boycott contact with academics working in Israel. Such boycotts threaten academic freedom and intellectual exchange, and cannot be acceptable. Lecturers in the new university and college lecturers' union should be given every support to combat selective boycotts that are anti-Jewish in principle. I urge the new union's executive and leadership to oppose the boycott.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/10">Alongside that, I urge them to take seriously the problems being experienced by Jewish students on some university campuses. That has been articulated very well today. I know that Universities UK is involved in that debate, and I urge it to go further. Universities should be centres for constructive dialogue and exchange of views that lead to better understanding of issues, and of people and their backgrounds. No one is disputing the right to criticise, or to criticise Israel, but a place where differences and diversity are welcomed and valued for adding new dimensions to the dialogue, and new ideas developed in partnership at the expense of hate, should be the norm rather than the exception.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.176.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="176"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0007.htm#070719106000358">
	<p pid="a.176.2/1">I have asked the cross-departmental hate crime taskforce to take the matter up as a matter of urgency, and it will consider ways forward. I hope that that reassures my hon. Friend. I have taken the matter on board personally, because compliance and enforcement are crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/2">Hon. Members referred to the internet, but not as much as I thought they would. Today's students are very much the internet generation, and they have access to reams of information, some of which helps them with their studies, but some of which exposes them to dangerous views and campaigns. That applies not just to students. The internet is open to the wider population, including children, which is a particular concern to me. Anti-Semitism on the net is a hate crime, and when a UK internet service provider is told that it is hosting offensive or anti-Semitic material, we should recognise and applaud the fact that it has a good record in removing it promptly. The police also have specific powers to deal with terrorist-related material. However, I believe we could do better in ensuring that service providers and the police find out about all such material more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/3">With that in mind, the Association of Chief Police Officers has agreed to improve its advice on what to do when an internet hate crime is spotted. Recognising that many internet sites are not hosted in this country, Foreign Office Ministers have raised the matter with Governments of other countries, including in the middle east. I hope that that reassures the right hon. Member for Rotherham who made the point so eloquently. Foreign Office Ministers have obtained agreement among the G8 countries to co-operate further on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/4">We should be clear that our policy in this country is robustly to tackle hate crime in whatever form or media it appears. Alongside that, we aim to build community cohesion so that communities draw strength from their diversity and celebrate what they all share, rather than remaining divided by difference. Tackling prejudice is an important part of building cohesive communities so that people from all backgrounds develop their shared future, find common solutions to shared problems, and live and work together.</p>
	<p pid="a.176.2/5">I believe the Chief Rabbi suggested that people should be bilingual, with a common language of citizenship and a second language connecting us to family and group traditions. Faith groups, including the Jewish community, have a crucial role to play in making the links and the bridges, and developing that common language.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-07-19a.178.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="178"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070719/halltext/70719h0007.htm#070719106000362">
	<p pid="a.178.0/1">Yes, I will certainly take that forward and ensure that best practice is disseminated through the taskforce and through other means.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/2">On my final lap I shall turn to education, because Members have said that education is the key to changing cultures and attitudes. There is a generational issue. My grandparents grew up during and fought in the second world war, and they feel revulsion and horror towards anti-Semitism, largely as a result of learning about the final solution and the holocaust. My generation does not tend to have that feeling, and certainly the generations coming forward now do not seem to have that direct connection with the horrors of anti-Semitism. It is therefore important that the holocaust and other matters relating to anti-Semitism, such as the rise of the Nazis in the 1930s, are taught in schools. The Blackburn school linking project, which brought together 14-year-old girls from schools in the Wirral, Preston and Blackburn, shows how successful such activity can be. Despite coming from very different backgrounds, the girls quickly discovered that they had a great deal in common, so new guidance will encourage linking as a way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families is also working with faith schools, which are another core part of the local cohesion picture. Indeed, the Jewish school in Birmingham, which has been mentioned in the debate, is an excellent example of promoting integration and cohesion, catering as it does for Jewish and Muslim children. However, there should also be a focus on the core curriculum to ensure that it provides opportunities to challenge racism, to understand the positive sides of migration and to value diversity. That is why I am delighted that the Government have made a &pound;1.5 million grant to the Holocaust Educational Trust. I pay tribute in the strongest possible terms to the trust and to its work enabling children and sixth-form pupils to visit Auschwitz. It has been mentioned in the debate that enabling two students from every sixth form to visit Auschwitz is not enough. I fully accept that point, and I hope that we can move forward in ensuring that even more people can experience at first hand the horrors of the concentration camps and the final solution. That will help spread awareness of the lessons from the holocaust, and ensure that its language is respected by new generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/4">There is a statutory requirement to teach about the holocaust, and the Department for Children, Schools and Families has supported holocaust memorial day in schools through the production of free educational resources to support its issues and themes. My Department's &pound;18 million &quot;Connecting Community Plus&quot; grant scheme is already supporting many projects that tackle racism more widely. With fair and objective media reporting, those practical projects have a real chance to make a difference in local communities throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/5">I shall end&mdash;perhaps where I should have begun&mdash;with the report's first recommendation, which is about the definition of anti-Semitism. The inquiry was attracted to the European monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia&mdash;EUMC&mdash;draft definition. The Government have undertaken to re-examine that definition, if and when the EUMC's successor body, the fundamental rights agency, does so. The hon. Member for Hazel Grove noted that the Government use the broader definition of a racist incident, which came from the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. It is based on the victim's perception, and we continue to regard it as a wide and powerful definition that shows society's abhorrence of such crimes, whether the victims are Jewish or from any other community. The fact that we have had the chance to publicise that message clearly and succinctly in the report reiterates how important the inquiry's findings and recommendations have been. We are therefore committed to taking the work of the inquiry forward, and we have established a cross-Government working group, which includes Jewish stakeholders, to ensure that our response is actioned throughout Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/6">In conclusion, I pay tribute to the inquiry's work. Moving it forward, I pledge that the Government will take it seriously and co-ordinate it properly, and I hope that we can have a similar debate sometime in the future.</p>
