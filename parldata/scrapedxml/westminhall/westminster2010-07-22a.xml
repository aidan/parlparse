	<p pid="a.155.1/1">I am grateful to have been called in what is clearly an important debate. I will be outlining the Liberal Democrat position on the reforms in place of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40062" name="Don Foster">the Member for Bath (Mr Foster)</phrase>, who could not be with us today. Before I do that, however, I want to acknowledge how incredibly valuable lottery money is.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/2">When I think of the odds of winning the lottery, a saying comes to mind: &quot;Don't bet on the lottery, bet on yourself.&quot; However, the fantastic thing about the national lottery is that that is exactly what it allows us to do; it contributes hugely to the things that allow us to better ourselves as individuals, as members of our local communities and as a country.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/3">The various arts councils contribute to the UK's artistic culture, which is one of the most exciting in the world. Our arts help to drive our immensely successful creative industries. However, they also nourish the inner life of everybody who engages with them. The sports distributors support activities that improve health and longevity. They promote not only self-esteem and the drive to succeed as individuals, but teamwork and co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/4">As a country we have been bequeathed a physical heritage that is part of our national character, which the Heritage Lottery Fund helps to maintain. It also helps to preserve our local identity. In St. Austell, the Heritage Lottery Fund has provided &#163;850,000 to regenerate the china clay museum where I worked before being sent by my constituents to this place. The museum celebrates the history of the china clay mining communities in the heart of Cornwall and provides a fascinating insight into how the industry changed and shaped the environment that I represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/5">I recently attended the opening of a local art exhibition on the theme of Newquay and the sea, a display of 19th century paintings, many of which were owned or created by local people. That also benefited from &#163;10,000 of Heritage Lottery Fund assistance. Through Big, lottery funding is directed to a host of other community groups and volunteers working on all manner of important projects. There are other benefits from promoting all those good causes and organisations-far more than I can list here-which work very hard. Indeed, as the Minister said, we have all benefited from the &#163;24 billion that the lottery has generated for them since its creation. That does not mean that improvements cannot be made, and the coalition Government are right to look at ways to make the most of lottery money.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/6">The lottery reforms, as has been mentioned, will lead to a boost in funding for the arts, heritage and sport. The relevant distributors have welcomed the changes. The Minister will be aware that no one funding stream can completely replace another: &#163;1 million of public money is not the same as &#163;1 million of private money, and &#163;1 million of lottery money is something else again. There are plans to boost private donations for the arts, for instance, and that is welcome, but we must still try to ensure that risky projects, smaller groups and organisations based outside London, such as in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> or, indeed, in the south-west, all of which may be less appealing to private donors, do not miss out in the reforms. We must remain aware that sometimes funding is conditional. Money is offered from one source only because another has signed up, and if one goes there is a risk the other will also be withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/7">Therefore, the boost in lottery funding will not be a panacea, but it is still an important step. To make the most of it we need to ensure that cuts will not be implemented immediately, but phased in gradually. I understand that statutory instruments to enact changes to lottery distribution will be laid in September, according to recently published DCMS plans, but it will be 2012 before distributors receive their full 20% of good cause funding. Bearing in mind that &#163;88 million of cuts have already been found this year, our side of the coalition would like reassurances that spending reductions will be restrained until that money comes into play. As the Minister said, the money that was redirected towards the Olympics will also start to find its way back, and will provide some relief; but we seek further reassurances.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/8">The coalition agreement contains a promise to look more closely at a gross profits tax system for the lottery. Camelot's figures showed that that would generate many millions of pounds of extra income for the Exchequer, but there has been little movement since the coalition agreement was published, and I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us what recent discussions have taken place with the Chancellor about gross profits tax, and when we can expect further announcements. Overall, we want greater urgency from the Government on those points. Most importantly, I urge the Department not to front-load the cuts but, instead, to phase them in, so that they begin to bite only when the new funding sources that I have mentioned become available.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/9">That brings me to the matter of how we handle cuts to administration. Under current plans, lottery distributors will be instructed to reduce their spending on admin to below 5%. It is of course right to make the most of limited funds and ensure that they are spent as efficiently as possible, but, again, such cuts need to be implemented intelligently. As other hon. Members have said, and distributors have made clear in representations to us, distributors are not just banks doling out large sums of money. Indeed, the Public Accounts Committee, in a report in 2008, considered the efficiency of grant making and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The Big Lottery Fund has increased the spread of successful applications across the United Kingdom and from different social groups&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.1/11">The report goes on to stress the importance of making funding available to small organisations, and stimulating higher quality applications. To provide the support needed to make that happen, distributors need dedicated backroom staff. Such staff should be seen as valuable assets, not unnecessary paper-pushers.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.1/1">It depends on one's understanding of the big society. My understanding is that we should be encouraging more groups and individuals to participate in creating vibrant, thriving communities; it will depend on the organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/2">I have talked about the need not to exclude the groups that are best able to carry out projects from receiving the money. There are relevant groups benefiting from the 8% of Big funding that does not go to the voluntary and community sector. It makes sense to make the most of what they can offer, rather than shutting them out completely. We might consider some kind of community benefit test. That would achieve our goal of ensuring that lottery money is not being used to plug gaps in local service budgets-I think that was the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal was making-but would still allow Big to fund projects that clearly benefit the community, even if the funding goes to a statutory body, a social enterprise, or an individual. It would have the added advantage of future-proofing Big. When the lottery was first created, we did not anticipate the increasing importance of social enterprises. It is important that any restrictions on Big are flexible enough to enable it quickly to embrace future innovations and changes. I welcome the recent announcements about the big society bank, which will work to enable similar projects, but it seems worth giving the Big Lottery Fund the flexibility also to fund projects in its own way.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.1/3">There are concerns that voluntary and community organisations could see a reduction in the amount of funding that they receive if Big has its funding capped at 40%. Currently, it receives 50% of all good cause money, of which 46% goes to VCOs. I hope that the Minister can provide some reassurances on this matter, as well as considering the other suggestions that I have made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-07-22a.159.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40147" speakername="Alun Michael" colnum="159"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100722/halltext/100722h0001.htm#10072242000237">
	<p pid="a.159.0/1">I chair the all-party group on the community and voluntary sector, and it is particularly pleasing to see in the new Parliament new members on both sides of the House taking a real interest in the issues affecting that sector, as well as volunteering and charities. I suspect that that will be reflected further in this debate. I welcome the consultation and opportunity to debate how the lottery funds should be redistributed after the Olympics, when additional elasticity is provided in the way the Minister described. I am certain that restoring the levels of funding for sports, arts and heritage will be important for the next decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/2">Responding to a comment by a Government Member, I have to say that I do not accept that either the extent of the cuts in Government expenditure or the precipitate nature of the cuts, which puts private sector growth at risk, is necessary. All the parties certainly knew that we were facing difficult financial circumstances, and that was reflected in what was said in advance of the election by my party. The Liberal Democrats in particular cannot abandon almost everything that they said in the run-up to the election using the excuse that they had somehow failed to notice an international crisis that was affecting our national finances. They put up a set of propositions in the light of well known financial circumstances and were clearly cavalier in what they said, not expecting to be in a position of having to make decisions in Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/3">One problem is that the precipitate nature of some of the cuts is damaging to some of the poorest communities throughout the country. For example, in Wales, dependence on employment in the public sector is higher than in many other parts of the United Kingdom. That means that public sector cuts are likely to undermine the capacity of private businesses, particularly small businesses that serve the community, when money is extracted from those economies. We must treat that seriously. I make those comments not to stir up controversy with the Minister, but to correct the excuses that were offered by his Back Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.0/4">It is certain that lottery money will be important in giving funds to important activities and in many cases attracting additional funding from other sources. I applaud the Minister's response on the importance of maintaining additionality. It will be philosophically difficult to maintain that when funding is sought for good projects that will provide value for money and for local communities; however, I think he has accepted the challenge to apply the right principles. It is important that that does not result in funds going only to communities that are better off and perhaps have the resources to prepare a good case for their projects.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2010-07-22a.165.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40429" speakername="Katy Clark" colnum="165"  time="015:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm100722/halltext/100722h0001.htm#10072242000247">
	<p pid="a.165.1/1">It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate, which is important for our communities and many community organisations. I shall echo some of the points that have already been made. It is only fair to say that there is a great deal of concern that Scotland will see a net overall reduction in funding from the lottery as a result of some of the proposed changes. Will the Minister examine that?</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/2">A number of hon. Members from Scottish constituencies are present. That is because in Scotland at the moment there is conversation and discussion about the proposals, and much of its content is that Scotland will fare badly as a result of them. That would be very sad, particularly as there has already been considerable debate in Scotland about the implications of the funding of the Olympics and the withdrawal of funding from Scotland, and many other parts of Britain, as a result of lottery funding being targeted on the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/3">I fear that the effect of some of the proposals may be to target funding on more built-up areas, particularly cities and centres where many large institutions are providing arts and other facilities to the community. I say that partly from my experience over the past five years of representing a very rural constituency and working with a wide range of different organisations that have been trying to obtain funding, not just from the lottery, but from other bodies, such as the Scottish Arts Council and a range of other public sector bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/4">Quite often, there is a view that arts institutions in particular should look like the kind of organisation traditionally seen in cities. Therefore, organisations such as the West Kilbride Craft Town in my constituency, and a range of other arts bodies trying to do important work in a more rural environment and in small communities, have found it difficult to get arts funding. That should be looked at, particularly in the light of some of the Government's proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/5">It is important that rural, poorer, more deprived and working-class areas benefit from the proposals that emerge when the Government decide on the matter. Some powerful points have been made about who buys lottery tickets, and whether those people and their communities are the ones who benefit at the end of the process of lottery allocation. Those arguments may not be made often, but there are important principles that should be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/6">As a Member of Parliament since 2005, I have met numerous community organisations and individuals to discuss applications to the Big Lottery Fund, as has practically every constituency MP, I suspect. New Members will have a huge amount of experience of that over time. It is fair to say that my views are anecdotal and probably reflect my constituency. If I represented a different kind of constituency, I would probably make other points, depending on my experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/7">I have concerns about the social policy implications of some past policies, which have encouraged institutions in our communities to move into the voluntary and community sectors rather than link with the public sector. I represent an area that was traditionally wealthy, because it was very industrialised, having gone through the industrial revolution early. As a result, we have many small communities with a proud history and impressive buildings, but without the wherewithal to maintain the infrastructure that was developed over time, so old buildings are falling into a great state of disrepair. Almost every community in my constituency has public buildings such as Saltcoats town hall, which is gorgeous but is falling to pieces and boarded up at the moment. Another example is Walker hall in Kilburnie, a town built on industries such as Knox rope, which was sold all over the empire and fuelled the construction of impressive buildings that are not being maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/8">In general, the state has taken over ownership of those buildings. However, because of the way national lottery funds operated in the past it has not been possible to get funding to regenerate them. I am not talking about long-term maintenance because that is a slightly different issue. Pressure has been put on community bodies-for example, voluntary committees that help run those halls-to move into the private and voluntary sectors, so that they can apply for funding. As a matter of public policy, it is appropriate for the national lottery and for Big to provide one-off funding to try to regenerate our communities and buildings of that nature, but that should not involve communities having to take on long-term responsibility for running those institutions, when other parts of the community, such as the council, might be willing to do so. I am concerned about the way that the funding rules have operated to date, in that they influence the decisions that people make in communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/9">I am concerned about the administrative role that local organisations have had to play-the fact that it is necessary to create a business plan when making a relatively small application for funding. People in communities without the skills to present a successful application have to professionalise themselves and put a huge amount of work into making applications. Communities that do not have to hand architects, solicitors and surveyors willing to provide their services free are at a disadvantage. More middle-class communities, where there are individuals who can assist and can present applications, will be at an advantage. No community should have to put a disproportionate amount of trouble into making an application. That is something the Government should look at when they consider the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/10">The approach has partly developed from a very cautious decision-making process because money is involved, and organisations have to account for it to the public and the Government. They want to be careful that grants can be justified and are for viable projects, but that makes it difficult for local communities to make applications.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/11">I echo some of the points made about long-term planning and the fact that there has often been a short-term approach to funding. An early experience I had in my constituency concerned the Three Towns Healthy Living Centre, which was set up partly with the support of lottery funding, to provide preventive health services in the community. Eight such healthy living centres were set up in Scotland in deprived communities. According to those who used and had contact with them, they were very successful. However, they were not the kind of project that the NHS was ever going to take on and at the end of the funding period, they had to wind up. We have seen that again and again with the lottery. That point needs to be taken on board. Is it responsible or realistic to provide funding to set up services on a short-term basis if others-whether in the private or public sector-will not come in to fund those projects? I think it would be acceptable for the lottery to say it will fund such projects on a much longer-term basis and that those decisions should be taken in the long term, rather than the short term. It would be helpful if the Government could look at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/12">There is great concern that there may be problems with some proposals, particularly at a time of significant cuts in the arts, museums, culture and, no doubt, many sporting facilities, if Government policy is implemented. Although extra funding for that part of society will be welcome, there is concern-particularly if we are to be living through difficult times-that many community organisations and small projects will lose out, if some of the proposals become reality. I ask for that to be taken on board.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.0/1">Does my hon. Friend not agree that that is wholly at odds with the spirit of the Government's intention to protect DFID's budget? The Government should be utterly comfortable with that, as should her constituents, because poverty and deprivation in other parts of the world have an impact on this country.</p>
