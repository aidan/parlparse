<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.256.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" speakername="Linda Gilroy" colnum="256"  time="009:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0001.htm#08060495000462">
	<p pid="a.256.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is timely. He has led much of the work on this issue. I think that I am right in saying that he was involved in initiating the sub-committee of the all-party group on occupational safety and health, which deals with these matters and keeps them before us. I say to hon. Members who have not yet picked up a copy of the debate pack provided by the House of Commons Library that he has also done us a great service by prompting the production of that pack, because for those of us who have continuously to explain to constituents where the problem stemmed from, it sets out clearly how we have come to this situation, which needs to be changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">My hon. Friend spoke very clearly about how this condition comes from exposure to asbestos at work and how people who are exposed at work to asbestos are 1,000 times more likely than others to develop this condition. My constituency contains the Devonport dockyard, which sadly makes the area a hotspot for deaths arising from asbestos-related diseases. As my hon. Friend mentioned, one third of people develop disease from the pleural plaque condition that turns into a cancer within a 30-year period and 20 per cent. within 20 years. I think that those were the figures that he cited.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">In Plymouth, we have had 250 deaths in the past 15 years. In 1968, in the early days following people's exposure at work, the number of deaths was as low as 153, but now it is 2,000 a year and it will probably peak at about 2,500 over the next 10 years. We are not talking just about individuals; there are also families whose anxiety is raised&mdash;probably 7,000 to 10,000, if one third go on to develop the condition. Given that some of those families' worries do not translate into death from a cancer-related disease arising from pleural plaques, the number of people affected is much greater than such figures suggest.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/4">I pay tribute to everybody who supports people in this campaign and in dealing with those anxieties. I am thinking of groups such as that in my constituency, which was set up by the family of Roger Lowe, who was a dockyard electrical fitter. He lost his battle against the disease in 2005. His family, and particularly his daughter Jackie, who is an articulate spokesperson, have raised these issues. They want to ensure that people can make the best of things. If the disease becomes a cancer, I think I am right to say that people have about 18 months from that point until death. One reason that that gives rise to anxiety for those who have pleural plaques is that they wish to be prepared&mdash;to make those last months as good as possible and to find out about the various support services available.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/5">We should also pay tribute to the trade unions that are backing the campaign. The Union of Construction, Allied Trades and Technicians has already been mentioned, but I know that the Public and Commercial Services Union, Unite and GMB are also actively backing the campaign in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/6">In May, we had an interesting seminar, but great concern was expressed about the time that it will take to sort out the House of Lords ruling. My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone has put before us a straightforward and clear way for that to take place. For all those who are worrying about these things, the sooner we sort them out the better. My constituents feel let down.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/7">We should consider how many hon. Members have raised the matter in questions, signed early-day motions and have campaigns running in their local constituencies. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1744" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase> runs an open surgery campaign in his local paper, as the <i>Evening Herald</i> does for Plymouth. The Norwich <i>Evening News</i> runs what it calls the &quot;Dust of Death&quot; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/8">I hope that we will hear shortly from my hon. Friend the Minister of a way ahead. We have heard that there will be consultation, but I hope that it will not be overly complicated and lengthy. The suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone has the merit of being straightforward; it has great clarity and may prove to be a possible outcome. Once again, I thank him for giving us this timely opportunity to debate the matter. It reminds us what the issue means to our constituents. I hope that we will hear of some progress from the Minister.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2007" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="259"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0002.htm#08060495000464">
	<p pid="a.259.0/1">I add my thanks to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1386" name="Michael Clapham">the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham)</phrase> for securing the debate. The issue will not go away until or unless we get some sort of satisfactory conclusion on behalf of our constituents who suffer from that terrible disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/2">I shall be brief, but I will not dilute in any way the importance of the debate. I am not only anxious to hear what the Minister has to say and to allow her ample time to speak, but to hear what the Opposition parties say. To date, they have been extremely helpful and supportive in the campaign to get justice for those who suffer from pleural plaques. I also thank my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone for bringing forward new evidence this morning, and I hope that the Minister reflects on it and responds accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/3">The debate on pleural plaques has been well rehearsed in this Chamber and throughout the country. To my mind, there is no tangible evidence to prevent the Government from introducing legislation that will compensate those workers who, through no fault of their own, have contracted the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/4">Insurance companies and their legal conspirators play a role in the drama. From day one, insurance companies have set out to block and obstruct the legislation that provided workers with decent compensation, which prompts the question why, after 25 or 30 years, the matter has gone back to the House of Lords. The only reason I can think of is that the insurance companies are trying to cut costs and save money by denying people compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/5">To digress briefly, there was a similar example of such practice under Scots law not so long ago. It used to be that when people died of mesothelioma, their claim died with them, so we saw the unedifying spectacle of insurance companies engaging medical practitioners to assess, across the courtroom, how long a claimant had to live. The companies would then find some sort of technicality to put the case back, hoping that the claimant would die and their claim with them. I mention that to give the Minister and the Government a flavour of the kind of people with whom we are dealing in the insurance industry: they may have sharp suits, but they also have sharp practices. Fortunately, under Scots law, the trade unions, to their credit, fought and won the case, so when someone dies, their family can claim compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, West and Penistone mentioned the previous debate on the matter and the branch of the GMB in London&mdash;only one branch&mdash;in which at least 12 people per year contracted pleural plaques. A significant number of those people went on to die of mesothelioma. That is one branch, as I said, so extrapolating that number throughout the UK would give us an idea of the seriousness of the problem. If the same number of cattle were affected by a disease, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and others would argue that compensation should be at the top of the list, and that it should be a priority for the Government to compensate the farmers whose cattle had died. What is the difference between cattle and human beings?</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/7">There is an international dimension to the matter. The trade unions and the Government have worked to regulate the use of asbestos in the country, but producers have now moved to third-world countries. There is evidence that people in such countries are suffering from the same disease that people in this country suffered from some years ago. That producers of asbestos move from this country to exploit workers in developing countries is a problem. There is a moral case for this country to lead the way and say, &quot;If you poison and exploit people in third-world countries, you should suffer the same consequences as you would here.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/8">There is hope that the Scottish Parliament will introduce legislation to deal with the problem. I have said this before and I shall say it again: I sincerely hope that it brings forward legislation to overturn the ridiculous decision by the Law Lords. I still live in Scotland, and I have watched the performance of the current of the Administration there, so I have some doubts that they will deliver, given that they have delivered on very few of their promises to date. I wish them the best, but I sincerely hope that the UK Government is not standing back waiting for the Scottish Parliament to legislate. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1427" name="David Anderson">the Member for Blaydon (Mr. Anderson)</phrase>, I want to know what discussion, if any, the Minister or the Ministry of Justice has had with the Scottish Parliament on the issue and what progress has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/9">I have a high level of respect for the Minister&mdash;she is a progressive thinker and a fighter for workers' rights&mdash;but, in the previous debate on the matter, she said that she had a duty to consult other Departments. Will she detail which Departments she has consulted and tell us what their position is? What assistance can those of us who are campaigning for legislation to be introduced offer to bring about a satisfactory conclusion?</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/10">I am at a loss, as are people outside the Westminster bubble, as to why we need yet more consultation. We have had consultation since October last year. Perhaps people have not been listening, but do we need further consultation? If so, how long will it take? People are anxious about where we are going with those consultations. Telling them that we need another three or six months' consultation on the matter suggests that we are kicking it into the long grass. I sincerely hope that that is not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.0/11">Like others, I was extremely heartened when the Prime Minister appeared at the Scottish trade union Conference and said that the Government are working toward solving the problem of pleural plaques and that they will bring forward legislation in the near future&mdash;he reiterated that at the Scottish Labour party conference. The Prime Minister is a man of integrity. He has said clearly that we want to be on the side of hard-working families and to introduce fairness. To my mind, there is nothing more fair than saying to the workers of this country, &quot;If you contract a disease outwith your control, those responsible will be held accountable.&quot;</p>

I thoroughly support the main thrust of his argument. I am concerned, however, with the robustness and health of town centres and the fact that independent retailers, which are so vital to their well-being, have been driven out. We cannot stop the march of supermarkets. In fact, I use them myself, and I am sure that everyone in this Chamber does. They have provided a massive service to the people of this country. However, we should encourage them to develop a code of practice, help to start small businesses and do something about loss leaders. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman will address those points quickly, because they are the ones that count.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1645" name="Barry Sheerman">the Member for Huddersfield (Mr. Sheerman)</phrase> on securing this debate. The Under-Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" name="Gareth Thomas">the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas)</phrase>, who has responsibility for consumer affairs, is out of the country on Government business today, but I shall do my best to respond to the important points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Huddersfield.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.0/2">Supermarkets are an important part of life in our country. We all have them in or near our constituencies&mdash;I have a Morrisons, an Aldi, a Lidl, a small Tesco and a large Waitrose in mine. My hon. Friend talked about supermarkets' work in communities and I believe that they do good work. In my constituency, Tesco has given money to a pensioners link line and Waitrose does good work with the Graiseley primary school. It is important, as my hon. Friend stressed, that such businesses are good citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.0/3">My hon. Friend raised many issues about his own constituency, Tesco and the plans that are under discussion. I am sure he will understand if I do not comment on the detail, given that the proposals are likely to be subject to the planning process; indeed, he would not want me to do so. If an application is made along the lines that he described, the local authority might have to refer it to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, so it would be wise not to get drawn too much into the pros and cons of the issue now, lest it prejudice any future decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.0/4">My hon. Friend's description of monopoly power reminded me a little of a film we all watch at Christmas&mdash;&quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot;, starring James Stewart. I cannot remember the name of the character who, in effect, owns the town&mdash;perhaps other hon. Members know&mdash;but I was reminded of him when my hon. Friend described the effect that a monopoly or near-monopoly influence can have on an area.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.0/5">As a society, we probably have dual views on supermarkets' power and small shops. Supermarkets have brought us huge advances in convenience: price, even if there are some issues with that, and choice, because we can choose from thousands of retail lines within one store. However, we also like small shops. We might like to do our major fortnightly or monthly shop in a big supermarket, but in between we like to buy bread at the local bakery or go to the butcher and the small grocer. I am not sure that we should always see the issue in terms of conflict, although I suspect that I might if I were a small retailer. As a society, however, we want both the choice that the big supermarkets represent and probably also the choice represented by small shops in specific cases.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.279.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="279"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0005.htm#08060495000490">
	<p pid="a.279.2/1">It is always a joy to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Atkinson, although I wish I had a more joyful subject to debate. I have called for this debate many times over the past months but, unfortunately, I have not been able to achieve it. This is a little bit late in the day in respect of the consultation on post office closures in mid-Wales. We anticipate an announcement next week. Some news has broken already, and I may mention that in passing during my contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/2">My hon. Friends the Members for Ceredigion (Mark Williams) and for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik) also feel strongly about this issue. I am aware that other announcements have now taken place in Wales regarding post office closures, so other hon. Members from Wales may wish to be involved in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/3">The previous programme of planned post office closures, which related to urban areas, was titled &quot;Post Office reinvention&quot;, which was a misnomer if ever I heard one. As far as the Post Office is concerned, an urban area is defined as an area with more than 10,000 people in one settlement or contiguous settlements. Such is the rural nature of my constituency that only three out of the 56 post offices then open were considered urban and were caught up in the reinvention programme. Those were all in the Ystradgunlais area, which is an old coal-mining community in my constituency that has suffered in respect of its economy and its ability to generate employment ever since the mines closed. That area should have been looked after a little bit better. In the end, we saved one of those post offices, but the one that was closed was probably the one that should have stayed open, because it was in the most deprived area. So when we approached the next planned closure programme, we did not really have much confidence that, if we opposed the closure of post offices in our area, the ones that were closed would have the least impact on our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/4">The consultation exercise in 2006 took place prior to the current closure programme. However, it was difficult to engage in that consultation, because people had to read a relatively thick consultation document and then fill in a pro forma to address the issues raised in that document. A number of people felt that they could not engage in that process. Despite the fact that there were only about 160 responses to the formal consultation in Wales, 40 of those came from my constituency, where I set about ensuring that the people whom I represent made the most of the opportunity. We also submitted 220 responses to our own consultation document, which was easier to complete, with the formal consultation. People were concerned about the criteria for post offices in rural areas. Some 95 per cent. of people living in those areas should be within three miles of a post office, but that means that 5 per cent. of people, whatever their age or capacity to access post offices, could live more than three miles away from one.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/5">In my most pessimistic frame of mind, I looked at the relatively large centres of population in my constituency&mdash;Llandrindod Wells, with about 5,000 people, and Brecon, with about 8,000&mdash;and noticed that a post office in one of those places, with about eight others, might meet the 95 per cent. criterion. My most pessimistic view then was that we were in for a wholesale closure of post offices. Our contribution to that consultation made little or no difference, because the closure programme went ahead as set out in the consultation document. It seems to me that our representations had no particular effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/6">The announcement of the post office closures in mid-Wales under the current closure programme was made on <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-11">11 March 2008</phrase>. By that time, we had been running a campaign to alert people to the possibility of post office closures and distributing postcards to people to be filled in and returned to us so that we could pass them on to the Prime Minister himself in No. 10 Downing street. By <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-11">11 March 2008</phrase>, we had received 2,500 postcard responses. To date, we have received 3,500 postcards from a constituency population of about 50,000. So hon. Members can see the concern and affection. Affection is an emotional term rather than an economic one, but that is how people feel about their local post offices and the contribution that they make to local communities. Furthermore, the postcard campaign required action on the part of my constituents. In many campaigns, people just have to press a button on the web page, hit the &quot;send&quot; button or sign a petition. Petitions are valuable, but with our campaign people had to buy a stamp, stick it on the postcard and send the postcard to me. So people responded actively.</p>
	<p pid="a.279.2/7">The public consultation has now closed and the Post Office is currently reviewing the submissions that it received. Probably all the postmasters and postmistresses involved in the process have now been informed of the outcome, but unfortunately some have broken cover and revealed it. That makes it difficult for other postmasters and postmistresses who have kept the confidence, because if their customers ask what the outcome of the consultation is, they will be in a difficult, embarrassing situation. I regret the process that has taken place.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.285.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" speakername="Hywel Williams" colnum="285"  time="014:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0006.htm#08060495000506">
	<p pid="a.285.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Atkinson; I will take your injunction to heart. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on securing the debate. It is an important, if slightly unglamorous, debate, covering the bread-and-butter issues that constituency MPs deal with every day. Clearly, such a debate cannot compete with the glamour of the debate in the main Chamber, as not a single member of the Welsh parliamentary Labour party is here. Presumably, those hon. Members are in the main Chamber, vying with one another to contribute to the debate on volunteering&mdash;or possibly not. However, this is an important issue, pertinent not only to mid-Wales but to all of rural Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/2">The point that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire made about rurality being defined in terms of populations of under 10,000 people is very important for my constituency. Not a single town in the constituency of Caernarfon has a population of more than 10,000, so I assume that all of my constituency is defined as rural, which would come as a surprise to some of the town dwellers.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/3">Rural Wales faces a profound challenge. I will mention only in passing such challenges as the Government's decision to grant greater tax relief in relation to capital gains on holiday homes. That will have a strong effect on that market. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation report published just today on housing in Wales shows that there are 18,000 empty houses, while at the same time homelessness in rural Wales is up sharply. Houses in rural Wales typically cost five time average earnings. That is a truly shocking scenario. The challenge to life in rural Wales is clearly substantial, and it will become more substantial&mdash;the situation is even more dangerous&mdash;because of the Post Office proposals. They not only affect post offices in mid-Wales, but will extend to north Wales as a result of the consultation that is under way, which I understand will report at the end of July.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/4">I shall not go through all the arguments. They are fairly familiar, as such debates are held regularly in this Chamber&mdash;indeed, I have contributed to a number of them. However, it is worth quickly restating some points. For instance, rural sub-post offices are focal points for the community; they pay pensions and benefits and provide all kinds of vital services&mdash;not only shopping, but basic information and social contact for local people. Some of those services are not commercial; some are. The commercial ones might not be viable without the post office element, such as the one at Llyswen referred to by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/5">In my constituency, we have a sub-post office that is clustered with a couple of other shops. I believe that those shops depend on each other to attract custom; without the post office, there would be a serious threat to the viability of the other shops that crowd into that parade, which is in a nice area in the north of Caernarfon. It is not only post offices that are under threat; their closure will also affect newsagents, small grocery stores and so on. The area will be less attractive for shoppers. Closing the post office can have a domino effect on other local shops. We should also be aware of the multiplier effect, which has been mentioned a number of times, as people who claim a benefit or draw money from the local post office tend to spend it locally. That pound circulates more widely and has a much more beneficial effect on the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/6">Between March 2001 and December 2007 in Wales, 258 post offices closed, many of them in rural areas in mid and north Wales. That is about 19 per cent., or nearly one in five. As I said, a consultation is taking place in north Wales and we expect a number of post offices to be closed. Some of them, I suppose reasonably, will close because people will want to retire and put their business up for sale, but I am sure that some will be closed in the teeth of local opposition. I hope that the Minister will assure us that the Post Office will listen to local opinion when the consultation is held in north Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/7">As I said in an intervention on the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, mobile post office vans have been introduced in my constituency, which is in a particularly rural part of the Lleyn peninsula. That, of course, has led to diminished hours. It also raises specific questions about the business model. The provider of the van found that he could not make a business of driving the 50 or 60 miles while ensuring that someone minded the shop at home. At the same time, although some people accepted a service every two or three hours, some found it insufficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/8">Given the geography of rural Wales&mdash;and the deeply rural areas of England and the north of Scotland&mdash;the post office could be miles away. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, the standard is three miles. However, 5 per cent. of people might be as far as six miles away from the post office. In rural areas where public transport, if there is any, might be scarce, travelling such a distance could be a challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/9">We are all aware that there is a green aspect. In areas such as Powys, which is represented by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, it is not surprising that car ownership is at its highest&mdash;and incomes are at their lowest. Car ownership is sometimes seen as a measure of prosperity, but in Powys the car is a necessity. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree that many families own one, two or even three cars in order to ensure that life in rural areas is viable. Cars are not a costly luxury, but a costly necessity. For such families, the withdrawal of the post office will be a further disincentive to live in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/10">Rural poverty is also an issue. Without doubt, lack of access to good services is a major component of poverty. That is recognised in the index used by the Welsh Assembly Government to measure deprivation and poverty. Remoteness is another factor. The closure proposals will exacerbate rural poverty on such measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/11">One might think that some of those bad effects could be countered by the introduction of new technology and that people could perhaps use services online. I draw the House's attention to a report published yesterday, which shows that in rural areas broadband access is not easy to obtain because of what are called not-spots, although BT claims that only 1 per cent. of Wales has not-spots. None the less, I seem to have many of them in my constituency. For example, one cannot receive broadband in the village of Rhiwlas but gallingly one can see Caernarfon and Bangor on the coast from there as it is high on the side of the hill. One can see areas where people have not only good access to shops but broadband.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/12">We may have not-spots, but significantly yesterday's report also noted that broadband speeds in Wales are about half those in London. I have no technical expertise in these matters, but I believe that as a result it is more difficult to use broadband for all kinds of services, not least receiving television pictures&mdash;but that is another matter. Such things have a significant effect on the viability of living in rural areas. Local businesses in my constituency that use the post office and might use broadband instead will have to think again, because of the difficulties of working online.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.0/13">The rural-urban split is deepening, as life in much of Wales becomes more and more unsustainable. The Government's policy should be to ameliorate that divide, not deepen it, as a perhaps unintended consequence of that deliberate and unwelcome policy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.287.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1506" speakername="David Jones" colnum="287"  time="015:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0006.htm#08060495000507">
	<p pid="a.287.0/1">I am aware of the shortness of time, Mr. Atkinson, so I shall be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I also have a good word for the Minister. Of all the poisoned chalices on offer in Westminster, he seems to have drawn the most unpalatable. It is a credit to him that over the past few months he has been at one debate after another attempting to defend the indefensible. I remember the mauling that he suffered in March in an Opposition day debate on the subject. It must be difficult for him to undertake his present role. Nevertheless, I believe that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire was right to invite the Minister to come here again this afternoon to take another mauling from Welsh Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/3">The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire has already mentioned the particular difficulties caused by the remoteness of his community. Mid-Wales is a part of the country that I know only too well. My wife comes from mid-Wales, and I can certainly attest to the area's remoteness. I sometimes wonder how I ever found her; but find her I did. In many respects, the hon. Gentleman's constituency resembles mine. It is one of scattered villages, many separated by hills and rivers. That is where the Government's access criteria fail. The three-mile radius is meaningless when one considers the topography of mid and north Wales. One cannot travel as the crow flies there. The damage being done to communities in the rural parts of Wales by the closure programme, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> pointed out, is significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/4">Very often, the post office is literally the only business in the village, let alone the only shop. There are villages in my constituency, as I am sure there are in the constituency of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, where the post office is also the shop, and it might also be a small guest house. As a composite, such a business is viable, but if one element is taken out, it becomes unviable. I regret to say that that is precisely what will happen in mid and north Wales and in other rural parts of Wales when the closure programme is completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/5">Rural life in Wales is becoming increasingly difficult. We have seen school closure programmes, the effect of high fuel prices and now the effect of the Government's disgraceful tinkering with vehicle excise duty. It is becoming almost impossible to live a civilised life in rural parts of Wales, and the post office closure programme is doing deep social damage to the fabric of life.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/6">When the Government tabled their successful amendment to the Opposition day motion, it was interesting that they recognised</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the vital social and economic role of post offices, in particular in rural and deprived urban communities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/8">If they really do recognise the vital role of post offices, why are they presiding over such a draconian closure programme?</p>
	<p pid="a.287.0/9">For many people in mid-Wales and other parts of Wales, the post office closure programme will simply be the last straw. Businesses will close across Wales, and the heart will be taken out of village communities, which will ultimately die. It is sad that the Government are presiding over this programme with apparent equanimity, seemingly oblivious to the social effects that they are inflicting on people in scattered rural communities. It is probably too late for the Government to think again, but I would like the Minister to reflect on the damage that has been done and possibly even to consider apologising for it to the people of Wales.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.289.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" speakername="Mark Williams" colnum="289"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0006.htm#08060495000510">
	<p pid="a.289.1/1">I worry about Postwatch, and the hon. Lady is right to mention it. Postwatch's role in the process has been minimal, and I am very concerned about it. In some instances, Postwatch did not even come to our large consultation meetings, which is a real worry. In their many submissions, my constituents were quite wise to that fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/2">We cannot overstate the significance of practical issues such as access to services and the lack of public transport. I represent a large county with 147 villages and hamlets, where rurality really does mean something. Ceredigion has 7,000 small businesses, which is more than any other constituency in the United Kingdom, let alone Wales. We are talking, therefore, not only about business opportunities for the person who undertakes the mobile van service, but about the great inconvenience to a large number of our small businesses, which are the backbone of the rural economy, and to the farming community. Another threatened post office, in the community of Pontsian, serves a large ward and 64 farming families. Again, small businesses will not easily be able to fit in with the van's limited hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/3">I shall cite one more example to highlight the vagaries of public transport. The now infamous village of Llanddewi Brefi&mdash;it is a wonderful community&mdash;has a post office with an accompanying village shop. It has been asserted that when the van is not there, people will be able to access services in Tregaron&mdash;another delightful town in the south of Ceredigion. However, even if people had the good fortune to catch the bus to Tregaron, which is five miles away, they would either have to undertake all their business in 33 minutes flat so that they could catch the bus home, or they would have to wait two hours for the next service&mdash;and that is a pretty good service, compared with other public services in my constituency. The alternative would be to hire a taxi for the return journey, which would involve a &pound;12 fare.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/4">Sadly, as my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, we are looking ahead to the next campaign. Like the hon. Member for Clwyd, I shall reflect on the criteria set out by the Government. We were told at the numerous public meetings that the Post Office was the agent of the Government and of Government decision making, and that the criteria are a Government responsibility. However, there has been a complete lack of recognition of rural deprivation. Ninety-nine per cent. of the total population in deprived urban areas across the UK are to be within one mile of the nearest post office branch, but the same recognition has not been afforded to rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/5">Ceredigion and the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> fall into the EU convergence funding&mdash;formerly objective 1&mdash;area for a very good reason. As he said, the National Assembly, through its communities first programme, has also recognised that they are areas of acute rural deprivation. Europe has recognised that, the Welsh Assembly Government have recognised it, but the Westminster Government seem not to recognise it in this instance. There is a widely held perception that the communities of west Wales, which are scattered and isolated, are being left to wither on the vine.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/6">Over and above its initial criteria, the Post Office has said that it would consider the impact on local economies, but I seriously question how much weighting it has given to that critical factor. In many communities in Ceredigion&mdash;Talybont, Llanilar, Llangeitho, Llanddewi Brefi and Pontsian&mdash;the post office is integrally linked to the village shop: if one goes, the other will go too. I remain very concerned about the future viability of those businesses. I cite again the verdict of the Select Committee on Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, which I realise the Minister heard yesterday in the debate on post office closures in East Devon. The Committee said that</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/7" class="indent">&quot;there should be a presumption against closing a Post Office where this is the last shop in the village or in a deprived urban area&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/8">We cannot overstate the significance of the post office in rural life. It is the last community social business in those communities. When the village school has gone and the chapel is boarded up the post office is the last thing left. Sometimes I think that we and the Government have been debating completely different cases; the social role of post offices has been neglected.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/9">I know that the Minister is well versed in the many anecdotes that he has been and will be subjected to in past and coming months, but people such as Heulwen Astley, the postmistress in Talybont, and Ann Mayes-Davies in Pontsian, have served their communities very well, and, if given the opportunity, will continue to do so in future. The majority of postmasters and postmistresses I have spoken to in the affected areas are keen to carry on their businesses and do not want to join the exodus that others have talked about. They want their businesses to thrive, and they want support. I should have thought that if the Post Office was sincere about supporting those retail businesses it would at the very least have offered them an outreach facility. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire cited the example of the van parked outside the shop. Pontsian post office near Llandysul is a case in point. If the proposal proceeds, the van will be located outside that shop. What an insult to the years of service that the postmistress has given. Giving her the chance to have the outreach facility in the shop would at least guarantee footfall across the threshold.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/10">I am conscious of the time, so I will be quick, but I want to ask the Minister the extent of his discussions, and the Post Office's, with the National Assembly Government, in the light of the announcement in January of the recommencement next year of the post office development fund, which did good work in its previous life. Another threatened post office in Ceredigion, Devil's Bridge, was one of those that benefited from the development fund. The branch received many accolades from the Post Office itself. Edryd and Jane Jenkins, the owners, have done a huge amount of community work, which has been acknowledged by the Post Office. They pioneered a service there with the Dyfed-Powys police, yet it seems that when the National Assembly starts its work next year, even in the communities first areas that it has defined itself, the post offices will already have gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/11">Business has been taken from the Post Office over many years, such as the loss of TV licences. There is a continuing fear about the future of the Post Office card account. I hope that, as other hon. Members have said, notwithstanding the economics of the issue and the work that needs to be done to publicise future post office services and encourage people to use them, the Government will at least acknowledge the essential social role of post offices. The irony is that at a time when the Post Office is being branded &quot;the people's Post Office&quot;, in Wales, practically and theoretically, it seems far removed from people's everyday lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.2/1">Yet still the Conservatives closed post offices. That makes the position even more incongruous than I believed.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/2">The criteria for considering which post offices to shut have been described as numerous, but money is obviously the core consideration. The Government and the Post Office say that they have been required to make a profit and that what is happening is the only way they can do it. Actually, the Government could make a different political judgment instead of dogmatically requiring the closure of post offices; if, rather than taking away the ability of post offices and sub-postmasters to offer facilities, they positively widened that access, we would not be in the mess that we are in. The irony is that television licensing, which was taken away from the Post Office, costs more now than it did under the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/3">With an ageing population and high rural house prices the problem is even worse in rural areas such as mine. Several post offices have been and continue to be under threat in my constituency, including those at Llanbrynmair, a small settlement with no convenient local alternative; Carno, a village with the capacity to grow substantially; Trefeglwys, which has a successful shop, and where others, including the community, are interested in taking on the post office facility; Garth Owen, the only other post office in Newtown, which has a population of about 11,000; Sarn, where there is a small outlet of many years' standing; Castle Caereinion, which has a cherished and well used post office under the auspices of Michael Rogers; Berriew, which is an idyllic village with many tourists and a Spar shop that is very keen to take on the facility; and Abermule, perhaps the greatest concern of all, where Pauline and Peter Albrecht have worked their guts out to make their shop successful and their sub-post office an important local service. All those post offices are under threat because of the mandate that has come from the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/4">It is all very well for the Government to adopt the approach of pretending that there is no alternative. If they gave post offices more opportunity to provide wider services, profits would be forthcoming. In addition, the Government seem to be ignoring what is happening in the oil market at the moment. With diesel at &pound;1.30 a litre in my area, my constituents are all too aware of the additional cost of travelling to other post offices in lieu of those that are to be closed. Let us not pretend that what is happening is cheap. If Castle Caereinion post office were to shut it would cost at least &pound;2 to post a letter, taking into account the cost of the fuel to travel to the next nearest post office, at Llanfair Caereinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/5">What about the environmental consequences? The Government talk about wanting to be environmentally responsible, yet in the same breath they announce the decimation of rural services, so that people are forced to travel further than ever before for such facilities. The Government also seem to ignore the fact that post offices are not just a business service; they are a social service. Nothing in the accountancy-led decision that has been made seems to reflect the social importance of post office facilities to constituencies such as Montgomeryshire and those of my hon. Friends who are here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/6">The strength of feeling can be garnered not just by word of mouth from the population but from the well organised and coherent campaigns that have been run by so many people in the affected communities. I pay tribute to the <i>County Times</i>, which has done more than any other paper in my constituency to highlight the issue and consistently to portray, with a fact-based approach, how important local people consider post offices to be. Furthermore, the paper employs the finest photographer and some of the finest reporters anywhere in the land.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/7">In conclusion, I have some questions for the Minister. Why are the Government unwilling to make a surcharge, to ensure that the private competitors of the Royal Mail do not have to pay towards the universal service obligation? What is the justification for continuing with the ludicrous access headroom discount, which means that the Post Office has to discount its competitors? Why could that money not be used to cross-subsidise the post office network? We could also look again at the price of stamps. What assurance can the Minister give us that the consultation process, in which all of us have meticulously participated, has the capacity to make any positive difference?</p>
	<p pid="a.291.2/8">Like many others, I have acted in good faith. I have worked with the Post Office, Postwatch and Ministers to get the Government to think again. Forthcoming announcements will give a clear indication as to whether the Government and the Post Office value the consultation and whether the social value of post offices has been taken into consideration. If there is wholesale closure of rural post offices, they will also tell us that the Government know the price of everything and the value of nothing.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.0/1">I did not cover that point in my contribution. We managed to save a post office in my constituency, but we wait with baited breath to find out whether another has been identified for closure, which would mean going through the whole six-week consultation process again.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.1/1">Absolutely&mdash;it is invidious to expect local people to make such a choice. People will always campaign for their local post office, and they understand that the closure of a post office could have a huge impact on a neighbouring area. Six weeks is not long enough to put together any kind of sensible rescue package. Many communities, perhaps working with the local authority or businesses, want to put together a rescue package to ensure that a post office continues to be viable, but six weeks is not long enough to do that. It is as if we are simply going through the motions. By law, the Government must consult, but they are not terribly interested in what local people think about the impact of closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/2">London is a different kind of area&mdash;it is urban rather than rural&mdash;but we in Brent have just found out that another six post offices are due to close, so I sympathise with the frustration that hon. Members feel. Only 60 per cent. of post offices that were open in 1997 remain. A number of hon. Members spoke about queues. I have seen a change in people's behaviour even before post offices close, and the queues are already unmanageable at neighbouring post offices.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/3">All hon. Members who have spoken mentioned the impact on local shops. That is especially relevant in villages, where the post office might be the only shop, but it is also relevant in urban areas where, often, post offices reside in small parades of shops. If the post office is lost, the shop often goes with it. Because of the lack of footfall to neighbouring shops, the whole parade of shops in the area could be lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/4">A post office has an important economic role to play in surrounding areas&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1469" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Caernarfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion made that point well. A number of reports have attempted to quantify their value. The New Economics Foundation, for example, has said that the cost to an urban area's economy of losing a post office is around &pound;277,000, which impacts on VAT received by the Government. Sometimes, the Government do not benefit greatly from their own cuts. In rural areas, it has been estimated that for every &pound;1 of subsidy, there is something between a &pound;2 and &pound;4 pound benefit to the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/5">Mobile post offices are simply inadequate to replace an original post office&mdash;they will not replace local shops that are lost.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/6">A number of hon. Members spoke about the small amount of money&mdash;&pound;45 million&mdash;that the Government will save from the process. Given the amount of grief they get and the impact on the rural economy, I am sure that the Minister, sitting in his place yet again, wonders whether it is really worth it and whether, in the long run, it will cost the Government more money. I know that he will hate my raising this, but that sum is in stark contrast to the figures published by Royal Mail that show that Adam Crozier gained more than &pound;3 million in bonuses, benefits and salaries. The Minister has an answer to that point, because he knows that I make it all the time.</p>

	<p pid="a.297.4/1">Thank you, Mr. Atkinson. We certainly recognise the fantastic service provided by postmasters and sub-postmasters in local communities, which came through in some hon. Members' contributions. However, what I did not hear from any of the Liberal Democrat Members or the Plaid Cymru Member was a concerted plan for post office action.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/2">As the Minister knows, in response to increasing fears about significant post office closures, the Conservatives published a post office action plan last year. For the sake of symmetry, I shall repeat it, which will give the Minister an opportunity in responding to update me on the Government's views. First, on freeing up sub-postmasters, we would certainly allow sub-postmasters to provide a greater range of products and services, including private mail services. The network's long-term future will be best secured if the post office is opened up to new markets and new customers. We want to use post offices as a sort of government GP surgery. We could investigate a scheme in which people with concerns involving a range of government services could use their local post office as a kind of government GP.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/3">Will the Minister update me on what has been happening with the Welsh Assembly Government? The &quot;One Wales&quot; document said that the Government would</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/4" class="indent">&quot;reinstate and refocus the Post Office Development Fund&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/5">Will he confirm whether that has happened? Also, what has been happening as far as the small business rate relief scheme is concerned for post offices in Wales?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/6">We campaigned on the Post Office card account. We called repeatedly for the Government to review the decision to abolish the POCA, and we were delighted that they responded to our arguments and changed their mind, but we also propose to encourage council counters, which would encourage local councils to see what services they could provide through their post offices and whether they could use the post office network in their area to engage better with local residents.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/7">Services should be more widely available in the community. Indeed, one of the post offices I visited, in the constituency of the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire, was providing fishing licences for a father and son. That was an excellent additional service. When I visited Pendre, I spoke to Jay Vakil, and in Llanfaes I met Karen Weale with our excellent candidate for Brecon and Radnorshire, Suzy Davies, who has been doing a tremendous amount of work on the issue. She started many of the petitions in the area. I became aware of the pressure from the community to keep those post offices open, as I said when the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire so kindly let me intervene.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/8">The post office closures have worrying implications for Wales. Will the Minister comment on the New Economics Foundation study showing that when post offices close in a community, it has an impact on the local economy, and that a single post office closure could result in the loss of &pound;270,000 to that local economy? The foundation also worked out that every &pound;10 earned by a post office generates &pound;16.20 in income in the local economy. He will know that our economy in Wales is fragile, to say the least, in rural areas. What work has he done on that effect of the closures that the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire has brought to our attention?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.4/9">Despite all the protests by Members of Parliament and members of the community, the Government appear not to have responded. I point out to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> that no Welsh Labour MPs are present in this debate. When we proposed to halt the closure programme, 22 Welsh Labour MPs voted against our motion; the only one to stick with us was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase>, on which he should be congratulated. I believe that the Government are doing Wales and the rest of the country a great disservice. They are not listening to the people. I hope that the Minister will not turn out the standard response that he has been turning out in these debates over the past weeks, months and years, and that this time he will really listen to the people of Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.1/1">I understand. I was saying that the Post Office tries to inform people, such as MPs and sub-postmasters, before information enters the public domain. Difficulties can result if someone else&mdash;we do not know who&mdash;releases that information, but I suspect that, if the Post Office were to stop informing such people in advance, the effect would be even worse, because people would simply read about it in the newspapers.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/2">Understandably, hon. Members talk about the strength of feeling about, and opposition to, the closures in their constituencies. No one likes their post office to close, even if they do not use it very much. Hon. Members might object, but quite often I have to point out the reasons for some of the closures and set out some of the challenges that face the Post Office. Over the past hour or so, we have not heard a great deal about that. The Post Office's difficulties are being driven by three significant factors. The first factor is life-style change, the biggest example of which is how we receive money. Nowadays, people are used to receiving their salaries directly into their bank accounts, which is reflected as people retire. We might think of the post office as the outlet of choice for almost all pensioners when picking up their pensions, but that is no longer the case. Eight out of 10 have their pensions paid directly into their bank account, and the younger a pensioner is, the more likely that is to be the case&mdash;the figure is nine out of 10 among new retirees. That is one example of how things are changing for the Post Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/3">The second factor is technology. The past decade has witnessed a complete revolution in the way that people communicate with one another. That technological change has also affected the way that we pay bills and carry out transactions. An example is car tax online, which is a service that did not even exist a year ago. Last year, 500,000 people used it every month, and that figure is now 1 million&mdash;1 million people no longer visiting their post offices to tax their cars. What should the Government do about that? Should we deny the availability of that service? I do not believe so. The difficult truth is that, far from being ahead of the curve on technology and the way that people live, I believe that the Government are probably behind it. The public are probably ahead of the politicians. That will inevitably have an impact on the number of people who use the Post Office.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.2/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mr. Atkinson. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">the hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/2">The point about the interest in the service has been well made both by the presence of four other hon. Members and by the support of others who were not able to be here today. I recognise the concerns that the hon. Gentleman raised about the future funding arrangements of the combined police and air ambulance operation. The unit provides police air support and helicopter emergency medical services to the people of Wiltshire. Significantly, the helicopter has been provided under a private finance initiative and is based at the Devizes headquarters of the Wiltshire constabulary. The PFI contract has been going for a long time. By working with its local ambulance service and co-locating some of its services, Wiltshire has been one of the most forward thinking police authorities. Perhaps other parts of the country could learn from such an operation. The contract has been running for nearly 10 years and is due for renewal from December this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/3">Contract negotiations are currently ongoing. The Great Western ambulance service has asked for an extension to the contract while it carries out a review of the area's clinical need for helicopter services. I understand that the police are pressing for a further five-year contract. As the hon. Gentleman said, the two parties are still in negotiation over that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/4">As the hon. Gentleman appreciates, there are limits to the Home Office's reach in such areas. As he quite helpfully pointed out, I do not have responsibility for the national health service; I have plenty of other things on my plate. There are important issues about the autonomy of local police and ambulance authorities. It is not the role of the Home Office to direct, at a close local level, individual operational decisions. It is for Wiltshire constabulary, the police authority, neighbouring police forces and the air ambulance charities to determine their own operational needs. It is important to recognise that the Government do not run everything from Whitehall. We do not have any locus in this area and neither do the Department of Health or the National Policing Improvement Agency, for which I have some responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/5">From the Home Office perspective, police helicopter operations are very important. They have been used to target criminal activity and have improved safety on dangerous vehicle pursuits. In this instance, in which the aircraft is shared, we have seen benefits to the public, which is what we all, as Members of Parliament, are most interested in. The vital role of delivering emergency care to people across south-west England has proved an effective and faster way of getting people to hospital and supporting inter-hospital transfers.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/6">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the amount of money that has been raised by the public. Clearly, the service has had enormous support from the public. People have been dipping into their pockets to pay for it. They also support the work that has been done by the medical and trauma teams. I am grateful for the work done by both the police and the helicopter emergency medical service, which is carried out on a 24/7 basis. The teams work long hours, which is very impressive.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/7">It was interesting and instructive to learn&mdash;from the review that the hon. Gentleman mentioned&mdash;that Wiltshire and Sussex are the only two counties with a joint operation. We should consider that model for the future. In a moment, I will touch on what is happening with the review, as the hon. Gentleman asked. There are clearly financial benefits to linking services, which enables the air ambulance to operate at night because of the capacity of the police helicopter and the equipment therein.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/8">The current national air support strategy for the police has served police services since 1993, but there has been no meaningful review for 14 years. It is a mark of the differences and changes over the years that in 1993 only 16 forces nationally had any form of air support, but today 39 of 43 forces have direct access to aircraft, with 34 helicopters and four fixed-wing planes available to the police nationally, although procured on the basis of local demands and resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/9">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the funding provided by the Home Office, in the funding round that we are approaching at the moment, with a capital pot of &pound;5 million available for part-funding the capital purchase of helicopters. Because the Wiltshire helicopter was purchased under a private finance initiative arrangement, the aircraft belongs to Police Aviation Services, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. We cannot put Home Office investment into an asset that belongs to that organisation rather than the police. That limits the opportunities to look at that pot of money.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.309.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" speakername="Daniel Kawczynski" colnum="309"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0009.htm#08060495000548">
	<p pid="a.309.1/1">This is a subject that I feel passionately about. The college is a major centre for learning in my constituency, and during the next 15 minutes I have a tremendous opportunity to share some of our experiences of co-location with the Minister and to ask for clarification on certain elements of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/2">I start by stating my admiration for the teachers, lecturers and staff of the sixth-form college, who do a tremendous job&mdash;I am always in awe of what they achieve. The Minister will know of the tremendous results of the college's pupils. That is primarily down to the professionalism and hard work not only of the teaching staff but of the assistants, management and everyone involved. That is not the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/3">There is no doubt that sixth-form colleges need investment. I was taken around the sixth-form college by Mr. Robert Bland, one of the governors, and I was shown the dilapidated state of some of the rooms. I have no doubt that both colleges in Shrewsbury&mdash;the sixth-form college and Shrewsbury college of art and technology&mdash;need significant investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/4">Funding comes from the Learning and Skills Council. The LSC will allow a community such as mine to apply for funding for only one project at a time, and there is no alternative to that. In our case, the principals have decided to go ahead with a co-location proposal to scrap the Shrewsbury sixth-form college in the town centre and co-locate that college with another&mdash;Shrewsbury college of art and technology&mdash;in London road.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/5">That is the proposal, and the LSC has told our community that it can have &pound;30 million if we co-locate both colleges on London road, which the principals of both colleges want. However, there is no alternative for the community; there is no alternative for me; there is no alternative for the council; and there is no alternative for the thousands of my constituents who object to co-location in London road, which is in a highly residential area of Shrewsbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/6">If the proposal does not secure planning permission, the governing bodies will have to go back to the drawing board. It is much better always to have a back-up plan when trying to secure such an investment, rather than putting all one's eggs in one basket&mdash;co-location or nothing&mdash;and then having to go back to the drawing board and start discussions all over again.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/7">I disagree with co-location on London road, because it is a highly residential part of the community and it will pull the students away from the town centre, where they have become are an integral part of its life and character. My hair is going grey as a result of the controversy; over the last year, I have had to grapple with this issue more than any other. There is huge dissatisfaction among the teachers at the sixth-form college, who are not convinced by the educational case for co-location.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/8">My first question to the Minister is this. What is Government policy on co-location? Is it something that the Government want? Do they want to see colleges co-locating? Is there an educational case for co-location? Ninety-three per cent. of the teachers at the sixth-form college have written to me stating that they do not want co-location. They want independence; they want to be able to carry on as they have done for generations past and make a tremendous success of it. What is Government policy on co-location?</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/9">I want to share with the Minister the problems that the community has had in that regard. For the benefit of this debate, I shall mention the three most important people involved in the project. I shall read statements from a Shrewsbury resident who is a parent of three school-age children, a governor who was forced to resign from the sixth-form college over the issue and a lecturer at the sixth-form college.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/10">The parent states that</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/11" class="indent">&quot;the professional bodies the Highways Agency and the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment have issued numerous and wide-ranging criticisms of the co-location plans (HA issued a TR110 directing that planning permission not be granted until all the HA's concerns have been addressed and CABE rated the plan's environmental strategies as 'poor', the lowest possible rating).&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/12">I was so concerned about the views of the Highways Agency that I held a public meeting, attended by more than 150 members of the public. The agency has stated on record that it has serious concerns about the prospect of the co-location going ahead in London road, because that would have major ramifications for the A5 and Emstrey island, for which it is responsible. Do the Government share my concerns? I ask the Minister for a guarantee that such a project cannot go ahead as long as the Highways Agency continues to have those professional concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/13">The parent goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/14" class="indent">&quot;Despite all this, the principals continue to attempt to force their project through. At times there has been scant regard for free speech and democracy (SSFC Code of Conduct issued Nov 07 prohibiting staff from speaking to the media without the Principal's permission), and undue pressure has been brought to bear on individuals, including yourself, (you'll remember the co-location meeting minutes of late Jan 08 which said 'MP will be placed under pressure at appropriate points to curb his random tendencies').&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/15">Those are the minutes of the meeting of the governors of the sixth-form college. They were leaked and given to my office. I am extremely concerned that the governors and principal of the sixth-form college have tried to stifle debate among teachers at the college who object to the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/16">I come now to the governor of the college who was forced to resign, for whom I have great admiration, Mr. David Holmes, who is head of civil engineering for a major British company. He was forced to resign because he objected to the proposals. He had the temerity to write to my borough council and say that he did not think that the plans were right and that, as a resident, he wanted to voice his concerns. He said that he very much hoped that planning permission would not be given for the project to go ahead. He made the mistake of saying in his letter of objection to the council that he was a governor of the college, and he was forced to resign. Is the Minister happy for governors of colleges to be forced to resign if they object to planning applications?</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/17">Mr. Holmes says:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/18" class="indent">&quot;I was requested to resign by Philip Morris (clerk) and he told me that this was as a result of a meeting between Bill Dowell&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/19">the principal&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/20" class="indent">&quot;and Robert Bland (chair). I assumed that this had been with broad support of other governors but I subsequently learned that they had not been consulted at all. This is another example of the unassailable power base of the principal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/21">Mr. Holmes says:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/22" class="indent">&quot;There are 16 governors...2 are elected by parents, 2 by staff, 2 by students and 2 are councillors and so have some accountability through the ballot box. This means that 50 per cent. are not elected in any fashion.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/23">I am very concerned about that. What plans does the Minister have to make governors of important learning institutions, such as that sixth-form college, more accountable to the people whom they purport to represent, such as students, teachers, the MP and the local community? It is of great concern to me that so many of the governors are appointed rather than being directly elected to their posts.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/24">Mr. Holmes says:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/25" class="indent">&quot;There is no means of holding the governors to account in any meaningful fashion. They do not answer to a single electorate. Parents, for example, can only elect 2 out of 16, a very small proportion&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/26">He says that the principal told him that there were &quot;high levels of accountability&quot;. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/27" class="indent">&quot;When I asked him who could hold the governors to account he could only come up with the LSC&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/28">Of course the principal says that the governors can be held to account by people going to the LSC, but if someone goes to the LSC, it says, &quot;No, we can't hold the governors to account. You have to go to the governors.&quot; That is ludicrous. It allows the whole governing body to be totally unaccountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/29">Mr. Holmes goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/30" class="indent">&quot;The introductory documentation (emailed to you on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-13">13 May</phrase>) for a person seeking to be an elected parent governor is now intimidating and virtually demands a person who is willing to accept and support all governor decisions without question. Dissent and debate do not appear encouraged. This stifles any fresh thinking.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/31">I am trying to speak in a non-partisan way. I would like clarification from the Minister on those points. I am deeply concerned about the lack of accountability in the governors and the principal, and the fact that everything is somehow falling through that lack of accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/32">Many of the teachers at the sixth-form college feel extremely intimidated if they say anything against the proposals. I have had some 14 meetings with teachers from the college. They have come to see me here at the House of Commons, and I have gone to see them. They are desperately concerned about what is happening. One of the lecturers&mdash;of course, I will not reveal her name&mdash;put the following questions directly to the Minister:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/33" class="indent">&quot;Staff at SSFC met with Bill Rammell in summer of 2007&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/34">a meeting that I organised for them&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/35" class="indent">&quot;who advised them to continue talking to their governors. This was not facilitated by governors and ultimately led to staff passing an overwhelming vote of no confidence in their governors.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/36" class="indent">In the light of advice from John Denham's office that staff should speak to their governors following an overwhelming vote of no confidence in them, what is the response to the fact that these same governors have now refused to engage in direct communication with staff on urgent and pressing issues?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/37">The Department has told teachers that they must go and speak to the governors if they have a concern, but the governors have made it quite clear that they are not prepared to talk to the teachers.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/38" class="indent">&quot;Those staff who feel compelled to voice their opinions have been and continue to be threatened by disciplinary action; is it acceptable that this situation exists and how does this best serve the interests of democracy?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/39">We all came into politics for different reasons. I came into politics because of an insatiable belief and interest in democracy, and I will stand up for the interests of every constituent of mine and their right to object to things that affect their daily or professional life in any way they like without threat of intimidation. I am extremely concerned that the trade unions representing those lecturers have not done more to make the management of the college realise that they cannot treat professional lecturers in that way. If we are to make co-location a success, those lecturers are the most vital ingredient.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/40">The lecturer concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/41" class="indent">&quot;Why, if the college is so committed to this project on the overwhelming grounds of the 'educational case', have the directors been unable to convince the college staff of the validity of their educational case?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/42">Those are the points that have been made, and I shall conclude with a few brief remarks. I feel strongly that we need investment for our two colleges in Shrewsbury, but I hope that the Minister will tell me a few facts about the future of the LSC. I have had run-ins on the issue with the LSC chief executive, who came to see me at the House to discuss my concerns. I know that the LSC will be reformed; perhaps the Minister can tell me something about that. I am greatly concerned that Government are giving such autonomy and power to quangos such as the LSC, which make decisions from very far away without knowing the problems of the geography of places such as Shrewsbury, the feelings of my community&mdash;the community is overwhelmingly opposed to the move&mdash;or the principals, lecturers, teachers, parents and staff, who are also overwhelmingly opposed to co-location. I need an assurance that the Minister will take a personal interest in all the professional problems that the teachers have experienced.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/43">My final plea is given everything that I have said, will he at least consider meeting teachers at the sixth-form college to hear their concerns at first hand, because they can put their case far better than me? I could also arrange for them to visit the House of Commons. Furthermore, will he take on board my concerns about the way in which the LSC has put my community in a straitjacket by saying, &quot;You can have &pound;30 million, if you co-locate your colleges in London road, or you have to go back to the drawing board.&quot;? That is not acceptable. My constituents and I want funding and investment for both colleges at their existing, separate sites.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.312.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills"  colnum="312"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0010.htm#08060495000549">
	<p pid="a.312.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1817" name="Daniel Kawczynski">the hon. Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski)</phrase> for raising this issue and for the close interest that he of course takes in the future of Shrewsbury sixth form college. As he indicated, he has raised the issue on a number of occasions, and has met my hon. Friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education. The hon. Gentleman has also held a number of meetings&mdash;14, I think&mdash;in his constituency and has written to the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills on a number of occasions. We have been willing and keen to continue to discuss what are very local issues in his part of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/2">We both ultimately have the same aim: to secure the best possible educational provision for the young people of Shrewsbury and the surrounding area. Shrewsbury sixth form college is a good college, according to the latest Ofsted report published in May. However, it recommends that the college should</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/3" class="indent">&quot;address unsatisfactory aspects of accommodation and social space&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/4">which was also recommended in its previous Ofsted report, in 2004, prompting the college to look at options for redevelopment. The Government are undertaking a massive capital investment programme to ensure that colleges such as the one in Shrewsbury have world-class buildings and facilities. Hundreds of thousands of learners in communities throughout England have benefited from colleges taking up the opportunity given by our investment. The planned capital investment in the Shrewsbury colleges will total approximately &pound;65 million, to provide fantastic resources for the young people in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/5">In 1997, there was no dedicated capital budget for further education colleges. Over the past 10 years, the Government have invested more than &pound;2 billion ensuring that learners have access to the state of the art buildings and facilities that are essential if we are to meet the skills needs of local communities and young people. As set out in our capital strategy document, &quot;Building Colleges for the Future&quot;, a further &pound;2.3 billion will be invested in the estate over the next three years. That investment will benefit generations of learners to come, meet the skills needs of employers and act as a catalyst for community regeneration.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/6">Capital investment plays a crucial role in the Government's implementation of their priorities for young people and adults, as set out in the 14 to 19 reform programme and our response to the Leitch review of skills in England. Capital grants for sixth form colleges are managed by the Learning and Skills Council. Following machinery of Government changes, we announced our intention to bring sixth form colleges within the scope of the &quot;Building Schools for the Future&quot; strategy document, from 2010-11, so that they can be part of the area-wide entitlement to 14 to 19 provision. We will ensure that our capital investment coheres to support sixth form colleges in the new system.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/7">Modernisation of the college estate is not just about bricks and mortar. It is about creating the best possible learning environments accessible to all learners, and ensuring that young people are excited by learning so that they stay on in education and training. It is about delivering greater specialisation, so that businesses have access to a wider range of industry-specific skills development opportunities for their current and future employees, and about creating community-owned facilities that meet local needs and that can provide an important kick-start for local regeneration. Ensuring that such facilities are accessible to those who most need them is obviously critical, and it is absolutely necessary if we are to maximise the public benefit of the investment that we are making.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/8">Our investment will result in cutting-edge facilities and ensure that our work force have the skills that they need to succeed in a rapidly changing world. The Learning and Skills Council will expect all contractors that access public funding to have in place a formal training plan that maximises access to apprenticeships and work-based learning and training opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.0/9">Although we are making significant progress towards modernising our further education estate, we must not do so at the expense of the environment. We will require all new projects to meet the highest building standards for sustainable design and we have a taskforce in place to advise on how to ensure that by 2016 all new buildings will be zero carbon&mdash;two years ahead of the Government target for public sector buildings that was announced in the Budget.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-06-04a.314.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1882" speakername="David Lammy" colnum="314"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080604/halltext/80604h0010.htm#08060495000551">
	<p pid="a.314.1/1">I was about to come to that point. The Government's capital investment programme is providing Shrewsbury sixth form college with the opportunity to redevelop its estate to ensure that learners have the best possible facilities in which to learn.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/2">The educational and business cases for co-location are strong. Sharing facilities at the new site will allow learners to access world-class facilities and a broader curriculum offer than they could by staying on the current site. The plans have the support of the local strategic 14 to 19 partnership for education and training, the local education authority and the local learning and skills council. The building design has been developed so that colleges retain their separate identities. They will share the building but have separate governance and management. Separate teaching and learning areas will exist for each college. The premises costs will decrease substantially owing to the modern, efficient design of the new campus.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about local decision making and the accountability of governors. I should make it clear that the redevelopment of the college is ultimately a matter for local decision and for the governing body of the college as an independent institution. Such autonomy is important if we are to have a strong further education sector that can shape its own future in response to the needs of learners and employers. It would be wrong and inappropriate for a Minister to intervene directly&mdash;I am actually prohibited from doing so by legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/4">To respond specifically to the hon. Gentleman's points about the governing body, we must remember that the decisions of a governing body are corporate decisions. From the correspondence between the hon. Gentleman and the Department, it is clear that the parent governor who resigned because of his opposition to the proposals was aware of the corporate nature of the decision-making process. Having decided to oppose publicly the decision to relocate the college, which he was entitled to do, it is understandable that the corporation felt that his position as a parent governor was untenable. The governor could not be forced to resign outside the corporation's procedures, but I understand that he was asked to resign and did so.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/5">Governing bodies do important work. The governance of Shrewsbury sixth form college is regarded by Ofsted as a key strength. Independent inspectors found that the college had a strong governing body. My Department has an ongoing programme of work with the sector and the Association of Colleges to ensure that governance arrangements for all further education colleges are strong and that governing bodies are accountable to the communities they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/6">On the process for capital applications, it is crucial that any investment plans by colleges underpin their core mission of providing high-quality learning opportunities while responding to the diversity of their local communities. That means that a college must engage with all sections of the community when starting to plan any redevelopment project, to take into account the needs of the population it serves.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/7">In order to be considered for public funding support, colleges are required by the Learning and Skills Council to demonstrate that their proposals will serve the educational needs of people in their local area. It is certainly not a policy of the Government or the LSC actively to encourage co-location. Indeed, the Government's plans for transforming education for 14 to 19-year-olds include a rich choice of learning opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/8">The LSC expects a college to put forward the strongest educational case for a capital project based on a comprehensive options appraisal and a feasibility study. It would not make sense for the LSC to make a decision for the governing body about which of its options is the most appropriate. Once the college has submitted its capital proposal to the LSC, it has to go through a robust, multi-stage process in which the educational and business cases are scrutinised. Listening to the views of those who will be affected by the proposals is an important part of that process and is required before planning permission can be granted. We are in that stage now.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/9">Looking in more detail at the situation for Shrewsbury sixth form college, in 2004, the LSC commissioned a review of infrastructure in the area, which concluded that a significant amount of Shrewsbury sixth form college's accommodation was no longer fit for purpose and that the estates do not lend themselves to the kind of flexibility needed for the modern curriculum encapsulated in the Government's 14 to 19 reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/10">I understand that the site has many listed buildings. Much of the Shrewsbury sixth form college estate is subject to planning restrictions, and large areas of both Shrewsbury sixth form college and Shrewsbury college of arts and technology cannot be made compliant with the Disability Discrimination Acts. Shrewsbury sixth form college and Shrewsbury college of arts and technology commissioned separate property strategies in 2004 to inform them how best to address the issues. The property strategies examined a number of alternatives, including redevelopment of the existing college sites, relocation to alternative sites and co-location of both colleges on a single site.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/11">After carefully weighing up the pros and cons of each option, the college governing body decided on co-location, because it presents the best opportunities for the college's future development. Towards the end of 2006, the development of the project was put on hold due to objections to relocation of the sixth form college from the town centre raised by the hon. Gentleman and a number of the sixth form college staff. A review of the project was then undertaken, in which all known or current town centre sites for co-location were re-examined and reconsidered in some detail. In view of the aspirations of the educational case and the existing estate issues, continuing on the present site and other alternatives were ruled out. Addressing the objections raised regarding the potential loss of the sixth form college's distinctiveness and the impact on the town centre and transport has been built into the project execution plan, which is now being implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/12">I understand why the hon. Gentleman does not want to lose the college in his town centre, but after a lot of weighing up of the options, it has been decided to co-locate. In essence, the colleges will remain separate, but it is in the interests of young people in the area that co-location should go forward. That is the determination of the LSC and the governing bodies of the two organisations. The hon. Gentleman dissents from that, and he is entitled to do so, but it would be wrong for the Government to step in, to take sides and disrupt a local process, despite the understandable anxiety caused by changes in local circumstances.</p>
