<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.349.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="349"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h01.htm#60124h01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.349.3/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate issues relating to rail travel in the south-east. I am a regular user of the services myself and I am a great fan of rail travel. I want to put that on the record because, inevitably, we tend to focus on negative points during these debates. I had thought that more hon. Members would be here today because problems exist throughout the country. The fact that there are not perhaps means that there is more satisfaction with rail services than the press lead us to believe.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/2">I asked for this debate after local issues came to my notice as a result of the retendering of the south-western train franchise. The key issue in the Romsey constituency and in the neighbouring constituency of Eastleigh is the proposed curtailment of the Chandler's Ford service. Unfortunately, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1565" name="Christopher Huhne">my hon. Friend the Member for Eastleigh (Chris Huhne)</phrase> cannot be with us today owing to a prior commitment, but he would very much liked to have been here.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/3">Other hon. Members have concerns about their services, but I shall leave it to them to raise the details of their localities. I would also like to talk about a few general issues such as the barriers to increased train usage: fares, problems with car parking, capacity and inadequate integration with existing transport networks. The latter includes lack of provision for cyclists and the difficulties that exist in integrating that.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/4">I shall begin with the retendering of the south-western train franchise. Before I come to the local difficulty, I should point out that one positive aspect of that service is the extension of many of the Waterloo to Southampton Central trains so that they travel onwards to Bournemouth and Poole. That will be welcomed by the increasing number of commuters who live beyond Southampton and who have a relatively reduced train service at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/5">However, as always in these debates, we concentrate on the problems, and the big problem is the plan to truncate the Romsey to Totton passenger rail service, replacing it with a Romsey to Eastleigh shuttle. That plan has certain knock-on effects. To provide some background, I should explain that this rail route is very new. It opened in May 2003 and the justification for opening it at the time was that the area surrounding Chandler's Ford station has the fourth highest population catchment per station in Hampshire. It was a high-profile opening&mdash;our local celebrity Charlie Dimmock came along&mdash;and everyone was positive about it; many local councillors of all parties had fought for it for some time. The project was so successful that it was shortlisted for a National Transport Award in 2004. All looked well, particularly because passenger usage exceeded the target set. It seems somewhat perverse to me that we are planning to get rid of something that is exceeding its targets&mdash;the world works in strange ways sometimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/6">At the moment, 1,500 people a week use the service from Chandler's Ford. Many go to Southampton and beyond, and some travel in the other direction to Romsey. When the system changes, many people using the existing line will have to change trains at least once to make the same journey, which will be a barrier. A public meeting on the matter was held just after Christmas. I did not think many people would attend because there had only been a few days in which to publicise it, and trains do not usually attract quite so much attention as health, but the meeting was packed. It is worth raising with the Minister a number of points made in the meeting.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/7">The train network could lose passengers. It was pointed out that three quarters of the passengers who use the service travel beyond Eastleigh or Romsey, which are the end points of the service mentioned in the franchise document, and simply would not use the train if they had to change at Eastleigh, or could not go directly to Southampton Airport Parkway to catch the fast train to London.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/8">The franchise document suggested that the termination of the service would reduce some of the congestion that currently exists in the rail network around Southampton. However, the changes imply that the Romsey to Eastleigh shuttle would occupy Eastleigh or Romsey platforms for up to 25 minutes per hour and it would double the number of times that the main line would have to be crossed at Eastleigh. That could have a greater impact on mainline passengers and cause more delays to mainline passengers and freight trains at both stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/9">The change would not reduce the number of trains terminating at Southampton, because the Chandler's Ford train currently terminates at Totton. Indeed, it would probably add to the existing problems. The other proposals of the Department for Transport for trains currently terminating at Southampton to continue to Bournemouth would reduce congestion at Southampton far more than the removal of the Chandler's Ford service. One suggestion in the document will address the congestion problem, but those who understand rail movement far more than I do tell me that the change will not positively affect it in any way. It will have a negative effect. It was also pointed out that the First Great Western franchise has included services with far lower passenger numbers than that service. There is, therefore, a precedent for supporting worthwhile services in the refranchising process. Others pointed out that cost savings&mdash;if it were a matter of cost&mdash;could be achieved by leasing types of train that are more suited to local operation, rather than the high-speed, air-conditioned trains used at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/10">There has been support from all political quarters for the retention of the rail line. The leader of Hampshire county council, Ken Thornber, wrote a letter to the south-western franchise replacement consultation manager about the matter. It is worth pointing out that Hampshire county council invested a significant amount of money in the station and the opening of the line. Ken Thornber's letter states:</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/11" class="indent">&quot;We know from surveys that prior to the station opening, 41 per cent. of Chandler's Ford's customers previously travelled by car and 35 per cent. by bus. It would be a disastrous blow to public transport in South Hampshire if the service at Chandler's Ford became so unattractive that newly won customers were to abandon the railway and add to the congestion on our local roads.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/12">If the Minister has ever visited the area, he will understand the problems of congestion on our roads. The letter continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/13" class="indent">&quot;Moreover it would send entirely the wrong signals about the relevance of public transport generally in modern society.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/14" class="indent">Hampshire County Council, as owners of the station&mdash;which received funding through local development and from council funds of more than &pound;3 million&mdash;has a vested interest in the continuing success of this station. The downgrading of the service which is proposed in the Consultation Document is frankly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/15" class="indent">The County Council believes that providing good viable alternatives and taking cars off the road wherever possible is a good thing&mdash;for commuters, for residents and for the environment and this was the motivation behind our substantial investment in constructing Chandler's Ford station.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/16" class="indent">If the changes proposed for the Romsey-Totton service do go ahead despite our protests, and those of neighbouring local authorities concerned, the County Council's role in supporting rail initiatives will be difficult to sanction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/17">The Minister should know there were representatives from Eastleigh borough council, Test Valley borough council and Southampton city council at the meeting, all of which are under different flavours of political control, and all of which are concerned about the future of the route.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/18">Ken Thornber goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/19" class="indent">&quot;Its future relationship and stakeholder role with the rail industry is considered valuable and I would not wish to jeopardise this in the longer term. As it is, we feel profoundly let down over Chandler's Ford, given the commitment we have shown over the project, both in constructing the station and since it opened.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/20">That is not the view of just Hampshire county council. The Hampshire Economic Partnership stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/21" class="indent">&quot;Rail passenger journey times will be extended with a decrease in reliability due to the need to change trains in Eastleigh&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/22">which obviously has an impact on how people choose to get to work. It also points out that businesses have relocated to Chandler's Ford because of the new rail service, which serves a large employment area in the vicinity of the new station. Existing employees can travel to Chandler's Ford more easily and there are some quite significant business parks close to the station as well. The Hampshire Economic Partnership concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/23" class="indent">&quot;Removing the through service will lead to business closures as employees move away due to poor access to transport&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/24">Its assessment has shown that the rail service at Chandler's Ford</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/25" class="indent">&quot;has removed 3,000 car movements per week from local roads&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/26">It makes the points about congestion, as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.3/27">There are further concerns. A recent debate in Westminster Hall highlighted some of the issues relating to the south-east plan and PUSH&mdash;the Partnership for Urban South Hampshire. The point made strongly in that debate was that unless the infrastructure was put in place&mdash;particularly road and rail infrastructures, and some of the support services&mdash;it was difficult to see how the proposed new housing build could be sustainable.</p>

	<p pid="a.352.2/1">The hon. Lady is talking about the integration of rail and other services. I frequently travel on the Midland Mainline. It is an excellent service; it was the first to recover after the Hatfield rail disaster. It serves substantial parts of the north-east and Luton. Will she pay tribute to the frequency and reliability of that service, particularly as it integrates very well with Luton airport, which is a major airport serving the south-east, the midlands and wider parts of England?</p>

	<p pid="a.352.4/1">I thought that while the hon. Lady was taking interventions it would be wise for me to speak about the south-east. Canvey Island is in the south-east. She is addressing the important question of capacity and fixed infrastructure, rather than rolling stock, but there is an area where the two coincide. While I have the Minister's attention, I would like to ask whether the hon. Lady is aware whether the Government intend to invest in the extending of platforms so that trains can run with more carriages and capacity can thus be increased, and also whether she is aware that Canvey Island is one of the largest communities&mdash;44,000 people live on it&mdash;without a rail service. It would be easy to stick a terminal line from the c2c line on to Canvey Island with a terminus station there, which would help to serve&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.352.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="352"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h01.htm#60124h01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.352.6/1">I am afraid that I have no intimate knowledge of Canvey Island, but I hope that the Minister will address the points that have been made. On the route that I use most frequently&mdash;Waterloo to Southampton Airport Parkway&mdash;the train sometimes stops at a station with short platforms and announcements have to be made, so clearly there are many areas where improvements could be made to the existing infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.6/2">I return to PUSH, in the context of which others have raised significant concerns. We must look at where housing growth is planned and ensure that the rail and road infrastructures match that growth. It seems perverse to reduce a service in an area of particularly dense housing. An expansion of Southampton International airport is also proposed, which will require enhanced rail access, not a reduction in services.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.6/3">All those points are supported on a cross-party basis. I want the Minister to look into the proposal very carefully. I do not pretend to be a complete expert on train movements. I freely admit that I leave that to others. However, will the Minister commit to meeting me and some of the people who know the local rail service like the back of their hands to discuss fully the current flaws in what is planned in the franchise document? It is not just a case of people losing a service that they need to access employment and that they have chosen to use to reduce the impact on the environment; there are wider implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.352.6/4">I want to talk briefly about some of the barriers to train usage, one of which must be cost. Although some routes are regulated, I noticed that there was a large hike at the beginning of the year in the price of fares from local stations into London. Some commuters have told me that that has made them rethink how they can afford to travel to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.354.1/1">I had not realised that the figure was quite as bad as my hon. Friend suggests, but I am sure that his research is accurate. I speak only about the services from the neck of my woods, but if my experience is replicated, his research would represent an accurate picture. Secure cycle storage provision would go some way to addressing the problem: it would increase the number of people who cycle only at one end of their journey, because they are content to leave their bike at the station.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/2">The other big bugbear for some of my constituents is the lack of disabled access. The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 has come into force, and it seems strange that more effort has not been made to ensure that our stations are fully compliant with its terms. It would be helpful if the Minister in his summing up outlined whether there is a date by which all stations must be compliant and whether there are any mechanisms to help achieve that. Some of my constituents undertake complex journeys that would be relatively simple if they did not use a wheelchair.</p>

	<p pid="a.355.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. As somebody who uses the rail service late at night, I generally feel relatively secure. However, there are instances on a train when one can feel vulnerable, although that is probably no different from anywhere else. If I know that I am coming back late at night, I choose carefully the station to which I return, ensuring that it is well lit and that I do not have to return to a darkened area to get into may car. Although some of my local stations have been upgraded, I am less keen to use others, precisely because of the problem that the hon. Gentleman raises. If the Minister could mention any planned improvements in that regard, it would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.1/2">I received a briefing from the City of London corporation. It is worth pointing out some of its concerns, because they echo points that I have made. The economic viability of the City of London and its ability to attract the work force that it needs is an important consideration. The corporation says:</p>
	<p pid="a.355.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The retendering of the South Western Trains franchise poses important opportunities for both the City and areas such as Hampshire and Surrey to press for the improvements required. The significant number of commuters travelling from Hampshire and Surrey to the City by rail is indicated by figures showing that 16,000 people make their way from Waterloo (being Hampshire and Surrey's terminus) to the City on the Waterloo &amp; City line in the morning peak. The City Corporation has made representations in support of the need to address overcrowding by running additional trains and increasing the number of carriages. With Waterloo forecast to exceed its passenger capacity by 2012, the opportunity to expand platform capacity presented by the vacation of Waterloo International by Eurostar must not be missed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.355.1/4">It would be helpful if the Minister could touch on that final point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.356.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="356"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h01.htm#60124h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.356.1/1">Again, I am not familiar with the route that the hon. Gentleman mentions, but the proposals in the franchise document backtrack on the original proposals. Other routes are affected, too. One problem with the train companies is that they sometimes think that the solution is to run fewer trains so that they are not held up so frequently. There is a capacity problem on the rail network, which greater brains than mine do not seem capable of sorting out. The City of London corporation rightly points out that we must sort out some of those capacity problems in general. Their resolution would have a knock-on effect on those services to the hon. Gentleman's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/2">The corporation makes a further point:</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Rail services should be of high quality. Improvements in rolling-stock and a move to designing trains for different types of route should be welcomed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/4">It talks about accurate, real-time information, which would be useful to passengers, and it also makes a point about improving station environments:</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Improvements need to be made to the system for booking assisted travel to make it simpler and more reliable so that passengers requiring assistance can travel with confidence.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/6">From speaking to some of my constituents who need assistance, I know that when the service works well, it is very good and they have nothing but praise for it. However, the service is patchy, depending on which members of staff people come across on the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/7">City businesses consistently rank transport problems, including delays and overcrowding, among their major concerns. A detailed study calculated that transport delays cost City businesses &pound;230 million a year and their employees &pound;100 million in lost leisure time. Reliability of train services must be improved to tackle that.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.1/8">I started by speaking about a small local difficulty, but clearly there are problems on the network that have a much more widespread impact&mdash;a national impact, in fact&mdash;and I would appreciate it if the Minister dealt with some of those points when summing up the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.357.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, but I do not think I am being unfair. We all understand that, after the Hatfield experience, the railways were not operating as they should have been, but a large part of my travelling experience is pre-Hatfield, when the service was pretty dreadful. Thousands of people who are now my constituents were extremely frustrated at the rail service provided to the town.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/2">I shall raise two issues. One is occasional overcrowding on Midland Mainline services and the other the threat to the rail service from the ODPM's growth agenda. There are far too many instances of overcrowding on train services to and from Kettering, particularly on the service that runs between Kettering and London St. Pancras. Normally, that journey should take about an hour, and it is fair to say that punctuality is pretty good. However, most people would regard it as reasonable that, if they buy a train ticket for a journey of such length, they should be entitled to a seat. Sadly, that is all too often not the case, which is unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/3">As I mentioned earlier, Mr. Lynn Wilson wrote to me, detailing his tragic travelling experience on <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 20 December</phrase>, when he purchased a first-class rail ticket for the journey from Kettering to London St. Pancras and had to stand all the way&mdash;for an hour. The next station down the line is Wellingborough. Mr. Wilson says:</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The train was very full when I got on, with around a dozen people, men and women of all ages, standing due to lack of seating capacity, including myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/5" class="indent">After the Wellingborough stop the situation was three times worse with people standing the carriage length and by the toilets and exit doors. Just how that conforms with Health &amp; Safety regulations I have no idea, but moving up and down the carriage was practically impossible.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.359.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="359"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h01.htm#60124h01_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.359.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> on securing this debate. She and I share an interest in the subject, because what we are largely talking about today is the post-South West Trains franchise that will run from February 2007. In truth, there are no real frontiers when it comes to the franchise in the areas that she and I serve. They are very much interconnected and will suffer, I fear, unless the Minister is prepared to allow some smaller services to continue post-February 2007. He knows that I have corresponded with his office on the matter, and I hope he will meet me and some of my concerned constituents, who are worried about the post-February 2007 franchise.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.0/2">My particular interest lies with the London Waterloo to Bristol service, which stops at stations in Surrey, Hampshire and Wiltshire before finding its way to Bristol. It is a good example of a direct service that has been well served by the public in the past, and if it were to be enhanced, it would go some small way towards discharging the aspirations laid out in the 10-year transport plan, about which we hear so little these days&mdash;I wonder why.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.0/3">The hon. Lady mentioned the Chandler's Ford to Southampton service, which is in many ways similar to the one about which I am concerned. The closure of those services will reduce the number of people who opt to travel by train rather than take their cars. We talk about multi-modal transport and car parks are very important, but overall, we must reduce the number of people travelling on roads. Trains seem to be the way to do that, but we must make it attractive for people to travel by train.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.0/4">We cannot just say to people, &quot;Here's a train, but you will have to change several times to get to your destination.&quot; They simply will not buy that. We must make trains attractive to people. I fear that, with the refranchising exercise under way, there will not be that ability for train operating companies to make their service attractive to customers. That is a pity, and it will certainly defenestrate, if that were necessary, the 10-year transport plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.0/5">I am particularly upset because of the June 2003 network utilisation strategy. It seemed to be quite promising in the context of the forthcoming refranchising exercise, which is now just around the corner. It certainly looked fairly good for my constituents, and my subsequent meetings with the Minister and his predecessors suggested that the service was going to be enhanced. That was the promise, and we were looking forward to it. Then, all of a sudden, there appeared to be a complete volte-face. We now find that the service is not in the post-February 2007 requirements, and it looks like it may be stopped once again.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.0/6">The Minister's predecessor, wisely in my view, brought the service back. However, I found it interesting that the passenger usage survey was done shortly after the service restarted. Those are the figures on which the Department for Transport is now relying to make its assessment. That is a pity: methodologically, this is problematic because there is a stop-start service and people will get out of the habit of using it, and figures will be artificially deflated.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.0/7">I hope that the Minister will look critically at those figures before making a final determination on whether that service should continue. I certainly recommend to him, en passant, the figures produced by the West Wiltshire rail users group, which are different from those compiled by the Department. My spies tell me that it is considering conducting more passenger user surveys on that route. If it is, I welcome that. If the surveys are done properly, they will paint a picture different from the one that I think the Minister has for that service.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.0/8">That is all I want to say. I hope the Minister agrees to meet me and my constituents to discuss the London Waterloo to Bristol service, which stops at intermediate stations in four counties and is of great importance to much of the public in the south-east and south-west.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.361.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="361"  time="010:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h01.htm#60124h01_spnew30">
	<p pid="a.361.1/1">I shall do that and keep my remarks to less than 10 minutes so that the Minister has at least 20 minutes, if not more, to respond in detail to all the points that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/2">It is proposed that the south-western franchise will last 10 years. Does the Minister believe that that is sufficient time to allow the investment that will be required to deal with some overcrowding issues? He and the Secretary of State have talked at length about double-decker trains, for example. Will a 10-year franchise allow for that investment? I suspect not.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/3">Furthermore, I hope that the Minister says a little about how he sees the balance between fare increases to pay for services and a reducing subsidy. He will no doubt be aware of an article on saver fares that appeared in <i>The Times </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January</phrase>. As hon. Members know, such fares are available on all longer distance routes, but can be used only outside peak hours. There is a price cap on them, but the article said:</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Train companies have persuaded ministers that they will require less subsidy and attract more passengers if they are given more control over fares.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/5">Are the saver fares safe in the Government's hands or, as the report suggests, are they about to be jettisoned to allow the train operating companies to increase fares significantly?</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/6">For people who want to turn up and go, there some extremely expensive fares for travelling from A to B&mdash;about &pound;200 for return journeys if the tickets are purchased on the day. Does the Minister agree that the price increases are about managing demand on overcrowded trains? That is the view of Christian Wolmar, a well-respected expert in transport matters. As he believes, and this would be fairly easy to quantify, one effect of the high fares is to switch people on to the roads, thereby increasing road congestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/7">I want the Minister to respond on a further point, which is significant and pertinent to rail services in the south-east: have the Government considered how they undertake cost-benefit analysis of rail projects and the value of those projects to the economy? In other countries, in Europe in particular, greater weight is given to other factors such as the ability of rail projects to relieve congestion and to regenerate rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/8">What does the Minister expect the south-western franchise to deliver in respect of overcrowding? What will the Government be seeking? During morning and evening rush hours, the number of people travelling on main commuter lines in and out of London&mdash;many of whom are from the south-east&mdash;in excess of the recommended train capacity has increased by no less than 53 per cent. since 1996. Overall, according to the latest figures, 2.9 per cent. of people travelling on the main commuter lines in and out of London were in excess of capacity, which is the Government's official definition of overcrowding.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/9">As I have said, those in excess of capacity figures do not take into account the people left stranded on the platform. At peak hours in the morning as I travel in from Wallington&mdash;sometimes I get a seat, sometimes I do not&mdash;the further down the line we go, the more passengers are left stranded on the platform unable to get on the train. Incidentally, the figure for South West Trains passengers who are travelling in excess of capacity in the morning peak is 6.8 per cent.&mdash;one of the highest overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/10">The Minister and the Secretary of State have referred to double-decker trains as a possible way to sort out overcrowding problems. It has been reported that Network Rail has been told by the Government that all future engineering projects must take double-decker trains into account. Can the Minister confirm whether that is so? Moreover, apparently there have been informal talks between the Department for Transport, Network Rail and the train operating companies about where the double-decker rolling stock could be used. What preliminary thoughts do he and the Government have on where that stock could be used?</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/11">The bids that will be made for the south-western franchise are being developed at the same time as the route utilisation strategy issued by Network Rail that covers services from Waterloo station. Will the Minister explain how those two processes interlink, as it is not immediately clear how that happens? On the one hand, Network Rail has issued a shopping list of what it wants to do; on the other, we have the bidding process for the south-western franchise. I want reassurance that those two processes meet in the middle.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/12">Crossrail is an important transport project that will have a significant impact on rail services in the south-east, London and beyond. We cannot debate rail in the south-east without giving the Minister yet another opportunity, which has been declined on many occasions, to say where the funding for Crossrail will come from. A couple of weeks ago, we debated the instructions to the Select Committee when the matter was raised, but he did not use that opportunity to reply to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.1/13">The project has been kicked into the long grass. The answer is hiding behind Sir Michael Lyons's review, although perhaps the Minister can put on the record the fact that, apparently, Sir Michael Lyons has not been asked specifically to consider Crossrail as part of the review. How are the two matters linked if Sir Michael Lyons has not been asked to look at Crossrail? It is a pity&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.364.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1927" speakername="Stephen Hammond" colnum="364"  time="010:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h01.htm#60124h01_spnew33">
	<p pid="a.364.0/1">This has been an interesting and important debate. I am aware of your stricture that we should give the Minister 20 minutes in which to respond, Mr. Olner, and I shall try to allow him that much time.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/2">In this debate, we have already covered the wide definition of the south-east, as well as a number of problems that rail travellers in the south-east face, including overcrowding, disability access, fares, security and&mdash;perhaps most importantly&mdash;capacity. However, we ought to give some context: the railways now carry 30 per cent. more passengers than they did 40 years ago, on a 40 per cent. smaller network. In recent years, billions of pounds have been spent on headline rail projects, such as the west coast main line upgrade and the channel tunnel rail link. Also, the Government promise to spend in excess of &pound;15 billion on Crossrail. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1487" name="Tom Brake">The hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> rehearsed some of the arguments on that subject, and we look forward to hearing assurances from the Minister. Also, I understand that the Government talk of spending more money on a London to Edinburgh high-speed link.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/3">Those projects are undoubtedly crucial, but they tend to overshadow their less glamorous relatives&mdash;the south-east network and, in particular, the workhorse commuter services. That section of the network delivers 120,000 people into the economic heart of this country every weekday morning. Also, local services around regional centres, such as those mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>, take people into centres such as Bristol, Southampton, Reading, Croydon and Brighton. Those commuters are increasingly packed on to overcrowded trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/4">The Minister will be aware that the Office of Rail Regulation has forecast a nationwide 28 per cent. increase in rail usage by 2014. That looks to be a particularly grim experience, given that it is suggested that the increase in capacity in that period will be in the order of 2 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/5">Many hon. Members touched on the misery of passengers having to pay fare increases that are well above inflation. That would all be very well if the extra money went into improvements but, as it is, punctuality is just about returning to pre-Hatfield levels. It is clear that on some routes&mdash;the Minister may wish to comment on this&mdash;punctuality is improving only because journey times, and timetables, have been lengthened significantly. That has been confirmed, to the Minister and to many of us, by London TravelWatch.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/6">One of our principal concerns&mdash;and the focus of this debate, which was secured by the hon. Member for Romsey&mdash;is rail services in the south-east and local services. The Department for Transport said in its consultation document for the new south-western train franchise that such services can be underused and that services nearer to London could make better use of capacity if local services were cut back. That is an interesting argument, but there is also an argument that if the Government persuaded Network Rail and franchisees to run a hub-and-spoke service, those local services, far from being cut back, should be increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/7">In the South West Trains franchise area, services under threat include the Reading to Brighton via Winchester service, the Bristol to Salisbury service, the London Waterloo to Plymouth and Paignton services, and, of course, the Chandler's Ford service, which the hon. Member for Romsey mentioned. I am particularly interested in that service, because I was born and raised in Chandler's Ford. I spent the first 11 years of my life there. Then, there was no station. Many of my relatives and friends still live in the hon. Lady's constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/8">Chandler's Ford makes an interesting case study, and it is worth rehearsing some of the hon. Lady's arguments for the Minister. The area has a valuable, local service that is used by 1,500 people a week; 10 or 15 years ago, that would have been impossible. Now, it is proposed that the service be cut. Up to three quarters of those people travel beyond Eastleigh and Romsey, and they would not use the service if they had to change at Eastleigh for Southampton, or if they could not go on to Southampton Parkway to catch onward trains there.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/9">One argument for cutting the service is that it will help to ease congestion in Southampton, but the Chandler's Ford trains terminate at Totton. The problems at Southampton would be much better dealt with if we did not remove the Chandler's Ford service and if trains were allowed to continue on to Bournemouth. Indeed, that is one of the proposals in the Department's document, and I urge the Minister to consider whether that might not be a better way forward than cutting the local service that the hon. Member for Romsey spoke about so eloquently. I look forward to the Minister's response on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/10">If the Government do not support the South Hampshire light rapid transit system, taking the Chandler's Ford to Southampton service off the network will be a double blow. Surely the overall consequences&mdash;this is why this case study is so interesting&mdash;would be, as elsewhere, increased local car usage, as people would travel to a mainline station or just abandon the rail service. Also, there would be implications for the environment. I look forward to the Minister's response on that case study.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/11">On some of the general points that have been made, the workhorse commuter services, as I described them, get a particularly difficult deal on fares. I asked a question about fares in the House last week. Regulated fares have gone up, on average, by 3.9 per cent.; that is despite the fact that the formula is retail prices index plus one. I note that in December the RPI was at only 2 per cent., so that is an interesting, moot calculation of the formula. Unregulated fares have risen by between 4 and 4.5 per cent., and many fares have risen by more than 8 per cent. One or two fares&mdash;this is particularly true of those under the more difficult structure&mdash;have trebled because of the abolition of saver tickets. Like the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington, I hope that the Minister will give some reassurance about saver tickets and the ability to get walk-on fares.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/12">I commend the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington on his recent report, which says that &pound;10 of commuter spend on railways buys an average of 38 miles of rail traffic. In France, that would get triple that distance. In Slovakia, one would get 350 miles, and in Italy 200 miles. It is interesting that those on the commuter network in the south-east are paying above-average fares for a service that is at best overcrowded and at times completely unacceptable. I shall come back to the issue of overcrowding later.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/13">As was illustrated earlier, the bidding war for franchises has meant that many train operating companies are accepting less subsidy. That would be fine for those paying ticket revenues to the Government if they got increased capacity or punctuality improvements. The Minister will be aware of one service not yet mentioned today: National Express, one of the franchises that took over services in the East Anglia region last year. It connects into the south-east. It is paying the &pound;500 million back to the Government over 10 years out of ticket revenues. Will the Minister comment on representations that he has received from hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2017" name="Alan Haselhurst">the right hon. Member for Saffron Walden (Sir Alan Haselhurst)</phrase>, about the problems that the Government are having with that new franchise? The franchisee is saying that there is no money for increased capacity and that there will be no new rolling stock and no extra track capacity. That is particularly important in relation to commuter services in the eastern part of the south-east network, which include services into Cambridge and&mdash;perhaps more importantly for the development of the south-east&mdash;the fast train to Stansted.</p>

	<p pid="a.366.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that point. He will have noted that I have only been in my position in the party for a month. However, I have already had representations from a number of franchise holders about that matter and the benefits that it would secure in rail traffic, particularly in terms of capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/2">Overcrowding, which has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members this morning, is a real feature and has risen dramatically. The number of people travelling on main commuter lines in and out of London, in excess of the recommended capacity, has risen more than 50 per cent. in the past eight years. The Association of Train Operating Companies has warned that the network will not be able to absorb the increase in passenger traffic. The 2 per cent. increase in capacity that is being suggested over a period to 2014 will not cater for the real issues of overcrowding. That has been recognised in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase> asked about that last week in the House and the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Additional capacity needs to be provided.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-17">17 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 691.]</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/4">I wonder whether the Minister will give us some assurances when we get to the nub of the problem for rail services in the south-east. For instance, we all know that, in terms of capacity, there has been an upgrade to the electrical circuitry. However, much of the new rolling stock that has replaced the old slam-door stock has to run at less than full capacity because the power is not available to run them at full speed. Will the Minister talk a little bit about what further electrical upgrades he would expect from Network Rail?</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/5">Hon. Members have already mentioned lengthening stations and the improvement to the throat at both Waterloo and Liverpool Street. We should be commissioning more rolling stock, rather than decreasing it. In the short time that I have been asked by the new leader of the Conservative party to consider rail services, it has been explained to me on more than one occasion that the Government have paid, in certain contracts, to decrease the size of trains rather than increase them. I should be interested to hear the Minister reassure us and say that we will see greater commissioning of rail stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/6">To finish, I shall mention three things that will be crucial to the south-east and to improving the network services: first, the increase of local hub timetabling in the system to allow greater local services; secondly, extending the East London line and upgrading Orbilink; and, thirdly, I think that everybody would be interested to hear some comments from the Minister about the delays to Thameslink and when we might see that work coming through.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.369.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1874" speakername="Stephen Ladyman" colnum="369"  time="010:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h01.htm#60124h01_spnew41">
	<p pid="a.369.1/1">My point is that, in accepting a franchise, a company knows the length of that franchise and its objectives on increased capacity, improved service and increased punctuality. The company makes its bid accordingly; it will have made its decision on how much investment can be levered into the system in the franchise period. The Government decide whether that will meet their objectives when they let the franchise. That is exactly what has happened in Kent.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/2">I bring to Members' attention the fact that, after some difficult years, Britain's railways, in the south-east and nationally, have improved considerably. I am not saying that they are yet all we want them to be&mdash;of course they are not. No Member of Parliament with a constituency anywhere in the south-east of England, particularly in Kent, would dare suggest that. However, services have improved significantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/3">During the last period for which information is available, a moving annual average of 85.7 per cent. of trains arrived on time. Performance levels are increasing all the time. Passenger numbers are growing significantly: 2005 saw the highest number of passenger journeys in 50 years. Last year, 1 billion journeys were made on the national railway network, an increase of 2.5 per cent. on the figure for 2004. Some &pound;87 million a week is being invested and major improvements are being delivered as a result of that major investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/4">The growth in demand for rail travel will continue to increase and there will be major problems, particularly in the south-east. However, that investment has given us 2,025 new vehicles that now operate on the network south of the Thames; they replace 1,700 slam-door coaches, at a cost of about &pound;2 billion. My own constituency in Kent has only just seen the back of slam-door trains, which were first introduced in 1950.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/5">In the final six months of last year, slam-door trains were replaced in constituency of the hon. Member for Romsey. She said that trains should be more appropriate for the lines on which they run rather than provide the fully air-conditioned services now used on some of her lines, but a fully air-conditioned modern railway coach is a damn sight better than those old slam-door trains with which many of our constituents were struggling not so long ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/6">Some 40 per cent. of our national rolling stock is now new and we are, of course, still investing to try to increase capacity. More seats are to be provided as part of the new Thameslink-Great Northern franchise. Some 10,000 additional seats a day will be provided as part of the timetable and eight-car trains will be used across the peak-hour period. The Greater Western franchise will deliver a redesign of the high-speed train fleet and a new timetable to increase capacity on trains between London and Reading in the morning and evening peak periods, by 20 per cent. and 30 per cent. respectively. That is a significant increase in capacity. The integrated Kent franchise that we have talked about also involves a considerable increase in capacity. Such things are happening not only in the south-east but across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/7">Despite those record levels of investment, we recognise that capacity in the south-east remains an issue and that it will continue to be a problem. That brings me to some of the specific matters raised by the hon. Member for Romsey. She talked about the south-western train refranchising. That franchise is the next to be let in the south-east of England and it will certainly impact on her constituency. The franchise will combine two existing franchises&mdash;South West Trains and Island Line&mdash;both of which are currently owned by Stagecoach. During the 2004&ndash;05 financial year, South West Trains accounted for 15 per cent. of total passenger rail journeys, 11 per cent. of national fare box revenue and 11 per cent. of the 4.6 billion passenger km travelled on the rail network.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/8">South West Trains operates 1,635 trains each week day with a fleet of 333 units, and the rolling stock has already seen considerable investment. The fleet of 91 inner suburban class 455 units is undergoing a major refurbishment programme, while a new fleet of 45 class 444 and 110 class 450 Desiro units have been successfully introduced during the past couple of years.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/9">By contrast, Island Line, which carries more than 1 million passengers a year on 1938 former London underground rolling stock, receives fare box revenue of just &pound;1 million. The new franchise is scheduled to start on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-04">4 February</phrase> next year, and five companies have pre-qualified to bid to run it.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/10">The South West Trains consultation document that set out the proposed specification was issued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-07">7 November 2005</phrase>. Department for Transport officials met with local authorities, passenger groups, regional bodies and industry stakeholders to discuss the proposals. The consultation period closed on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January</phrase> this year, and the Department is considering the responses prior to finalising the specification on which the bidders will be asked to price their bids.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/11">The new timetable introduced in December 2004 has already significantly improved performance; nine out of 10 of the trains now arrive on time, and significantly changing the timetable so soon was not deemed necessary. However, it was considered appropriate to review a number of services to the west of the franchise area. As hon. Members have mentioned, the review considered changes to the services on the Waterloo-Exeter route&mdash;specifically those going west of Exeter and to Bristol&mdash;the removal of the direct service between Reading and Brighton and a review of services in the Southampton area. I shall make sure that the comments made by Members about those services are passed to the team considering the consultation so that they will be taken into account as the way forward is determined.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/12">The hon. Lady mentioned the Romsey-Totton service in particular. In its south-west mainline route utilisation strategy, Network Rail has identified Southampton as an area that creates significant delay to train operations. That is related to a number of factors, including the use of the station by four different passenger operators, a significant volume of freight traffic and the constraint of a two-track tunnel at the eastern end of the station. The proposed specification attempts to address those problems by improving train movements through Southampton Central station. That package of measures will improve performance, offer better journey opportunities and provide more frequent and faster journeys to south Hampshire and Dorset.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/13">The proposals include the extension of the Waterloo-Southampton service to Bournemouth, the extension of the Waterloo-Poole service to Weymouth to provide a second train each hour, the acceleration of the existing service to Weymouth from Waterloo so that it is 10 minutes faster, and the provision of a regular and improved service between Brighton and Southampton.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/14">To facilitate improvements to the Southampton area, the proposed specification has reduced the Romsey-Totton service so that it operates as a shuttle between Romsey and Eastleigh. The hon. Lady will be aware that the service between Romsey and Totton was introduced in May 2003, with the opening of the new station at Chandler's Ford. The service is currently supported by money from a rail passenger partnership scheme established by the Strategic Rail Authority, but that expires in April 2006. Discussions about continuing to support the service until the end of the franchise are in progress. On the consultation on the limitation of that service in the future, I shall make sure that the hon. Lady's comments are referred to the team considering those proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.372.1/1">Sadly, today is an appropriate time to talk about the delivery of health services in north Manchester, given the information on the front page of <i>The Times</i> this morning about the unfortunate patients who were misdiagnosed by the radiology service in Trafford and north Manchester. I shall mention that briefly later.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/2">North Manchester has some of the worst health statistics in the country, the most startling of which is that a male child born today in north Manchester has a life expectancy of 72.3 years, whereas a similar child born in east Dorset has a life expectancy of 80.8 years. For every 10 years that that boy from north Manchester lives, a boy born in east Dorset can expect to live an extra year.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/3">Those statistics are from an extremely detailed and, in a sense, depressing publication called &quot;Where Wealth means Health&quot; by the Centre for Public Health at John Moores university. The report points out that there has been no real change over the past 10 years in the relative rates of good and bad health as they relate to class. Even though people at the bottom end have become healthier, they are still just as far behind people at the top end.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/4">My constituency is among the top 10 in terms of the number of people claiming incapacity benefit and the level of heart disease, and the number of people suffering from cancer is also among the highest in the country. Consequently, the mortality and morbidity rates are very high. By quoting health statistics from different documents, I could probably fill the whole hour and a half with that depressing story, but I put those statistics to hon. Members simply to show how important it is to deliver health services as effectively and efficiently as possible in a poor area where people suffer from poor health.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/5">Most of my area is covered by the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust, which consists of one headquarters and four hospitals&mdash;North Manchester general and the Bury, Oldham and Rochdale hospitals. It is the second largest trust in the country, employing more than 300 consultants and covering five primary care trust and five local authority areas. It is an unusual trust, and it was conceived and set up within the past four years in answer to a particular problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/6">Services were being reconfigured in the wake of improved resources and of the child care problems in Bristol and the report that followed. It was recognised that a concentration of specialists needed to work in one place to ensure that health care standards were right and that services would have to be reconfigured. When the Pennine trust was being set up, however, there was a worry that many of those specialist services would end up in the centre of Manchester. It was thought&mdash;incorrectly, as I shall argue later&mdash;that the configuration of the hospitals at Oldham, Bury, Rochdale and north Manchester would allow those services to be organised rationally. That, then, is the background in terms of the quality of health and the delivery units for health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/7">Like many hon. Members, I have had several meetings with patients, trade unions, doctors and administrators, and I was told that everything was not well in the Pennine trust. However, things really came to a head last summer, when an extraordinary alliance was formed. The consultants passed a vote of no confidence in the whole management team. Although that was initiated by the discussions on the new consultant contracts, the consultants' resolution went much wider. The trade unions passed a similar resolution, which was initiated by a disagreement about car parking charges. Again, however, that was the spark, and the discontent and complaints went much wider.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/8">The strategic health authority responded by asking Professor Alberti and Dr. Joan Durose to look into what was wrong in the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. They interviewed about 1,500 people and talked to trade unions, the consultants and the administrators. After two months, on <phrase class="date" code="">17 October</phrase>, they produced a report, which was given to the public on <phrase class="date" code="">1 November</phrase>. It was a rather sad, critical analysis of poor administration, bad communications and low morale, and 25 recommendations were made at the end.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/9">The human resources director and the medical director left, and that could have been it. The administrators&mdash;the management&mdash;said that they accepted all 25 recommendations, but several of my hon. Friends and I were again approached by medical staff and trade unions at the hospital, and we wanted to find out more. The report wanted the answers to three key questions, and so would any sensible person who looked at it. First, could the trust carry on with the personnel who remained after the human resources director and the medical director had left? Had there been sufficient changes? Had the right decisions been taken or was more needed? It became clear that the trade unions and many medical staff thought there should be greater changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/10">Secondly, the Pennine trust is, as I said, the second largest NHS trust in the country. Were greater structural changes needed? Was it too big to be managed? Clearly, it had not been managed, but was one reason for that the fact that it was simply too big? As I said, it covers five local authorities, five PCTs and four hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/11">Thirdly, there is the common-sense question&mdash;the first I was asked by journalists and the first thing that people living in north Manchester and patients want to know: are health services being delivered as effectively as they could be and are patients safe? When consultants say that they have no confidence in the management, we should all worry.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/12">I read several times Professor Alberti and Joan Durose's good, well-balanced report, which does not go further on those points. I also took the trouble, as did other hon. Members, to go and talk to Professor Alberti, the trade unions and administrators all over the system to see whether enough was done with those recommendations, and whether there has been progress in the three months since the report was written. The one person to whom I have not spoken in the past week, since I found out that I had been fortunate enough to come up in the draw and secure this debate, but to whom I would like to speak, is the chief executive of the Pennine trust. Since he was appointed, I have had regular meetings with him and have found him to be a reasonable man to deal with, but my phone calls have not been returned in the past four days, so I do not have the value of his views on what I am going to say. However, I talked to virtually everybody else in the system in that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/13">I return to the first point about personnel. Do we have the right balance now? Two senior members of the executive have left. Was that right? That is as far as the report goes. On page 6, Alberti and Durose say:</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/14" class="indent">&quot;We believe that the Chair and Medical Director have not demonstrated their role as leaders . . . We note that the medical director has now left the Trust.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/15">What conclusion would you, Mr. Olner, or any other reasonable person draw from those two sentences? I draw the conclusion that even though it is not written in black and white, Professor Alberti thought that the chairman should take the same decision as the medical director. I can think of no other way of interpreting that part of the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/16">When I talked to the trade unions and the medical staff&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent matters and say that this is the formal view of the trade unions, the joint medical committee or any other professional body&mdash;I formed the view that they do not believe that it is possible for the trust to improve with the current chairman and chief executive in post. The trade unions and a consultant said to me, in effect, that it is all right for the director of human resources to go, but he was the chief executive's representative on earth. He was head-hunted and appointed by the chief executive, and his actions were under the direct control of the chief executive. It is unlikely that the communications and management style will change.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/17">On the third point, a series of reviews is going on in the health service in north Manchester, as is the case elsewhere in the health service. Children's services are being reviewed, as are maternity and young people's services; major changes in configuration are being considered at the four hospitals; the primary care trust structure is being changed; and cancer services have been reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.1/18">Any hon. Member knows that conclusions on the reorganisation of health services are not reached by any process that could be described as an exact science. Usually, everyone is well motivated and people want the best for the service, but the process involves an element of horse trading and the attitude that, &quot;If Salford gets this, Tameside will have to get that.&quot; I am concerned that if a public report implies that the chairman and the chief executive of a large trust are not doing their jobs as well as they should, the people in the Pennine acute trust area whom I and other people represent will lose out in those discussions. I know that the Minister for Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1752" name="Phil Woolas">my hon. Friend the Member for Oldham, East and Saddleworth (Mr. Woolas)</phrase>, is concerned about the debate on whether a linear accelerator should be placed in Hope hospital in Salford or in Oldham. In such a debate, will the same confidence be placed in a management that has been so heavily and publicly criticised?</p>

	<p pid="a.380.0/1">I start by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate, which is of such significance to my constituents in Oldham as well as to people in north Manchester, Rochdale and Bury. He has given the context and a good overview of the health issues in his constituency. Sadly, those in my constituency are little better in many respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/2">It would be wrong to start without putting on record an acknowledgement of the improvements that the Government have brought about across the board in health services in the north-east and Greater Manchester, the area served by the Pennine acute trust. The extra investment put in year on year has had an impact on health prospects and outcomes for the 800,000 people served by the trust. However, the creation of the Pennine acute trust&mdash;the shotgun marriage of Bury, Rochdale, Oldham, and North Manchester about four years ago&mdash;was not a happy event. The hospitals across the sub-region did not, and still do not, sit comfortably together. The trust, which, as we have heard, is the largest in the country, just seemed too big, unwieldy, and challenging to manage and lead effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/3">It is often felt that little progress has been made during the past four years to reshape the trust into a more manageable configuration. However, at long last, just over a week ago, we saw the launch of the public consultation exercise, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1636" name="Jim Dobbin">my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin)</phrase> referred, on proposals for the reconfiguration of services, including hospital-based services in the north-east and Greater Manchester. The document is entitled &quot;Healthy Futures&quot;, but it is remarkably silent on the pretty unhealthy recent past. During the past couple of years, it became increasingly clear that things were not going well at the top of the Pennine acute trust. Relationships between managers, doctors and trade unions were far from healthy, as evidenced last summer by the virtually unanimous vote of no confidence in the trust's top management team, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/4">Against that worrying background, and like my hon. Friends, I welcomed the review carried out by Professor Alberti and Dr. Durose. The publication of their report in late October last year was keenly anticipated and, when it came out, the report was frank and hard-hitting. Alberti and Durose found deep-seated and long-established problems, many of which could be traced back to the time when the trust was established. Although they choose their words with care, the report is particularly critical of the top-level leadership at the trust. My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley has already quoted the passage that states:</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/5" class="indent">&quot;We believe that the Chair and Medical Director have not demonstrated their role as leaders.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/6">The report goes on to say that the chief executive's style of leadership</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/7" class="indent">&quot;has caused difficulties with some parts of the Trust. This style could usefully be modified.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/8">The report homes in on the role of the chair and non-executive directors, saying that they need to exercise</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/9" class="indent">&quot;greater influence on the executive team as a whole&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/10">Tellingly, the report continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Whether the Chair and all the non-executive directors feel able to do this is uncertain but given recent events we believe it will be very difficult.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/12">An important message to emerge from the Alberti-Durose report&mdash;I have to acknowledge that generally this matches my own perception&mdash;is that the quality of patient care at the trust's hospitals did not suffer too greatly during the difficult period when the trust's senior management came under such serious criticism from the staff. As my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley said, that is not to say that there have been no problems but, to the extent that it is true, it speaks well of the dedication, competence and public service ethos among the middle managers, consultants and medical staff, and backroom and front-line workers at the hospitals&mdash;the phrase &quot;lions led by donkeys&quot; comes to mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/13">The current position is that the medical director has gone, but the chair, non-executive directors and chief executive are still in post. I hope that they are working to carry through the action plan called for by Alberti and Durose to implement the 25 far-reaching recommendations in their report. Soon, the chair, non-executive directors and chief executive will face the immensely challenging job of carrying through the trust reconfiguration process, which will be determined in the light of the consultation outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/14">I hope that lessons will have been learned, changes in style effected, leadership issues addressed and communication links put in place, so that we can look forward optimistically. However, it could still be the case that the core problem has simply not been addressed. Even with a dramatic turnaround that sees the adoption of the best management practices and with inspirational leadership, the trust might be just too big, too cumbersome and too unbalanced ever to be capable of delivering the changes necessary to produce the quality of service that our constituents deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/15">Alberti and Durose conclude that</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/16" class="indent">&quot;it would be unhelpful at this time to reverse the size and core structure of the Trust.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/17">Their recommendations concentrate instead on strengthening site management and on devolution of operational decisions to divisions, with the chief executive and executive directors cast in the role of arbitrators. I hope that Alberti and Durose turn out to be right in declining to add to the complexities of the reconfiguration process. The public consultation, which is under way, is built on the same premise. The consultation document, the video presentations, the publicity bus that will tour the area&mdash;none of that envisages anything other than retaining the present hospital grouping. The option of cutting the size of the trust's geographical area to a more manageable scale is not on the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.0/18">The immediate future promises much-needed expansion in community-based care and treatment, with 35 new health centres throughout our area taking on significant areas of work that would previously have required someone to make a hospital visit as an out-patient or in-patient. All that implies a difficult period ahead for our hospitals as they have to adapt to the new environment and carry through the huge organisational changes that are necessary. Based on their track record, it is difficult to be optimistic about the ability of the present leadership to make a success of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.385.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his point, which was certainly made earlier. The hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley referred to the trust's size and complexity, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase>, speaking from the Conservative Front Bench, alluded to fact that the size of NHS trusts sometimes contributes to such problems. So those points have been well made.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/2">The NHS is in a time of great change and upheaval as a result of Government reforms. In a letter in <i>The Guardian</i> this morning, the Secretary of State for Health says that she intends</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/3" class="indent">&quot;to publish a manual to help managers&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/4">understand what is going on in the NHS. She outlines three main challenges. The first is</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/5" class="indent">&quot;to deliver improvements for patients&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/6" class="indent">the second is to</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/7" class="indent">&quot;implement the government's reform agenda&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/8">and the third is to &quot;achieve financial balance&quot;. I am sure that we can all agree with the first and third of those objectives, but the second is perhaps contributing to some of the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/9">Just before the Christmas recess, I read a letter from Chris Ham in <i>The Times</i>. As the Minister may know, he worked in the Department for Health, and I believe that he was the director of its strategy unit until June last year. He said that the Government were at risk of unleashing a wave of &quot;creative destruction&quot; on the NHS through their mania for reform and change. That pattern is, of course, reflected throughout the country, not only in Greater Manchester. Representatives from throughout the country will share concerns about the restructuring of primary care trusts, the reorganisation of services, the impact of deficits and&mdash;this has perhaps not been mentioned&mdash;the impact of central targets on local clinical needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/10">The Government often say that part of their solution to these problems is an enthusiasm for the market and the private sector, and that might be an appropriate response in some cases, but the impact of a private treatment centre in Greater Manchester&mdash;again, I do not think that this has been mentioned&mdash;has been to increase the deficit. The centre serves the 14 existing PCTs in Greater Manchester and has cost them &pound;2 million over six months due to lack of use. The centre's contract allowed for up to 7,000 patients to be treated in a full year, but it has seen just over 1,400 in its first six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/11">The NHS structure is going through constant change. The 14 PCTs in Greater Manchester will be reconfigured down to 10 so that they match local authority boundaries. I can tell hon. Members from a west country perspective that we wish that that were the case in our part of the world, where the PCTs have been made bigger so that they cross local authority boundaries, despite representations from all Members Parliament and all local unitary authorities in the former Avon area.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/12">Liberal Democrats believe that local control and accountability of health care is the answer. I repeat the phrase used by the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley: he referred to the size and complexity of local NHS trusts. When I first became a Member and went around meeting the various NHS organisations in the area, I could desperately have done with some sort of pictogram showing the structure of NHS services in the Greater Bristol area; it is amazingly complex. We need local, democratic control and accountability of our health care system. If there is to be major reform, that is the direction in which we need to go; that would be better than constantly reconstructing unaccountable trusts and management structures.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.1/13">If democratically accountable local people take an interest in, and set priorities and local targets for, health care, the life chances of people in deprived parts of Greater Manchester, and in other cities and counties, will be transformed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.390.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="390"  time="012:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h02.htm#60124h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.390.0/1">In the short time available, I shall try to cover the points that hon. Members have made in this Adjournment debate. I start, however, by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> on securing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/2">Some interesting points have been raised, but before I get into them, let me express my concern about the involvement of the two trusts in the anxiety caused to the women who were not properly diagnosed for breast cancer. The Greater Manchester strategic health authority has commissioned an independent review to discover how and why those errors occurred, and I am sure that we all want it to be rigorous, so that the problem does not, as far as possible, arise again.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/3">Several points have been made about health inequalities and reconfiguration. At the heart of the discussion is the issue of what our health service is for. As Minister with responsibility for public health, I suggest that the health service has tended to focus on responding to illness, which is quite understandable, given that people who are ill want treatment and want it to be to the best possible standard. For the past 50 years, the emphasis has more or less been on providing services in hospitals, which is also understandable, given the development of the national health service from where it was 50 years ago, with the needs and priorities that existed then, to where it is today.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/4">What is interesting about this discussion is that we have all experienced a change in how we think about the delivery of health services, whether as patients or members of the public with family members or friends in hospital, or as a result of taking advantage of health services in the community. In another Adjournment debate that I attended, it was suggested, for example, that 40 per cent. of orthopaedic referrals could be handled outside hospital, rather than inside.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/5">Those issues are important because they have an impact on what we think hospitals are for and on how effectively they can deliver, which brings me to the point about health inequalities. It is undoubtedly the case that more people in England are living longer. More people from all social and economic groups are benefiting from the technology used to treat heart disease and cancer, and are getting the right medication and treatment. Although the overall picture is good, however, the reality is that there is still a gap on mortality issues between those who are less well off and those who are better off. We have to look beneath the radar to address what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/6">As Minister with responsibility for public health, I suggest that one reason for that gap is that there needs to be a better focus on health inequalities within different areas. Regardless of whether a PCT is large or small, or whether the majority of people in a PCT area are relatively affluent and well educated, I would ask whether those who are less affluent and most in need are getting the health service they deserve to meet their needs. That issue must be addressed as part of the PCT reconfiguration.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/7">PCTs, whatever their size, must look at the health outcomes for their communities to ensure that they attend to those most in need. Alongside that is the issue of whether how we provide health services meets the needs of those who most need them. Perhaps they need a different service that will impact in a way that traditional services clearly have not. That is a hugely important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/8">On the financial situation, it is interesting that we are getting better value for money in terms of delivery in some of our poorer neighbourhoods, where the health inequalities are very clear. When we look at the trusts in deficit, we gain some interesting perspectives on those that are most in deficit. Such trusts are in a minority, but some are in more well-off areas with considerably fewer issues of health outcomes linked to deprivation, although I am not saying that they have no health inequalities issues. There are some important questions to be asked about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/9">My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley hit on a number of issues, and was absolutely right to refer to the Alberti and Durose report on the Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. We have had a reasonable discussion about the issues that have arisen. It is worrying that a clash between consultants and management led to a vote of no confidence by consultants, and it is worrying that the report had to be produced in the first place, but that's life&mdash;not everything works as well as we think it should.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/10">There were 25 recommendations in the report, which were aimed at strengthening the organisation in a number of different ways. Linked to that is an important point raised about confidence in leadership. This morning, different views have been expressed about whether the chair and the chief executive should consider their position and about ensuring that the report's recommendations are made to work and kept under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/11">A big issue was raised about the lack of communication, which seemed to be one of the issues at the heart of why the five sites were not working together effectively, how people felt about their part in the trust's organisation and the sense of ownership of all the sites. Those are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/12">As I said, the report made 25 recommendations. It is important for all concerned that the action plan that I understand has been drawn up should be made to work, and that there should be transparency over how those recommendations are made to work and how the action plan is carried out for the future. Clearly, if the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley are not attended to, they will have to be addressed again to ensure that progress is being made, and to find out why if it is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/13">My hon. Friend described how the structure of the trust has contributed to the situation. Different views on that issue have been expressed and the report stops short of suggesting that now is the time for restructuring and a break-up of the trust. As one of my hon. Friends said, the report is clear that there is not the best case for doing that now. However, in light of the comments made this morning and the report itself, those issues need to be kept under review. If the recommendations are to be seen to work, they need to take account of the concerns expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/14">The size of organisations presents a difficult situation. I do not think that there is a perfect size in any situation; part of the problem is addressing how the structure and management of the organisation work and, importantly, what the organisation delivers for people. That is key. Linked to that is a discussion taking place in the Greater Manchester area about how services could be better delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/15">I want to make it clear that the Rochdale hospital issue is not about there not being access to accident and emergency services; it is about a blue light service not operating. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1636" name="Jim Dobbin">my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin)</phrase> said, 80 per cent. of people who come to accident and emergency do not need a blue light service. I have seen for myself the beneficial outcome of walk-in centres and other services that can better meet the needs of those people. They are important because hospitals can then get on with the jobs they specialise in on behalf of the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/16">My hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Blackley made points about safety and choice. The issue of choice is important&mdash;speaking for my area, I am sure that many in Doncaster would choose to go to their local hospital&mdash;but if an elderly lady's family members lived 50 miles away, she might choose to have an operation closest to them so that they could look after and visit her. So choice is an interesting debate; it is part of the future and involves addressing what people need.</p>
	<p pid="a.390.0/17">A lot of issues have been raised this morning, and I hope that hon. Members agree that I have had limited time to respond to them, but I have spoken to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>. As the Minister with regional responsibility, he is obviously concerned about the issues. This morning, he asked me to convey the fact that he is willing to look further into them to ensure that the recommendations are carried out to everybody's satisfaction.</p>

	<p pid="a.395.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her words of support. I once aspired to represent a part of her constituency when I was a council candidate in Islington some 16 years ago. My candidature was not for as impoverished an area as Bunhill, but in spite of that, the electors were still not going to go for a Conservative candidate.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.0/2">I hope that this issue is of great interest not only to the Minister but to the Government beyond. It affects myself, as a constituency Member of Parliament in the heart of London. As has been rightly said, it affects other parts of the capital, too, because the hospital has a tremendous history.</p>

	<p pid="a.395.2/1">I am grateful for those kind words from the Isle of Sheppey and beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.2/2">This debate is about marshalling the forces among parliamentary colleagues, such as those we have heard from in the past few moments, not only to ensure the survival of this hospital but to create a valuable future for the benefit of all Londoners and the many medical professionals who will gain valuable experience within its portals in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.395.2/3">In April 2002, I hosted a similar debate on the future of St. Bartholomew's hospital. That debate took place on the day of an announcement by the Government of significant new expenditure on public health care funded by many of the taxpayers who make up the daytime population of the City of London. I shall quote from <i>Hansard</i> part of a reply given by the then health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>, who was at that time most complimentary about the capability of Barts and adamant that its future was secure as a centre of medical excellence, especially for cardiac and cancer care:</p>
	<p pid="a.395.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The minor injuries unit continues to operate at St. Barts . . . and will be retained as part of the new development. There is no prospect of its disappearing.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, Westminster Hall</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2002-04-17">17 April 2002</phrase>; Vol. 383, c. 238WH.]</p>

	<p pid="a.396.0/1">I agree entirely, and the hon. Lady might not appreciate that the Westminster side of my constituency has had a similar problem with the Paddington health campus in relation to St. Mary's, Paddington. Great amounts of money have been spent, as has been well documented, and &pound;100 million will be lost if this private finance initiative project does not go ahead because Skandia has already expended that money, which is ring-fenced from its point of view. As the hon. Lady says, it is inexplicable that a review is taking place at this stage. It makes no sense financially, apart from the other problems to which I referred and shall continue to refer during the rest of my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.0/2">Barts is internationally renowned for medical excellence. Institutionally, it is equally well-known throughout the nation. I would not mind betting that if we asked people anywhere in the United Kingdom to name a hospital other than their own local general hospital, Barts would be mentioned more than any other. I am afraid to say that it has only been in the 58 years since the nationalised health service came into being that the future of England's oldest hospital has been threatened.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.0/3">I said at the outset that introducing this debate gives me no pleasure. After five years of representing the Cities of London and Westminster constituency, I am completely at a loss to understand, just as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1605" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney, South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> was a moment ago, the Government's strategy for the provision of health care in central and east London. Judging from my own postbag and discussions with the many health professionals in my constituency, others share that incomprehension.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.0/4">In a letter published in the <i>Evening Standard </i>last week, Alistair Wilson, the accident and emergency clinical director of the Barts and The London NHS Trust, put the case on the broken promises to Barts and the London succinctly. He highlighted the crucial capacity offered by the two hospitals during the <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> bombings last year. One of those bombings took place on the edge of my constituency, by Aldgate tube station. He also wrote about the expectations of what Barts and the London will do when the next terrorist strike occurs&mdash;we pray to God that that will not happen any time soon&mdash;or indeed during the London Olympics in six years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.396.0/5">The nation is united in its support for Barts as a hospital and as a national treasure. Last week, I met Professor Charles Hinds, who spent his entire medical career at Barts, to discuss the critical importance of the PFI project to the future of the hospital. Without PFI, Barts probably has no future as a medical institution. There has already been huge investment in the new breast cancer centre in the west wing of Barts, which was predicated on the fully-fledged PFI taking place. Without the revenue from a cardiac and cancer care centre at Barts, the entire business case for the PFI, and the work of the Royal London in relation to cancer and heart care, seems to fail.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way; he has been generous with his time. Does he agree that following a discussion I had last night with five very senior consultants from the Barts and The London NHS Trust, it seems increasingly clear that the demand for cancer and cardiac care and major trauma at the trust is undeniable? The question that the Treasury raised at the last minute concerns the affordability of the scheme. Does he also agree&mdash;I hope that the Minister will respond directly to this point&mdash;that the worst value-for-money outcome for the NHS would be for the project not to proceed at this stage? Major penalties of up to &pound;100 million would be incurred if the project had not proceeded by <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, as intended.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.397.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" speakername="Mark Field" colnum="397"  time="012:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h03.htm#60124h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.397.1/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. Clearly, there is a financial case, but, none the less, as he has rightly pointed out, even that begins to fall when the facts of the matter are put into place. He also touched on demand. Demand is very prevalent in the parts of London that I represent and that are represented by the three hon. Ladies who have spoken and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase>, who has not. It is estimated that there will be some 300,000 new residents in the Thames Gateway and a further 100,000 in Tower Hamlets. That is based on the Government's figures for population increase in the east of London. At a time of such planned population increase and with the average age of many local residents rising substantially, the decision to put Barts under threat seems short-sighted in the extreme.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/2">There is no need for us to shake our heads; we need to get together and put the wheels of this PFI back on the rails. I am cheered by the fact that so many Members on the Government Benches are present today. I understand that they will be making their feelings plain to the Prime Minister in a meeting later tonight with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, who was the very Minister who announced the saving of Barts in 1998. I am under no illusions. As an Opposition Member of Parliament there is only so much that I can do. Perhaps I can raise the profile of the issue, but, ultimately, it is for Government Back Benchers to have their say. I hope that it will be clear to the Minister that there is a unity of purpose among all of us who represent this vibrant part of the capital.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/3">The operation of the PFI is causing great grief. It may be expensive, but it is the only funding option in town for our hospitals today. The failure of this PFI in health care, alongside the recent breakdown in the major development in St. Mary's hospital, Paddington, may prove the thin end of the wedge. Other contracts, such as the one operating at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Woolwich, will bring trepidation to those who are relying on the future success of PFI programmes nationwide for their health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/4">In my previous debate in 2002, I made the point to the then Minister that we must have an eye on the decades to come rather than simply on the past. I appreciate that one could talk about the historic importance of Barts, going back almost 900 years, but if we look at the future, even in the past four years the Government have developed quite detailed plans to build many more homes in the Thames Gateway, especially for key workers who will be servicing central London day by day. Obviously, we have also won the Olympics bid in the past seven months. Whatever increase finally occurs, the east end of London, as one of the poorest communities in England&mdash;it is the poorer areas where the highest rates of heart disease and cancer occur, as the hon. Member for Islington, South and Finsbury pointed out&mdash;deserves more investment in medical care, not less. It is painful to report the Government's intention to turn their back on the population of the east end of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/5">The case for redeveloping Barts and all its services has been made a long time ago and it is now a matter of the Government finding the money and letting that project blossom. Some people may wish to talk up the importance of cardiac and cancer care at Barts, but I want to talk about maintaining the viability of all the hospital's current operations and their importance both locally and nationally.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/6">Four years ago, in the light of the attacks in New York and Washington on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, I challenged a health Minister on what would happen should a major terrorist incident occur in the City and the importance that Barts and the London would undoubtedly play in the care of the injured. Tragically, such an event came to pass on <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> last year. I should like to quote again from Alastair Wilson's letter. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/7" class="indent">&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="">7 July</phrase> thirty major incident trained doctors and paramedics were transported to the sites of the explosions; trauma teams were assembled from all over the Trust to treat the awful shrapnel injuries and amputations caused by the bombs&mdash;we drew on all our expertise, including our cancer and cardiac colleagues from Bart's many of whom work also at the Royal London because of their interest in trauma care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/8">Those same people now feel desperately let down by a Government who only seven months ago were happy to bathe in the public's approval of our front-line health care professionals by stressing how their investment had led to such capability in the face of those terrible terrorist incidents. Alastair Wilson's words, and those of his colleagues, speak far more eloquently than anything that I can manage about the importance of Barts and the Royal London acting in concert.</p>
	<p pid="a.397.1/9">After decades of under-investment in local medical infrastructure, I believe that the people who live and work in the City and the east end of London deserve the centres of clinical excellence and medical care that they were promised. We will all continue fighting to ensure that we achieve them in the years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.398.0/1">It was eight years ago that the people of the east end and Londoners generally fought a tremendous struggle to save Barts hospital. The proposals then came from a Conservative Government, and we were proud that a Labour Minister for health was able to announce that he would save Barts. It is therefore with deep sadness that I rise to contemplate yet another threat to the future and viability of Barts and the Royal London.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.0/2">To remind hon. Members who were not here eight years ago, the argument then, in the light of the Tomlinson review, was that there was too much medical provision in London: it was over-resourced with hospitals and health care, and that that was why Barts had to close. It is sad indeed to have to revisit those arguments. However, as colleagues will remind the Chamber, there are pockets of poverty in inner London as bad as anywhere in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.0/3">Taking a slide rule or a tape measure to the number of hospitals within the M25 and arguing that London is overprovided misses other factors, such as the high number of refugees with endemic health problems and the logistical problems in London. It is easy to take a ruler and stretch it across a map from Stoke Newington to the Royal London hospital and ask, &quot;Why do these people need Barts when they can go somewhere else in London?&quot; People should try joining a mother with a push chair and a couple of children on the three buses that it takes to get from parts of my constituency to the Royal London to understand how ludicrous that position is. Eight years ago we fought with Ministers about that slide-rule, accountants' approach to medical care. That approach did not consider the need and the endemic problems&mdash;including the understating of the population in London by the census and other statisticians, and the poor housing&mdash;yet, on the basis of accountancy rules, said that we had too much health care. However, we are now revisiting the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.398.0/4">As I said, Barts is not the closest hospital to my constituency. However, although Homerton hospital has an excellent reputation and is one of the leading hospitals in London, Barts has a special place in the hearts of Londoners, not only because it has been there for so long but because of the high standard of care that Londoners, particularly in the east end, have grown accustomed to receiving there.</p>

	<p pid="a.399.3/1">That is right, but I do not want to take the argument forward on the basis of comparison, because that is what got us into trouble in the Tomlinson review. I want to take the argument forward on the basis of need, and the need for the services that Barts produces is real and quantifiable. Barts holds a special affection in the hearts of Londoners. They were promised that it would be saved and that they would have world-class cardiac facilities on that site. I cannot believe that my Government intend to go back on that promise now. If, at the last minute, there is an attempt to decouple the Barts part of the PFI from the general redevelopment of London, that will cost the taxpayer money. Skanska, the approved developer, could walk away with &pound;100 million in compensation. What sense does that make?</p>
	<p pid="a.399.3/2">I understand from Ministers that they are asking for the review at the last minute because the decision was made four years ago and things have changed in four years. Let me tell them that there are not fewer people; there are not fewer ill people nor are there fewer people suffering from heart disease and cancer in my constituency than there were four years ago. What do they believe has become so much better about health outcomes in the east end that they can justify throwing away &pound;100 million of taxpayers' money on compensation to a developer at the last minute?</p>

	<p pid="a.400.4/1">After the interventions that have been made, I have only a few minutes in which to respond to the debate. It is important that I reply to the points that have been made. If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I shall press on.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.4/2">I have been asked to explain why we are in such a situation. For many years, it has been widely acknowledged that there is a need to develop the facilities that are provided through the hospitals. Much of the estate is old and generally in poor condition. It was not designed to support 21st health care and it is in need of modernisation. I acknowledge that, and I hope that it will be accepted that the Government acknowledge it, too. Departments at Barts and the Royal London are not co-located for efficiency. The buildings do not lend themselves to the implementation of modern models of care. There is a need for new facilities in that part of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.400.4/3">A scheme of such a size or complexity has not been undertaken by the NHS before. It provides a total of 1,248 beds across two sites. When complete, it will be Britain's biggest new hospital. Therefore, it is right and proper for us to undertake greater scrutiny when the proposals are of such magnitude. We will soon be publishing a White Paper on the future of health care services in the community. We have been listening to what the public tell us about how they want to move some services from hospitals out into local communities wherever it is safe and economic to do so. People want personalised services that are built around their needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.403.3/1">Miss Begg, will you thank Mr. Speaker for choosing me to introduce this debate on asylum and detention&mdash;with the emphasis on detention? The number of people claiming asylum in the UK and in other industrialised countries is declining. In the UK, the numbers have dropped dramatically&mdash;by as much as 61 per cent. over the last two years, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. In spite of that, the number of those who have claimed asylum at some stage and who are detained solely under the powers of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 has increased. Given that the number of places to detain such people has tripled under this Government, it is crucial that the House look closely at what is happening and consider seriously what the implications of such a policy may be.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/2">I have asked for this debate because I believe that the detention of people who have sought asylum in the UK remains a hidden plight. The Minister will, I am sure, be aware of the fact that Amnesty International looked at the very issue earlier this year. The organisation reached some incredibly disturbing conclusions, which I believe warrant closer inspection and consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/3">The human cost of detention is far too high. It inflicts untold misery on the individuals concerned and their families. Those held in detention include some of the most vulnerable people who in most societies, including ours, are identified as needing the most support and protection. I am talking about families with young children, torture survivors, pregnant women, the elderly and those with serious medical conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/4">People are detained miles away from their family and friends. They are often held in grim, prison-like establishments. Many are not clear about the circumstances of their detention. They sometimes do not understand why they are being held. Those interviewed by Amnesty International were not told how long they would be detained. There is no maximum time limit for detention, and no automatic judicial scrutiny as to the lawfulness of and the necessity for the detention. If the onus were placed on the UK authorities to justify such use of detention, I would not like to hazard a guess as to how many decisions to detain would be questioned and perhaps overturned.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/5">Those interviewed by Amnesty International had all fully complied with reporting restrictions at the time that they were taken into detention. The Minister may argue that those people were detained because there may have been a credible risk of their absconding. Maybe so, but with no meaningful assessment of that risk, how can he be so sure?</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/6">There are people languishing in detention, sometimes for as long as two years. That has negative repercussions for individuals, and particularly for their mental health. Detainees say that they were frustrated by the lack of information and by feelings of abandonment and loneliness. Some had self-harmed and attempted suicide. Some complained of the verbal and racial abuse that they suffered. All that points to untold misery, and this is the plight of people who have committed no crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/7">The Government have often claimed that detention is pivotal to their strategy to remove asylum seekers whose claims have been dismissed. They have also claimed that detention would be used only as a last resort. However, Amnesty International found that many people were detained at different points of the asylum process. I confirm from my casework that that can be at the beginning, in the middle or at the end of such a case, when the prospect of effecting their forcible removal within a reasonable time is slim. This is not really a last resort, then.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/8">We have no idea how many people are held in detention. Amnesty International believes that twice as many people are detained as are removed each year. It is estimated that 25,000 people were held in detention in 2004. It is unacceptable that we do not know for sure how many people are detained. We do not know how long they are detained for and we have no profile of those held in detention. That gap in general knowledge must be filled.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/9">In April last year, the Government introduced new funding arrangements for legal work on asylum and immigration cases in England and Wales, with the aim of cutting the overall public funding for such work. I realise that that policy area is not necessarily within the Minister's remit, but he must be aware of the effect that it is having on his area of responsibility. The cuts in legal aid have resulted in the withdrawal of established solicitors from that vital area of work, which has created a gap in expertise that is felt most by those held in detention who are at the end of the asylum process. What hope is there for them if they do not get adequate legal representation?</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/10">I have referred extensively to Amnesty International, but last July there was a briefing from Save the Children to Members of the House, which made some important points about children held in the detention system. Save the Children said that it was worried about</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/11" class="indent">&quot;the negative impact that detention has on children's emotional and physical wellbeing&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/12">and</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/13" class="indent">&quot;the worrying lack of safeguards and child protection . . . for these children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/14">It also said that the processes for taking the welfare of children into account</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/15" class="indent">&quot;in the decision to detain are ineffective.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/16">Save the Children raised concerns about the effectiveness of existing review procedures for ensuring that the detention of children is not prolonged. It pointed out that it is Government policy for the immigration service to give written reasons for detention in all cases, at the time of detention and at intervals thereafter, but the briefing says:</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/17" class="indent">&quot;Evidence from our research suggests that few families are given initial reasons for detention, and there were families who were subject to unnecessary periods of detention because procedures for reviewing the decision to detain were ineffective. The European Human Rights Commissioner also raises these concerns, and HMIP's reports criticised the reviews for not being informed by external social work expertise or by the experience of staff involved in the direct care of children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/18">The briefing goes on to talk about ministerial authorisation in relation to children who are detained for more than 28 days. Ministers are supposed to authorise such cases every 28 days and every week thereafter. Save the Children says:</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/19" class="indent">&quot;There is no public evidence on the implementation of the ministerial authorisation process or the reviews on which they are supposed to be based. Neither is there any statistical information on how many authorisations have been sought and how many have been granted or declined. It has been expressly criticised by the European Human Rights Commissioner who believes it to be inadequate because it is an administrative decision without any form of hearing.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/20">Save the Children goes on to say that, in 2002, Her Majesty's inspector of prisons recommended that there should be an independent assessment of the welfare, developmental and educational needs of each detained child. Save the Children says that no system for that is in place. I presume that it is still not in place, even now. Perhaps the Minister will confirm that.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/21">Save the Children talks about prolonged detention and the fact that that can happen through an incremental process. It quotes the European Commissioner for Human Rights:</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/22" class="indent">&quot;It is not acceptable . . . that such lengthy detention should remain at all times at the discretion of the immigration service, however senior the authority may be.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/23">Finally, it offers another quote from the European Commissioner for Human Rights:</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/24" class="indent">&quot;It is perverse that the burden should lie on the child or his family to take arduous steps to challenge their detention, rather than on the Immigration Service to prove its continuing necessity to an independent authority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/25">Recently, there was a press conference to launch a document called &quot;A 'Bleak House' for Our Times&quot;, which was produced by Legal Action for Women. The document looks into what is happening at the Yarl's Wood centre, and I want to mention some points that were made at that press conference. Concern was expressed on various issues, including the fact that those who are suicidal are placed on a suicide watch that involves their being woken at timed intervals with flash lights, which is likely to remind victims of previous traumas and to cause severe sleep deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/26">Concern was also expressed at the fact that there is no mechanism to prevent victims of torture from being detained; that the outsourcing of medical care services results in detainees having restricted access to health professionals; that the detention centre manager is obtrusive and often refuses detainees medical attention, in some cases overruling the decision of the nurses and health professionals; that representation, when it is received, is often poor and undermines cases; and that lawyers' charges are too high for the people held in the centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/27">Legal Action for Women also said that there is a distinct lack of information about the fast-track scheme and that those who are detained do not know of it. It added that although there is a women's detention centre at Yarl's Wood, 70 per cent. of the staff are male. It went so far as to call for a full public inquiry on the issue of detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/28">The right to liberty is one of the most fundamental human rights protected under international law, and it is a serious violation of that right to detain an individual arbitrarily. It should concern us all if, as seems to be the case, there is a real possibility that people are being detained unjustly. For that reason, I urge the Minister to ensure that each decision to detain is seriously considered. Such a decision should not be made lightly, but should be overseen by a court or a similar independent body with the competence to review each decision regularly. Does he agree that that is the only way for us to ensure that we do not detain people arbitrarily and that we treat people humanely, as is our duty under international law?</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/29">Will the Minister consider reinstating the provision made in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 for two automatic bail hearings for all immigration detainees after seven and 35 days in detention, which would thus ensure that they were protected against prolonged and unnecessary detention? Given that detention should only ever be used as a last resort, will he make it his policy that alternative non-custodial measures, such as reporting, will always be considered before resorting to detention? That should be the policy for all asylum applications, including those considered under the so-called fast-track process. Does he agree?</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/30">I find it extraordinary that no comprehensive statistics are made available in the course of a year on the number of people who have sought asylum and who are held in detention. Nor, of course, is there any information on how long those people are held. That cannot be right. In 2003, the Home Affairs Committee noted that the lack of comprehensive data on detention made it difficult to judge whether detention was really being used as a last resort, primarily to support removal, as the Government have claimed.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/31">The Committee recommended that the figures be provided quarterly, but they are still not available. When will they be ready? It has been two years since the Committee made its recommendation. Why, after all this time, are the figures still not available? Can the Minister give us a concrete date for when they will be? Vulnerable people are being held in detention, and the cost for them is particularly high. Can he guarantee that no vulnerable person will be held in detention?</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/32">Recently, I employed a bright young woman called Anna Boaden. Unbeknown to me, although it must have been in her CV somewhere, she did her dissertation on the detention of asylum seekers. Her conclusion contains a crucial argument:</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/33" class="indent">&quot;It has become increasingly apparent that detention is no longer being used as an administrative device to facilitate the deportation of failed asylum applicants, just as it is evident that preventing people from absconding is not a primary justification for why increasing numbers of asylum seekers are being detained. Rather, it is becoming a tool of deterrence, a method of warning to would be applicants that Britain is no longer a soft touch. Not only does this message run against the spirit of the Geneva Convention, it is also arbitrarily detaining those who do not fall into the categories that appear in article 5(1)(f) of the European Convention on Human Rights. The process of detaining asylum seekers further excludes them from society, and contradicts non-discrimination policy.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/34">I do not know whether that is true, but if detention is being used as a tool of deterrence in any single case, that is an unsuitable use of detention and is, potentially, against international law. Let us have the information&mdash;the data&mdash;so it can be tested. If the Government say that that is not the purpose, let us see whether that is so.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/35">In conclusion, depriving people of their liberty is a serious measure and no decision to detain should be taken lightly. The Government themselves said that they would use detention only as a last resort, which signals the seriousness with which such decisions should be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/36">There appear to be no rigorous checks and balances on how detention is administered. It is crucial that that be addressed by the Government&mdash;not only to restore faith in the system, but, more importantly, to ensure that they deliver a fair and efficient asylum system. Although it is not unlawful in some circumstances for the Government to detain people who have sought asylum in the UK, it is unlawful for them to detain individuals arbitrarily. I call on the Government to take all the necessary steps to end arbitrary detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.3/37">I look forward to the Minister's response and ask him to focus particularly on the issues of judicial oversight, automatic bail review, the availability of statistics, the use of non-custodial measures and an end to the detention of vulnerable people.</p>

	<p pid="a.407.0/1">I should like to begin by thanking you, Miss Begg, for your intervention at the start of the debate. I was worried for a second that I might have to answer questions on St. Bartholomew's private finance initiative, as well as on detention and the immigration service.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/2">On a serious point, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1684" name="Harry Cohen">my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen)</phrase> on securing this debate. He is right to do so, because it is a matter of important public policy and it is right that there is the fullest possible debate about such serious issues. I agree with him at the start by saying that, by definition, the matter involves some very vulnerable people, which is why it is important that we debate these issues openly and are clear about the policy. I also congratulate Amnesty International for raising public awareness of the issues concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/3">These are difficult issues of public policy, and it is important that we foster an informed public debate about them. I say &quot;informed&quot;, because it is important that when conducting this debate, people on both sides of the issues stick to the facts and that the language used is temperate and accurately describes the situation. I am not describing this debate, but in other instances, recently, particularly in relation to events in Scotland, the language used has sometimes veered away from that standard, which does not help the conduct of a rational, sensible debate on immigration.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/4">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for the way in which he has introduced his debate today and for his remarks. I agree and sympathise with many of his points. I suspect that we may have a disagreement on the level of whether or not detention should be used and the extent to which it should be used. There may be a difference between us on that, but I can assure him that I agree with a number of the principles that he outlined.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/5">First, I would want to assure him that a decision is never taken lightly or before a meaningful&mdash;I think that was the word he used&mdash;assessment. I will explain that in more detail. There should be openness about the statistics, so that people can have clarity about the situation; I would want to agree with him on that point. That people are accommodated in decent conditions, in a humane way&mdash;I would agree with him there, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/6">I will move on to some of the areas where we may have a difference. The Government's view is that, although regrettable, detention is an integral and important element in maintaining effective immigration control and in tackling abuses of the system. We have made it clear that there is a general assumption in favour of granting temporary admission or release&mdash;I want to assure my hon. Friend on that point&mdash;but there will be circumstances where detention will be considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/7">Such circumstances would be: initially, where a person's identity or the basis of their claim is being established; where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person will abscond; thirdly, when part of a fast-track asylum procedure, where an individual's application appears to be capable of being decided quickly; or, fourthly, to effect removal. Those are the grounds on which such a decision will be taken, but, as I said to my hon. Friend him at the beginning, that would be done only after a serious assessment of the case before the particular immigration officer.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/8">Immigration detention policy and practise in the UK is fully in line with article 5 of the European convention on human rights and associated jurisprudence. Detention is for the shortest possible period and will last no longer than is reasonably necessary in the cases concerned. My hon. Friend raised the point about there being no time limit, but there is the phrase &quot;reasonably necessary&quot;. People have to make a judgment, of course. The sort of length of detention to which he referred would be an exceptional circumstance and by no means the average time that people would spend in detention. He is right, and when we come on to the statistics I can say a little more.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/9">Our view is that detention should never be prolonged unduly. The decision on whether detention should be authorised or maintained is made on a case-by-case basis, rightly subject to regular review. No one&mdash;I stress&mdash;is detained solely because they have made an application for asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/10">I want, too, to give my hon. Friend the assurance that we carefully considered the Amnesty International report, &quot;Seeking asylum is not a crime&quot;, and the 21 recommendations made. As he called the debate, I have been through those recommendations again, to satisfy myself that we gave them due consideration and took on board the points made.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/11">The Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Nationality, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase>, met representatives of Amnesty to discuss the report last July and he responded formally to the report in September. I hope that that is an assurance that within the Department we have treated the report with the seriousness that it clearly deserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/12">As an aside, a tribute to the power and reach of Amnesty International in this country is that I must have signed more letters to MPs about that report than about any other single issue. That is a good thing, which clearly shows that, as I said at the beginning, Amnesty has succeeded in producing a far-reaching public debate. I congratulate it for succeeding in such a positive step.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/13">A number of the recommendations that the report made, we would argue, reflect what we do already or relate to issues on which we have indicated that we share much the same underlying principle. There are other recommendations with which we disagree or simply cannot accept that the matters concerned need to be placed on a statutory footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/14">I will give an example. There is the recommendation for a statutory prohibition on the use of Prison Service accommodation to hold certain individuals, which in our view is necessary in individual cases for reasons of security and control. It is not used routinely, but there will be circumstances when it is an appropriate option, perhaps for the protection of the individual concerned. We would not want to rule it out. I will be happy to provide my hon. Friend and other hon. Members with a copy of our full response to the report. I shall write to my hon. Friend with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/15">Although detention is not time limited, it is subject to clear and well-understood legal constraints. Domestic and European Court of Human Rights case law provides that it should last for no longer than is reasonably necessary, that it must be used for the purpose authorised and that it must not be prolonged unduly. That is the basis on which detention operates in practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/16">As I say, we have no wish to detain people for longer than necessary and we believe that there is every reason to keep detention as short as possible. Detention has to be used efficiently and effectively if it is to support an increased level of removals of failed asylum seekers. We have made it clear on many occasions that we do not consider it appropriate to have a fixed upper limit on the duration of detention; that would go beyond the requirements of article 5 of the European convention on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/17">A fixed time limit would be arbitrary, thus taking no account of the individual's circumstances. It would serve simply to encourage individuals to frustrate and prolong immigration and asylum processes to reach a point at which they would be released. That would be unacceptable. A time limit might also encourage people to set longer time limits to err on the side of caution; again, that would not be in the interests of the individual concerned. The right thing is to work from the principle that detention should be minimised as much as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/18">All cases are considered carefully on their individual merits, and that will include an assessment of the risk of absconding. However, we do not detain only those individuals who present such a risk; people may be detained as part of a fast-track asylum process in which there may be little or no risk of their absconding. In some cases, individuals may also be detained simply to effect their removal. They may not represent a risk of absconding, but it may be clear that they have no intention of leaving the UK voluntarily. Detention may therefore be necessary to enforce removal.</p>
	<p pid="a.407.0/19">My hon. Friend went into great detail on the detention of vulnerable people. Naturally, that is an issue of concern. Operational instructions provide clear guidance to immigration service staff about persons normally considered unsuitable for detention; I give my hon. Friend assurances on that. Such persons include victims of torture, pregnant women, those with serious medical conditions, people with mental health problems and elderly people. However, the detention of such individuals cannot be ruled out completely. Officers dealing with such cases must weigh the various factors in favour of and against detention and make a judgment in each case about whether it would be appropriate to authorise it. We have to trust the professionalism of the staff involved at that point. As I said, emotive language can often be used to describe immigration service staff, but we owe them a debt of thanks for the difficult job that they do in enforcing immigration control.</p>

	<p pid="a.410.1/1">In the short time left, I shall turn directly to that point. My hon. Friend mentioned the system for authorising the detention of children beyond 28 days. As Ministers, we see such reports regularly and in our view, the system is working well. My hon. Friend the Minister of State has met representatives from Save the Children and will meet them again next month.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.1/2">We take the issue seriously; it is, of course, of great importance. It is right that the situation should be scrutinised regularly at the highest ministerial level. I assure my hon. Friend that the system is working well and will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.1/3">There has been concern about the availability of statistics on detention. We have done much to improve the accuracy and scope of such published statistics&mdash;for example, data on children in detention is now included in them. However, I completely understand my hon. Friend's point about the need to do more. If we want the public debate that I described at the beginning of my remarks, it is crucial that people should have access to the full facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.1/4">In particular, we appreciate the desire to have statistics for the number of people detained over a period, rather than the snapshot figures for the end of each quarter that we have at present. Work is going on at the research and statistics sections of the Home Office at the moment so that we can produce a measure that is meaningful and that will give my hon. Friend what he wants.</p>

	<p pid="a.412.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. On his first point, a potentially good example of an accreditation scheme is being introduced in north Somerset, and I hope that the Minister will agree to consider that as a pilot scheme that might be rolled out across the country. I shall return to his second point presently, as I plan to address that issue later.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/2">As I was saying, the quality of addiction treatment is vital. The second issue on which we have been focusing in Weston-super-Mare is whether there is notification to the authorities in north Somerset when people from other parts of Britain who are referred for treatment are sent to the town. If someone who is incredibly vulnerable embarks on a course of treatment in Weston-super-Mare, or anywhere, it is important that the local health service, housing service and police be properly notified of that person's arrival, so that if something goes wrong and the person concerned needs additional support or help, the local services are aware of that person's circumstances and can provide appropriate support.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/3">I am afraid to say, however, that that is not what we have found. Since being elected to Parliament seven or eight months ago, I have been writing letters to referring agencies around the country asking questions under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. Sadly, a large proportion are not informing the north Somerset authorities of the arrival of the addicts that they are sending for treatment in Weston-super-Mare. That is not good for addicts. If something goes wrong, such as a relapse, and if an addict is picked up by the police without the police knowing that that person is in the middle of a care plan provided by a referring agency in some other part of the country, the addict will go to the local magistrates court and will not be treated in the right way. However, if information can be sought from the agency, a much more effective set of sentences and actions can be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/4">It is crucial that that communication loop is properly closed and connected. I am pleased to say that there are examples of excellent referring authorities around the country. Oxfordshire is one example: in the last two and a half years more than 100 people have been sent by Oxfordshire to Weston-super-Mare for treatment, and in almost every single case those concerned have managed to inform the local authorities of when people are arriving, where they are going, and when they will be there. So we are not asking for the unusual or the impossible: it is being done and good practice already exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/5">However, rather than one Opposition Back-Bench MP writing letters to referring agencies around the country about people who are sent to his constituency, a more effective approach, if possible, would be Government action pointing out that, wherever addicts are being sent for treatment or support, referring agencies owe them a duty of care to keep people in the relevant referral areas informed, and that if they are failing to do that they should resume promptly.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/6">My final point is that made earlier by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase>. When someone is referred to Weston-super-Mare or another place for addiction treatment or care, that referral should be part of a unified care plan. A session in a treatment centre for several months should be only one step on the road to recovery, and one step on the road towards piecing a life back together and enabling someone to re-enter society and rejoin their family&mdash;if that is appropriate&mdash;and to get themselves another job. Too often, however, we have found from writing to referring agencies that some of them do not know what has happened to a large proportion of referred addicts in Weston-super-Mare. If there is an effective care plan, the agencies should know what has happened after treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.1/7">The fear is that if the agencies do not know where those people are, either there may have been no effective care plan in the first place and they were shovelled out of the referring agency's area to get the problem off its front doorstep; or, when the addicts arrived for treatment in Weston-super-Mare, they may have failed to complete the course, relapsed, left the course and ended up on a street corner in Weston, possibly looking for their next hit and probably at high risk of an overdose, which is most likely after an attempt to break a habit, at severe risk of ill health and, from the point of view of local residents, likely significantly to increase the local crime statistics. Addicts in relapse, or those who have not got rid of their habit and have a chaotic lifestyle, are incapable of holding down a job. Therefore, the only way in which they can fund their habit is through crime.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. As part of a complete care package and plan, typically after leaving treatment, most care plans will involve a series of steps through half-way houses, dry houses, education and training and voluntary work as a way of re-entering society as one of its fully functioning members. My hon. Friend is correct to point out that people can fall through the cracks in that process. That is why a properly functioning care plan is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/2">My final point to the Minister is that rather than having a solitary Back-Bench MP such as myself with a particular problem in his constituency writing to local agencies that have referred people for treatment in Weston-super-Mare, a far more effective way of dealing with the problem would be through Government action to remind agencies of the duty of care they owe to people whom they send for treatment&mdash;in Weston or anywhere else. That duty is to ensure that people complete their care programme and that when they leave their treatment in any place, particularly Weston, they are not left to sit on a street corner and make their own way.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.1/3">Those are the three critical issues, and there is a big opportunity for the nation and the Government to pick up on them. I hope that the Government will consider what is happening in Weston-super-Mare and use it wherever possible&mdash;potentially nationally&mdash;as a pilot for roll-out. I hope, also, that the Minister has had a chance to study the report that the local police authority published, and which my predecessor, Brian Cotter, referred to the Secretary of State for Home Affairs. It set out several of those points in greater detail. I look forward to the Minister's reply.</p>

	<p pid="a.415.1/1">I am pleased to hear that. However, it goes to show that even in the context of expanding resources for drug treatment, and despite our development of the drug intervention programme&mdash;which provides that end-to-end, seamless approach of supporting people into and through the process of treatment, recognising the issues around housing, employment and so on&mdash;we still cannot be complacent. Even with the best will and the best guidance in the world&mdash;indeed, the best organisational structure, whether that be the national treatment agency or its regional support&mdash;it is not necessarily happening in the best way, as we would hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.1/2">I am indeed aware that there are particular problems in the south-west. Previously, in the Home Office, I visited the south-west a number of times. It is undoubtedly the case that the environment of that region provides a pleasant place to live, often in places by the sea and with buildings suitably located for residential rehabilitation&mdash;without somebody else living right next door, for there are all those issues about locating these services. Having said that, its very attraction can also be a problem because one issue, as I understand it, is that when people finish residential rehabilitation treatment they may not always go back to whence they came. That then raises a number of issues with a knock-on effect on services.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.1/3">That is why we expect drug action teams to ensure that aftercare packages covering issues such as housing and employment are built into care planning when they refer a drug abuser to in-patient detox or residential rehabilitation. That should be part of the process. In some cases, residential rehabilitation providers also offer a secondary care package as part of the care plan. Often, they even provide that back in the community from whence the person first came. So, there are good examples of where that can work well, but it highlights&mdash;it is important to raise this today&mdash;that we must improve the commissioning of services.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.1/4">There must also be understanding that in referring an individual to an out-of-area residential rehabilitation service, the ownership of that individual and their success should not end there. That is one reason why I was pleased last year when we reached a point where we could say, with hands on our heart, that we had increased the number of people in treatment. That is now at 160,000, ahead of our target, and we have made progress with retaining them in treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.1/5">The NTA launched its new treatment-effectiveness strategy to bear down further on successful outcomes. It is recognised that clinical treatment might be necessary, but there is also the wrap-around provision that will sustain someone through the years ahead. Let us face it: in difficult circumstances, people with any addiction may be vulnerable to relapses. This is not only about the here and now; it is about sustainability.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-01-24a.416.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="416"  time="013:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060124/halltext/60124h05.htm#60124h05_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.416.1/1">I do not disagree with the hon. Gentleman's point. If a drug action team or social services is paying for a treatment service for an individual, the people who are paying should be clear about what is happening with their investment. Continuity is needed in terms of follow-up and sharing of information. That also applies to providers, whether of treatment or housing, in terms of sounding the alert in the community if someone suddenly decides just to leave in the middle of the night. I cannot wave a magic wand and say that that will never happen. The question is: if someone opts out, for whatever reason, what is the process by which that is communicated? If part of the process for someone is that they have not gone to jail, for example, one would want to know, because it was part of their probation conditions, that they were in that treatment. These are important issues; we need to close some of the gaps. It has been clearly indicated that some commissioners of services, those who are referring people, are working well and some are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/2">In the short time available to me, I want to talk about action for the future. First, I hope that I have acknowledged that I take this issue very seriously and I am aware of the complexities. Unregistered residential services in the constituency of the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare are of particular concern. I understand that New Dawn house, Hope house and Sanctuary Addiction Services have been highlighted in that regard. It is worrying if those services are not offering effective treatment. There seem to be issues at the commissioning end. Perhaps those who commission are sometimes not doing as much work as they should to ascertain the nature of the services. In some instances, it is accommodation, rather than effective treatment, that is provided. Those paying for the service need to know exactly what they are paying for and what they should expect from it. To know that, they have to engage with the treatment provider and should be consulting the NTA and others about information that can give them a better picture of what they can expect for their investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/3">I am pleased to say that, despite the problems, it is clear that the different local stakeholders in the hon. Gentleman's area are aware of the problem. The report to which he refers, by Avon and Somerset constabulary, is very helpful. It was put together in conjunction with a number of people in the health sphere who are concerned about the issue. I understand that a number of actions have been considered, the first of which is the development of a system of local accreditation and quality assurance in line with the NTA standards, which will help placing authorities to understand better the risks of placing clients in the areas that we are discussing. I understand that, under that scheme, Sanctuary Addiction Services is working with the local drug action team to improve its clinical care practice to meet required standards. I am interested in that work and how we might consider it in the context of the national picture. I shall discuss that shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/4">Correspondence has been sent to probation areas nationally to set out concerns and to ask, for example, that placements at Hope house stop. I understand that that has already had a significant impact. A letter will be sent to all directors of social services reminding them of their statutory duties in relation to the aftercare of those placed out of area.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/5">Through the NTA regional commissioner's forum, agreement was made with neighbouring local authorities such as Bristol City not to place clients in unregistered care homes. Working with the NTA, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Commission for Social Care Inspection and Supporting People, funding for New Dawn house has been terminated, and New Dawn house is expected to close in July 2006. Operation Jupiter, which was carried out by Avon and Somerset police in partnership with the local drug action team, targeted 20 local houses in multiple occupation associated with high levels of criminal behaviour with very positive results.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/6">The recently submitted draft 2006&ndash;07 drug treatment plan signals a clear and continuing commitment to improving local service quality and capacity and to engaging pragmatically to address the problems posed by unregistered care homes. I understand, however, that this is a problem not only for the hon. Gentleman's area; it could be happening in other parts of the country. The work that is being done locally gives us some idea of how we could approach the problem nationally and how we can discuss what other steps the NTA can take, certainly through its regional arms, throughout England.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/7">As I said, the problems identified in Weston-super-Mare are experienced nationally, and to assist the process I have asked the NTA to produce an action plan on how those problems can be addressed nationally and for regular progress reports. I shall seek discussions with my colleagues in the Home Office, as it is jointly responsible for the NTA. The NTA is accountable both to the Home Office and to the Department of Health, and is required to assist us with any criminal justice issues that need further investigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/8">Before I conclude, I must say that we are doing a huge amount nationally to improve the effectiveness of residential substance misuse services. There are challenges in referring people to out-of-area services, as well as in not referring people to residential rehabilitation when it is in fact in their best interests. Hon. Members will know that it is often a big problem for local funders to decide whether to keep people in the area or to send them out. That is true in many respects for specialist children's services, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/9">We are trying through the effectiveness strategy to place a renewed emphasis on the whole journey of someone who is trying to find their way out of drug addiction and on how drug treatment systems can support that. I believe that drug action teams have a responsibility to put in place a package of support that covers assessment before someone enters the residential rehabilitation service, the period in the residential care setting and aftercare when they have left the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/10">As I said, the aftercare package should include housing and employment and the commissioning drug action team, irrespective of whether the person resumes residence in the area in which they lived before they had treatment or whether they go to a different area. There needs to be a better connection to make sense of the considerable investment in giving the individual another chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/11">We need to tackle variations, and several pieces of work are planned to ensure that the quality of that commissioning is improved. That work includes guidance on commissioning residential rehabilitation and in-patient detoxification services and other work to promote good practice and to improve tier 4 commissioning, encouraging the use of local flexibilities in the pooling of community care, and developing regional and sub-regional commissioning mechanisms. A region might explore more creatively what residential services it needs to make sense of the post-residential rehabilitation experience of coming home and the aftercare packages. As I said, work is also being done to improve and to promote the evidence base and consensus on suitable clients for tier 4 provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/12">As I have said, a huge amount of work is being done. We must always ensure that we are not complacent, even though so much progress has been made in identifying drugs as a link to crime, in providing the resources to make a difference, and in understanding that effective treatment can be important for the wider community as well as for the individual.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/13" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.1/14" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Two o'clock.</p>
