	<p pid="a.113.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman brings much more experience to this debate than I. Maybe he has made that calculation; I have not. Suffice it to say that I think that a number of race courses would be left vulnerable if the levy were reduced in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/2">What conversations has the Minister had with the Advertising Standards Authority regarding the initial leaked findings, reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>, disputing the basis of the bookmakers' figure? Turf TV believes that its product should cost &pound;4 million extra a year for all bookmakers, whereas SIS believes that the cost is closer to &pound;50 million. Does he have a view on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/3">As I said, the Minister must now decide the level of the 47th levy. Does he not agree that the best thing for racing would be to leave the levy at the same rate? That would undoubtedly fail to please bookmakers and race courses alike, but it would be a credible position for the Government at this time. Once he has made the new determination, will he redouble his efforts to bring all interested parties in racing together to modernise the levy in order to ensure more equitably racing's long-term future? It is an aspiration that should unite us all.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">I agree totally. The right hon. Gentleman and I have both been involved in previous debates on the matter in this Chamber, and I think that our views are as one.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2">Why was the RCA's announcement so surprising? In 1998, the outmoded system of transfer through inheritance, or dead men's shoes as it was called, was replaced by a trading system. On-course bookmakers could finally buy and sell their assets. The post-1998 system was approved and adhered to by all parties involved, including the RCA, which was consulted at every stage of discussions and assented fully to the regime's establishment. Indeed, the race courses benefited from the system, as substantial sums from the commission and sales of list positions were spent on race course improvement. Everybody benefited.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/3">Interestingly, at the Select Committee's oral evidence session on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November</phrase>, the RCA said that it was the only party involved in the post-1998 trading system to believe that list positions bought by on-course bookmakers were not assets held in perpetuity.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which I may not have included in my speech. It adds to my argument, and I am grateful for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/2">The NJPC, the levy board and, most importantly, bookmakers&mdash;both buyers and sellers&mdash;thought that list positions were held in perpetuity, but the RCA said that it did not. That cannot be so. At the time, race courses had to recognise list positions to receive a certificate of approval from the levy board. The RCA could not have predicted a change in that arrangement. Like all other parties involved, it must have based its decisions on the assumption that the regime established in 1998 would continue. The only change that it might have predicted relates to the five times rule&mdash;the rent&mdash;which is an entirely separate issue. That is an important point. Furthermore, as Tom Clarke, the chairman of the NJPC, said, the RCA did not mention a time limit or raise the issue of list position tenure until the 88th meeting between all the parties involved. I repeat that it was the 88th meeting before the issue was first raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/3">At the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-07">Wednesday 7 November</phrase> between the Federation of Racecourse Bookmakers and the RCA, held under the Minister's auspices, the FRB asked the RCA to explain the timing of its decision. It asked why the RCA had waited until March 2007 to make the announcement given that, until then, the race courses had been perfectly happy with the status quo&mdash;the post-1998 system&mdash;and had never questioned the tenure of list positions. Something must have changed. In response to that question, one of the RCA representatives explicitly stated that the decision was made in March 2007, just after the new regulations came into force in February. If that is not an admission that the proposed theft&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;of bookmakers' assets had been facilitated by the Gambling Act 2005, then I do not know what is.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/4">It is clear that the Select Committee was thoroughly unimpressed at the Racecourse Association's evidence. Although the other parties that gave evidence, including the NJPC and the levy board, understood that bookmakers held their list positions in perpetuity, the RCA said that it did not, despite having representatives on all statutory bodies. That does no credit to the race courses that are members of the RCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/5">The RCA's chief executive disingenuously referred continually to property rights with regard to list positions, despite knowing full well, because he had been told on a number of occasions, including in front of the Minister, that on-course bookmakers had never argued that list positions conferred a property right. It has been explained to the RCA on numerous occasions that list positions are assets held in perpetuity, subject to the existence of the race course in question. Furthermore, I remind the House that the dispute is over the status of list positions&mdash;bookmakers' assets&mdash;and not the rent. It is important to make that point because of attempts to cloud the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/6">Issue 10 of the RCA's update for racecourses states that the proposal to move the five times rule to commercial arrangements between racecourses and bookmakers was originally made by the Government in March 2003. That statement disingenuously failed to recognise that the position papers of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had recommended movement to commercial arrangements only from the five times rule. The Government's position on list positions, as stated in paragraph 2.6 of the DCMS paper, was that we had already seen the removal of the &quot;dead man's shoes&quot; on horse race courses and a move to fully commercial sale arrangements for pitches. Again, highlighting that point shows that the argument is flawed.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/7">The RCA is effectively advocating the move to fully commercial arrangements, with all the implications that it would involve for racing. I am sure that the House will agree that it is an interesting proposition, as it totally undermines its argument. We already have fully commercial sale arrangements&mdash;on-course bookmakers buy and sell their list positions. The only problem for the RCA is that the race courses are not directly involved in those transactions. They want to be involved. They want more money. That is what they mean by commercial arrangements. However, although wanting more money is acceptable, it does not justify theft.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/8">The RCA is disingenuously attempting to use the umbrella term &quot;commercial arrangements&quot; to refer to both rent and assets when they are and should remain entirely distinct and separate. As the Select Committee pointed out again and again, it is extremely difficult to understand why the race courses could not recognise bookmakers' list positions and at the same time undertake negotiations over the rent. That is what should have happened. On-course bookmakers have always been willing to negotiate over the rent. However, they also want their pitches back. Rent and assets are separate issues. We should not let the Racecourse Association muddy the water.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/9">I call upon the race courses to disassociate themselves from the comments and actions of the chief executive of the RCA. I call on the RCA fully to recognise the list positions of on-course bookmakers. Failing that, the Government should bring in secondary legislation that invests the duty of preservation in a statutory body.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.122.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" speakername="Celia Barlow" colnum="122"  time="010:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0002.htm#07112172000542">
	<p pid="a.122.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> on securing this very important debate. I agree with him that Turf TV has immense implications throughout the industry. I would like to return, however, to the matter mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> although his exposition of the problems of pitch bookmakers was so full that there is very little that I can add. However, I feel that I must add my weight to his cause, particularly in the interests of constituents of mine such as the Morrill family and Adrian Pariser.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/2">Surely the current situation that many in the trackside betting industry find themselves in was never intended when the Gambling Act 2005 was first proposed, and it is important to look at the specific matter of trackside list positions and their future allocation. Obviously, the gambling industry as a whole has undergone immense change over the past few years. I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> because I think that it is completely different from the inherited system that has damaged the livelihoods of constituents of mine and of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> who has done so much to highlight the problems in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/3">Throughout the many changes, however, the horse racing industry has shown a willingness to reform. Outmoded practices, such as the notion of an inherited seniority being handed down from parent to child have now given way to the trading of assets in a free and open market. The opening of trade in pick-list positions has led to much-needed fresh blood and new investment in the racing industry, but that fresh blood itself is now feeling let down and abandoned by the industry, because those people are now being told that the pick positions, in which they invested so much money, are no longer theirs. Most in the industry would agree that changes made in recent years to modernise it have been of immense benefit to all parties concerned, until now perhaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/4">The RCA will continue to argue, of course, that because it owns the physical asset, it is up to it to determine, by whatever means it sees fit, who trades there. However, we must say also that the pick position is merely the order in which a bookmaker can choose their position of trade on the race course, and not an actual physical pitch position. That distinction is obviously important to the RCA, but I suggest that the argument is deliberately two-dimensional in its thinking. An asset does not need to be physical. For example, a CD manufacturer does not own the music that it presses on to plastic. Already, we have agreed on, and spent many hours debating in this place, the concept of intellectual property. I argue also that there is such a thing as moral property, which is what the bookmaker owns.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/5">The RCA clearly recognises the accrued value of a bookmaker's position on a pick-list, otherwise why would it be attempting to wrestle the control of the pick-list away from the bookmakers? Although it has always been acknowledged, ever since the 2001 gambling review report, that negotiations would take place on admissions charges for bookmakers to race courses, as my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston has mentioned, the tenure of list positions was never in question until March this year, despite numerous&mdash;88&mdash;meetings on the subject. It has always been understood by the buyer, seller and administrator that list positions were to be held in perpetuity.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/6">The decision of the RCA to lay claim to the commercial benefits to be gained by the auction of valuable pitch positions has, as we have heard, stunned the National Joint Pitch Council, which set it up in the first place. It is quite disingenuous for the RCA to argue back in 2001, and then in 2003, that the Government advocated a change in the arrangement for pitch allocations and a move to commercial arrangements. It is a short-term smash and grab. I believe that the Government had no such intention, and that that is an interpretation of the 2005 Act, which serves only to increase the commercial gain of the RCA, at the expense of the very people and businesses without which there would be no trackside betting industry&mdash;in other words, the very people and business that, together with the trainers and jockeys, give the entire industry its flavour and value.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/7">Indeed, the Government's recommendations went only as far as a change to the five-time rule. That refers to the rent of the pitch, not to the asset itself&mdash;the moral property. There is no reason why commercial arrangements by the RCA about the rent cannot take place while recognising the bookmakers' list positions, as it has always done. The RCA, again disingenuously, is attempting to use the umbrella term &quot;commercial arrangements&quot; to refer to both the rent and the assets, when, in fact, they are, always have been, and should remain entirely distinct and separate.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/8">We are talking essentially about the livelihoods of hundreds of people in our gaming sector, but particularly about the family bookmakers, as we heard during the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport sittings, which many Members present attended. The family bookmakers have spent generations in the industry, and my constituents who trade under the name, Taffy, have been hit by a triple whammy: first, over the father-child rule, secondly over pitch allocations and sales, about which I cannot go into detail because of actions taken by the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green, and finally, over losing the last thing that they possess&mdash;their pitch position. The family have been hit three times within one generation, but the measure will affect small rather than large bookmakers. Large bookmakers will also be damaged, but they have large assets, and we are discussing small, family firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/9">Trackside bookmakers are asking for nothing more than clarity about the assets that they have accrued either through generations of hard work or by commercial acquisition. Let us not forget that some bookmakers in the south-east have spent more than &pound;1 million buying something that they believed they would hold in perpetuity. We want those assets to continue to be recognised as the industry standard, as all concerned have always understood them to be&mdash;that is until suddenly last March when the bombshell was dropped on the bookmakers.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/10">For the RCA to use the period of transition between the passing of the Gambling Act 2005 and its implementation as a means to wrest control of the assets of hundreds of trackside bookmakers is a blatant misinterpretation of the Act as it was intended. We have it in our power to set out in clear guidelines for both the RCA and the bookmakers precisely which areas are open to reform under the new legislation, and which areas are not. We, as legislators, have a responsibility to take any misinterpretation of legislation on board and clarify it, not leave it entirely up to the industry. Until the guidance is made clear, the trackside betting industry will remain at an effective standstill. Until we clearly define the parameters of the 2005 Act, many in the industry will not know whether their most important commercial asset, which involves the future of their children and their business, is to be rendered entirely worthless. The situation is entirely unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a reduction in the levy would disproportionately hit Scotland hard? Most of the horses are trained in the south of England, which involves transport costs to Scotland, particularly to the race course in Perth in my constituency which is the most northerly in the UK. If there is a reduction levy, there will be a reduction in prize money, which might be a massive disincentive for horse trainers and owners to come to race courses like the one in Perth.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.1/1">If the Tote goes to the open market and one of the major firms buys it, the hon. Gentleman is right: there could be a huge loss of jobs, particularly in the north. I hope that a deal can be found under which it is sold as was originally intended&mdash;he and I served on the Committee dealing with the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Bill&mdash;and goes to a racing consortium so that it is kept within racing. That is what we were promised and what we understood we were signing up to. As I mentioned in an intervention, if it is at all possible I want the Minister to give a commitment that at least 50 per cent. of money from the sale of the Tote will go into racing.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">On the list pitches, I agree with the contributions of the hon. Members for Livingston (Mr. Devine) and for Hove. Everybody that I have talked to is convinced that that was a separate issue, with the rent on one hand and the asset on the other. There was no understanding that the asset was being given up or that the five times rule was going, with people saying, &quot;Yes, that was understood. It's time to prepare for it.&quot; There was no understanding that the asset was going. I welcome the Minister's trying to knock heads together to find a solution. I know that the Culture, Media and Sport Committee is also considering this issue. I hope that he can give us some information as to what progress is being made. It is critical that we get a solution to that dilemma as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/3">Racing is critically important to this country. It is loved by millions and it has a bright future. However, a number of vital issues have to be resolved. The Minister has got a big job on his plate, because a lot of the decisions fall to him. I wish him the best of luck, but I hope that he will take racing's interests into serious consideration in making his determination.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I understand and share many of my hon. Friend's concerns. Let me set out the Government's position. We do not want to pre-judge what the determination will be, but we hope to announce it early in the new year to meet the requests of hon. Members. The levy has only just gone to determination, and we have not yet appointed consultants to assist the Secretary of State in his deliberations. However, my predecessor and my officials have followed the levy board's discussions closely and we are fully aware of the importance of having fair and timely outcomes for the racing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/2">I confirm that, in line with the recommendations of the future funding of racing review group, which my hon. Friend Lord Donoughue chaired in 2005, we still plan to review the workings of the levy scheme to see whether there is any way in which the machinery can be streamlined and simplified. I hope that the levy board will share the burden of that work with my Department. Obviously, that review can happen only when the 47th levy is determined. As my predecessor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase>, told the House late last year, we have no plans to abolish the levy until a viable commercial alternative emerges.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.1/1">That is an important point. First, let us make the determination. We need to do that quickly for the reasons that have been outlined. Again, I agree with the hon. Member for Tewkesbury: we ought to look at the options that are available to us if that is not successful. I am happy to give the commitment that we will do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">The Select Committee is looking into pitch tenure. I want to resolve the matter. We have set up a working group with an independent chair. We want to ensure that all sides of the argument, including the race courses and bookmakers, benefit from such a group. It is important to do that rather than going to law. People in racing tend to go to law very quickly, whether it be Turf TV or because of pitch tenure, which incurs huge cost. However, that money could go into racing, and we want to ensure that it is spent wisely for the future of racing.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">Hon. Members raised a number of points that I will cannot respond to in the time left. However, I will put in writing to those who have attended the debate the details on the questions that were asked. I urge that there are more debates on horse racing, that we look with interest at the work of the all-party group on horse racing and that we try to meet the challenges together. I accept that politics sometimes comes into play, but I hope that that will not prevent us from working together for racing's benefit.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.137.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" speakername="Stephen Crabb" colnum="137"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0005.htm#07112172000570">
	<p pid="a.137.3/1">That is an important intervention. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that we should not see customs cover as ultimately separate from the wider security arrangements. If Lord Carlisle made that judgment about Holyhead, I am very pleased, but the police and customs officers to whom I spoke said that there was significant concern about ports across Wales generally and the weakness of customs cover at them.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/2">What are the practical consequences of this state of affairs? First, at the same time that customs cover has been eroded, there has been a fall in the overall volume of drugs seized by customs. There is no evidence to suggest that the decline in seizures is because of a decline in the overall trade. The success of the Serious Organised Crime Agency last May in preventing what would have been the largest ever shipment of cocaine across the Atlantic into Wales via the Pembrokeshire coast is a stark warning of the scale of the threat that still exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/3">The failure of the current strategy is borne out by figures that were provided to me by the PCS union. They show a strong correlation between the decline in the amount of drugs seized by customs in the past three years and a fall in the street prices of various popular drugs during the same period. The amount of cocaine seized last year was less than one third of that seized just three years previously: 5,800 kg in 2005-06 compared with more than 20,000 kg in 2003-04. Over the same period, the per gram street price of cocaine dropped sharply. The figures for heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and crack cocaine all show the same relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/4">Those drugs are having a devastating impact on many communities in Wales. The police tell me that they are particularly concerned about the cheap heroin flooding into south and west Wales. We need to be careful about implying that a correlation means causation, but there is no doubt in my mind that the drop in customs seizures as a result of the removal of permanent customs cover at Welsh ports is allowing a greater flow of illegal drugs into Wales through Welsh ports, and that that is a contributory factor to the overall drugs problem in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/5">In the past year, we have marked the bicentenary of the Act abolishing the transatlantic slave trade. There has been a strong focus on human trafficking as one of the modern forms of slavery that needs to be stamped out. We know that the UK, with its booming illegal sex industry controlled by criminal gangs, is now a major destination for girls and young women being trafficked from eastern Europe, south-east Asia and north and west Africa. We should not engage in the fantasy that the victims of this grotesque trade are to be found only in London. A recent report on trafficking by Amnesty International suggested that Wales is now also home to a &quot;sophisticated and extensive&quot; trade in humans. Amnesty estimates that there are some 60 to 100 victims in Cardiff at any one time and, in a series of major police raids on massage parlours in Cardiff, Swansea and Bridgend last year, the vast majority of prostitutes discovered were illegal immigrants. There was a strong suspicion that many had been trafficked. It is obviously hard to quantify numbers because the trade is hidden, but outreach workers assisting sex workers in Cardiff report that about 50 per cent. of the girls and women they meet are foreign, and they believe that many of those girls have been trafficked.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/6">There is little strong evidence to suggest or to prove that many of those girls are being trafficked through Welsh ports as opposed to reaching Wales via England, but I have spoken to police and customs officers who tell me that they are concerned that girls and young women are being trafficked through Welsh ports. It was suggested to me that the route into the UK from Europe and North Africa via northern Spain and Ireland into Welsh ports is increasingly seen by traffickers as a less risky route than the traditional route from the continent via the south-east ports.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/7">This is a timely discussion, given the Prime Minister's announcement last week of a new UK border agency. His promise of an integrated system is welcome, but restructuring institutions and reshuffling personnel is not the whole story, and the resourcing issue must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/8">I opened my comments by referring gently to the calamitous news that broke yesterday about the missing child benefit claimant records. It would not be right for me to score cheap points about that&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.145.6/2">Having tabled early-day motion 402, I found out that an official from No. 10 Downing street was going round to signatories and, without telling me, was asking them to withdraw their names from the motion because of the sensitivity of the issue.

I listened carefully to his answer to the question on the Barnett formula today, and I am not sure in what sense he meant that the formula applied to England. It was based either on an obtuse understanding of the Barnett formula or he missed the point. Effectively, the formula applies at the margin and is based on an increase in expenditure in England, not previous expenditure, which is multiplied by a comparability factor of the population. I do not see what the Prime Minister meant when he said that the formula applies to England, apart from the fact that the calculation starts with England. My hon.

	<p pid="a.147.1/1">Hon. Members on both sides of the House appear to have had sight of my speech even though I was still writing it half an hour ago. I am coming to my hon. Friend's point, but I shall first go through some of the issues that illustrate the unfairness. I could spend the rest of the debate going through the figures, some of which are in the Library debate pack and the Library guide to the formula, but I shall not go through them all.</p>
	<p pid="a.147.1/2">Last year, disposable household income in Scotland was &pound;11,753, which is &pound;1,000 greater than in the north-east of England. However, when it comes to public expenditure, the north-east of England receives &pound;600 less per capita than Scotland, and the north-west of England receives &pound;800 less per capita. Overall in England, the per capita level of expenditure is &pound;1,000 less.</p>

	<p pid="a.148.1/1">No, I absolutely do not take that view. Not for the first time is a Conservative party proposal unworkable. It does not deal with the real issue, which is that the situation of people living in Leeds or Birmingham in terms of their influence on local policies on health and transport is very similar to that of people in Scotland. Rather than creating a completely unworkable situation in the House of Commons in which there are different classes of Members, it would be better to devolve issues down to local democracy. I do not accept the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">The example that I have given illustrates the fact that the English regions are not just competing with London, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland for resources, but are left out of the complete calculation. That is why, when I walk down the streets in Manchester, although people do not say that the Barnett formula is wrong, they do come up to me and say, &quot;Why does my daughter have to pay tuition fees in England, whereas if we lived in Scotland, she wouldn't?&quot; They go through a series of issues&mdash;hon. Members will be aware of them&mdash;from being able to get cancer drugs in Scotland that are not available elsewhere, to the care of the elderly&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I hear hon. Members saying from a sedentary position that that is to do with the Scottish Parliament, but the fact is that the Scottish Parliament, without raising a penny in taxes, can spend money at a higher rate than is the case in England. The whole basis of this debate is to ask for a review so that there is an equitable basis for funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">I am part of a campaign, with a number of hon. Members from all parties, to try to secure a referendum on the Lisbon treaty or reform treaty or whatever the European constitution is called at the moment. The basis of that is trust: what people say to the electorate should be carried through. What is often not talked about is that in national elections, there is a corrosive effect, certainly within the three major parties, in terms of how they campaign at national level and in the different countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/4">I have searched through the manifestos of the Conservative party, the Lib Dems and the Labour party, and there is no mention in the last three manifestos of all those parties for the United Kingdom&mdash;in the Great Britain manifestos, to be precise&mdash;of the Barnett formula, with one exception. In 2001, the Lib Dems came out against the Barnett formula and were in favour of a review and a fairer basis for funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> for bringing this debate into the open. It has been hidden for too long. I speak on behalf of a borough that is regularly listed among the 10 most deprived areas in Britain and has been so for a long time. The needs-based formula must be debated; it is no good hiding from it. The Welsh Assembly Government recently voted that that should happen, and we should take our lead from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/2">In Blaenau Gwent, one of the poorest boroughs, we also have one of the highest rates of council tax in Wales, if not the highest. Once a borough is poor, it is extremely difficult to escape from that position. Settlements come down from either London or the Cardiff Government, but our uplift is also among the lowest in Wales. The spiral of deprivation, in which a borough continues to be poor, is difficult to escape. A needs-based formula might have to be based in part on population, but to hide from the debate is not the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/3">The Government introduced European objective 1 funding, which was seen as a means of lifting people out of poverty. The problem is that it cannot be used for statutory responsibility, so the funding does not help to lift boroughs out of their real problem, which is statutory funding and statutory responsibility. European funding is also project-based, not long term, and that is another worry&mdash;it can disappear as quickly as it is given. It is important that we consider the needs of every area and region in this country, and not in isolation.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Atkinson; that is what I am talking about. The Barnett formula was an agreement made between Parliaments down here. When I make an agreement with someone I like to stick to it. If we had stuck to it, and merging had taken place over time as was supposed to happen with the Barnett formula, we would not be having this discussion. However, the Conservative party&mdash;whose spokesman will unfortunately speak later&mdash;let go of the formula from 1979 to 1992 without doing anything about it. If merging had occurred as was supposed to happen, the Barnett formula might have converged by now, or at least we might be contemplating that in the near future. Once again, a political party unfortunately did not do what it was supposed to. It wanted votes north of the border. Well, it got the votes it deserved, with two Members in the last three general elections. That says it all.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/2">As a trade unionist, which I have been all my working life, I have been expected, by the members whom I have always looked after and supported, to deliver as I have said I would. Those expectations extend to the Barnett formula. The fact is that Scotland delivers quite a lot to the United Kingdom. We also have added problems that other areas of the United Kingdom do not have. We have talked of the rural areas and the highlands and islands, and the poverty in some of our inner cities, which is as great as in any inner city in the world in a nation that professes to be a civilized part of western democracy. However, there is at present an alliance between the Conservative party, which I now call the English national party, because that is what it now is, the Scottish National party, which is well known north of the border as the tartan Tories, and the Welsh nationalists, who, I am informed by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd, who is not in his place at the moment, are called the daffodil Tories. That speaks for itself. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/3">I am somewhat disappointed in nationalist Members. I sat in silence while the Plaid Cymru spokesman did his eight minutes and I never interrupted him with a word. All that they have done this afternoon&mdash;and this is a shining example of how the nationalists conduct themselves throughout the country&mdash;is shout people down when they do not agree with them.</p>

We are in an age in which the Government talk to us about the importance of evidence-based policy, in which we are told that the focus must be on outcomes rather than just inputs, and in which the Government's priorities are based on equality, equity and meeting need. Does the hon. Gentleman not accept, therefore, that the Barnett formula indeed needs reviewing? It was not agreed between different Parliaments; it was agreed inside one person's head in Whitehall. In terms of providing policy accountability, it does no justice to this Parliament to defend a policy that neither stands the test of time nor meets the needs of people throughout the country that this Parliament serves.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.1/1">We could probably have a complicated debate about the mathematics, but I do not think that this is the time or place to do that given the time available.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/2">Clearly, there is a legitimate question here that cannot simply be ignored, and it is more complex than some, such as Ken Livingstone, sometimes like to present it as. Let us get the matter into perspective. The figure often quoted in the media is for a &pound;1,500 gap between England and Scotland, but almost certainly that exaggerates the effect, because if we exclude spending on social services, which is not subject to the Barnett formula and is intrinsically need-reflective, the difference is less than &pound;1,000. Furthermore, any alternative system almost certainly would have to be based either on fiscal autonomy&mdash;Scottish taxes for Scottish spending&mdash;or on an updated needs-based formula applied to all four countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/3">It is not at all clear that a needs-based distribution formula would eliminate the differential between England and Scotland, as some appear to suggest, and spending in the English regions, as has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members, varies enormously already, with public sector activity accounting for nearly 60 per cent. of the economy in the north-east, but little more than 30 per cent. in the south-east. So for those of us who wish to strengthen the Union and who are wary, therefore, of the fiscal autonomy solution, it is not clear that a revision of the formula on a needs basis would produce the results that the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley and others seem to assume.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/4">Let me be clear where the Conservative party stands. We are not considering changes to the Barnett formula, but we recognise a growing body of opinion that questions the settlement. It is legitimate to ask whether the formula, which has served the UK well, is best suited to dealing with the distribution of public spending in the future. That is a long-term question that might well need to be addressed. However, it must be placed in context, which I shall come to in just a moment.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.1/1">The Barnett formula seeks to allocate increases in what are known as departmental expenditure limits based initially on English departmental allocations and it seeks to ensure that the increases in DEL, rather than annually managed expenditure, are conveyed fairly on a per-population basis to the devolved authorities, which are allocated their spending through a block grant. In England, each part of public expenditure that is departmentally limited is allocated departmentally rather than on a block basis. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have explained that annually managed expenditure, such as social security, that is allocated on a demand basis is not part of the Barnett formula. The formula allocates Department expenditure-limited moneys that are in some ways devolved or not devolved, as the case may be, to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It is a needs-based formula for financial allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/2">The Barnett formula does not determine annually managed expenditure; its needs-based allocations are included in the limits, which hon. Members use to say that there was unfairness, whereas it distributes only part of total managed expenditure, which is known as DEL, rather than annually managed expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.1/1">In respect of the Barnett formula, the issue is whether such moneys are devolved or not and, if they are, by what percentage they are devolved. That is the technical mathematics involved in all this. If money is distributed, it is because the policy is nationally determined and therefore the devolved Administrations are allocated their percentage of it on a population basis. It is purely about whether it is a devolved matter or not. Since Crossrail is not a devolved matter, that is why the distribution was made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.169.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="169"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0009.htm#07112172000671">
	<p pid="a.169.2/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate housing in Northampton, which is the largest town in the UK and one of its most successful. It is in the Government growth area and has a successful economy, an incredibly high level of employment and a high level of home ownership. Most people in Northampton aspire to home ownership, and until recently house prices were low enough to make it a realistic option for almost all working families. Government plans for the growth area include the provision of 37,000 more homes, one third of which are to be affordable and a quarter to be social housing. All that is successful and should continue to be so, with people buying decent quality homes and building solid communities in which to bring up their families. That is what makes my constituency so special and puts the values of people there at the core of our country's success.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">What I wish to deal with in the debate is different, however: the provision of social housing by Northampton borough council&mdash;some 13,500 housing units in total, including a big block of new town housing from the previous big planned growth in Northampton in the 1970s. As every hon. Member knows, good quality social housing is central to the well-being of some of the more disadvantaged people in our constituencies. All of us deal with housing issues at our advice surgeries and visit the estates in our areas. We all know the hardship caused to people if they are homeless, if their homes are in disrepair, if they do not get the aids and adaptations that they need or if their estates become plagued by antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">In my constituency, over 12 years of campaigning first as a candidate and then as an MP, I can honestly say that I have seen a real deterioration in the quality of life of many of my constituents in council housing. That has been despite the Government's commitment to the decent homes standards and to driving up council performance, and it has happened under all types of political control. When I first became an MP, we were in control at the Guildhall and there were some difficulties. Then in 2003, the Conservative party got minority control of the council and, to my surprise, things went downhill seriously. In the most recent elections, the Liberal Democrats got majority control, and things have got considerably worse to the extent that housing now far outstrips everything else in my constituency case load.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4">I wish to emphasise that the problems are not because of the shortcomings of individual staff, who mostly do a good, straightforward job, but because of the council's strategic management and leadership. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will point to the most recent comprehensive performance assessment report, which shows some improvements. However, the main improvement is what the report calls &quot;stronger political leadership&quot;, which, to be honest, is to a great extent an obvious result of having a majority party administration as the result of one party getting an outright majority at the council elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/5">The reality for my constituents, who depend on the council's housing services, is that things have got much worse. Over 10 years, the council's housing stock, which should have improved under the national decent homes programme, has simply got 10 years more dilapidated. Homeless people have been driven into the inadequate private sector of rented housing; people with special needs, such as domestic violence victims or those waiting for aids and adaptations, have gone unheeded; and antisocial behaviour, which is the ultimate plague of badly managed housing stock, has made life a particular misery on some estates. The most recent assessment of housing services by the Audit Commission found that Northampton provided a poor housing service with uncertain prospects for improvement. Uncertain the prospects were indeed, because they have not improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/6">On disrepair, the council's housing stock condition survey found that about a third of the borough's housing was in need of improvement to bring it up to the decent homes standard. However, the CPA's overall assessment of the council's performance found that although it had identified funds to bring the properties up to standard, there was a &quot;very high risk&quot; that the council will fail to meet the decent homes standard by 2010. It also found that although the council had made regular statements that its ambition is to achieve the decent homes standard, they amount to aspirations and not realistic, robust and deliverable objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/7">Between 2004-05 and 2005-06, the number of council properties that were deemed unfit fell by only 3 per cent. from 28.7 to 25 per cent. By my reckoning, therefore, it will take a further eight years to achieve the decent homes standard, which well misses the Government's targets. That does not take into account the fact that some of the property is deteriorating at a substantial rate without receiving any kind of planned maintenance check from the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/8">We are now less than three years away from the 2010 decent homes target. The experience of my constituents, which is reflected through my advice surgeries and my visits to their homes, is that some properties are deteriorating very quickly. The upgrading programmes taking place up and down the country, which my hon. Friend the Minister must see when he looks at housing programmes, is simply not happening in Northampton. People come to my advice surgeries carrying plastic bags with belongings covered in green mould. On one estate, a woman, her husband and two children are unable to use one of their two bedrooms because of the damp and have had to throw away clothes affected by mould.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/9">I cannot tell you the number of times, Mr. Atkinson, that I have visited homes to see the extent of the disrepair to find water pooling on floors and walls covered with mould. On one estate, I found little stalactites and stalagmites growing in the walkways as a result of long-term structural disrepair. In one home, I knelt down on the carpet to look at some mould on the wall in a corner of the room. When I got up, my clothes were soaking wet, as the carpet was completely sodden. Some properties are permeated by the smell of damp, and parents complain that their children have chest infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/10">On one estate, partially completed repairs programmes had left serious holes and disrepair that had not been dealt with for many years. In the eastern Newtown district, major improvements are needed to housing that was not particularly well built to start with and that has deteriorated markedly in the past decade. Substantial reconfiguration is also needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/11">In other parts of the country, it has been well recognised that estate design can contribute greatly to problems of crime. Steps have been taken to remove rat runs, block off walkways and provide people with defensible space around their homes. Recently, councillors have been told that emergency repairs only will be carried out because of the need to focus on reducing the number of voids. Emergency repairs are extremely inefficient because they mean that planned maintenance does not get done. If they are dealt with on a call-out basis, they are also extremely expensive, which leads to a reduction in the number of repairs that are completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/12">Another big problem is that of homelessness. The CPA assessment of the housing department commended the council's housing and money advice service. Indeed, I used to refer homeless constituents to that service. Unfortunately, it was closed down, and homeless applicants now simply get referred to a general one-stop shop. The results for people with some of the most complex needs are truly appalling. Women who are fleeing domestic violence do not want to set out their concerns over a general counter in front of whoever else happens to be there. Therefore, they do not get the priority that they should be accorded under our homelessness legislation, which was hailed as such a milestone in supporting homeless people and in tackling real social problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/13">Housing options interviews, which should be carried out after needs assessments to see if people can be housed in the private sector, are being used crudely to direct people into private sector housing that they cannot manage. For example, a pregnant and homeless 16-year-old girl who had spent a week applying for housing and being sent off to stay with friends for the night was then put into a bed-and-breakfast hostel in the red-light district. However, the hostel did not provide breakfast and the girl had a packet of Coco Pops in her little room, which she ate before she set off for school. She was then offered a two-bedroomed private rented flat, but her housing benefit would not cover the rent. I do not know how a young girl, newly homeless and pregnant and still at school, was supposed to manage a six-month tenancy without security of tenure and without the necessary money to pay the rent. There appeared to be no joint working with other agencies, so the girl's midwife had no idea where she was. Her school, which could not get any response from the council, contacted me.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/14">Recently, a young girl who had fled domestic violence with her child applied for housing and was told that she was intentionally homeless. She did not know how to get a review or how to appeal the decision. She moved in with her parents and has now ended up in a six-month tenancy with her parents having to pay the deposit and about a third of the rent each month. That type of position is not financially sustainable and puts the young woman and her child in a revolving door of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/15">People suffering racial harassment have an equally difficult time in getting the type of professional support that I had thought was now routine. For example, a woman of Somali origin has had her car attacked and has been followed to the shops by a gang of youths who shouted racist abuse at her and her eight-year-old child. When she went to the council, she was told that it would be years before she could get a move.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/16">I note that the 2006 inspection report criticised the housing department's record on diversity, yet with an increasingly diverse community, it is even more important that systems are in place to ensure that this dimension of housing is given due attention. That includes the need to provide proper support for people with disability needs. I recall one woman who came to see me because she had been promised a stair lift, two years before, so that she could get upstairs to the bathroom. Meanwhile, she was still sleeping in her front room in which she had a commode, and she washed in the kitchen sink.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/17">We all know that estate management contributes to antisocial behaviour. An area that is run down, in which the planting is not maintained, the footpaths are not cleared and graffiti is left in place, attracts vandalism and crime. That is especially true in the eastern district of my constituency, where there is a major need for improved estate management, particularly of tree growth. The enthusiastic landscape planners who designed the estates planted too many trees and the wrong type of trees. They have confessed to that now. The result for many people is not enough light coming into their homes, and damp and damage from tree roots. In one instance, a branch fell on to a family's home and demolished a child's bedroom&mdash;fortunately during the daytime. It also means there are a lot of overgrown areas that harbour vandalism and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/18">On the Blackthorn estate in my constituency, the residents campaigned to get improvements and got the then Labour-controlled council to set up a special multi-agency project to tackle antisocial behaviour. That included blocking off rat runs, providing play areas in empty spaces and managing some of the more difficult tenancies. They found that a quarter of all local crimes were committed by children from one single family. People should not have to tolerate that type of severe antisocial behaviour from council tenants without the council taking action to enforce the tenancy conditions and ensure that people behave in a reasonable manner towards their neighbours. What happened on the Blackthorn estate shows what can be done if action to tackle antisocial behaviour is taken by all the agencies, not just the police, particularly on housing management. In cases in which a service is deteriorating, people plead a lack of resources, yet there are wasted resources in the council's area.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/19">There are three hostel-type units for single people in my constituency. They are completely counter-productive. Local authorities have a responsibility to advise and assist but, ultimately, not to house single people unless they are in some other way vulnerable. The duty is to house people who are vulnerable, in particular families with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/20">The three hostels have become havens for some of the most appalling antisocial behaviour, drug dealing and violence. In many of the bedsits, the single tenants have long since become families. It is not unusual to find a couple and their child or even children living in a tiny bedsit. Successive council administrations have failed to take action over the hostels, in particular to convert them to family housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/21">We are now 10 years into a Labour Government and just under three years off the target date for the decent homes standard programme, yet the reality for many of my constituents in Northampton who are dependent on the council for housing is that they find themselves trapped in steadily decaying housing stock. Those who look to the council, as they are perfectly entitled to do, for support and help and also housing find that they are turned away or life is made very difficult and they are refused help.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/22">Over the years, the council has shed many of its responsibilities. It lost its road maintenance service, which was taken back by the county council because of the borough's poor performance. It lost its planning functions to the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, which now also manages regeneration. It seems recently to have lost two of its major public events to the local rugby club. Housing is one of the few functions remaining to it, and it is easily the one that is most critical to the well-being of my constituents. I therefore ask the Minister to ensure that the regional office intervenes quickly and decisively to get improvements in housing services for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/23">The window of opportunity for large-scale public sector investment in social housing is likely to close without my constituents seeing any benefit at all. The target date for the decent homes standard programme will have come and gone, but the council will still be arguing over whether repairs and housing services should be run from one depot or another. My constituents cannot continue to wait indefinitely. The excuses have been that elections were just coming up, or that a new chief executive was just starting, yet two council elections have come and gone with changes of control, and two new chief executives have come and gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/24">Frankly, I do not think that my constituents should have to wait any longer. In 21st century Britain, it is completely wrong that people should have to live in homes where green mould grows on their belongings, where they cannot walk across the estate without their child being called all the racist names under the sun, or where they have to go for months without a bath because they have no way of getting upstairs. I completely recognise that it is down to the council to deal with such problems, but, at the end of the day, the Government also have a responsibility to ensure that people get decent housing, as is their right. In this case, the council either cannot or will not get its houses in order, so I ask my hon. Friend to ensure that the regional office intervenes in the interests of my constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.1/1">I am always happy to meet hon. Members and their constituents. I shall talk to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing about that, but certainly I would be prepared to meet the hon. Gentleman, his parliamentary colleagues and some of his constituents to discuss these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/2">The hon. Member for Ceredigion referred to the three-month consultation on formula grant distribution that took place over the summer and closed in mid-October. The consultation was preceded by several meetings of the police allocation formula working group, a Home Office-chaired group that includes representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities, which considered possible changes to the funding formula. I will say, slightly defensively, that one member of the group was the director of finance and resources for Dyfed-Powys, so the hon. Gentleman can be sure that the interests of his local force were properly represented in that forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/3">We received responses from most police forces or authorities, including from three of the Welsh forces, which I hope provides some reassurance that the consultation included consultation with and representations from Welsh forces. We have considered very carefully the representations from all police stakeholders received in response to the public consultation. That includes the representations from the Welsh forces, including those from the former chief constable of Dyfed-Powys. We have noted his concerns, particularly about sweeping rule 2 grants, which are specific to rural policing, into the general pot. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the Dyfed-Powys police force has a particular interest in the rural policing fund. That is not surprising, because with 4,225 square miles, it covers the largest area of any force in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/4">Let me be clear: the purpose of the consultation paper was not to disadvantage rural authorities. Our intention was to take the views of the police service on a range of options. One of those was to ensure that we were using the most up-to-date data in calculating the police funding formula. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues talked about ensuring that we use the correct data.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/5">The other option concerned ways to convert funding from specific grants, which can be used for a specific purpose, to general grant, which can be spent at the discretion of police authorities. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, there is a tension between grants for specific purposes, which in many respects people like because they say that the money goes to an earmarked pot&mdash;a specific thing&mdash;and the representations that we often receive from the APA and chief constables that that money should not be ring-fenced, and that it should all be put in a general pot so that it can be used in the way that they feel is appropriate in their local area. There is a balance to strike between those two positions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.184.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" colnum="184"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0012.htm#07112172000690">
	<p pid="a.184.1/1">The only reassurance that I can give the hon. Gentleman is that we have heard the point about the importance of the specific grant for rural policing for the huge areas of Dyfed-Powys and of some other forces in England and Wales. We have heard the representations, and we are considering them alongside others.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/2">Hon. Members will have to wait until the police funding settlement announcement for the Government's conclusions on the matters about which we consulted. However, in order to reassure the hon. Gentleman, we are not going to implement changes that would jeopardise the stability of the entire finance system for police authorities. As in previous years, the settlement announcement will be followed by a six-week consultation period, and that may be when we should have the meeting that was referred to earlier. We will, of course, take account of any further representations that he or his hon. Friends may wish to make; there will be a further opportunity for the hon. Gentleman to represent his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/3">I know that the hon. Member for Ceredigion is interested in the impact of local tourism, and that he recently tabled parliamentary questions about the use of a tourism indicator. There is little more I can add. The current formula was consulted on in the summer of 2005, and introduced in 2006-07 after a comprehensive review in which representatives from ACPO and the APA were involved. The review concluded that there was no accurate measure of tourism impacts, and it therefore did not include them in the new formula. Dyfed-Powys benefited from the revised formula changes, and its position was further protected by the application of a virtually flat-rate grant increase for all police authorities for both 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/4">One of the real successes of recent years has been the roll-out of neighbourhood policing, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows. However, Dyfed-Powys was one of three forces that were inadvertently disadvantaged by the decision to alter the funding arrangements for community support officers and neighbourhood policing in 2007-08, which was announced in a written ministerial statement by the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase> when he was Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety. The three forces had not previously been able to commit to early acceleration in the roll-out of neighbourhood policing, so made representations that they needed further help to complete neighbourhood policing coverage in their areas. We were pleased to be able to find some money to help them get back on track. For Dyfed-Powys, it amounted to &pound;186,000 towards the cost of an additional 12 PCSOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/5">Finally, I want to say something about force efficiency, to which the hon. Member for Ceredigion referred. Dyfed-Powys has a good record of delivering efficiency gains over and above the targets set since 1999-2000. However, over the coming years, increasing efficiency and productivity will become more important. Forces will have to work together and across communities, and take every opportunity to deliver services more effectively. I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman about good collaboration between the four police forces in Wales and the way in which they are trying to develop that relationship into an ever-closer partnership. Many forces have already gained from working in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/6">I conclude by saying that I am happy to meet the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends in due course. The best time will probably be after the settlement has been announced, when they will be able to see the figures and what has happened. He can then make further representations if he wishes. I say again that Dyfed-Powys has received significant additional money. There will always be a debate about whether more resources are needed and about how they should be deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/7">I am happy to join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating Dyfed-Powys police on its excellent record in financial management and in fighting crime and making people feel safer. Today's debate has been an important contribution to that, and I congratulate the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends on the measured and constructive way in which they put their case.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/9" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at fourteen minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
