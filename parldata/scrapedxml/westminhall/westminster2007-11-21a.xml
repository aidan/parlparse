<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.112.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" speakername="Hugo Swire" colnum="112"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0001.htm#07112172000517">
	<p pid="a.112.1/1">The hon. Lady has quite properly secured her press release for today. If she will bear with me and allow me to develop my thoughts on the levy, I think that I will answer her and she will not be disappointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/2">Pitch positions&mdash;a very important issue&mdash;were covered comprehensively in recent Westminster Hall debates, two of which were instigated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">my right hon. Friend the Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase>, whom I am pleased to see with us t<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">his morning, and one by the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>, who is also present. The issue is now the subject of a hearing of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, so I will not rehearse the arguments this morning. However, I would like to ask a couple of questions relating to pitch positions.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">Does the Minister now admit that before the Gambling Act 2005, list positions were guaranteed by certificates of approval as issued by the levy board? Does he agree that that Act enabled the Racecourse Association to make its announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase> this year to refuse to recognise on-course bookmakers' list positions? Was that an intentional consequence of the legislation?</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/4">The Government's nationalisation of the Tote was profoundly wrong, and what has happened since has been nothing short of a farce. The Government at the time&mdash;it is good to see the previous Minister for Sport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase>, present as well&mdash;gave cast-iron assurances that racing would not lose out from the sale. Initially, Ministers promised that the Tote would be sold only to the Racing Trust for &pound;50 million, but later they gave a pledge that, in the event of its being sold to another buyer, racing would receive half the proceeds from the sale. However, either by conspiracy or cock-up, it transpired that such a move would contravene EU state aid rules. I now understand that PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is advising the Government, has reviewed racing's latest offer of &pound;320 million for the Tote and advised that it risked again being blocked by Brussels. Is that the case? If so, what contingency plan does the Minister have in case the Tote is again not sold? How will the Government honour their manifesto commitment to benefit racing? What compromises have they tried to broker? The Government must now decide the future of the Tote, and an indication from the Minister this morning, setting out once and for all the endgame and a timetable, would benefit all.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/5">When licensed betting operators were legalised in 1961, it was with the proviso that a mechanism should exist to recycle some of the proceeds to racing. The levy, it should be remembered, had two criteria: to meet racing's needs and to take into account the bookmaking industry's ability to pay. As hon. Members are aware, the European Court of Justice ruling on data rights in 2004 prevented an alternative revenue stream for racing from the sale of pre-race data to bookmakers, which might have offered a credible alternative to the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/6">The Government then commissioned Lord Donoughue's future funding of racing review group, which concluded in 2005 that a commercial alternative to the levy would require the Government's intervention to ensure that any sale of picture and pre-race data rights did not fall foul of competition law. Many of us believe that the levy, in its current form, is not the most desirable or even a desirable way of funding racing, but we are where we are.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/7">The Minister must now make a determination for the 47th levy so that racing can plan for its future. He will be more than aware of the robust discussions going on between the bookmakers and the race courses about the levy. Does he share my view that Turf TV is a commercial decision divorced from the levy and does he believe that it would be wrong and not in the best interests of racing if his decision on the levy had the net effect of competition not flourishing? Hon Members will be aware that the major bookmakers believe that the introduction of Turf TV will lead to an increase in their costs. Does the Minister agree that the rationale used by the bookmakers for a &pound;50 million reduction in the levy, from &pound;85 million a year to &pound;30 million a year, was based on the extra costs associated with receiving Turf TV?</p>

	<p pid="a.113.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman brings much more experience to this debate than I. Maybe he has made that calculation; I have not. Suffice it to say that I think that a number of race courses would be left vulnerable if the levy were reduced in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/2">What conversations has the Minister had with the Advertising Standards Authority regarding the initial leaked findings, reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase>, disputing the basis of the bookmakers' figure? Turf TV believes that its product should cost &pound;4 million extra a year for all bookmakers, whereas SIS believes that the cost is closer to &pound;50 million. Does he have a view on that?</p>
	<p pid="a.113.3/3">As I said, the Minister must now decide the level of the 47th levy. Does he not agree that the best thing for racing would be to leave the levy at the same rate? That would undoubtedly fail to please bookmakers and race courses alike, but it would be a credible position for the Government at this time. Once he has made the new determination, will he redouble his efforts to bring all interested parties in racing together to modernise the levy in order to ensure more equitably racing's long-term future? It is an aspiration that should unite us all.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.2/1">Absolutely. It is ruined now.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/2">I want to deal with the poor put-upon pitch bookmakers, but first&mdash;recognising the subject of the debate and the fact that a court case is taking place on which we cannot comment&mdash;I shall refer to an article written by Barry Dennis, the well-known bookmaker from Channel 4. He pointed out in <i>The</i><i>Sun </i>on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-13">13 October</phrase> that he had bet &pound;20,000 with Betfair on a photo finish, the outcome of which he already knew. Within minutes he had earned nearly &pound;2,000. The House needs seriously to look into such practices. Barry Dennis describes them in his article as fraud, and I do not think that that is an unfair description.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/3">I speak in defence of on-course bookmakers, who happily relieved me of all my money at a recent meeting in Ayr. My good friend Frank Carroll managed to pick winners at 33:1, 25:1, 18:1 and 16:1, but sadly I did not listen to him. Bookmakers are important to the colour of horse racing. It is an enjoyable sport. My predecessor Robin Cook said that there were two thumps that he liked: one was the thump of a ballot box on the night of an election, and the other was the thump of horses' hooves at a race meeting. He was well known as a friend of racing, not just in this place but throughout the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase> this year, the Racecourse Association announced that it would confiscate assets from on-course bookmakers to which the race courses had never before expressed a claim. It was a bolt out of the blue. It was commercial opportunism, and I shall explain why. Since 1958, through various regulatory regimes, it has always been understood by all interested parties that list positions were assets held in perpetuity subject to the existence of the race course in question. The letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase> was the first that on-course bookmakers, the National Joint Pitch Council, the body responsible for the administration of list positions as of 1998, or the Horserace Betting Levy Board, the statutory board responsible for awarding certificates of approval&mdash;I agree with the hon. Member for East Devon that there are too many bodies in racing&mdash;had heard of the Racecourses Association's intention to cease to recognise list positions.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.2/5">The chairman of the NJPC said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November</phrase> in a Culture, Media and Sport Committee oral evidence session that he was stunned by the announcement, and the levy board representative declared that he was surprised. Neither body could understand the justification for the RCA's announcement. It had been understood by all parties involved that list positions were held in perpetuity. Not only was it a shock for the bookmakers, but it threatened their livelihood, their retirement and their families. Before the RCA's announcement, the NJPC valued list positions at &pound;70 million. After the announcement, it valued them at &pound;40 million and falling daily. Those assets, bought in good faith, will be rendered worthless by 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">I agree totally. The right hon. Gentleman and I have both been involved in previous debates on the matter in this Chamber, and I think that our views are as one.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/2">Why was the RCA's announcement so surprising? In 1998, the outmoded system of transfer through inheritance, or dead men's shoes as it was called, was replaced by a trading system. On-course bookmakers could finally buy and sell their assets. The post-1998 system was approved and adhered to by all parties involved, including the RCA, which was consulted at every stage of discussions and assented fully to the regime's establishment. Indeed, the race courses benefited from the system, as substantial sums from the commission and sales of list positions were spent on race course improvement. Everybody benefited.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.1/3">Interestingly, at the Select Committee's oral evidence session on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November</phrase>, the RCA said that it was the only party involved in the post-1998 trading system to believe that list positions bought by on-course bookmakers were not assets held in perpetuity.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.115.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" speakername="Jim Devine" colnum="115"  time="009:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0001.htm#07112172000528">
	<p pid="a.115.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, which I may not have included in my speech. It adds to my argument, and I am grateful for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/2">The NJPC, the levy board and, most importantly, bookmakers&mdash;both buyers and sellers&mdash;thought that list positions were held in perpetuity, but the RCA said that it did not. That cannot be so. At the time, race courses had to recognise list positions to receive a certificate of approval from the levy board. The RCA could not have predicted a change in that arrangement. Like all other parties involved, it must have based its decisions on the assumption that the regime established in 1998 would continue. The only change that it might have predicted relates to the five times rule&mdash;the rent&mdash;which is an entirely separate issue. That is an important point. Furthermore, as Tom Clarke, the chairman of the NJPC, said, the RCA did not mention a time limit or raise the issue of list position tenure until the 88th meeting between all the parties involved. I repeat that it was the 88th meeting before the issue was first raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/3">At the meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-07">Wednesday 7 November</phrase> between the Federation of Racecourse Bookmakers and the RCA, held under the Minister's auspices, the FRB asked the RCA to explain the timing of its decision. It asked why the RCA had waited until March 2007 to make the announcement given that, until then, the race courses had been perfectly happy with the status quo&mdash;the post-1998 system&mdash;and had never questioned the tenure of list positions. Something must have changed. In response to that question, one of the RCA representatives explicitly stated that the decision was made in March 2007, just after the new regulations came into force in February. If that is not an admission that the proposed theft&mdash;that is what it is&mdash;of bookmakers' assets had been facilitated by the Gambling Act 2005, then I do not know what is.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/4">It is clear that the Select Committee was thoroughly unimpressed at the Racecourse Association's evidence. Although the other parties that gave evidence, including the NJPC and the levy board, understood that bookmakers held their list positions in perpetuity, the RCA said that it did not, despite having representatives on all statutory bodies. That does no credit to the race courses that are members of the RCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/5">The RCA's chief executive disingenuously referred continually to property rights with regard to list positions, despite knowing full well, because he had been told on a number of occasions, including in front of the Minister, that on-course bookmakers had never argued that list positions conferred a property right. It has been explained to the RCA on numerous occasions that list positions are assets held in perpetuity, subject to the existence of the race course in question. Furthermore, I remind the House that the dispute is over the status of list positions&mdash;bookmakers' assets&mdash;and not the rent. It is important to make that point because of attempts to cloud the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/6">Issue 10 of the RCA's update for racecourses states that the proposal to move the five times rule to commercial arrangements between racecourses and bookmakers was originally made by the Government in March 2003. That statement disingenuously failed to recognise that the position papers of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had recommended movement to commercial arrangements only from the five times rule. The Government's position on list positions, as stated in paragraph 2.6 of the DCMS paper, was that we had already seen the removal of the &quot;dead man's shoes&quot; on horse race courses and a move to fully commercial sale arrangements for pitches. Again, highlighting that point shows that the argument is flawed.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/7">The RCA is effectively advocating the move to fully commercial arrangements, with all the implications that it would involve for racing. I am sure that the House will agree that it is an interesting proposition, as it totally undermines its argument. We already have fully commercial sale arrangements&mdash;on-course bookmakers buy and sell their list positions. The only problem for the RCA is that the race courses are not directly involved in those transactions. They want to be involved. They want more money. That is what they mean by commercial arrangements. However, although wanting more money is acceptable, it does not justify theft.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/8">The RCA is disingenuously attempting to use the umbrella term &quot;commercial arrangements&quot; to refer to both rent and assets when they are and should remain entirely distinct and separate. As the Select Committee pointed out again and again, it is extremely difficult to understand why the race courses could not recognise bookmakers' list positions and at the same time undertake negotiations over the rent. That is what should have happened. On-course bookmakers have always been willing to negotiate over the rent. However, they also want their pitches back. Rent and assets are separate issues. We should not let the Racecourse Association muddy the water.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.3/9">I call upon the race courses to disassociate themselves from the comments and actions of the chief executive of the RCA. I call on the RCA fully to recognise the list positions of on-course bookmakers. Failing that, the Government should bring in secondary legislation that invests the duty of preservation in a statutory body.</p>

I would like to return, however, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the matter mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase> although his exposition of the problems of pitch bookmakers was so full that there is very little that I can add. However, I feel that I must add my weight to his cause, particularly in the interests of constituents of mine such as the Morrill family and Adrian Pariser.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/2">Surely the current situation that many in the trackside betting industry find themselves in was never intended when the Gambling Act 2005 was first proposed, and it is important to look at the specific matter of trackside list positions and their future allocation. Obviously, the gambling industry as a whole has undergone immense change over the past few years. I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> because I think that it is completely different from the inherited system that has damaged the livelihoods of constituents of mine and of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1499" name="Iain Duncan Smith">the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green (Mr. Duncan Smith)</phrase> who has done so much to highlight the problems in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/3">Throughout the many changes, however, the horse racing industry has shown a willingness to reform. Outmoded practices, such as the notion of an inherited seniority being handed down from parent to child have now given way to the trading of assets in a free and open market. The opening of trade in pick-list positions has led to much-needed fresh blood and new investment in the racing industry, but that fresh blood itself is now feeling let down and abandoned by the industry, because those people are now being told that the pick positions, in which they invested so much money, are no longer theirs. Most in the industry would agree that changes made in recent years to modernise it have been of immense benefit to all parties concerned, until now perhaps.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/4">The RCA will continue to argue, of course, that because it owns the physical asset, it is up to it to determine, by whatever means it sees fit, who trades there. However, we must say also that the pick position is merely the order in which a bookmaker can choose their position of trade on the race course, and not an actual physical pitch position. That distinction is obviously important to the RCA, but I suggest that the argument is deliberately two-dimensional in its thinking. An asset does not need to be physical. For example, a CD manufacturer does not own the music that it presses on to plastic. Already, we have agreed on, and spent many hours debating in this place, the concept of intellectual property. I argue also that there is such a thing as moral property, which is what the bookmaker owns.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/5">The RCA clearly recognises the accrued value of a bookmaker's position on a pick-list, otherwise why would it be attempting to wrestle the control of the pick-list away from the bookmakers? Although it has always been acknowledged, ever since the 2001 gambling review report, that negotiations would take place on admissions charges for bookmakers to race courses, as my hon. Friend the Member for Livingston has mentioned, the tenure of list positions was never in question until March this year, despite numerous&mdash;88&mdash;meetings on the subject. It has always been understood by the buyer, seller and administrator that list positions were to be held in perpetuity.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/6">The decision of the RCA to lay claim to the commercial benefits to be gained by the auction of valuable pitch positions has, as we have heard, stunned the National Joint Pitch Council, which set it up in the first place. It is quite disingenuous for the RCA to argue back in 2001, and then in 2003, that the Government advocated a change in the arrangement for pitch allocations and a move to commercial arrangements. It is a short-term smash and grab. I believe that the Government had no such intention, and that that is an interpretation of the 2005 Act, which serves only to increase the commercial gain of the RCA, at the expense of the very people and businesses without which there would be no trackside betting industry&mdash;in other words, the very people and business that, together with the trainers and jockeys, give the entire industry its flavour and value.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/7">Indeed, the Government's recommendations went only as far as a change to the five-time rule. That refers to the rent of the pitch, not to the asset itself&mdash;the moral property. There is no reason why commercial arrangements by the RCA about the rent cannot take place while recognising the bookmakers' list positions, as it has always done. The RCA, again disingenuously, is attempting to use the umbrella term &quot;commercial arrangements&quot; to refer to both the rent and the assets, when, in fact, they are, always have been, and should remain entirely distinct and separate.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/8">We are talking essentially about the livelihoods of hundreds of people in our gaming sector, but particularly about the family bookmakers, as we heard during the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport sittings, which many Members present attended. The family bookmakers have spent generations in the industry, and my constituents who trade under the name, Taffy, have been hit by a triple whammy: first, over the father-child rule, secondly over pitch allocations and sales, about which I cannot go into detail because of actions taken by the right hon. Member for Chingford and Woodford Green, and finally, over losing the last thing that they possess&mdash;their pitch position. The family have been hit three times within one generation, but the measure will affect small rather than large bookmakers. Large bookmakers will also be damaged, but they have large assets, and we are discussing small, family firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/9">Trackside bookmakers are asking for nothing more than clarity about the assets that they have accrued either through generations of hard work or by commercial acquisition. Let us not forget that some bookmakers in the south-east have spent more than &pound;1 million buying something that they believed they would hold in perpetuity. We want those assets to continue to be recognised as the industry standard, as all concerned have always understood them to be&mdash;that is until suddenly last March when the bombshell was dropped on the bookmakers.</p>
	<p pid="a.122.0/10">For the RCA to use the period of transition between the passing of the Gambling Act 2005 and its implementation as a means to wrest control of the assets of hundreds of trackside bookmakers is a blatant misinterpretation of the Act as it was intended. We have it in our power to set out in clear guidelines for both the RCA and the bookmakers precisely which areas are open to reform under the new legislation, and which areas are not. We, as legislators, have a responsibility to take any misinterpretation of legislation on board and clarify it, not leave it entirely up to the industry. Until the guidance is made clear, the trackside betting industry will remain at an effective standstill. Until we clearly define the parameters of the 2005 Act, many in the industry will not know whether their most important commercial asset, which involves the future of their children and their business, is to be rendered entirely worthless. The situation is entirely unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the hon. Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> on securing the debate, and all right hon. and hon. Members who have contributed to what has been a stimulating discussion. I also join many of those who paid tribute to Tristram Ricketts. He will be sadly missed by racing. Were he with us today, he would remind us how important racing is to the economy, that almost 20,000 people are employed directly by it and that if we take all the satellite industries, including betting, into account, the figure rises to almost 100,000 people. He would also, no doubt, remind us of the study by Deloitte last year, which demonstrated that its contribution to the economy overall is nearly &pound;3 billion, and of the nearly &pound;300 million that is paid annually in taxation into the Treasury's coffers. More importantly, he would point out how popular racing is with the people of this country. It is the second most popular sport to football, with some 6 million people attending race courses last year alone. Of course, he would remind us that we are the envy of the world because we undoubtedly have the best racing. Eight of the 12 top races are held in this country and even today the nation stops for some of those races&mdash;for example, the grand national.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/2">Racing is critical. However, we are talking about the future and, in that respect, it is important to recognise that we have a new regulatory body. I am delighted by the work that has been done in such a short time by the British Horseracing Authority, which is working on some innovative ideas for the timetabling of racing that will be of enormous benefit to the betting industry: if there are more races, there is more opportunity for it to make profits. That should be borne in mind in some of our future debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/3">The BHA has also been building on work that has been done, including work to improve the security and integrity of the sport. We should not forget the huge costs borne by the racing industry in terms of guaranteeing the integrity of racing. Some &pound;24 million a year is spent in that particular endeavour. However, many other activities are engaged in, including&mdash;importantly, but so far not referred to&mdash;education and training and the welfare of jockeys, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1644" name="Celia Barlow">the hon. Member for Hove (Ms Barlow)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/4">We have to bear in mind that racing has huge costs, and it is important to take that into account when considering issues such as the levy or the future of the Tote. If we want a bright future for a sport that is already successful, we have to ensure that it has the resources coming into it to enable it to develop and grow and to deal with issues including securing the integrity of the sport and increasing prize money, as well as other things that hon. Members mentioned. That is why I am disappointed that the proposal to roll the levy forward for another 12 months&mdash;to give another opportunity for debate about streamlining and modernisation to take place&mdash;has not been possible and that the bookmakers have forced it to determination.</p>
	<p pid="a.127.0/5">We are now in a situation whereby the Secretary of State, for the first time since the 41st scheme back in 2002-03, has to decide how to proceed. I urge him and the Minister to make that determination as quickly as possible. The current scheme runs out on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2008</phrase>. Everybody knows that in planning the future of a significant business, time is needed to get the financial planning right. An early determination, enabling us to know what sum is coming in through the levy, is crucial. It is critical that we get a quick determination by the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that a reduction in the levy would disproportionately hit Scotland hard? Most of the horses are trained in the south of England, which involves transport costs to Scotland, particularly to the race course in Perth in my constituency which is the most northerly in the UK. If there is a reduction levy, there will be a reduction in prize money, which might be a massive disincentive for horse trainers and owners to come to race courses like the one in Perth.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.1/1">If the Tote goes to the open market and one of the major firms buys it, the hon. Gentleman is right: there could be a huge loss of jobs, particularly in the north. I hope that a deal can be found under which it is sold as was originally intended&mdash;he and I served on the Committee dealing with the Horserace Betting and Olympic Lottery Bill&mdash;and goes to a racing consortium so that it is kept within racing. That is what we were promised and what we understood we were signing up to. As I mentioned in an intervention, if it is at all possible I want the Minister to give a commitment that at least 50 per cent. of money from the sale of the Tote will go into racing.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">On the list pitches, I agree with the contributions of the hon. Members for Livingston (Mr. Devine) and for Hove. Everybody that I have talked to is convinced that that was a separate issue, with the rent on one hand and the asset on the other. There was no understanding that the asset was being given up or that the five times rule was going, with people saying, &quot;Yes, that was understood. It's time to prepare for it.&quot; There was no understanding that the asset was going. I welcome the Minister's trying to knock heads together to find a solution. I know that the Culture, Media and Sport Committee is also considering this issue. I hope that he can give us some information as to what progress is being made. It is critical that we get a solution to that dilemma as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/3">Racing is critically important to this country. It is loved by millions and it has a bright future. However, a number of vital issues have to be resolved. The Minister has got a big job on his plate, because a lot of the decisions fall to him. I wish him the best of luck, but I hope that he will take racing's interests into serious consideration in making his determination.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1391" name="Don Foster">the hon. Member for Bath (Mr. Foster)</phrase>, who, as always, spoke with expertise on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1538" name="Hugo Swire">the matter. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for East Devon (Mr. Swire)</phrase> on securing this timely debate, which has been interesting and stimulating. I join him in paying tribute to Sir Tristram Ricketts, who played such an active role over four decades in the very subject that we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/2">My hon. Friend summed up with clarity the challenges facing the industry. I am grateful for the deluge of material that many of the organisations and parties whose representatives are sitting at the back of the room have sent my way in the past few days. Of course, it is not I who is in a position to resolve the issues but the Government, who have not gained a reputation for decisive action. I am reminded of Shakespeare's famous horse quotation from &quot;Richard III&quot;, of which everyone will be aware. At the battle of Bosworth, Richard III wants to continue the battle and is willing to trade his kingdom for a horse. In contrast, today we have a Minister who wants to avoid the battle completely and runs away from anything to do with horses. The consequences of that have allowed the British horse racing industry to enter a protracted period of confusion. I am, of course, being entirely disingenuous to the current Minister, who has worked hard to get on top of his brief and been approachable and friendly, but it is his watch now and he needs to make amends for the errors of his predecessors.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/3">The Tote has been with us in one form or another since 1928, when it was the Horserace Totaliser Board, to give it its full name. It operates as a bookmaker and offers pool betting on horses. It has been the Government's intention to sell the Tote for some time; we first got a inkling that it might happen way back in May 1999. It was an election pledge in June 2001 and in May 2005, and I am sure that it would have been an election pledge in November 2007 had we had an election. I wonder what the odds are against its appearing again in a manifesto in June 2009 or whenever the election is.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/4">There have been more than seven years of briefing versus counter-briefing, bids agreed then scuppered, prices confirmed then rebuffed, and Government announcements and then retractions. As we have heard, the Opposition fully support the sale of the Tote, but in a timely fashion, as reiterated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1668" name="Ben Wallace">my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Wyre (Mr. Wallace)</phrase>. I asked the Minister in a parliamentary question only two months ago whether the Tote would be sold in the next three months. His reply was that the Government were in advanced stages of discussions. Two months on, will he update us? What are those advanced stages, what value is the Tote now set at, who is leading the consortium to buy it and how much of the money will go back into racing? I understand that Lord Davies of Oldham said in the other place in July that the cost of trying to sort out the sale of the Tote had already climbed to &pound;2 million. Will the Minister confirm exactly what the cost to the taxpayer is? I am sure that it is in our interests to find out.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/5">The horse racing levy is the agreed annual amount paid by bookmakers to race courses, and it goes towards such things as prize money, the grass roots of the sport, veterinary skills and so forth. It is valued between &pound;85 million and &pound;90 million. As was stated in Lord Donoughue's study for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, which has been referred to several times, all sides agree that the levy should eventually be phased out and replaced with a commercial alternative. Unfortunately, by the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-31">31 October</phrase>, racing and the bookmakers had failed to reach an agreement on the 2008-09 levy, meaning that determination now falls to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/6">The sticking point, as we have heard, is commercial television rights. Traditionally, horse race footage has been beamed into betting shops by SIS, which is predominantly owned by a number of the large bookmakers, including William Hill and Ladbrokes. Turf TV, a new race course broadcaster, has been established and signed up to by about half the race courses. That means that bookmakers must now have two contracts, with SIS and with Turf TV, if they are to show the full complement of racing on offer in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/7">The two sides of the argument have been well rehearsed: one either supports the levy and says that it should be reduced to compensate for the funds earned by Turf TV, or says that it should remain and that broadcasting rights are separate from any discussions about the levy itself. Sadly, Lord Donoughue could not find a solution, but it was established that all parties agreed to the long-term aim of abolishing the levy and replacing it with a commercial alternative. I was pleased to hear from the British Horseracing Authority in meetings yesterday that it agreed to a wider modernisation review of the levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1872" name="Laurence Robertson">My hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr. Robertson)</phrase> reiterated the points about the duplication of costs. Does the Minister agree that, with a long-term commercial solution required, running two broadcasting systems needs to be reviewed if funding to support the racing industry is to be maximised while bookmakers are offered an attractive deal? Alternatively, does he believe that horse racing can receive the critical financial support that it needs with the broadcasting monopoly broken up? I look forward to his response, as I understand that he is already starting talks with an independent organisation to mediate between the groups. What are his views on the short-term requirement to sort out the levy for this year and the long-term challenge of resolving and removing it?</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/9">The final act in the Government's three-ring circus of equine confusion, if I may call it that, is the issue of bookmakers' course pitches at race meetings. For many years, bookmakers had assumed that their pitches on race courses were theirs to use or sell on. Their value hinged on the so-called list system, reflecting the greater choice of pitches for people higher up the list. Location is critical, as it is linked directly to the amount of revenue that a bookmaker might receive. Charges to bookmakers were limited to five times the entry fee of the course, which changed in 2003 following a position paper from the Department. The change modernised the charges but there was no agreement on changes to list positions, which had been traded for some value for many years. Along came the Gambling Act 2005, which removed the responsibility for track betting licences from the Horserace Betting Levy Board and gave it to local authorities, with no longer any mention of list positions. That was the fundamental flaw in the 2005 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/10">The Racecourse Association was quick to announce that, by 2012, bookmakers' list positions would no longer be recognised. There seems to be no official documentation showing that pitch ownership was ever to be in perpetuity, but conversely I understand that there is also no official documentation showing that it was not. That is a complete legislative nightmare. How on earth did we get there? It certainly seems that the sport of kings is being managed by a Ministry of court jesters.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/11">What action is the Minister taking, and what time scale is he adopting? What parties and intermediaries are being involved? Does he believe, for example, that race courses should take a small percentage of bookmakers' profits provided that there is a fairer charge, linked to earnings, so relinquishing the need to interfere with the list? Will he be using section 151(2) of the 2005 Act, which allows the Secretary of State directly to influence the form and contents of premises licences?</p>
	<p pid="a.129.2/12">We have heard a number of eloquent speeches, and everyone has joined in supporting the industry. We can rightly be proud of horse racing in the UK, and certainly of its role in the economy. It is a multi-billion pound industry with more than 9,000 races a year, including eight of the top, world-class races. However, that position is not guaranteed. We need better co-operation within the industry and stronger leadership from the Government. I hope that the Minister will not duck his responsibility to help to resolve the concerns that we have debated, which affect the horse racing industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I understand and share many of my hon. Friend's concerns. Let me set out the Government's position. We do not want to pre-judge what the determination will be, but we hope to announce it early in the new year to meet the requests of hon. Members. The levy has only just gone to determination, and we have not yet appointed consultants to assist the Secretary of State in his deliberations. However, my predecessor and my officials have followed the levy board's discussions closely and we are fully aware of the importance of having fair and timely outcomes for the racing industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/2">I confirm that, in line with the recommendations of the future funding of racing review group, which my hon. Friend Lord Donoughue chaired in 2005, we still plan to review the workings of the levy scheme to see whether there is any way in which the machinery can be streamlined and simplified. I hope that the levy board will share the burden of that work with my Department. Obviously, that review can happen only when the 47th levy is determined. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">my predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase>, told the House late last year, we have no plans to abolish the levy until a viable commercial alternative emerges.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.1/1">That is an important point. First, let us make the determination. We need to do that quickly for the reasons that have been outlined. Again, I agree with the hon. Member for Tewkesbury: we ought to look at the options that are available to us if that is not successful. I am happy to give the commitment that we will do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/2">The Select Committee is looking into pitch tenure. I want to resolve the matter. We have set up a working group with an independent chair. We want to ensure that all sides of the argument, including the race courses and bookmakers, benefit from such a group. It is important to do that rather than going to law. People in racing tend to go to law very quickly, whether it be Turf TV or because of pitch tenure, which incurs huge cost. However, that money could go into racing, and we want to ensure that it is spent wisely for the future of racing.</p>
	<p pid="a.135.1/3">Hon. Members raised a number of points that I will cannot respond to in the time left. However, I will put in writing to those who have attended the debate the details on the questions that were asked. I urge that there are more debates on horse racing, that we look with interest at the work of the all-party group on horse racing and that we try to meet the challenges together. I accept that politics sometimes comes into play, but I hope that that will not prevent us from working together for racing's benefit.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.137.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1768" speakername="Stephen Crabb" colnum="137"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0005.htm#07112172000570">
	<p pid="a.137.3/1">That is an important intervention. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that we should not see customs cover as ultimately separate from the wider security arrangements. If Lord Carlisle made that judgment about Holyhead, I am very pleased, but the police and customs officers to whom I spoke said that there was significant concern about ports across Wales generally and the weakness of customs cover at them.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/2">What are the practical consequences of this state of affairs? First, at the same time that customs cover has been eroded, there has been a fall in the overall volume of drugs seized by customs. There is no evidence to suggest that the decline in seizures is because of a decline in the overall trade. The success of the Serious Organised Crime Agency last May in preventing what would have been the largest ever shipment of cocaine across the Atlantic into Wales via the Pembrokeshire coast is a stark warning of the scale of the threat that still exists.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/3">The failure of the current strategy is borne out by figures that were provided to me by the PCS union. They show a strong correlation between the decline in the amount of drugs seized by customs in the past three years and a fall in the street prices of various popular drugs during the same period. The amount of cocaine seized last year was less than one third of that seized just three years previously: 5,800 kg in 2005-06 compared with more than 20,000 kg in 2003-04. Over the same period, the per gram street price of cocaine dropped sharply. The figures for heroin, cannabis, ecstasy and crack cocaine all show the same relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/4">Those drugs are having a devastating impact on many communities in Wales. The police tell me that they are particularly concerned about the cheap heroin flooding into south and west Wales. We need to be careful about implying that a correlation means causation, but there is no doubt in my mind that the drop in customs seizures as a result of the removal of permanent customs cover at Welsh ports is allowing a greater flow of illegal drugs into Wales through Welsh ports, and that that is a contributory factor to the overall drugs problem in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/5">In the past year, we have marked the bicentenary of the Act abolishing the transatlantic slave trade. There has been a strong focus on human trafficking as one of the modern forms of slavery that needs to be stamped out. We know that the UK, with its booming illegal sex industry controlled by criminal gangs, is now a major destination for girls and young women being trafficked from eastern Europe, south-east Asia and north and west Africa. We should not engage in the fantasy that the victims of this grotesque trade are to be found only in London. A recent report on trafficking by Amnesty International suggested that Wales is now also home to a &quot;sophisticated and extensive&quot; trade in humans. Amnesty estimates that there are some 60 to 100 victims in Cardiff at any one time and, in a series of major police raids on massage parlours in Cardiff, Swansea and Bridgend last year, the vast majority of prostitutes discovered were illegal immigrants. There was a strong suspicion that many had been trafficked. It is obviously hard to quantify numbers because the trade is hidden, but outreach workers assisting sex workers in Cardiff report that about 50 per cent. of the girls and women they meet are foreign, and they believe that many of those girls have been trafficked.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/6">There is little strong evidence to suggest or to prove that many of those girls are being trafficked through Welsh ports as opposed to reaching Wales via England, but I have spoken to police and customs officers who tell me that they are concerned that girls and young women are being trafficked through Welsh ports. It was suggested to me that the route into the UK from Europe and North Africa via northern Spain and Ireland into Welsh ports is increasingly seen by traffickers as a less risky route than the traditional route from the continent via the south-east ports.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/7">This is a timely discussion, given the Prime Minister's announcement last week of a new UK border agency. His promise of an integrated system is welcome, but restructuring institutions and reshuffling personnel is not the whole story, and the resourcing issue must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.137.3/8">I opened my comments by referring gently to the calamitous news that broke yesterday about the missing child benefit claimant records. It would not be right for me to score cheap points about that&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.145.6/1">I am not attacking Northern Ireland, Wales or Scotland. I wish to see public expenditure, which is directed on a per capita basis towards a person in Glasgow, Cardiff or Belfast when it comes to health or education, determined on the same basis in all the four home countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.6/2">Having tabled early-day motion 402, I found out that an official from No. 10 Downing street was going round to signatories and, without telling me, was asking them to withdraw their names from the motion because of the sensitivity of the issue. That was a profoundly wrong way for No. 10 officials to behave; such issues are better aired in public debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.6/3">The Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions that he does not believe in a review, but I hope that we can change his mind. I listened carefully to his answer to the question on the Barnett formula today, and I am not sure in what sense he meant that the formula applied to England. It was based either on an obtuse understanding of the Barnett formula or he missed the point. Effectively, the formula applies at the margin and is based on an increase in expenditure in England, not previous expenditure, which is multiplied by a comparability factor of the population. I do not see what the Prime Minister meant when he said that the formula applies to England, apart from the fact that the calculation starts with England. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1428" name="Ronnie Campbell">My hon.

	<p pid="a.147.1/2">Last year, disposable household income in Scotland was &pound;11,753, which is &pound;1,000 greater than in the north-east of England.

	<p pid="a.148.1/1">No, I absolutely do not take that view. Not for the first time is a Conservative party proposal unworkable. It does not deal with the real issue, which is that the situation of people living in Leeds or Birmingham in terms of their influence on local policies on health and transport is very similar to that of people in Scotland. Rather than creating a completely unworkable situation in the House of Commons in which there are different classes of Members, it would be better to devolve issues down to local democracy. I do not accept the point that the hon. Gentleman makes.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/2">The example that I have given illustrates the fact that the English regions are not just competing with London, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland for resources, but are left out of the complete calculation. That is why, when I walk down the streets in Manchester, although people do not say that the Barnett formula is wrong, they do come up to me and say, &quot;Why does my daughter have to pay tuition fees in England, whereas if we lived in Scotland, she wouldn't?&quot; They go through a series of issues&mdash;hon. Members will be aware of them&mdash;from being able to get cancer drugs in Scotland that are not available elsewhere, to the care of the elderly&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I hear hon. Members saying from a sedentary position that that is to do with the Scottish Parliament, but the fact is that the Scottish Parliament, without raising a penny in taxes, can spend money at a higher rate than is the case in England. The whole basis of this debate is to ask for a review so that there is an equitable basis for funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/3">I am part of a campaign, with a number of hon. Members from all parties, to try to secure a referendum on the Lisbon treaty or reform treaty or whatever the European constitution is called at the moment. The basis of that is trust: what people say to the electorate should be carried through. What is often not talked about is that in national elections, there is a corrosive effect, certainly within the three major parties, in terms of how they campaign at national level and in the different countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.148.1/4">I have searched through the manifestos of the Conservative party, the Lib Dems and the Labour party, and there is no mention in the last three manifestos of all those parties for the United Kingdom&mdash;in the Great Britain manifestos, to be precise&mdash;of the Barnett formula, with one exception. In 2001, the Lib Dems came out against the Barnett formula and were in favour of a review and a fairer basis for funding.</p>

	<p pid="a.149.1/1">I take the hon. Gentleman's point. Of course, the nature of devolution is that there will be policies at elections in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland that relate to those countries, but where there are issues of taxation and expenditure, there is no doubt that the Barnett formula applies to England and has consequences in England. It is very strange, unhealthy and corrosive that it was possible for the previous Prime Minister to go to the Lighthouse in Glasgow on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-13">13 April</phrase> and say what a great thing the Barnett formula was, whereas it was not mentioned in our 2005 manifesto. That is the real point I am making. There is a level of unintended dishonesty, in that the Conservative party, the Lib Dem party and the Labour party would not campaign hard on what a great thing the Barnett formula is in England, and that needs exposing.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.5/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1704" name="Graham Stringer">the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley (Graham Stringer)</phrase> for bringing this debate into the open. It has been hidden for too long. I speak on behalf of a borough that is regularly listed among the 10 most deprived areas in Britain and has been so for a long time. The needs-based formula must be debated; it is no good hiding from it. The Welsh Assembly Government recently voted that that should happen, and we should take our lead from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/2">In Blaenau Gwent, one of the poorest boroughs, we also have one of the highest rates of council tax in Wales, if not the highest. Once a borough is poor, it is extremely difficult to escape from that position. Settlements come down from either London or the Cardiff Government, but our uplift is also among the lowest in Wales. The spiral of deprivation, in which a borough continues to be poor, is difficult to escape. A needs-based formula might have to be based in part on population, but to hide from the debate is not the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.5/3">The Government introduced European objective 1 funding, which was seen as a means of lifting people out of poverty. The problem is that it cannot be used for statutory responsibility, so the funding does not help to lift boroughs out of their real problem, which is statutory funding and statutory responsibility. European funding is also project-based, not long term, and that is another worry&mdash;it can disappear as quickly as it is given. It is important that we consider the needs of every area and region in this country, and not in isolation.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Atkinson; that is what I am talking about. The Barnett formula was an agreement made between Parliaments down here. When I make an agreement with someone I like to stick to it. If we had stuck to it, and merging had taken place over time as was supposed to happen with the Barnett formula, we would not be having this discussion. However, the Conservative party&mdash;whose spokesman will unfortunately speak later&mdash;let go of the formula from 1979 to 1992 without doing anything about it. If merging had occurred as was supposed to happen, the Barnett formula might have converged by now, or at least we might be contemplating that in the near future. Once again, a political party unfortunately did not do what it was supposed to. It wanted votes north of the border. Well, it got the votes it deserved, with two Members in the last three general elections. That says it all.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/2">As a trade unionist, which I have been all my working life, I have been expected, by the members whom I have always looked after and supported, to deliver as I have said I would. Those expectations extend to the Barnett formula. The fact is that Scotland delivers quite a lot to the United Kingdom. We also have added problems that other areas of the United Kingdom do not have. We have talked of the rural areas and the highlands and islands, and the poverty in some of our inner cities, which is as great as in any inner city in the world in a nation that professes to be a civilized part of western democracy. However, there is at present an alliance between the Conservative party, which I now call the English national party, because that is what it now is, the Scottish National party, which is well known north of the border as the tartan Tories, and the Welsh nationalists, who, I am informed by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd, who is not in his place at the moment, are called the daffodil Tories. That speaks for itself. [<i>Interruption.</i>]</p>
	<p pid="a.160.1/3">I am somewhat disappointed in nationalist Members. I sat in silence while the Plaid Cymru spokesman did his eight minutes and I never interrupted him with a word. All that they have done this afternoon&mdash;and this is a shining example of how the nationalists conduct themselves throughout the country&mdash;is shout people down when they do not agree with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.164.1/1">We could probably have a complicated debate about the mathematics, but I do not think that this is the time or place to do that given the time available.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/2">Clearly, there is a legitimate question here that cannot simply be ignored, and it is more complex than some, such as Ken Livingstone, sometimes like to present it as. Let us get the matter into perspective. The figure often quoted in the media is for a &pound;1,500 gap between England and Scotland, but almost certainly that exaggerates the effect, because if we exclude spending on social services, which is not subject to the Barnett formula and is intrinsically need-reflective, the difference is less than &pound;1,000. Furthermore, any alternative system almost certainly would have to be based either on fiscal autonomy&mdash;Scottish taxes for Scottish spending&mdash;or on an updated needs-based formula applied to all four countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/3">It is not at all clear that a needs-based distribution formula would eliminate the differential between England and Scotland, as some appear to suggest, and spending in the English regions, as has been mentioned by a number of hon. Members, varies enormously already, with public sector activity accounting for nearly 60 per cent. of the economy in the north-east, but little more than 30 per cent. in the south-east. So for those of us who wish to strengthen the Union and who are wary, therefore, of the fiscal autonomy solution, it is not clear that a revision of the formula on a needs basis would produce the results that the hon. Member for Manchester, Blackley and others seem to assume.</p>
	<p pid="a.164.1/4">Let me be clear where the Conservative party stands. We are not considering changes to the Barnett formula, but we recognise a growing body of opinion that questions the settlement. It is legitimate to ask whether the formula, which has served the UK well, is best suited to dealing with the distribution of public spending in the future. That is a long-term question that might well need to be addressed. However, it must be placed in context, which I shall come to in just a moment.</p>

	<p pid="a.167.1/1">The Barnett formula seeks to allocate increases in what are known as departmental expenditure limits based initially on English departmental allocations and it seeks to ensure that the increases in DEL, rather than annually managed expenditure, are conveyed fairly on a per-population basis to the devolved authorities, which are allocated their spending through a block grant. In England, each part of public expenditure that is departmentally limited is allocated departmentally rather than on a block basis. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I have explained that annually managed expenditure, such as social security, that is allocated on a demand basis is not part of the Barnett formula. The formula allocates Department expenditure-limited moneys that are in some ways devolved or not devolved, as the case may be, to Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. It is a needs-based formula for financial allocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.167.1/2">The Barnett formula does not determine annually managed expenditure; its needs-based allocations are included in the limits, which hon. Members use to say that there was unfairness, whereas it distributes only part of total managed expenditure, which is known as DEL, rather than annually managed expenditure.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.1/1">In respect of the Barnett formula, the issue is whether such moneys are devolved or not and, if they are, by what percentage they are devolved. That is the technical mathematics involved in all this. If money is distributed, it is because the policy is nationally determined and therefore the devolved Administrations are allocated their percentage of it on a population basis. It is purely about whether it is a devolved matter or not. Since Crossrail is not a devolved matter, that is why the distribution was made.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.169.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1741" speakername="Sally Keeble" colnum="169"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0009.htm#07112172000671">
	<p pid="a.169.2/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to debate housing in Northampton, which is the largest town in the UK and one of its most successful. It is in the Government growth area and has a successful economy, an incredibly high level of employment and a high level of home ownership. Most people in Northampton aspire to home ownership, and until recently house prices were low enough to make it a realistic option for almost all working families. Government plans for the growth area include the provision of 37,000 more homes, one third of which are to be affordable and a quarter to be social housing. All that is successful and should continue to be so, with people buying decent quality homes and building solid communities in which to bring up their families. That is what makes my constituency so special and puts the values of people there at the core of our country's success.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/2">What I wish to deal with in the debate is different, however: the provision of social housing by Northampton borough council&mdash;some 13,500 housing units in total, including a big block of new town housing from the previous big planned growth in Northampton in the 1970s. As every hon. Member knows, good quality social housing is central to the well-being of some of the more disadvantaged people in our constituencies. All of us deal with housing issues at our advice surgeries and visit the estates in our areas. We all know the hardship caused to people if they are homeless, if their homes are in disrepair, if they do not get the aids and adaptations that they need or if their estates become plagued by antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/3">In my constituency, over 12 years of campaigning first as a candidate and then as an MP, I can honestly say that I have seen a real deterioration in the quality of life of many of my constituents in council housing. That has been despite the Government's commitment to the decent homes standards and to driving up council performance, and it has happened under all types of political control. When I first became an MP, we were in control at the Guildhall and there were some difficulties. Then in 2003, the Conservative party got minority control of the council and, to my surprise, things went downhill seriously. In the most recent elections, the Liberal Democrats got majority control, and things have got considerably worse to the extent that housing now far outstrips everything else in my constituency case load.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/4">I wish to emphasise that the problems are not because of the shortcomings of individual staff, who mostly do a good, straightforward job, but because of the council's strategic management and leadership. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will point to the most recent comprehensive performance assessment report, which shows some improvements. However, the main improvement is what the report calls &quot;stronger political leadership&quot;, which, to be honest, is to a great extent an obvious result of having a majority party administration as the result of one party getting an outright majority at the council elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/5">The reality for my constituents, who depend on the council's housing services, is that things have got much worse. Over 10 years, the council's housing stock, which should have improved under the national decent homes programme, has simply got 10 years more dilapidated. Homeless people have been driven into the inadequate private sector of rented housing; people with special needs, such as domestic violence victims or those waiting for aids and adaptations, have gone unheeded; and antisocial behaviour, which is the ultimate plague of badly managed housing stock, has made life a particular misery on some estates. The most recent assessment of housing services by the Audit Commission found that Northampton provided a poor housing service with uncertain prospects for improvement. Uncertain the prospects were indeed, because they have not improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/6">On disrepair, the council's housing stock condition survey found that about a third of the borough's housing was in need of improvement to bring it up to the decent homes standard. However, the CPA's overall assessment of the council's performance found that although it had identified funds to bring the properties up to standard, there was a &quot;very high risk&quot; that the council will fail to meet the decent homes standard by 2010. It also found that although the council had made regular statements that its ambition is to achieve the decent homes standard, they amount to aspirations and not realistic, robust and deliverable objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/7">Between 2004-05 and 2005-06, the number of council properties that were deemed unfit fell by only 3 per cent. from 28.7 to 25 per cent. By my reckoning, therefore, it will take a further eight years to achieve the decent homes standard, which well misses the Government's targets. That does not take into account the fact that some of the property is deteriorating at a substantial rate without receiving any kind of planned maintenance check from the council.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/8">We are now less than three years away from the 2010 decent homes target. The experience of my constituents, which is reflected through my advice surgeries and my visits to their homes, is that some properties are deteriorating very quickly. The upgrading programmes taking place up and down the country, which my hon. Friend the Minister must see when he looks at housing programmes, is simply not happening in Northampton. People come to my advice surgeries carrying plastic bags with belongings covered in green mould. On one estate, a woman, her husband and two children are unable to use one of their two bedrooms because of the damp and have had to throw away clothes affected by mould.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/9">I cannot tell you the number of times, Mr. Atkinson, that I have visited homes to see the extent of the disrepair to find water pooling on floors and walls covered with mould. On one estate, I found little stalactites and stalagmites growing in the walkways as a result of long-term structural disrepair. In one home, I knelt down on the carpet to look at some mould on the wall in a corner of the room. When I got up, my clothes were soaking wet, as the carpet was completely sodden. Some properties are permeated by the smell of damp, and parents complain that their children have chest infections.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/10">On one estate, partially completed repairs programmes had left serious holes and disrepair that had not been dealt with for many years. In the eastern Newtown district, major improvements are needed to housing that was not particularly well built to start with and that has deteriorated markedly in the past decade. Substantial reconfiguration is also needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/11">In other parts of the country, it has been well recognised that estate design can contribute greatly to problems of crime. Steps have been taken to remove rat runs, block off walkways and provide people with defensible space around their homes. Recently, councillors have been told that emergency repairs only will be carried out because of the need to focus on reducing the number of voids. Emergency repairs are extremely inefficient because they mean that planned maintenance does not get done. If they are dealt with on a call-out basis, they are also extremely expensive, which leads to a reduction in the number of repairs that are completed.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/12">Another big problem is that of homelessness. The CPA assessment of the housing department commended the council's housing and money advice service. Indeed, I used to refer homeless constituents to that service. Unfortunately, it was closed down, and homeless applicants now simply get referred to a general one-stop shop. The results for people with some of the most complex needs are truly appalling. Women who are fleeing domestic violence do not want to set out their concerns over a general counter in front of whoever else happens to be there. Therefore, they do not get the priority that they should be accorded under our homelessness legislation, which was hailed as such a milestone in supporting homeless people and in tackling real social problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/13">Housing options interviews, which should be carried out after needs assessments to see if people can be housed in the private sector, are being used crudely to direct people into private sector housing that they cannot manage. For example, a pregnant and homeless 16-year-old girl who had spent a week applying for housing and being sent off to stay with friends for the night was then put into a bed-and-breakfast hostel in the red-light district. However, the hostel did not provide breakfast and the girl had a packet of Coco Pops in her little room, which she ate before she set off for school. She was then offered a two-bedroomed private rented flat, but her housing benefit would not cover the rent. I do not know how a young girl, newly homeless and pregnant and still at school, was supposed to manage a six-month tenancy without security of tenure and without the necessary money to pay the rent. There appeared to be no joint working with other agencies, so the girl's midwife had no idea where she was. Her school, which could not get any response from the council, contacted me.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/14">Recently, a young girl who had fled domestic violence with her child applied for housing and was told that she was intentionally homeless. She did not know how to get a review or how to appeal the decision. She moved in with her parents and has now ended up in a six-month tenancy with her parents having to pay the deposit and about a third of the rent each month. That type of position is not financially sustainable and puts the young woman and her child in a revolving door of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/15">People suffering racial harassment have an equally difficult time in getting the type of professional support that I had thought was now routine. For example, a woman of Somali origin has had her car attacked and has been followed to the shops by a gang of youths who shouted racist abuse at her and her eight-year-old child. When she went to the council, she was told that it would be years before she could get a move.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/16">I note that the 2006 inspection report criticised the housing department's record on diversity, yet with an increasingly diverse community, it is even more important that systems are in place to ensure that this dimension of housing is given due attention. That includes the need to provide proper support for people with disability needs. I recall one woman who came to see me because she had been promised a stair lift, two years before, so that she could get upstairs to the bathroom. Meanwhile, she was still sleeping in her front room in which she had a commode, and she washed in the kitchen sink.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/17">We all know that estate management contributes to antisocial behaviour. An area that is run down, in which the planting is not maintained, the footpaths are not cleared and graffiti is left in place, attracts vandalism and crime. That is especially true in the eastern district of my constituency, where there is a major need for improved estate management, particularly of tree growth. The enthusiastic landscape planners who designed the estates planted too many trees and the wrong type of trees. They have confessed to that now. The result for many people is not enough light coming into their homes, and damp and damage from tree roots. In one instance, a branch fell on to a family's home and demolished a child's bedroom&mdash;fortunately during the daytime. It also means there are a lot of overgrown areas that harbour vandalism and antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/18">On the Blackthorn estate in my constituency, the residents campaigned to get improvements and got the then Labour-controlled council to set up a special multi-agency project to tackle antisocial behaviour. That included blocking off rat runs, providing play areas in empty spaces and managing some of the more difficult tenancies. They found that a quarter of all local crimes were committed by children from one single family. People should not have to tolerate that type of severe antisocial behaviour from council tenants without the council taking action to enforce the tenancy conditions and ensure that people behave in a reasonable manner towards their neighbours. What happened on the Blackthorn estate shows what can be done if action to tackle antisocial behaviour is taken by all the agencies, not just the police, particularly on housing management. In cases in which a service is deteriorating, people plead a lack of resources, yet there are wasted resources in the council's area.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/19">There are three hostel-type units for single people in my constituency. They are completely counter-productive. Local authorities have a responsibility to advise and assist but, ultimately, not to house single people unless they are in some other way vulnerable. The duty is to house people who are vulnerable, in particular families with children.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/20">The three hostels have become havens for some of the most appalling antisocial behaviour, drug dealing and violence. In many of the bedsits, the single tenants have long since become families. It is not unusual to find a couple and their child or even children living in a tiny bedsit. Successive council administrations have failed to take action over the hostels, in particular to convert them to family housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/21">We are now 10 years into a Labour Government and just under three years off the target date for the decent homes standard programme, yet the reality for many of my constituents in Northampton who are dependent on the council for housing is that they find themselves trapped in steadily decaying housing stock. Those who look to the council, as they are perfectly entitled to do, for support and help and also housing find that they are turned away or life is made very difficult and they are refused help.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/22">Over the years, the council has shed many of its responsibilities. It lost its road maintenance service, which was taken back by the county council because of the borough's poor performance. It lost its planning functions to the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, which now also manages regeneration. It seems recently to have lost two of its major public events to the local rugby club. Housing is one of the few functions remaining to it, and it is easily the one that is most critical to the well-being of my constituents. I therefore ask the Minister to ensure that the regional office intervenes quickly and decisively to get improvements in housing services for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/23">The window of opportunity for large-scale public sector investment in social housing is likely to close without my constituents seeing any benefit at all. The target date for the decent homes standard programme will have come and gone, but the council will still be arguing over whether repairs and housing services should be run from one depot or another. My constituents cannot continue to wait indefinitely. The excuses have been that elections were just coming up, or that a new chief executive was just starting, yet two council elections have come and gone with changes of control, and two new chief executives have come and gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.169.2/24">Frankly, I do not think that my constituents should have to wait any longer. In 21st century Britain, it is completely wrong that people should have to live in homes where green mould grows on their belongings, where they cannot walk across the estate without their child being called all the racist names under the sun, or where they have to go for months without a bath because they have no way of getting upstairs. I completely recognise that it is down to the council to deal with such problems, but, at the end of the day, the Government also have a responsibility to ensure that people get decent housing, as is their right. In this case, the council either cannot or will not get its houses in order, so I ask my hon. Friend to ensure that the regional office intervenes in the interests of my constituents.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.182.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="182"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0011.htm#07112172000686">
	<p pid="a.182.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1489" name="Mark Williams">the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mark Williams)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the measured but powerful way in which he made his case, which was extremely helpful. He has some of the other Welsh Members from the area with him, including the hon. Members for Carmarthen, East and Dinefwr (Adam Price) and for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams). May I also say how much I welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1720" name="Lembit pik">the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase>? He and I have spent many hours together in various Northern Ireland Committees and on various pieces of Northern Ireland business. I am very pleased that all those hon. Members are present. They are all assiduous in campaigning for their constituents. Whatever the political differences between us, the reason that they are all here this afternoon is to do what they can to ensure that their constituents have the best possible service. I commend them for that, particularly the hon. Member for Ceredigion.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/2">I shall start by setting out the context and the existing situation. Since 1997, the Dyfed-Powys police force, like every other police force in England and Wales, has received substantial and significant increases in Government grant. In the past decade, Dyfed-Powys has seen a 20 per cent. increase in real terms in central Government grant. That is a huge investment in local policing. Dyfed-Powys police force is receiving &pound;51.8 million in general grant this year&mdash;an increase of 3.6 per cent. from 2006-07. That is in line with the broadly flat rate increase of 3.6 per cent. for all forces in England and Wales. On top of the general grant, Dyfed-Powys will receive about &pound;13 million from a range of other Government funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/3">I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman recognises that the product of that significant investment from both central and local resources is clear. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-31">31 March</phrase> this year, Dyfed-Powys had 1,177 police officers, compared with 1,005 10 years ago&mdash;an increase of 172, which is 17 per cent. The number of support staff had grown from 322 to 594&mdash;an increase of 272, which is virtually 85 per cent. All those extra support staff help to release more officers for front-line duties, where we all want to see them. They are also supported by 77 police community support officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/4">I very much welcomed the intervention by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire. PCSOs will do sterling work not only in the constituency of the hon. Member for Ceredigion, but in constituencies in the rest of the Dyfed-Powys area, the rest of Wales and, indeed, in England. We need to demonstrate continually our support for them. They do a different job from that of police officers, but they do an excellent job, for which I am sure that most of our constituents are very grateful, so I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman intervened on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/5">Let us not focus just on inputs. In 2006-7, total recorded crime was down, violent crime was down and burglary was down from the year before. Like the hon. Member for Ceredigion and the other hon. Members, I pay tribute to all those in Dyfed-Powys police whose efforts have contributed to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/6">Dyfed-Powys police have been supported by the funding floor for many years to ensure that they have had year-on-year increases in grant. This year, Dyfed-Powys police are receiving &pound;4.5 million more than their strict police funding formula allocation. Part of that additional money comes from grant that would otherwise go to South Wales police, but the vast bulk of the support for Dyfed-Powys&mdash;&pound;3.6 million&mdash;comes from additional money provided by the Home Office from outside the general grant settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.182.0/7">I have set all that out to establish the context and to make clear the situation of Dyfed-Powys. However, I know that the hon. Member for Ceredigion is keen to look to the future. As the hon. Member for Montgomeryshire will know, normally I try to answer specifically the questions that are raised, so I apologise that I cannot be as specific today as I would normally be in such a debate. I hope that the hon. Member for Ceredigion will find in the future that when I answer questions as a Minister, I actually try to answer the question. However, I cannot do that at present, for which I apologise. He will appreciate that we will be announcing very shortly details of the police funding settlement for the next three years, so I cannot give details today, much as I would like to pre-empt that announcement. Obviously, he would like to know about all of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.183.1/1">I am always happy to meet hon. Members and their constituents. I shall talk to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing about that, but certainly I would be prepared to meet the hon. Gentleman, his parliamentary colleagues and some of his constituents to discuss these matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/2">The hon. Member for Ceredigion referred to the three-month consultation on formula grant distribution that took place over the summer and closed in mid-October. The consultation was preceded by several meetings of the police allocation formula working group, a Home Office-chaired group that includes representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities, which considered possible changes to the funding formula. I will say, slightly defensively, that one member of the group was the director of finance and resources for Dyfed-Powys, so the hon. Gentleman can be sure that the interests of his local force were properly represented in that forum.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/3">We received responses from most police forces or authorities, including from three of the Welsh forces, which I hope provides some reassurance that the consultation included consultation with and representations from Welsh forces. We have considered very carefully the representations from all police stakeholders received in response to the public consultation. That includes the representations from the Welsh forces, including those from the former chief constable of Dyfed-Powys. We have noted his concerns, particularly about sweeping rule 2 grants, which are specific to rural policing, into the general pot. As the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the Dyfed-Powys police force has a particular interest in the rural policing fund. That is not surprising, because with 4,225 square miles, it covers the largest area of any force in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/4">Let me be clear: the purpose of the consultation paper was not to disadvantage rural authorities. Our intention was to take the views of the police service on a range of options. One of those was to ensure that we were using the most up-to-date data in calculating the police funding formula. The hon. Gentleman and his colleagues talked about ensuring that we use the correct data.</p>
	<p pid="a.183.1/5">The other option concerned ways to convert funding from specific grants, which can be used for a specific purpose, to general grant, which can be spent at the discretion of police authorities. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, there is a tension between grants for specific purposes, which in many respects people like because they say that the money goes to an earmarked pot&mdash;a specific thing&mdash;and the representations that we often receive from the APA and chief constables that that money should not be ring-fenced, and that it should all be put in a general pot so that it can be used in the way that they feel is appropriate in their local area. There is a balance to strike between those two positions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-11-21a.184.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" colnum="184"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm071121/halltext/71121h0012.htm#07112172000690">
	<p pid="a.184.1/1">The only reassurance that I can give the hon. Gentleman is that we have heard the point about the importance of the specific grant for rural policing for the huge areas of Dyfed-Powys and of some other forces in England and Wales. We have heard the representations, and we are considering them alongside others.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/2">Hon. Members will have to wait until the police funding settlement announcement for the Government's conclusions on the matters about which we consulted. However, in order to reassure the hon. Gentleman, we are not going to implement changes that would jeopardise the stability of the entire finance system for police authorities. As in previous years, the settlement announcement will be followed by a six-week consultation period, and that may be when we should have the meeting that was referred to earlier. We will, of course, take account of any further representations that he or his hon. Friends may wish to make; there will be a further opportunity for the hon. Gentleman to represent his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/3">I know that the hon. Member for Ceredigion is interested in the impact of local tourism, and that he recently tabled parliamentary questions about the use of a tourism indicator. There is little more I can add. The current formula was consulted on in the summer of 2005, and introduced in 2006-07 after a comprehensive review in which representatives from ACPO and the APA were involved. The review concluded that there was no accurate measure of tourism impacts, and it therefore did not include them in the new formula. Dyfed-Powys benefited from the revised formula changes, and its position was further protected by the application of a virtually flat-rate grant increase for all police authorities for both 2006-07 and 2007-08.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/4">One of the real successes of recent years has been the roll-out of neighbourhood policing, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman knows. However, Dyfed-Powys was one of three forces that were inadvertently disadvantaged by the decision to alter the funding arrangements for community support officers and neighbourhood policing in 2007-08, which was announced in a written ministerial statement by the Minister for Security, Counter-Terrorism, Crime and Policing, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1618" name="Tony McNulty">my right hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty)</phrase> when he was Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety. The three forces had not previously been able to commit to early acceleration in the roll-out of neighbourhood policing, so made representations that they needed further help to complete neighbourhood policing coverage in their areas. We were pleased to be able to find some money to help them get back on track. For Dyfed-Powys, it amounted to &pound;186,000 towards the cost of an additional 12 PCSOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/5">Finally, I want to say something about force efficiency, to which the hon. Member for Ceredigion referred. Dyfed-Powys has a good record of delivering efficiency gains over and above the targets set since 1999-2000. However, over the coming years, increasing efficiency and productivity will become more important. Forces will have to work together and across communities, and take every opportunity to deliver services more effectively. I take the point made by the hon. Gentleman about good collaboration between the four police forces in Wales and the way in which they are trying to develop that relationship into an ever-closer partnership. Many forces have already gained from working in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/6">I conclude by saying that I am happy to meet the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends in due course. The best time will probably be after the settlement has been announced, when they will be able to see the figures and what has happened. He can then make further representations if he wishes. I say again that Dyfed-Powys has received significant additional money. There will always be a debate about whether more resources are needed and about how they should be deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/7">I am happy to join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating Dyfed-Powys police on its excellent record in financial management and in fighting crime and making people feel safer. Today's debate has been an important contribution to that, and I congratulate the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Friends on the measured and constructive way in which they put their case.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to</p>
	<p pid="a.184.1/9" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at fourteen minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
