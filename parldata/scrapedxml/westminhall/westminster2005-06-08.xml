<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.125.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="125"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h01.htm#50608h01_spnew0">
	<p pid=".125.3/1">I am grateful to Mr. Speaker for this invaluable opportunity. During my 13 years in the House I cannot remember having an Adjournment debate that has attracted more interest in the outside world. That is a measure of the concern that is now felt throughout the land about the Licensing Act 2003.</p>
	<p pid=".125.3/2" class="indent">&quot;In my view, we are in danger of having a wholly disproportionate attitude to the risks we should expect to run as a normal part of life. This is putting pressure on policymaking, not just in government but in regulatory bodies, on local government, public services, in Europe and across parts of the private sector&mdash;to act to eliminate risk in a way that is out of all proportion to the potential damage. The result is a plethora of rules, guidelines and responses to 'scandals' of one nature or another that ends up having utterly perverse consequences.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".125.3/3">Those are not my words; they are those of the Prime Minister during one of his first major speeches since the general election, at the Institute for Public Policy Research on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-26">26 May</phrase>. What a relief it was to discover that he is indeed thinking what I have been thinking for a long time. Understandable concern about antisocial behaviour that is fuelled by alcohol in our towns and cities is having &quot;perverse consequences&quot; for local communities. The Prime Minister gave the example of a village in the Cotswolds that had to remove a seesaw with an unblemished safety record because it fell foul of an EU directive on playground equipment for outside use.</p>
	<p pid=".125.3/4">The Licensing Act means that villages in every corner of the country, not just in the Cotswolds, will say goodbye to the traditional touring circus, see more village shops go to the wall, watch local sports clubs forgoing much-needed income and lose their village halls, despite no accidents, no antisocial behaviour and nothing worrying having occurred in, outside or even remotely close to them.</p>

	<p pid=".126.1/1">On village halls, does my hon. Friend agree with the correspondents who have written to me from the management committees of Dickleburgh and Morley St. Botolph village halls in my constituency that the Act is confusing and is likely to put some halls out of action? Does not it suggest a lack of understanding by the Government of the problems facing rural areas?</p>
</speech>
<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.126.2" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08a.126.2" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.126.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="126"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h01.htm#50608h01_spnew5">
	<p pid=".126.2/1">There is consensus among those of us who are worried about the Act, and my hon. Friend summarised some of the points that I want to make towards the end of my speech about the impact of the Act, particularly on village halls. I entirely agree with what he said.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/2">It would have been good to have had a reply to my letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-10">10 March</phrase> to the Minister who was then responsible for the Act. I raised serious concerns on behalf of Wychavon district council about the publication of application forms, regulations and fees and on communication between the Department and local authorities. In light of the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">Saturday 6 August</phrase> there should be serious concern about the low rate of response for applications to convert existing licences. It seems that there will be a late rush and woe betide anyone who submits their application too late for it to be checked.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/3">Errors mean rejection and the burden and cost of a brand new application, copied with all supporting documentation to seven other regulatory bodies and advertised expensively in local papers. Local authorities that have received a significant number of applications are having to reject many of them because of inaccuracies. That is fine now because there is time to put the matter right, but it will be a problem if an application is made too close to the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">6 August</phrase>. The Department has not done enough to publicise that important date and, as a result, even commercial organisations, never mind the volunteers who run village halls, are cutting it fine.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/4">My first main point concerns circuses. I had a full debate on the subject in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-27">27 April</phrase> last year. I shall not rehearse all that I said then, but for the benefit of the new Minister I repeat that circuses, which already bear a heavy burden of legislative inspection to protect public safety, are perfectly happy to adapt to a new licensing regime. However, the cost and bureaucratic rigidity of the proposal may make touring with a circus virtually impossible. Local communities, often small villages, for which the only live performing art that ever comes near them is the circus, will lose out and a great British invention will be put in jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/5">The root of the problem is that the Government told circuses that they would be exempted from the legislation but broke their word and took no account of the needs of circuses. Fairgrounds were exempted; I have struggled for months to understand the logic in that but cannot begin to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/6">I have had two meetings with representatives of the circus industry and the previous Minister. I was encouraged by what I thought was the growing understanding in the Department, but nothing has happened to address the concerns expressed and, as implementation of the Act draws closer, the situation is getting much worse.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/7">The Minister advocated that local authorities should license land on which circuses could then perform without an additional licence. Leaving aside the fact that many circuses rely on private, not public, land for their sites, that idea seemed worth exploring, but local authorities have taken a different view of the Act. Following a decision by West Berkshire council, all applications by circuses to other councils have been refused. A precedent has been set which other licensing officers, who are lost in a vacuum until new procedures are set, have been only too ready to follow. On <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-28">Thursday 28 April</phrase>, the licensing sub-committee of West Berkshire council dealt a potentially fatal blow to the Government's cunning attempt to find a way out of the mess that they had created.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/8">In the words of the circus concerned:</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/9" class="indent">&quot;Two objections to licences for a circus&mdash;from the parish council and the fire brigade&mdash;were satisfactorily dealt with but the licences were still refused because a plan of the premises was not submitted as required by section 17(3) of the Act and the application did not comply with regulation 23 of the Act (which deals with the nature of plan required).&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/10">The circus told me:</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/11" class="indent">&quot;Our intention is to hold Premises Licences for circus venues without specifying a detailed plan of the circus . . . in the application. In this way, the licence can exist unchanged for the future. Safety authorities have been satisfied with our voluntary condition to supply a detailed plan 28 days in advance of each circus visit.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/12" class="indent">The West Berkshire sub-committee considers the Act is prescriptive in requiring a detailed plan with the application. As well as the circus tent, the plan must include locations of exits, details of fire safety equipment, furniture, items in fixed locations like seating and the circus ring, which is likely to include major props or rigging e.g. safety net, tight-wire etc. The same will apply to many other events where equipment is installed, which might include staging, safety barriers etc.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/13" class="indent">A licence granted would therefore only be valid as long as nothing in the plan was changed. The layout of any circus is likely to change annually for example when equipment is updated, when a new act installs a major prop, and when new legislation requires it.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/14" class="indent">The new applications we have so far made have cost an average of &pound;500 each. For a circus visiting 40 venues each season, this is a considerable outlay. While it will be possible to retain the licence and apply for a licence variation to accommodate the changes, the procedure for obtaining a variation is almost as involved as a new application.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/15">That problem is common with village halls. The circus continued:</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/16" class="indent">&quot;If a detailed plan is required, it will not be possible for a local authority to hold a licence. This does not only apply to circuses: every separate event in a local park or any other area will need its own licence for each individual event. Thus the DCMS objective for Local Authorities to license their own land cannot be achieved in the light of this judgement.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/17">I believe that a legal challenge is planned, but I could not obtain up-to-date information and it may even have happened. What a mess the Government have got us into; it is even worse than we predicted. I wrote to the Minister last week asking for a meeting to discuss the specific issue and I hope that he will agree to meet a small delegation from the circus world before we rise for the summer recess. After all, the problem now goes beyond circuses to all activities that take place on local authority land.</p>
	<p pid=".126.2/18">In that context it is worth mentioning just how worried are the organisers of local festivals such as the Bromyard gala. The complexity of the rules and how to avoid punitive licence fees of many thousands of pounds for these events are matters that tax the ingenuity of very professional organisers. I think that I am right in saying that if a band plays at the gala from the bandstand but there are no chairs in front of it, that is fine, but if chairs are put there and people listen, it becomes a licensable event. The location of the bandstand in relation to the beer tent is a matter of great importance in determining what licence is required and how much it costs. What a farce.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.130.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" speakername="Peter Luff" colnum="130"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h01.htm#50608h01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".130.1/1">It is fair to say that of the representatives of the 12 village halls in the room for that meeting, one left after five or 10 minutes because their hall was so small that it was not affected by the Act, but theirs was a particularly small hall. The other 11 were all terrified by what faced them, and I entirely agree with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/2">The old system worked well. It was easy to apply for a community premises licence costing only &pound;27, and for a series of occasional licences costing only &pound;10 and valid for up to 12 events. It ain't broke, so why are we fixing it? The more we delved into the process, the more problems we discovered. To start with, apparently, and bizarrely&mdash;the Minister may put me right on this&mdash;the safety requirements of the new licences are less onerous than those of the old ones because electrical and fire safety certificates no longer have to be produced.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/3">When it comes to licences for alcohol, it is only the sale of alcohol that is controlled. A wedding reception where the booze is free does not need a licence, but one with a cash bar does. In theory, I know which of those is more likely to lead to public disorder: the one where price is not rationing consumption.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/4">The essence of the problem is threefold. First, the cost of the new licensing regime is much higher. An application fee for a typical hall is around &pound;190&mdash;it could be much higher for a bigger hall&mdash;plus about &pound;60 to add alcohol to the licence, which is waived if the application is received and approved before <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">6 August</phrase>. Moreover, for a typical hall&mdash;again, it could be much larger&mdash;there is an annual fee of around &pound;180. If one wants a variation at a later date, there is the huge cost of advertising and sending all the relevant documentation to seven different public bodies. That advertising has to be expensive advertising in local papers covering a wide area, not affordable, or perhaps even free, advertising in the local parish newsletter or magazine that covers the area the hall actually serves.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/5">Secondly, there is the bureaucratic nightmare. The forms are complicated and the conditions difficult to understand. For the volunteers who run village halls that alone is bad enough. In fact, one person at the meeting admitted that she had just thrown the forms away because she could not understand them. She took another set as the meeting ended.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/6">Thirdly, and perhaps most worryingly of all, there is the huge burden of responsibility that must be borne by one person, the designated premises supervisor, if the hall decides to put alcohol on its licence. That one, named person, who must be trained at a cost of at least &pound;100, probably more, and then pay his or her own licence fee too, will bear responsibility for ensuring that the terms of the licence are complied with and will face criminal sanctions if they are not.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/7">With many halls having 30 or 40 licensable events a year, and the busier halls having up to 80, that is an intolerable burden. It is difficult enough to find volunteers to run village halls as it is without that burden; this is now a job that no one in their right mind would volunteer for. What a way to celebrate the year of the volunteer.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/8">Another possibility is to hand over the running of the bar to the local publican, who will supply trained staff and take a good cut of any profits&mdash;hardly an attractive option, given the tight budgets with which village hall committees, and all the other people and voluntary groups who use the halls, have to work. Another alternative is to restrict the number of events to 12 over a maximum of 15 days by using temporary event notices. However, that will sharply reduce the rental income of many halls below the level of viability. As Crowle village hall told me:</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/9" class="indent">&quot;The limitation of twelve TENs per calendar year is the key problem in our particular case. We hold some 26 events per annum involving the sale of alcohol. The letting income from these events is a significant part of our total income. We cannot afford to discard this source of income so we must accept the additional cost of the Act and raise our letting rates to cover the increase.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/10">Temporary event notices are needed to modify any term of a new licence, not just to sell alcohol. If, for some reason, one wants a later night for the village pantomime than the standard licence allows, that is one of the 12 TENs gone. If the application goes beyond midnight, that takes two TEN days out of the total allowance of 15, not one, because anything after midnight is counted as a new day.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/11">If someone were to decide not to put alcohol on the new premises licence because they expected to rely on 12 TENs for the events that they organised, what would happen if someone who hired the hall took the TEN for his event? The premises will have lost one of those nights, which will put the holder of the licence in real trouble.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/12">Another constituent, Peter Charlesworth, wrote to me:</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The law is now so expensive, time consuming and complex that really it is not worth the effort for many small organisations to bother to try and fund raise. There will be no profit at the end of the day. The income for both organisation and Hall will suffer . . . If the local publican becomes the licensed premises controller, many of the village functions will be too small to warrant carrying alcohol and employing staff. He will refuse to support the event. The function will then be either illegal or will not happen . . . Many small functions which attract only a few people, to get a TEN, will have administrative costs of nearly &pound;2.00 per head&mdash;a lot out of a &pound;4.00 ticket.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/14">That is the problem for small communities and events. The Government just have not understood it.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/15">It is not just village halls, by the way; I am told that even farmers markets are at risk for similar reasons. It seems that if wine is sold&mdash;I am sure that we all want to encourage English wines&mdash;those markets will need a full licence, and all the burden of cost, bureaucracy and responsibility that applies to village halls will apply to them too. That reminds me: it is not even clear how the new Act affects the traditional bottle stall at a village f&ecirc;te, another great English tradition that is apparently under threat from unthinking regulation.</p>
	<p pid=".130.1/16">There are similar problems for sports clubs. They have faced a raft of expensive legislation, much of which is justified, such as that dealing with child welfare, health and safety, and new electrical requirements&mdash;the list goes on. Now they are faced with the Licensing Act. Richard Wood, the chairman of Ombersley cricket club in my constituency, tells me that the club has 120 juniors who play cricket and 80 who play football, with a further 100 senior members for cricket and bowls, and 300-plus social members and parents. The bar is a major source of income for the club and largely funds all the junior activities. In fact, it represents more than half of the total income of the club.</p>

	<p pid=".132.1/1">I am hugely encouraged, and I am glad that I gave way to my hon. Friend because the figure that he gave is exactly the figure that Ombersley cricket club quoted to me. It says that the licence is so central to its functions that it will have to use professional advice to shape its application. It cannot afford to get it wrong. It reckons that, taking the professional advice and fees together, the cost will be &pound;1,000. To be fair, Richard Wood tells me:</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The bottom line is that the club can afford to pay this money, but it's money that won't then be available for equipment and machinery to support the junior boys and girls playing football and cricket.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/3">For many village halls, the Act could be the kiss of death. For many sports clubs, it is a brutal kick in the teeth.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/4">What is to be done? Of course, few local communities will suffer each of these hammer blows, but every child who loses the opportunity to see traditional live entertainment at a circus will have missed out on something very valuable. Every village shop that is forced to put up the shutters for the last time takes something precious from the community that it served. Every sports club that restricts its activities with young people will cause deep sadness among those who understand the value of encouraging sporting activity, and every village hall that curtails its activities, or even closes, strikes a real blow to the sense of community that makes England's villages what they still are.</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/5" class="indent">&quot;There is usually a seductive logic to any new regulation. There is almost always a case that can be made for each specific instrument. The problem is cumulative. All these good intentions can add up to a large expense, with suffocating effects. Sometimes, we need to pause for a moment and think whether we will not do more damage with a hasty response than was done by the problem itself.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/6">Again, those are the words of the Prime Minister in the excellent speech that I began by mentioning. There are solutions, such as new exemptions for circuses, small shops, community-based activities and the charitable trusts that often run village halls. That may take primary legislation, but there is now a hole in the Government's programme because we do not have to ratify the European constitution, so there is time for an emergency Bill. I urge the Minister to pause for a moment and think, to quote the Prime Minister,</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/7" class="indent">&quot;whether we will not do more damage&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/8">to local communities</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/9" class="indent">&quot;with a hasty response than was done by the problem itself.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".132.1/10">He must delay the so-called second appointed date, when the legislation goes live&mdash;currently expected to be in November&mdash;and conduct an urgent review of an Act that deserves to be put out of its misery.</p>

	<p pid=".133.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the typical passion and vigour with which he introduced his case. In the few minutes for which I seek the Chamber's attention, I intend to complement what he said by concentrating on pubs and the licensed trade.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/2">I will begin by praising the role of council licensing officers, whom the hon. Gentleman referred to. When I worked in local government some years ago, licensing was relegated to a fairly minor function. I remember that, at Leeds city council, where I worked, it was adjacent to the cemetery section. However, in recent months and years, that has changed. In Selby and York, which are the two councils that I represent, there are two outstanding licensing officers: John Lacy in York and a gentleman by the name of Tim Grogan in Selby, which has caused slight confusion. I know which individual the pubs are most concerned with at the moment and it is not their local MP; it is their licensing officer. Both licensing officers are doing a splendid job. They go around Selby and York, without employing any great bureaucracy, and encourage licence applications to be made.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/3">It is interesting to look at some of the figures in Selby and York. In Selby, of the 400 licensed premises that will need licences, 10 per cent. have passed through the entire system and 75 per cent. of those 40&mdash;30 of them&mdash;have applied for variations on their licences. On the whole, that has been for the odd extra hour, often at weekends. Ten premises have just converted their licences. There has been no need for any hearings in Selby at this stage. Everything has been done through delegated powers. There is a confidence there that the licence applications will be made and that the deadlines will be met.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/4">In York, rather more than one in seven&mdash;107&mdash;of the 725 premises have gone through the system. Forty applied for variations and 67 for direct conversions. There have been three hearings so far in York. There are one or two cause c&eacute;l&egrave;bres, one of which is in my constituency. It will no doubt go to a hearing of the licensing board soon. According to evidence from the parish council, the Charles XII pub, which is in the student area of Heslington, has not been particularly good in its relations with the residents down the years. It has not necessarily adhered to its public entertainment licences and has had people still revelling in the garden after midnight, which is against council regulations.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/5">Given such cases, hon. Members and Ministers can expect that, as with a controversial planning application, there will be local controversy and various factors will need to be weighed at a licensing board. However, from the evidence that I have seen in my local area, it is a misleading characterisation to say that no applications are being made or that licensing boards will not be able to cope with the number of hearings that they will have to hold. Across the swathe of middle England that I represent, people are quietly getting on with implementing the Act. In many cases, there are no objections whatever to variations in hours. As both licensing officers remind me, the councils in Selby and York, like all councils, have strong powers to bear down on pubs that abuse the extra hours that they are granted, and no doubt they will use them. I am encouraged by that.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/6">I am the chair of the all-party beer group. It is a tough job, but someone has to do it and I hope to be re-elected. Incidentally, I hope that we can maintain our status as the largest all-party group. The annual dinner is coming up in July and prior to that we intend to do a survey of local authorities, on an all-party basis, to look at how many applications they are getting and what problems they are encountering.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/7">In terms of both councils and pub companies, there will be little sympathy&mdash;certainly in the case of the pub companies&mdash;if applications do not go in on time. The pub companies have big resources and they need to get themselves organised, as most of them are, to get their applications in on time. Equally, there will be little sympathy with councils that are over-bureaucratic in their approach to licensing. If they are turning down applications because of minor errors on forms, rather than just making a quick phone call and getting the necessary amendment, people will not sympathise when well known and well run pubs are closed down for a period. There is an onus on both councils and pub companies to make this work, and on the whole they are doing so.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/8">I welcome the Minister to his post. It is good that the licensing function has stayed within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. As a Back Bencher, I can say that the implementation of the Act has not been without problems. There have been creative tensions between the Home Office and the DCMS and that has led to some of the delays. However, I, for one, am pleased that the function is staying at the DCMS. The Home Office sometimes views the licensed trade purely in terms of antisocial behaviour; the function is in the right place.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/9">There is an onus on both the Department and councils to publicise what is going on. The pub companies and big chains will be all right, but there are also smaller, independent pubs, sports clubs, which have been mentioned, and late-night refreshment houses outside London, which will have to apply for licences for the first time. There needs to be an awful lot of publicity and effort over the next few months to generate those licence applications.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/10">There is a related agenda of antisocial behaviour and the various measures that the Home Office is introducing in conjunction with the Act. Some of the measures are very welcome, such as fixed penalty notices for trying to buy alcohol under age or for selling alcohol to people under age, and powers for the police to close down pubs that persistently serve people who are under age. However, I urge Ministers to be careful with the concept of alcohol disorder zones, which was in our little red book&mdash;the manifesto. The implementation of that concept requires great care.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/11">An alcohol disorder zone represents a breakdown in the partnership between the police, the licensed trade and councils in an area. With a levy on licensed premises in an area where there are alcohol disorder problems, the zone could be characterised as a business improvement district in reverse. Is it fair that all licensed premises in a particular area, even those with no record of trouble, have to make a payment? Who decides when an alcohol disorder zone is lifted or imposed? Should the decision be made by the bodies that benefit from the extra revenue? One or two of my colleagues have told me that their town wants to be the first to have an alcohol disorder zone. I again urge caution. The zone would not be a badge of pride, as it could attract the wrong sort of people and destroy a town's reputation for its hospitality industry. The measure should be one of last resort; we should not pepper the country with such zones and impose burdens on well run businesses.</p>
	<p pid=".133.1/12">There is a quiet revolution taking place throughout middle England. People are applying for extra hours, and on the whole they are getting them and no one is objecting. That is good, because of all the nations of Europe, surely it cannot be just the English and the Welsh who cannot be trusted to have a quiet drink after 11 o'clock at night. The day when people can drink after 11 o'clock will come&mdash;hopefully&mdash;in November. The date should not be put back. The pub trade is certainly not asking for either the date in August or the date in November to be put back. Indeed, if it were, it would be a very quiet Christmas and new year in terms of pub opening hours, because the previous provisions would no longer apply. It is essential that those provisions of the Act are introduced on time, and there is every reason to have confidence in their being implemented with good consequences. There will be the odd difficulty and the odd local hearing that causes controversy, but that is as it should be. It puts power in the hands of local people, which is where it should be.</p>

	<p pid=".135.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase>, but I must say to him that it will be a quiet Christmas and new year in many village halls throughout rural England and Wales if we are not careful. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> on securing the debate and on his comments. He covered the ground extremely well. I shall reiterate two areas that he discussed, and I shall mention one other.</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/2">I am no great fan of the Act. When it was introduced I spent quite a lot of time campaigning against it, to the extent that a sort of west country fatwa was declared by the Wurzels, no less, on the then Minister in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">the Department, the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase>, when he made disparaging comments about folk singers in Somerset. At that time we were concentrating largely on the risks to live music.</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/3">I want to discuss the effect of the Act on communities. The Act is having a direct effect on village shops, which stock, as a small part of their business, a few alcoholic beverages. They are sold as a service, more than anything else, to the shop's customers, for which the shop has an off-licence. It is not remotely feasible economically for shops to continue to sell alcoholic beverages under the new licensing regime. It is having a negative effect on villages and on individuals who have to drive to another village or the nearest town to buy drinks, with all the possible dangers that that entails. There is also a danger to the viability of the shop. Those effects are all of very little benefit to the licensing regime, and they run entirely against the principle that we have heard espoused many times in the House of keeping village shops as a viable and visible presence in our villages.</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/4">The threat to village halls that the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire mentioned is serious. I have two examples in my constituency. First, the representatives of a substantial village hall, Beckington memorial hall, have written to me. They are extremely concerned because last year they had 27 events with a licensed bar but this year, because of the way in which the temporary events licensing system works, they are restricted to 12 events. That is having a serious effect on the financing of the hall as a centre for village life, and that is replicated in village halls throughout my constituency.</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/5">Secondly, at the other extreme, a small village hall, the reading room in Charlton Mackrell, does not serve alcoholic beverages. It is a small reading room that was set up by a beneficent incumbent to provide a place for quiet reading and recreation for the village. It holds Women's Institute meetings, parish council meetings, art classes for some elderly residents and a Christmas panto. Its officers have had to go through all the nonsense of paying a surveyor to provide detailed plans of the building to continue their entertainment. They have had to pay for the cost of licensing, and they will have to pay for the recurrent costs of maintaining the licence.</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/6">We are talking about volunteers who run a small premises because they think that it is a vital part of village life. Confronted by two copies of a 21-page form and a further 64 pages of explanatory notes, there comes a point when they say, &quot;Forget it. I'm sorry, but I'm not prepared to spend my life reading explanatory notes rather than doing what I want for the purposes of my village.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/7">My final point is about something that is perhaps unique to Somerset, and something with which many hon. Members may not be familiar. It concerns the Somerset carnival tradition, which has been going for 400 years. The carnival circuit in Somerset is massive, attracting on average 500,000 people a year. The biggest carnival is the Bridgwater carnival, which on its own attracts more than 100,000 people. It is one of the best kept cultural secrets in the country, because people are simply not aware of its scale. When I first came to London and saw the lord mayor's show, I thought, &quot;What on earth is this pathetic excuse for a carnival?&quot;, compared with Bridgwater carnival and the Somerset circuit.</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/8">The carnival circuit is under serious threat from the Act, not because it does not exempt moving vehicles but because carnival comprises not only moving vehicles but walking exhibitors, marching bands and many others for whom it would appear that a licence may be required. The district councils in Somerset have got together this year to try to interpret the law, but they cannot do so. They have taken legal advice, which says that carnival may be all right this year. &quot;May be&quot; is not good enough for the thousands of people throughout Somerset who work all year to prepare the floats. Carnival raises an enormous amount of money, and the licence fee, if required, is &pound;64,000, which will kill carnival stone dead. The councils have asked for guidance from the Department, but it is unable to provide any, other than to say that some carnivals may be exempt but others may not.</p>
	<p pid=".135.0/9">It is not worth the risk of being taken to court because of one person's complaint about the carnival for whatever reason. The organisers risk hefty fines of &pound;20,000, prosecution and a prison sentence of up to six months. Of course people are not prepared to take that risk. We could lose an important and vital tradition in my county, and I am not prepared to stand by and let that happen. I hope that the Minister is today able to provide a definitive view on carnivals. If he cannot, it suggests that there is a gap in the law that must be corrected at the earliest opportunity.</p>

	<p pid=".138.0/1">I shall not attempt to give any more than the briefest history of this wretched legislation, partly because of the time, but also, Mr. Taylor, because I do not wish to try your patience.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> on introducing the debate. As he rightly said, we have all been <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1474" name="Malcolm Moss">here before. Along with my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Cambridgeshire (Mr. Moss)</phrase>, I served on the Standing Committee that considered the Bill. We had a good time talking about the alcohol issues, many of which concern Westminster city council. Many people did not realise the great implications that my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire rightly pointed out for the range of village hall-related events. The issue has the makings of an absolutely horrendous mess. In Committee, we gave repeated and persistent warnings that there were great inconsistencies between the proposed liberalisation of alcohol licensing and the Home Office agenda on binge drinking and antisocial behavi<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">our. What the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> referred to as &quot;creative tensions&quot; are, I fear, somewhat more than that.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/3">The legislation as a whole is unrealistic. It has been driven by the large-scale alcohol and entertainment industry. Even in my constituency, in places such as Soho and Covent Garden, one of the interesting things is that many of the smaller, family-run businesses&mdash;the bars and restaurants that have been around for 50 or 60 years&mdash;are as appalled by the Act as are many of the residential population.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/4">It is impossible for us to Europeanise the drinking habits of people in this country simply by changing the hours of operation. We need only to consider the experience of places such as Scotland and Ireland to realise the impossibility of that goal. I can assume only that the measure was led by the large-scale alcohol and entertainment industry, which rammed it through and probably paid large sums to Government funds. As with the Gambling Act 2005, there was a commitment to try to make radical changes without thinking them through.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/5">We have also seen the undermining of a well-balanced undertakings regime. I have worked closely with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1639" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>, because we share responsibility for part of Covent Garden. In the past, undertakings have been given by a number of pubs, bars and restaurants. That has worked extremely well, but that regime is being swept away and there threatens to be something of a free-for-all that will affect the balance in our neighbourhoods. The issue is not simply one for central London and the hot spots of coastal England; it has an impact throughout the country, along the lines pointed out by my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/6">The new Minister has an opportunity to wield a new broom. I do not think that he realised when he took on the post how the Act was likely to blow up in his face. He may know that, in the last few weeks, I have tabled questions about the flexibility of the new regime and about how much consultation has taken place. It is clear that, when the transition period began in February 2005, there was an opportunity for consultation with local authorities, licensing authorities and people who required licences. At this stage, I am not aware that many changes or recommendations have been made by the Government in consequence.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/7">My view is that, potentially, we have an absolute mess in the making. I would like there to be a delay of at least eight months to allow licensees adequate time to complete the complex and overly prescriptive application procedure that has been dictated by the new Act. The problem is not simply going to occur on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">Saturday 6 August</phrase>; there will be a problem in November. I fear that even local authorities, such as mine in the city of Westminster, that are well organised and used to large-scale and important licensing arrangements will face a massive logjam in the second half of the year. I hope that, even at this late stage, the Government will give serious consideration to delaying implementation to allow for the full implications to be thought through.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1450" name="Madeleine Moon">The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon)</phrase> rightly suggested that, inevitably in any such process, there will be a queue on the final day. My fear is that it will be a hell of a long queue and will have an impact, particularly in this important area, in the run-up to Christmas which could be little short of disastrous. The Government's approach to the start date is hopelessly optimistic. One must consider those local authorities that are less well attuned to such matters, which will find themselves in great difficulties.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/9">The Minister probably now appreciates that, with this Act, he has inherited something of a mess. It has been poorly drafted and has an unrealistic timetable. However, I believe that there is still time for him to take action to prevent something that is not only a public relations disaster in the making but has negative implications.</p>
	<p pid=".138.0/10">I would like to say much more, but I realise that two other hon. Members wish to make contributions. I thank you for your indulgence, Mr. Taylor, and I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire for introducing this vital debate at an important time.</p>

	<p pid=".143.0/1">Like o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">thers, I congratulate the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> on calling for this debate, and on making a powerful contribution. I offer congratulations, too, to all other Members who have spoken. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">The hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> is perhaps more supportive of the legislation than I am; nevertheless, he rightly reminded us that if we are to go ahead with the second named date, which is in November, there is an urgent need to advertise to a wide range of people the importance of getting applications in quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/2">The hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire referred to issues of concern to circuses, village halls, small shops and many other places, and he was right to do so in every single regard. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">My hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase> added to that list his concerns about the important issue of carnivals&mdash;a point also picked up by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1898" name="Mary Creagh">the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1450" name="Madeleine Moon">The hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon)</phrase> was perhaps more supportive of the Act than I am. Nevertheless, she too reminded us of the urgent need to promote the measures and to get licence applications in as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/3">Then we heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the contribution of the hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>; I will return to the issue of his village hall later. His view is that there is, to some extent, a rural-urban divide. I must say that I do not entirely agree. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1503" name="Mark Field">The hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mr. Field)</phrase> made the point that a number of the problems referred to by the hon. Member for Mid-Worcestershire also applied in his distinctly urban constituency, as they do in parts of mine.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/4">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire rightly said that of course there is merit in some aspects of the legislation. However, we really need far greater flexibility, so that we do not have to take tough measures to crack a nut that does not even exist in some of our rural communities. Sadly, however, the problems of binge drinking and their impact on local communities are growing in many parts of the country. Accident and emergency admissions related to alcohol misuse are increasing, and the number of violent episodes and violent crimes related to alcohol misuse is rising.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/5">It is interesting that although the Government are keen on introducing lots of new legislation, existing legislation is hardly being used: on average only 11 landlords a year are prosecuted for allowing drunken behaviour on their premises. Under the new measures brought in by the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, there has been only one, failed, prosecution. The real question is whether we need the new Act, and whether it will really help to solve many of the problems.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/6">Before the Government rush ahead with all their plans, there are so many measures that we need put in place. Frankly, we need more support for the police and local authorities. We need more flexibility in the legislation for local authorities. I take as an example the last-minute agreement of the Government to allow reference to special saturation policies. When they did that, the details were not in the 2003 Act, but it is interesting that the guidance that accompanies the Act says, in relation to special policies on cumulative impact:</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Nothing in the Guidance should be taken as indicating that any requirement of licensing law or any other law may be overridden.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/8">So we can have a special saturation policy, but it will not necessarily do very much. Given that, it is not very surprising that Andrew McNeill, the director of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, has stated:</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/9" class="indent">&quot;I think it's going to be a legal minefield&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/10">Because of that legal minefield, a number of local authorities that are keen to pursue the potential of the measure&mdash;such as my local authority, Bath and North East Somerset council&mdash;have decided not to go ahead; they fear those legal complexities.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/11">Indeed, the Act is full of legal complexities that are causing a nightmare. For example, can the new Minister&mdash;who I welcome to his post&mdash;tell me whether, under the new legislation, it is legal for a family to go out for the night and leave their 15-year-old child in their hotel room, which has a minibar, between 12 am and 5 am? I ask the Minister a straight question: is that legal or not? Those are the sorts of complexities that I fear he will find as he considers the legislation. [Hon. Members: &quot;He doesn't know.&quot;] Well, I will ask the Minister another one; hon. Members might be able to help him. Will it be possible for a family to send their 17-year-old son to a 24-hour supermarket to buy a loaf of bread between midnight and 5 am? I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us, because those sorts of things&mdash;whether people can get their loaf of bread at that time of night&mdash;affect local communities.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/12">Also on complexity, the Minister is keen to press ahead with the Act, but although we have been told at the last minute that we are to have back-up measures such as alcohol disorder zones, we do not even know how they are to operate. They will be covered in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill, which has not yet been considered. How are we meant to know how all these things will relate to each other?</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/13">We need to do more about alcohol labelling. We need to build on the welcome measures of the British Beer and Pub Association, which is banning drinks promotions, although other pubs and clubs need to be advised to do it. We need more support for those who work to try to tackle the problem of alcohol misuse. We need time to sort out a lot of the nonsense. I have given some examples of it, but others have talked about the problems for supermarkets; nearly everyone who has spoken mentioned them.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/14">The hon. Member for North-East Bedfordshire rightly raised the concerns mentioned by Rodney Tate, chairman of the Swineshead village hall management committee, which is in the hon. Gentleman's constituency. That honourable gentleman&mdash;Rodney Tate&mdash;has managed to express himself even more succinctly than he did in the letter that the hon. Gentleman read out. In another very good letter to <i>The Daily Telegraph </i>on this very subject, published just yesterday, he says that he had already written a letter to the newspaper about the huge increase in the fees that the village hall was to be charged, and says:</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Now we have been deluged with the paperwork for this conversion, including a main application form of 21 pages, with over 30 other pages of documents and notes to read.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/16">He points out that he had to go to two seminars to try to understand how to fill in the form. Many other such examples could be given.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/17">The Minister will need time to sort out the issue of temporary event notices. That will be fascinating. We understand that TENs will be issued, but we do not know how that will be done because we have not yet had the regulations. Can the Minister tell us when we will see them? Will he guarantee that there will be a consultation period before he sets out the regulations? Can he tell the House whether the official Cabinet Office guidelines for the length of consultation will apply, which would make the consultation 12 weeks? If it is 12 weeks, will there be time to introduce the statutory instrument, to consider whether to pray against it, and then to have a debate? If all that is to happen, and if we are to go ahead with the appointed date of <phrase class="date" code="">7 November</phrase>, how will the Minister get it all in place in the time provided? As I understand it, we simply cannot do that.</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/18">Is it really the case that the only people who can object to a temporary event notice are the police, and that they have only 48 hours to do that? If so, someone who wanted to organise a rave on the outskirts of my constituency could simply shove a letter through the letterbox of the village police station, if there is one&mdash;and there are one or two around&mdash;late on a Friday night, and then have the rave on the Sunday night, with no time for the police, or anyone, to do anything about it. Have I got that right?</p>
	<p pid=".143.0/19">Can the Minister tell me whether local councils will be given more powers? Is it not daft that local councillors in whose ward an application has been made cannot be involved in deciding it? Will he do more to tell those who need to apply what to do? Frankly, a huge number of problems need to be resolved. I welcome the new Minister to his post, but from everything that he has heard today, he will see that he has a huge fight on his hands to convince many people in communities up and down the country that the Act will help them. Frankly, I do not think that it will.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.146.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1474" speakername="Malcolm Moss" colnum="146"  time="10:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h01.htm#50608h01_spnew22">
	<p pid=".146.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1940" name="Peter Luff">my hon. Friend the Member for Mid-Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase> on securing this debate. As we have heard from the contributions, the problem under discussion is extremely vexatious and affects not only constituencies with a rural bent, but the industry across the board.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/2">I congratulate the Minister on his new post. By now, he will have realised that he has been sold a hospital pass. He has the most poisoned of all the poisoned chalices not only in his Department, but across the whole of the Government. He is the third Minister with whom I have had to deal across the Floor of the House, and I say to him&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" name="Alistair Burt">the point was made by my hon. Friend the Member for North-East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>&mdash;that he has the opportunity to right a great wrong.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/3">The Act is very problematical. In the past, Ministers did not have the necessary tight control. The bureaucrats have been allowed to run riot, and there is now an incredibly difficult situation and a time scale that does not give the Minister much room for manoeuvre. However, he has a massive opportunity to make his mark by grasping the issue by the throat, shaking it hard and coming up with something sensible that will not lead to the kind of problems that have been listed today.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/4">We are on the verge not only of a disaster, but of a total debacle that will affect thousands of businesses and blight local community facilities, including village halls and sports clubs, to mention just a few. I am ashamed to be part of a legislature that is involved in this kind of nonsense. The situation now verges on the farcical. It is not only unfair, but, as my hon. Friends have mentioned, over-zealous and disproportionate. It is certainly over-bureaucratic, and is turning out to be very expensive indeed.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/5">I am also embarrassed not to have been able, with my hon. Friends, to make any fundamental changes to the Bill in Committee and on Report. I regret that. We certainly won the arguments, many of which have been repeated today. However, the Government are still not listening. I am angry that we are visiting such considerable cost and inconvenience on so many businesses and individuals. We need to ask the question, &quot;To what end?&quot; What is the purpose of it all?</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/6">It is difficult to come up with a sensible conclusion. The old system was not doing a bad job; in fact, it worked perfectly well. There may well have been a hidden subsidy involved throughout the court system&mdash;I am prepared to admit that. However, that could have been addressed separately. Instead, we now have a bureaucratic nightmare that involves many different facets of our society.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/7">We have done some research. In some Labour constituencies it is claimed that 10 per cent. of potential applicants have now made applications, to which I say, &quot;Whoopee!&quot; However, our research shows that, across the board, around 5 per cent. have done so. Only 5 per cent. of all the businesses that need to apply for a licence&mdash;all the clubs, village halls and so on&mdash;have so far come forward.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/8">As we all know, the cut-off date is <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">6 August</phrase>, and I do not see how the issue will be dealt with in that tight time scale. Why have applications been slow in coming through? The hon. Members for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) and for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) made the point that such slowness was an aspect of human nature. That is nonsense&mdash;it is not human nature to leave one's business hanging over the edge of a cliff, waiting for some bureaucrat on the council to stamp it as okay.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/9">The reason is down not to human nature, but to the Government. The regulations were laid on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-13">13 January</phrase> to come into force on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase>, the first appointed day, on which the application process was to begin. Even at that stage, the forms released on the DCMS website were incorrect and had to go back because they did not conform to the regulations. Corrections were made and the forms were reissued on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-07">7 February</phrase>. It goes without saying that without the forms, the regulations relating to the plans required, the advertising requirements and other similar details, it proved very difficult for businesses or councils to plan ahead.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/10">Businesses that tried to do work in advance, particularly those that prepared plans of premises, had to revise it to ensure that the 11 different requirements that suddenly came out of the blue were met. Despite repeated requests by the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services and the industry, and despite a promise from the DCMS, the industry is still awaiting clarification on the extent to which outside areas must be shown on the plans. Some councils still believe that all outside areas must be shown on a scale of 1:100. What is the point of sheets of paper that show the golf course, the hotel gardens or the race track? The confusion over plans is probably the single biggest issue holding up applications.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/11">As applications were extremely slow in coming in, on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-30">30 March</phrase> a number of interested parties wrote to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1811" name="Richard Caborn">the then Minister, the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Central (Mr. Caborn)</phrase>. They included the Local Government Association, LACORS, the British Beer and Pub Association, the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers, the British Institute of Innkeeping, Business in Sport and Leisure, the Bar Entertainment and Dance Association and&mdash;the police were involved&mdash;the Association of Chief Police Officers. They wrote expressing their concern about the lack of applications and made points that could be taken on board to ease the process.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/12">The letter suggested, for example, that a reason for the delay was a lack of awareness of the new law among licence holders, particularly among small independent businesses, largely due to a severe lack of information and publicity from the DCMS. They also mentioned the late laying of the regulations and the due date for annual fees, which have to be paid on the anniversary of the granting of the licence, and provide no incentive for early application. We have said time and again that if the renewal date were simply a year after the second appointed day, there would be no problem. However, no one will put in an application early if next year they have to pay their new fees earlier than their neighbour. That is an obvious point, made to the then Minister not only in the letter, but over and over by Opposition Members. Again, the Government just did not listen.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/13">The letter also highlighted the need for multiple copies of applications to the various authorities responsible under the Act and the absence of a slip rule in the regulations that would have allowed the correction of minor errors rather than the rejection of applications. We have heard stories of local authorities sending back application forms because they had not been completed in black ink; the whole process had to be gone through yet again. A slip rule would have prevented some of that nonsense.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/14">The letter also raised the implications of alterations made to licences after the first appointed day&mdash;there could, for example, be a change of licensee&mdash;and mentioned the lack of clarity about aspects of the existing law which are carried forward under the new Act. For example, there is still an argument about embedded rights; people have gone to court. The LGA believes that it can interpret them in one way and the DCMS says, &quot;We're not sure; let the courts decide.&quot; What nonsensical legislation&mdash;it is absolutely appalling. Ministers should have resigned over this nonsense, but they have not.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/15">In replying to the letter that I mentioned, the then Minister more or less indicated that it was all the fault of the pubs&mdash;of everyone but the DCMS, which was whiter than white. Unless this Minister gets a grip of the issue, he will have on his hands the biggest debacle for years. If the pubs do not get their licences through by <phrase class="date" code="">6 November</phrase>, they will not be able to trade, and people will not be able to buy a drink in their local pub.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/16">The three-month time scale from the <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-06">6 August</phrase> cut-off until the second appointed day does not, in my opinion, give the time needed for the local authorities to process all the late applications. There was one example of a club that applied early and had done all its homework, but its application still took eight weeks to process because there were objections and the issue had to go to a hearing. Let us remind ourselves that no other applications were being processed by the council during those eight weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".146.0/17">If objections are raised&mdash;and they will be, without fail&mdash;there will not be time to hold all the hearings during that three-month time scale, which will mean that those who do not get their licences in time will go to court. Magistrates courts will be clogged up with people saying, &quot;You have not processed my licence in time, and I am taking the matter to court to have it resolved.&quot; Either today or very soon, the Minister must introduce, or announce the introduction, of legislation. I do not mean legislation to move the second appointed day, because that has not been decided&mdash;November is only a possible date. However, that has to be shifted. Eight months has been suggested by Westminster&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".157.0/1">Will the Minister write to me as soon as possible in response to my specific point about the cut in Eastern Deanery's funding, which has led to a reduction of 12 places&mdash;a 75 per cent. cut&mdash;in the number of final year self-construct GP registrars?

	<p pid=".157.1/1">I will find out further details about that and write to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid=".157.1/2">There are not only more GPs but more specialised GPs developing their expertise in particular areas depending on the service that they want to provide for their patients. There are also better facilities. Some 1,400 GPs with special interests deliver a range of extended services, such as dermatology, in a local setting that is convenient to patients. Since July 2000, 2,848 general practice surgeries have been replaced or refurbished as we modernise the NHS's infrastructure after years of under-investment. More money also means more services. Bedfordshire Heartlands primary care trust is investing &pound;4.9 million this year in the treatment of people with long-term conditions, and has been developing means of care that will allow people to be treated at home instead of in hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".157.1/3">The hon. Gentleman talked about decisions on premises in his constituency, and I know that he has spoken with the chief executive of his local trust. He will be aware that a decision has not yet been taken on any premises and that the trust cannot give the go ahead to the Leighton Buzzard surgery plans independently of the other three premises being considered. I know that he is actively engaged with the PCT and I hope that the lines of communication are open so that he will feel that there is real engagement in determining the facilities to provide services to the local community and that his concerns are being addressed. No final decisions have been made but the PCT is considering the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".157.1/4">One of the Government's priorities, as I hope the hon. Gentleman is aware, is to create healthy and sustainable new communities in the south-east. There are 44 PCTs in the four growth areas of Ashford, London-Stansted-Cambridge-Peterborough, Milton Keynes and south midlands, and the Thames Gateway, and the Bedfordshire Heartlands PCT falls within that area. We must deal with housing growth and the development of health services to meet the needs of population growth. I know that the PCT is considering those issues in the medium and long term, and additional funding has been incorporated to take account of that. Discussions must take place alongside development to deal with the long-term health care needs of the communities that he and other MPs in the surrounding area represent.</p>
	<p pid=".157.1/5">We are trying to provide innovative ways to access care to meet patients' demands. The hon. Gentleman raised concerns about the independent sector and whether its involvement at primary care level would too strongly undermine the role of the GP practice. We do not want to undermine the role of the GP practice but we are examining options for other service providers, which could include entrepreneurial GPs wanting to expand. As I have said, a number of GPs specialise in certain areas of health care and may want to use those skills to provide, for example, satellite services outside the GP practice.</p>
	<p pid=".157.1/6">The voluntary sector could also be involved. As a former Home Officer Minister responsible for the national drugs strategy, I know that the voluntary sector often plays a key role in helping GP practices&mdash;for example, with referrals for drug treatment. There is no prescriptive, &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach; it depends on what services are needed. There is not a blueprint to be handed down. We want to engage GPs in the process and are not seeking to undercut them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.160.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="160"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h03.htm#50608h03_spnew0">
	<p pid=".160.1/1">It is a great honour to be given this opportunity so early in the new Parliament to address the key issue of international social and economic justice, particularly at such an opportune moment. As we approach the G8 summit, World Trade Organisation talks and a six-month European Union presidency, it seems that the stars are aligned in such a way that this could be an historic moment for not only the Government and Parliament, but how we lead the world on this agenda.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/2">I intend to address how we should be tackling what I see as a tyranny of oppression that affects so much of the developing world. It is not a tyranny that any dictator has imposed, but a tyranny of oppression that we can see symbolised by poverty, disease and malnutrition and a lack of access to water and basic sanitation, health care and education. It is a tyranny of oppression that is fixed by a set of global circumstances that it is within our power as international actors to do much to alleviate.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/3">Today in the United Kingdom, the moment is right. We have a recently re-elected Government who are committed fully to international development, and we also have cross-party support for tackling global poverty. Crucially, the UK will also shortly assume the presidencies of both the EU and G8 in the run-up to the vital WTO talks in Hong Kong. For a brief moment, it seems that everything is lined up in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/4">Perhaps most significantly, the British and international publics are pressing for action, most visibly through campaigns such as the momentous Make Poverty History campaign but also through others such as the excellent Trade Justice Movement, which has lobbied us so effectively in Parliament over a number years. Several representatives of the Make Poverty History campaign have informed me that they have been overwhelmed by the public's enthusiasm for an ambitious agenda. Indeed, the campaign's ubiquitous white wristbands&mdash;even though they have become a focal point for the powerful negative externalities of global trade such as work force exploitation&mdash;are symbolic of perhaps the greatest groundswell of opinion in support of global action since Band Aid 20 years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/5">Make Poverty History is a unique campaign, because it is not asking us to pledge money per se; instead, its primary goal is structural. It asks us to challenge how we view the developing world and our relationship with it. Essentially, Make Poverty History is asking us to make a long-term political pledge, with each wristband symbolising a commitment on the part of its wearer to pressurising those in power to tackle the global inequalities that condemn billions in the developing world to grinding poverty. I firmly believe that in Britain today we have an unprecedented opportunity to respond positively and energetically to that popular pressure.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/6">The political developments to date, with the agenda led by the Government and the popular pressure to reform, are considerable, and we have great cause to feel optimistic. Ultimately, however, our achievements to date, our ambitions on debt relief and aid, and our hopes of achieving the millennium development goals will be hugely diminished if we cannot combine that with similar concurrent progress on trade. Of the three main concerns of the Make Poverty History campaign&mdash;aid, debt relief and trade&mdash;it is the last that I wish to discuss today. That is because I believe that, although we can never afford to be complacent, we are already pushing the agenda on debt relief and aid, and others will follow if we keep our nose to the grindstone.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/7">The momentous efforts of our Prime Minister, who was much criticised for spending time on international diplomacy, are to be applauded. When his personal commitment and efforts bring President Bush to the table, jointly proposing to write off the debt of 32 countries if coupled with economic reform and the measures to tackle corruption, this will be a milestone in transatlantic co-operation and bode well for the G8 summit. As the White House spokesman Scott McLellan said only a few days ago, debt relief was</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/8" class="indent">&quot;one area where we have a shared goal&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/9">On the surface, the aid package is much less hopeful, and I trust that the Prime Minister and all his Ministers will make every effort to persuade the President to go further and faster. Indeed, I note that some are already speculating that that will happen. I would welcome the Minister's reassurance that diplomatic pressure will continue behind the scenes up to G8 and beyond, because he knows that if the US were to match the 0.7 per cent. of national income recommended by the United Nations for international aid, the US would not only get the thanks of the global community but it would help us to reach the target of an extra &pound;14 billion being pledged before G8, and I would be first to send a note of congratulations to the White House.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/10">It is on international trade justice that we face our stiffest challenge, and our efforts in that arena will ultimately define the limits of our success in the crucial months ahead. The US Trade Secretary has set his face against calls for an immediate cessation of cotton and sugar subsidies, as demanded in the Commission for Africa's report, even though the World Trade Organisation has ruled that US cotton subsidies are in breach of trade rules. Even on our own doorstep, the indefensible horror that is the common agricultural policy gives the lie to those who constantly point an accusing finger at the US alone. CAP was described by the Commission for Africa as the world's most protectionist trade regime. To make it worse, abuses of trade rules by both the US and the EU have consequences that are so transparent and obvious that no sane person would not cry out for immediate reform.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/11">Whenever we look back at the millions of people harmed by smoking, we try to identify the point in time when the manufacturers unarguably knew what their product was doing. We did the same with health claims in the UK coal industry in order to determine liability for the billions of pounds now being paid out because someone knew that damage was being done to miners' health.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/12">It is now clear&mdash;it has been clear for a while&mdash;what damage is being done to developing and impoverished nations and those at the receiving end of the protectionist policies of the US and the EU. We are complicit unless we move to change those abhorrent rules of trade that dump subsidised products on developing nations and undercut their indigenous agriculture and industry. It is only through fair trading arrangements that development can be sustainable in the long term. Although aid and debt relief are vital&mdash;they grant developing nations a breathing space&mdash;without equal terms of trade, such countries can never hope to grow and prosper.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/13">Handouts and bail outs provide little in the way of incentive to invest in the construction of a vibrant industrial base, a flourishing agricultural sector or a robust trading infrastructure. Nor can they ever hope to provide the sort of stable, consistent funding upon which adequate vital public services can be financed. At best, they keep developing nations in a state of perpetual hope&mdash;and, at worst, in permanent despair.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/14">From a hard-nosed western perspective, we would clearly benefit from fairer trading arrangements with the developing world. Apart from the overwhelming moral motivations, there are powerful economic and political imperatives for fair trade. For example, CAP export subsidies sting the British public twice over. According to Oxfam, not only does the policy cost UK taxpayers &pound;3.9 billion a year, but, as consumers, the average family of four pays &pound;800 extra more every 12 months than it would in the absence of CAP.</p>
	<p pid=".160.1/15">Moreover, aid and debt relief do not represent long-term value for money for the taxpayer. That is especially so if the recipients of the money are simultaneously denied the opportunity to repay the donors by generating their own wealth through productivity and trade.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.162.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="162"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h03.htm#50608h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".162.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that helpful intervention. We are undoubtedly moving in the right direction, and the speed at which we do so is very important. I agree that progress is being made, and that it is being made because of international pressure, applied not least by this Government. We need to continue to make progress, and to do so faster, because the implications of not doing so are staring us in the face at this very moment.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/2">I am very pleased that the UK Government have recognised the central role of trade in development, and that we have built considerable momentum in that direction to date. Of course, if we are to achieve the millennium development goals, secure the conditions for a successful pro-poor outcome to the Doha round, and ultimately lay the foundations for a fairer global trading system, no one can deny that we, the Minister and his colleagues face a challenge of immense proportions. However, as the non-governmental and campaigning organisations acknowledge, we are taking important steps in that direction. Indeed, the Government have already shown their clear desire to play a leading role in tackling global trade injustice.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/3">Perhaps the most significant recent development has been the Government's recent acceptance that the Commission for Africa's March 2005 report should form the basis of UK policy. That is hugely welcome. It is particularly encouraging when we consider that powerful document's central argument on trade: that developing nations should be able to manage their own trade policies and paths to development rather than having them dictated by wealthy states. Leaders of developing countries have frequently reiterated that sentiment to those who are willing to listen. The President of Tanzania expressed that view succinctly when he implored developing states to recognise that</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/4" class="indent">&quot;Development cannot be imposed. It can only be facilitated. It requires ownership, participation and empowerment, not harangues and dictates&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/5">As the Commission for Africa's report rightly stresses, it is simply inappropriate to dictate policy to fellow sovereign nations. Isolated from key decisions over their own future and often sensing little immediate progress, Governments and citizens of poor countries are also likely to become progressively less enthusiastic about taking the painful measures that developed nations have declared necessary for their reform and recovery. More often than not, the result is stagnation, opposition and even resentment both domestically and internationally. By contrast, the results can be considerable when poor nations are provided with the opportunity to manage their own economic development.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/6">The UK Government have acknowledged the force of that argument. In its July 2000 White Paper, &quot;Making Globalisation a Force for Good&quot;, the Department of Trade and Industry underlined the importance of affording developing states the autonomy to determine their own development priorities. It clearly stated that</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/7" class="indent">&quot;developing countries need the space to design and sequence trade reform packages in a way that is appropriate for their particular circumstances, and then integrate them into their own development and poverty reduction strategies.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/8">The enthusiasm of the Minister, of Cabinet Ministers, and of the Prime Minister for pushing that message in the coming months is essential, because it is only by building a multilateral consensus on the importance of enhancing the room that developing states have to manoeuvre on trade issues that we can hope to secure significant and lasting change. We must therefore have those goals in mind when we assume the presidencies of the EU and the G8. Europe will undoubtedly be our busiest arena in this respect. The fact that the UK presidency of the EU will inevitably be dominated by the consequences of the rejection of the European constitution will certainly make it even busier, but I see no reason why that should necessarily distract us from our focus on eradicating global poverty.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/9">After all, if Europe is indeed looking for a new direction, a new purpose and a sense of collective mission, we will be extremely well placed to shape that new identity positively. To that end, we must be sure to highlight two ever-present challenges on the international fair trade &quot;to do&quot; list&mdash;subsidies and market access. As the Minister knows, the economic partnership agreements will provide a prime opportunity to raise the issue of market access.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/10">With the possibility of free access to the European market, EPAs could hold great promise for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries involved. According to the Trade Justice Movement, however, that promise will be negated if the EU negotiates EPAs in a way that includes reciprocal trade liberalisation and new rules regarding the Singapore issues, namely competition, investment and public procurement. The path that the EU takes could have crucial implications for poverty reduction and for development. A 2003 impact assessment by PricewaterhouseCoopers postulated that a bad EPA had the potential to destroy west Africa's manufacturing sector, so we must move forward with consideration. The pace and structure of reform must be in the interests of the developing nations, not just the western, leading developed nations.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/11">Alternatively, the EU could back a fair EPA, or an alternative viable agreement that does not demand full and immediate liberalisation. The European Commission could also encourage its developed world partners at the WTO towards a firm agreement on special and differential treatment that empowers developing states to set tariff levels according to their specific industrial and agricultural requirements. If the EU can be coaxed, cajoled, bullied or bested down the latter route, it will represent a significant boost to the long-term development potential of many least-developed countries, and it will help to build an invaluable developed-world consensus on the benefits of empowering poor nations to choose how, when and what to liberalise. Such an outcome would be a historic coup for the UK presidency.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/12">Halting unfettered, pure, laissez-faire liberalisation will not make developing nations any freer to manage their economies if their vital agricultural sector is simultaneously undermined by developed-world export subsidies and dumping. That point has been highlighted by the case of the EU sugar regime. Conspicuously absent from the &quot;Everything but Arms&quot; agreements until 2009, the price of sugar in the EU, according to the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development, has been maintained at three times the world market level by tariffs of up to 140 per cent. It is perhaps unsurprising that the WTO recently ruled that the sugar subsidies are illegal, as it did with similarly unjust American subsidies of cotton. It is vital that we interpret the ruling in a way that enhances development opportunities by eliminating those subsidies and increasing the import quotas from less developed countries.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/13">More generally, the UK must endeavour to ensure that a core priority of its EU presidency is the rapid phase-out of agricultural subsidies, and it must ideally aim for the Commission for Africa's goal of 2010, even though it is ambitious. Moreover, as is appreciated, progress on agricultural subsidies is central to the ultimate success of the Doha round, and we must be ceaseless in our insistence that the EU agrees a date at the WTO ministerial talks in Hong Kong in December for the total phase-out of subsidies.</p>
	<p pid=".162.1/14">In addition to the EU presidency, the G8 presidency and the Gleneagles summit give clear opportunities for the UK to press a new model of global trade on its developed-world partners. Although there are institutional limitations on the G8 in terms of its ability to influence the WTO, the UK can still reasonably hope to build momentum for change if it uses that platform to reiterate consistently a pro-development line. After all, those Heads of State assembling in Perthshire in July ultimately control the bulk of global trade and unofficially dominate the major international financial institutions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.166.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="166"  time="14:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h03.htm#50608h03_spnew5">
	<p pid=".166.0/1">I congratulate very sincerely <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> on his choice of subject at an opportune time: the lead-up to the summit. It is very appropriate that he introduced the subject and did so in an effective way, emphasising the moral dimension behind trade policy that is often overlooked. I agreed with a large part of what he had to say. Indeed, I would subscribe to some of his more colourful rhetoric about the indefensible horrors of the common agricultural policy, as well as his more general arguments.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/2">I shall explain why I am speaking in an unfamiliar Back-Bench role. It is partly because I share the Chancellor's view&mdash;and that of the leader of the Conservative party expressed today&mdash;that we cannot treat trade policy as if it were in a separate box. It is part of the broader approach to global development, the international economy and the future of developing countries. There is no point trying to deal with aid and debt relief in one compartment while ignoring the trade dimension: they are part of an interrelated whole. Those of us who are interested in better economic policy, particularly helping growth in developing countries, have to attend to trade policy issues.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/3">On a purely personal level, I spent a substantial part of my professional life dealing with development matters in developing countries, particularly trade policy. I argued for many years for a trade liberalising agenda, but things are still&mdash;alas&mdash;very much the same as they were 20 or 30 years ago. Many of the trade barriers that we argued about vehemently in the 1970s are unfortunately still there, but none the less it is important to restate the arguments.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/4">I take a slightly different tack from the hon. Member for Ogmore; I want to reinforce what he says, but I have a slightly different point to make. Very often we use vocabulary about trade justice and fairness that is confusing. The word &quot;fairness&quot; in trade policy is used in several quite different, and sometimes rather unhelpful, ways. I use the term &quot;fair trade&quot; in the sense of free and fair trade in broadly the same way as the hon. Gentleman. In a sense, it means free trade with a purpose: opening up markets, getting rid of distorting subsidies and achieving the aim of helping poor people in poor countries.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/5">Unfortunately, &quot;fair trade&quot; is often used by different people in different ways. Certainly, in the days when I was doing battle with the European textile lobby&mdash;a body called Comitextil&mdash; it would try to justify the introduction of quotas by using the term &quot;fair trade policy&quot;. Very often, one finds American protectionist lobbies say that they are demanding fair trade, giving the term a completely different and opposite meaning.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/6">The term is also used in a third way, which the hon. Gentleman used, to defend non-reciprocity in trade. There are arguments about reciprocity and I shall come to them in a moment, but the meaning is different and it does not just concern open markets. In some contexts, it defends protection. There is also the issue of preferences. &quot;Fair trade&quot; is often used as a way of justifying preferences for some developing countries over others, and defending quotas for supposedly more worthy developing countries. This is an issue in relation to textiles, sugar, bananas and so on. We need to deal with that.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/7">Lastly, &quot;fair trade&quot; is used in a context that we often encounter in supermarkets, where fair trade products are advocated because they are produced with better social standards or in some other way. That may be desirable but, again, the meaning is completely different. The words &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; are used in many ways and I want to be a little more precise about what exactly we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/8">Sometimes the arguments are muddled unhelpfully and a good example of that is textiles. There has been a retrograde move in international trade policy in the past few weeks. Regrettably, the Trade Commissioner in Brussels, Mr. Mandelson, who had made some effective interventions, seems to have gone backwards and accepted demands from the French Government that textile quotas should be strengthened or reintroduced, particularly for China. It is clear that those demands have come from producer interest groups in western Europe, but quotas have been justified on the grounds that we must protect other developing countries from China. That is a separate argument, but it is being used and intermingled dishonestly. We are used to that in the sugar agreement, which is a complex problem that has been with us for three decades at least. There is an unholy alliance between sugar beet producers and high-cost producers in the Caribbean and elsewhere to protect an inefficient regime that does great harm to developing country exporters. Different aspects of fairness are used in different ways and sometimes unhelpfully.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/9">I turn to two tricky issues of trade policy, and there is a right answer to neither. The first is reciprocity, upon which the hon. Member for Ogmore touched. Should developing countries concede liberalisation when negotiating trade agreements and, if so, in what circumstances? During the election and earlier, we all received deputations from trade justice groups, Churches and so on. I agreed with 95 per cent. of their arguments, but they wanted me to say that opening up the markets of poor countries is a bad thing and that we must fight against that. That may be so, but many poor countries such as India have suffered great damage from excessively protective trade policies, and I am not sure that I want to subscribe to them.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/10">We must consider more critically the argument for reciprocity. Under existing rules, which were developed under the general agreement on tariffs and trade and have been carried forward by the World Trade Organisation, developing countries can seek special and differential treatment of trade in goods. Different negotiating principles are involved in services but an offer principle applies and countries do not have to offer concessions if they do not want to. Poor developing countries, particularly in Africa, that do not want to participate do not have to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/11">The World Trade Organisation specifically protects developing countries from undue pressure to open up their markets if they choose not to do so. Many of the lobbyists on trade justice seem not to appreciate how the system operates and mix it up with a separate matter: that the European Union, in its bilateral relationships, and sometimes the World Bank, in its aid packages, use trade liberalisation as a condition.</p>
	<p pid=".166.0/12">The simple answer is that developing countries should not be forced to adopt policies that they feel passionately are against their interests. There should be no coercion, but in many cases it will be in the interests of developing countries to pursue more liberal policies. Throughout south-east Asia, Thailand, Malaysia, India and China have radically reduced their import quota and tariff regimes to their own betterment. That should not be imposed, but it is often in their interests.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.170.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1987" speakername="Ann McKechin" colnum="170"  time="15:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h03.htm#50608h03_spnew11">
	<p pid=".170.0/1">I, too, welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the choice of debate from my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase>. It is timely and appropriate given the current major debate on the best way for the international community to address world poverty and particularly poverty in Africa. As has been commented, this year will be a key period in political history if we are to achieve meaningful change.</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/2">Our thoughts are focused on the G8 summit in Gleneagles in a few weeks' time. I am encouraged that there are real signs of progress on the issues relating to aid and debt, but we need the world leaders at that summit also to make progress on the third main issue: world trade. As we can tell from today's debate, that is possibly the most difficult and contentious of those three major topics. It involves not only the simple movement of what is still a tiny fraction of our wealth to poorer nations, but substantial change in the operation of our economies and a phasing out of the huge range of subsidies and tariff rates that currently protect a sizeable amount of our own production. We need our political leaders to show courage and determined commitment to achieve change, and to do so urgently, before the opportunities fade away from us.</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/3">Our last substantive debate on world trade took place about 18 months ago, when we had the opportunity to discuss the excellent report prepared by the International Development Committee, following on from the Cancun ministerial summit. I attended that summit as part of the parallel parliamentary conference, so I had the opportunity to witness at first hand the frustration of many nations that their priorities on development issues were squeezed out by an overloaded agenda that eventually toppled over, with no real progress in any of the major areas. At that time, there seemed little sign that any substantial agreement would be reached, and there was a danger that major players, such as the USA, would slip back into relying on bilateral trade agreements and establishing free trade areas. However, there are now signs that most nations see the benefit of reaching a comprehensive multilateral trade agreement and, particularly in the west, there is increasing public pressure on leaders to consider the needs of the world's poorest in a development-focused round.</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/4">The Commission for Africa report highlights the fact that unless Africa increases its diminishing share of world trade, it will fail to achieve sustainable growth and poverty reduction. However much aid we put into the continent, if we do not increase its share of world trade, we will never achieve the goals. As the report points out, in stark contrast to what has happened in the emerging economies in India, China and Brazil, the last 30 years have seen stagnation in Africa, with the composition of its exports essentially remaining unchanged.</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/5">The commission identifies the two main causes of the collapse in Africa's share of world trade. The first is its low capacity to produce and trade, which has been consistently hindered by protectionist policies such as those in the European Union, as my hon. Friend identified. The commission does not hold back in condemning current trading systems. It states that</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/6" class="indent">&quot;barriers and subsidies are absolutely unacceptable; they are politically antiquated, economically illiterate, environmentally destructive, and ethically undesirable. They must go.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/7">Secondly, the commission identifies the advance of other nations such as China and India as having made it more difficult for Africa to break into world markets at this time, as competitors have established strong advantages on the world market. Any new trade agreement that we consider this year must take into account both those issues, and it must ensure that there is a proper sequencing of the reforms and that special and differential treatment obligations are an integral part of any final deal.</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/8">It is very important that, when we reach agreement, a distinction should be made between the needs of middle-income and often larger nations, and those of the poorest nations, which include all those of sub-Saharan Africa. For a time at least, it will be vital to provide the poorest nations with some form of protectionism, so that they do not simply swap one form of export dumping from the USA and the European Union for a huge tide of exports from emerging economies, with which they cannot, at this stage, be reasonably expected to compete on anything like equal terms. We need to meet that challenge this year.</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/9">Since the Cancun summit, the EU has agreed to drop three of the most contentious Singapore issues: competition, investment and transparency in public procurement. The continued strength of the G20 group, which encompasses nations such as China, India and Brazil, shows that middle-income nations&mdash;we should recall that they comprise more than 50 per cent. of the world's population&mdash;are willing to show their weight on the world scene.</p>
	<p pid=".170.0/10">The recent cases brought by Brazil at the WTO tribunal against the EU and the USA on subsidies for cotton and sugar show that the G20 has a new and sophisticated political strategy, to which the richer nations will need to adapt quickly. That was completely underestimated at the Cancun ministerial summit, but now there is a growing realisation that the EU and the USA need to engage in the talks, out of not only altruism, but a recognition that they need to co-operate with emerging world economies if they are to protect their own trade positions in turn.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.174.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="174"  time="15:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h03.htm#50608h03_spnew14">
	<p pid=".174.0/1">I echo <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1987" name="Ann McKechin">the final point made by the hon. Member for Glasgow, North (Ann McKechin)</phrase>: all who examine the opportunities to make poverty history recognise that 2005 is a pivotal year. If we fail this year, there will be a less rosy picture of the future for all the non-governmental organisations and campaigners who have campaigned for many years. They are hoping&mdash;with the G8 summit, the UN millennium council in September, the WTO talks later this year and the opportunity for the UK Government to take an important lead as a result of their presidency of the EU and of the G8&mdash;that this is the year of major change.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/2">I also congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1750" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> on securing the debate, on doing so in such a timely fashion and on making such a strong case, which I endorse. I am well aware that as a new boy to these debates I could easily fall into the trap, as perhaps others have, of believing that coming new and fresh to them enables one instantaneously to find an inspired policy solution that has strangely bypassed armies of policy thinkers and academics over the past few decades. I do not hold that view and I reassure Members that I do not start from the position of thinking that I will inject the debate with that flash of inspiration, although I would like to think that one day I might. This is a question of probing the issue so that we can move it forward and of an Opposition party encouraging the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/3">The debate is largely consensual, which is good because we can concentrate on the positive things, but it could become weak and flabby and lose the sharpness of the challenging debates that the Chamber often experiences. The background is not just the opportunities that I mentioned, but the Live 8 rock event and the gathering of people concerned about achieving a positive outcome from the G8 summit in July. That has helped to raise the issue's profile. Those who have campaigned for years are aware that away from the glamour of the rock concerts, the hard graft on the ground in developing countries still needs to go on.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/4">The fundamental principles of wanting to establish trade justice for developing countries is based on our understanding of a policy of enlightened self-interest: we have an interest but we must be enlightened to the extent that we are aware of the impact of our policies on those countries when we implement things. Let us consider the development of the policies, particularly by the west, over <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the past 10 or more years. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> has much more front-line experience in that regard than me. There is much emphasis on the west's having involved itself in pursuing the self-interest part of the policy, but the enlightenment bit does not appear to have kicked in a great deal. I hope that that element of &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot; is kick-started in 2005.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/5">Although I welcome what I hope is not momentary compassion from those who will attend rock concerts in a few weeks' time, the way that the debate is developing suggests that there is a certain schizophrenia among the public in this country and in the west in general. Sometimes difficult decisions have to be taken and people start saying, &quot;We want to cut hospital waiting times&quot;, &quot;Deal with the potholes in our roads&quot; or, &quot;Improve the rail service&quot;; often the same people who turn up at the rock concerts or who wear the campaign wristbands will question why so much money is spent on debt relief and aid in other countries for people we do not know when we still have not got things sorted out in this country. We must bear that theme in mind. Political pressures will inevitably fall on us politicians, and we will have to face difficult decisions about the development of, and poverty in, less-developed countries when those topics are not in the media or the subject of public attention. However, we must sustain momentum.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/6">When people in the west realise that the implementation of trade justice policies might mean that some parts of their country's economy become less profitable as the cold winds of global trade make some companies more marginal, and when they realise that improvements in labour standards in other countries might mean that we cannot buy our trainers, footballs and fashion accessories as cheaply, people may question why we have gone down that route. We must keep the public on board when pursuing those policies and we must recognise that there will be implications for our lifestyles and standards of living.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/7">The hon. Member for Ogmore rightly emphasised the tyranny of oppression on the world's poor and the golden opportunity that we have this year. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham, who has a great deal of experience on this subject, while supporting the contribution made by the hon. Gentleman, pointed out that there may be more disagreement behind the scenes and behind the language used than there appears at first sight&mdash;for example, about the definition of the word &quot;fair&quot;. Everything looks fair from someone's perspective if it benefits them but it is never fair for others on the receiving end of policies that do not benefit them. The language used in the debate masks more disagreement on the world stage than our debates here give the impression of.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/8">My hon. Friend also rightly argued against the one-size-fits-all policy for future trade relations and emphasised the need to move as rapidly as possible away from export subsidies and trade barriers, which are unjustifiable across a large number of economies and commodities.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/9">The hon. Member for Glasgow, North discussed the important role that the United States plays, and, in that context, we had the announcement of the outcome of the Prime Minister's recent visit to the US President. Although there were agreeable words at the press conference last night, I have significant concerns that the fact that the United States spends about $100 billion a year in pursuit of its policy in Iraq compared with $4 billion in Africa indicates its priorities. If we are to make a significant difference to the way in which the G8 and other countries pursue policies, it will be essential to bring the United States further on board.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/10">I have a number of questions for the Minister, as I am sure he will be delighted to know. The first follows up a question I raised during departmental questions. I asked the Secretary of State about economic partnership agreements, which have been mentioned by others, and especially by the hon. Member for Ogmore. I asked for reassurance that ACP countries would be given a genuine choice between signing up to EPAs and pro-development alternatives. The Secretary of State answered:</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Yes, I agree with him. In the end, it is for ACP countries to decide whether they wish to sign up to economic partnership agreements. They can have confidence about the choice that they will face if they see that there are alternatives if they do not like the deal on the table. From my conversations with Trade Ministers in developing countries, I know that they are clear that all is to play for on these agreements. They know what they want and I am sure that they will use their bargaining power to achieve it.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-25">25 May 2005</phrase>; Vol.434, c. 691.]</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/12">That was said in the context of a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-11">11 April</phrase> sent to the UK Government, in which the European Commission said that a statement made by the UK Government on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-21">21 March</phrase></p>
	<p pid=".174.0/13" class="indent">&quot;represents a major and unwelcome shift in the UK position as it focuses exclusively on the potential risks of EPAs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/14">The letter goes on to list a number of concerns about the way in which the UK's interpretation of EPAs, and of giving ACP countries a genuine choice, is not reflected in the views of other European countries or in the agreement by the Council of Ministers. The letter says:</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Peter Mandelson is taking up our concerns and will press for a revised UK line, noting that their statement is contrary to the agreed EU position and harmful for our common objective of promoting development through trade.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/16">I would be grateful if the Minister would let us know what progress has been made in those negotiations with Peter Mandelson. One assumes that the Government speak the same language as the Trade Commissioner, both literally and politically, and so I hope that the Government can make progress in ensuring that less-developed, ACP countries genuinely have a choice.</p>
	<p pid=".174.0/17">Also, I would welcome the Minister's clear interpretation of the revised line taken by the European Commission regarding EPAs and would like him to say whether the Government agree in principle that debt relief and aid should not be conditional on enforced trade policy. I am aware of the time, and of the fact that the Conservative spokesman and the Minister need to respond, so I shall end my remarks now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.183.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1652" speakername="Mike Gapes" colnum="183"  time="16:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h04.htm#50608h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".183.1/1">I draw attention to this issue because of constituency reasons. Eight weeks ago, I was on a tube train on the Jubilee line in central London in the middle of a weekday afternoon when three young men who were probably 14, 15 or 16 years old got on to the train, carrying between them a large plastic bag containing stalks with leaves. They proceeded to spend the whole journey picking the leaves and chewing them. It was the first time that I had ever seen that on a tube train, and I wondered what the significance of it was. The three young men were clearly intoxicated and in their own world, taking part in something that was important to them.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/2">The young men were Somali. During the recent election campaign, I had lots of discussions with members of my local Somali community. After that, I thought that it was important to raise this issue as early as possible in this Parliament. People in my Somali community in Ilford tell me that the consumption of khat&mdash;there are at least 40 different words for the substance in different languages&mdash;is a growing social and community problem. It is not just a problem for the Somali community, because it is not only Somalis who are chewing the leaves of this shrub. It is a wider problem, which could become serious unless the Government take some action to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/3">What is khat? It grows throughout the Arab peninsula, north-east Africa and other parts of the world. It is a shrub that grows 6 to 12 ft high and is known scientifically as Catha edulis. It goes by 40 different street names, including qat, kat, chat, gat, tohai, tschat and mirra. It has been grown interspersed with coffee in many countries and is very profitable for the producers. It has been suggested to me that in war-ravaged, divided Somalia, the production, sale and export of the plant are as valuable as the heroin poppy in parts of Afghanistan. That raises big questions about what will happen.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/4">Chewed in moderation, as it has been for centuries, khat alleviates fatigue and reduces appetite. It can create among people a social environment and mild intoxication, and that is why, for centuries, men in Muslim societies in the middle east and Africa have often enjoyed chewing it. I am told that it has an effect similar to amphetamines, which are sold illegally and sometimes legally in many parts of the world. However, if it is chewed for long periods&mdash;several hours&mdash;it can result in manic behaviour, grandiose delusions, paranoia, hallucinations and other effects. It is also believed&mdash;and there are studies to back this up&mdash;that it can have carcinogenic effects on the mouth, that it increases the possibility of heart attacks, and that it has other effects, including very serious psychotic ones, on numbers of individuals.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/5">Yet khat is perfectly legal in this country. There are no restrictions on its sale. One can walk through certain areas and find little shops that advertise its sale in the window. That is not the case in all parts of the world. It is regarded as a schedule 1 drug in the United States, and it is controlled and banned in several European countries, in Canada and in New Zealand. We must therefore ask why this country has not taken action against it up to now.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/6">Some people would say that there are cultural and community questions and sensitivities to be considered. Yes, there are, but, as the Somaliland Forum says on its website:</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/7" class="indent">&quot;This drug is eating at the fabric of society at every level. It is an economic drain as well as a social ill that has a devastating effect on the nucleus of the society&mdash;the family. What once was considered leisure has now become a necessity, like food. Its use is spreading faster than AIDS because it is accepted by society as harmless, and even those who understand its harm do not strive to educate the public of its ills.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/8">That is from a publication in Somaliland, the northern part of Somalia.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/9">Another publication, <i>The Somaliland Times</i>, carried a very long article by Abdul Halim M. Mussa, entitled, &quot;The Problems of Qat for Society and Health&quot;, on the front page of issue 59. The article details the damage that khat has done in Kenya, Ethiopia, Yemen, Djibouti and Somalia.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/10">Another issue reports the discussions on a peace treaty in Somalia in 2004, and quotes one woman, Eng Rukia Osman Mahmoud, who was involved in the negotiations:</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/11" class="indent">&quot;Our men have become lazy over the years because of the widespread trade that forces them to just sit and enjoy the product. Our children have nothing to eat, let alone go to school, because their fathers cannot work&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/12">She claims that</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/13" class="indent">&quot;about 75 per cent. of the eight million people in Somalia chew khat, with men and boys accounting for the largest percentage&quot;,</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/14">and concludes:</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/15" class="indent">&quot;Women and children have suffered for so long, and now that peace is in the air we have to look at ways of reconstructing the country in all aspects . . . This will have to involve everyone, including men, and may be more effective only if a ban has been imposed on the khat trade, because trading in this commodity poses a challenge to rebuilding efforts.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/16">Clearly, the Somali community in this country has grown. There are also people here from Yemen and other countries in which khat is chewed and is prevalent in the culture and in society. These are difficult issues, but we usually have some control over substances that make young men in this country clearly seriously intoxicated during the day. We do not allow tobacco or alcohol to be sold to people under a certain age. We do not allow unrestricted access&mdash;in fact, we ban or strictly control access&mdash;to amphetamines, for example.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/17">Although a few critics might say that we should, it is generally not acceptable in this country to argue for a deregulatory free-for-all in which anybody can buy and take anything that they like, regardless of the social and human costs, let alone the medical consequences for the individuals concerned and their families. Yet, khat is not controlled, and we must wonder why. People in this country can buy limitless quantities and chew the substance for hours without any control: no regulation, quality control, tax or other measures. Other countries have a different attitude.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/18">The Government are aware of the problem, and there have been a number of parliamentary questions on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1411" name="Gisela Stuart">the matter. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> asked a question in 2004 and received a written answer from the <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">then Home Office Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, which stated:</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/19" class="indent">&quot;The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs keeps the situation in respect of all controlled drugs under review. At its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-02">2 October 2003</phrase>, the Advisory Council's sub-committee the Technical Committee considered the impact of Khat. The Committee concluded that further research needed to be carried out before any informed decisions could be made.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/20" class="indent">The Home Office is in the process of commissioning a piece of research into Khat use in the United Kingdom. We expect the research to be completed by the summer of 2005.&quot; &mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-30">30 March 2004</phrase>; Vol. 419, c. 1347W.]</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/21">It is almost midsummer 2005, so where is the research? I want to know, so I have been doing some digging. I have been on the Home Office website and had help from the Library, and something very interesting has happened.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/22">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-27">27 May</phrase>, the Home Office website, under the heading &quot;Diversity Research&quot;, listed a report published by Turning Point called &quot;Khat use in Somali, Ethiopian and Yemeni communities in England: issues and solutions&quot;. The website said:</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/23" class="indent">&quot;This report was commissioned to explore khat use and treatment issues in England, and to make good practice recommendations. The report interviewed individuals and carried out focus groups in the communities concerned, and consulted a range of professional drug treatment specialists&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/24">There was a button to download the report, and we tried, but the report was not there because it had not yet been published. I went online again last night, to see whether it had been published, but found that the passage had disappeared. I do not know why it was taken off the website, but that is strange.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/25">Today, the Library helpfully sent me an e-mail that said that the parliamentary and briefing delivery unit of the Home Office had informed it that</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/26" class="indent">&quot;We intend to publish this report in the autumn.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/27">I wonder whether the report is finished. I do not know the reason for the delay, and I wonder whether something is going on internally. Will the Minister explain what is happening and why there has suddenly been a memory hole? The report has disappeared, and I do not know why.</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/28">More seriously, when the report is published&mdash;I hope that it will be soon, in the autumn and not later in the year or next year&mdash;I hope that the Government will give serious consideration to all the growing scientific evidence. I refer them to an article on the BioMed Central website entitled &quot;Khat use as risk factor for psychotic disorders: A cross-sectional and case-control study in Somalia&quot;. I refer them also to the <i>British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology</i> in May 2005, and the article entitled &quot;Khat chewing is a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction: a case-control study&quot;. There is lots of growing evidence about the damaging effects on health, and we have also heard evidence from the community. In the words of one of my constituents speaking about Khat yesterday,</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/29" class="indent">&quot;This is a menace. It should be banned. It is dangerous and ruins family life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".183.1/30">That Somali-British mother is aware of the issues and the damage that is being caused in our communities.</p>

	<p pid=".186.1/1">No.</p>
	<p pid=".186.1/2">I believe strongly that the Government must now give serious consideration to the reports in their possession and to any forthcoming reports. The potential damage must be considered, because there is growing evidence of khat being exported. I have been studying the local press. A newspaper in Milton Keynes reported on <phrase class="date" code="2005-02-03">3 February</phrase> that people from Milton Keynes had been arrested in the United States. It said:</p>
	<p pid=".186.1/3" class="indent">&quot;Travellers from Milton Keynes have been turned back at US airports after trying to smuggle in the drug qat . . .</p>
	<p pid=".186.1/4" class="indent">It is understood armed American customs officers caught at least five &quot;mules&quot;&mdash;recruited in Milton Keynes&mdash;with the leafy narcotic in their luggage during the last 12 months.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".186.1/5">People try to fly the drug across the world because its potency when fresh lasts only for about 48 hours.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.188.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1950" speakername="Paul Goggins" colnum="188"  time="16:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h04.htm#50608h04_spnew6">
	<p pid=".188.1/1">I am reluctant to give way because the tradition of the House is that that is done with the agreement of the Member who secured the debate and the Minister. My hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South was clearly not happy to accept an intervention, so although I often make interventions myself, I regret that on this occasion I do not feel that I ought to accept one. The Member who secured the Adjournment debate has to be happy about interventions and agree to them.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/2">The work by Turning Point was commissioned specifically to map users' needs in terms of service provision. It will identify the treatment services currently provided, establish where there are gaps in service provision and consider examples of good practice&mdash;not just by drug agencies&mdash;in supporting khat users. The report will help the Home Office to address the concerns of the Somali community in respect of khat misuse as part of our wider diversity strategy. It will include a review of the availability of appropriate drug-prevention materials and information to raise awareness among practitioners and the community. Ultimately, the work should help local drug action teams and treatment services to develop good practice and support systems to deal with the real and current problems presented by khat misuse.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/3">The NACRO research is a longer-term piece of work and will look specifically at the impact of khat use among Somali communities living in the UK. That follows up a study carried out by Paul Griffiths for the Home Office in 1998, which was called &quot;Qat use in London: a study of qat use among a sample of Somalis living in London.&quot; That publication may be of interest to my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford, South.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/4">The new study will examine the issue in more depth and in particular will investigate levels of khat use, changes in level of use and any associations with other types of substance misuse, the relationship between khat use and crack use by some Somali women, and any offending behaviour associated with khat use. Some members of the Somali community have suggested that the misuse of khat is symptomatic of the social isolation of Somalis in Britain. Since the bulk of the community began arriving 12 years ago, the population has roughly trebled in size but continues to be segregated, living in our inner city areas.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/5">The community appears to be divided fairly evenly on whether khat should be a controlled substance. There are concerns about the lack of treatment for khat use and a lack of support for associated mental health problems, which we are now addressing by way of the research that I have mentioned already. However, there are also concerns about the underlying causes of khat misuse. For example, poor housing and overcrowding are said to be common among Somali families, making young people reluctant to go home and causing them to feel vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/6">There are higher levels of unemployment in the Somali community and there is a lack of recognition for professional and educational qualifications obtained in Somalia. We know that a disproportionately low number of Somali young people obtain the grades necessary to attend university, which can lead to low self-esteem and a perceived need to use stimulants as a form of escapism. Those issues will be covered by NACRO and Turning Point in their research, and we look forward to the publication of the relevant papers.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/7">On the question of whether khat ought to be brought under the control of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, the Government look to the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs for advice on whether to classify substances as controlled drugs. The ACMD last formally considered the misuse of khat in 1988 and advised that there was not sufficient evidence at that time of a social problem arising from its misuse in the United Kingdom to justify bringing the plant under the controls of the 1971 Act.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/8">The minutes of the ACMD's technical committee meeting from <phrase class="date" code="1988-01-11">11 January 1988</phrase> stated that an international conference in Madagascar in 1983 first raised global concerns about khat. The minute went on to note that the ACMD had been advised that although the plant grew naturally in east Africa, it had been informed by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew that it might be possible to grow the crop in greenhouse conditions and in the warmer climate of the south-west&mdash;for example, on the Isles of Scilly. I am pleased to say that domestic production has not become a reality, and I am sure that my hon. Friend is grateful for that.</p>
	<p pid=".188.1/9">As I said, the ACMD concluded in 1988 that khat misuse was not a problem in the UK and that therefore controls under the 1971 Act were not justified. I know that the ACMD has kept a watching brief over the issue of khat in more recent years. Before the general election, during consideration of the Drugs Bill, the Opposition tabled amendments to have khat classified as a class A drug. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">The then Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, resisted the move during the debate, but undertook to write to the ACMD to request a comprehensive study of khat, especially in the light of the research to which I have already referred. I am reliably informed that during its last meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-19">19 May</phrase>, the ACMD formally established a khat working group to consider the matter and carry out that important work. I am sure that my hon. Friend looks forward to the further deliberations of the ACMD, and I promise to ensure that his concerns and a transcript of this debate are brought to the attention of the advisory council.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.190.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" speakername="John Pugh" colnum="190"  time="16:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h05.htm#50608h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".190.1/1">I am delighted that the Under-Secretary of State for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" name="Andy Burnham">the Home Department, the hon. Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham)</phrase>, will respond to this debate. I watched him on his first outing at Home Office Questions, and he behaved with considerable panache. He surprised me, because I asked him an unscheduled question about identity fraud, which he could not have expected. He not only answered the question, which is laudable in a Minister and a little surprising, but he knew that I had asked previous questions on the subject. I formed the impression there and then that this is a Minister who means to do business and who does his homework.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/2">We all accept that the Minister has taken on a challenging role. I should like him today in so far as it is possible to help to solve a problem that relates to his role and that confronts me. I want him to provide an assurance that is fundamental to the debate about security and immigration. I recognise that it is not too easy for him to provide that particular assurance, but it is needed. It is especially important to those who want a balanced approach to such topics, and who are not, as some politicians appear to be, paranoid, xenophobic, in some cases racist, and alarmist.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/3">I want the Minister to provide an assurance that gives real credibility to the Government's approach to such issues as immigration and security. It is the assurance that the rules about entering the country are kept and kept properly. We are all aware from our constituency work that people who want to abide by the rules and who have legitimate cause to be in the country or to enter the country often find it difficult to do so. It is therefore particularly annoying when some people appear to abuse or to get around the rules.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/4">I suspect that it is less easy for the Minister to provide such an assurance when regional airports are considered. That belief has grown as a result of information that has reached me about my own regional airport, Liverpool John Lennon airport. It is my local airport, and I wish to see it prosper and thrive. It is typical of a new generation of regional airports. They are expanding, and there are more and more flights. Recent figures show how much some carriers flying to those airports are growing their business. The airport is typical of such regional airports, as it attracts largely the budget carriers, the no-frills airlines, rather than many scheduled flights. Owing to its dealing largely with non-scheduled flights, it is typical also because it does not have to pay the high levies paid by airports such as Heathrow, Gatwick and Birmingham for security, policing and all the other ramifications of being a major international airport. That is possibly where the problem starts.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/5">I knew that people had come in through Liverpool airport, had been detained and had subsequently absconded, and I knew broadly what the causes were. The problem was caused by inadequate numbers of immigration staff to cope with the flow of business. Business can be quite hectic and often at quite problematic times such as the middle of night, when some of the no-frills airlines are happy to use airspace, and some of the scheduled airlines are not.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/6">I knew that the problem stemmed in part from a lack of proper secure accommodation, and I knew also that there were poor arrangements for detaining people for reasons of immigration or security. I knew that the arrangements for removal were the subject of a private contract, which was itself the subject of certain negotiations, and that at times the contract or immigration activities had to be supplemented by special branch, which was not contracted to do so but had stepped into the breach.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/7">I accepted that there were problems for the airport. There were problems for the police, who had to deal with people in the community who had no right to be there. There were problems for airline security, which in some cases would not know who such people properly were. There were also problems for the airport owners, who would prefer everyone to enter and leave the airport properly identified and registered, and for the carriers, who of course were providing the business. There were a number of people in play, and several reasons why sorting out such matters would be problematic.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/8">Knowing that, I tabled some simple, straightforward questions to the Home Secretary, asking how many entrants to the country had arrived at John Lennon airport who had subsequently absconded. I asked some time ago, and I said that I wished to examine the figures for the past three years. I received the answer that information on the number of entrants at individual ports who had absconded or not reported back was available only by examining individual case files at a disproportionate cost. That led me to form the impression that the Home Office simply did not know.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/9">I did not believe the Home Office&mdash;it was probably safer not to do so&mdash;but had I done so, I would have been disappointed that it could not provide information that I already had, at least in part. I knew that there were absconders from Liverpool airport; I knew that they included people from a range of nationalities, including people of Asian, Chinese and Nigerian extraction; and I knew that some of them had subsequently attracted the attention of special branch&mdash;not, I am glad to say, in connection with terrorist offences, which would have been critical, but in connection with people trafficking and the like.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/10">By that stage, I was in possession of an e-mail from the chief immigration officer at Liverpool, which stated:</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/11" class="indent">&quot;The Immigration Officers working at JLA cannot, and should not, be held responsible for the high number of absconders we have there. They all work extremely well under adverse circumstances, often performing tasks outside their remit. The quality of casework is high&mdash;there are facilitators, imposters and holders of bogus documents arriving at this airport . . . Liverpool JLA is under-resourced in terms of staff and facilities and the staff are working under a great deal of pressure to maintain the integrity of the control. Indeed, the lack of detention facilities&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/12">this went on for some time, it being a critical problem&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/13" class="indent">&quot;has meant that the control has been compromised on many occasions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/14">So, I already knew that. I also knew that there was good evidence of what one could call recurrent scams. One was of tourists from Brazil on magical mystery tours. Each group arrived at Liverpool JLA with the same travel agency. They were regarded with some suspicion, but owing to the prevailing circumstances at the airport, they had to be discharged. They normally stayed for one night in a hotel&mdash;one of the cheapest but not the cheapest&mdash;and the following day most of the tour party had gone, presumably to tour elsewhere, and the only person remaining was the courier or the travel operator's representative. That scam was repeated on more than one occasion. I have every expectation that some of those people are abroad in this country, no doubt clutching plausible-looking Portuguese identity documents.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/15">Since raising the issue&mdash;I did not do so to be difficult, but in order to have the problem solved&mdash;I have been to the Home Office and spoken to those in charge of the airports, and I have been given assurances that new, more secure procedures will be put in place and that there will be a northern command. The airport people tell me that new systems will be developed that will make such problems a thing of the past. I am grateful for those assurances; I am pleased to see that new rigour.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/16">The point is made&mdash;I accept that it is valid&mdash;that much of the security that we need and require is fairly covert. People are tracked on flights by others not wearing uniforms who work for the Home Office or an agency, with a view to ensuring that we all travel safely and that there are no highly undesirable customers on our flights. I accept that not all security is up front, but the problem has not gone entirely. Since I made all those points, there has been an industrial dispute at Liverpool, this time involving the airport security&mdash;those who control the airport grounds. People working for Securicor&mdash;I believe that that is the firm and apologise if it is not&mdash;have complained about the low rate of wages that they are paid for doing a critical job.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/17">More embarrassingly, in the run-up to the general election, I was contacted by Mercury Press, which told me that the car park firm covering the vicinity of the airport was employing illegal immigrants. I did not discover that story myself. In other words, there were people walking around the airport car park of whose identity nobody could be truly certain. I accept the explanation that the airport gave me&mdash;some of those people should have been checked, and that the firm was checked and that its tender was by no means the lowest&mdash;but I remain to be convinced that we are entirely on top of the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/18">As a result of my interest in the area, I have received reports from other airports; I do not think that Liverpool is the only airport at which circumstances may be less than ideal. I have been told anecdotally of people wandering through places in Coventry airport where they ought not to be. I am reliably assured that in the past few weeks a Chinese woman arrived at John Lennon airport, refused to talk to anybody and presented no documents. She is now simply gone; we do not know where she is. I suspect that she is somewhere in the country, but she is not known by or identified to us. One can consider that case as a specific. One Chinese woman is not Osama bin Laden, but my point is that if the fact that that can happen is no secret to me it is certainly no secret to far more cunning people who run human trafficking or drugs into the country and have malevolent intentions.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/19">I require an assurance that the problem is recognised and that there is an intention to address it seriously. Most informed opinion would say that people who wish to get into the country for no good reason would not go through the fearsome apparatus that we have set up in places such as Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester or Birmingham. They will use no-thrills carriers and expanding airports. When things tighten up at Liverpool, they will move to other expanding airports. Blackpool is one airport that wishes to expand.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/20">Immigration and security need to expand just as fast or the regional airport will become the Achilles heel of the system. That means that a number of things should happen, which most of those airports would recognise, as would most of the staff working at them. It means a review of funding for the security arrangements and immigration facilities. It means a review of staffing&mdash;basically, more people are required. One of the great problems in Liverpool was the shift pattern, which meant that an employee would have to leave somebody whom they had detained in order to deal with another flight coming in. I believe that that situation has been rectified; I sincerely hope that it has.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/21">The situation at Liverpool could just as easily be replicated at Blackpool or at any other regional airport that wishes to expand three, four or five years down the line. We need better integration of security. One of the problems at Liverpool, where a number of organisations were involved with security in one way or another&mdash;car park security, airport security, immigration security, special branch, local police and a range of other people&mdash;and one of the anomalies of the immigration episode relating to the car park was that some of the people one expected to be informed and know about such situations were not informed by the local police. Sometimes one hand does not know what the other hand is doing.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/22">Fundamentally, we need the problem to be taken seriously. One element requires significant resource commitment. When somebody is picked up as problematic, difficult and not having proper documentation&mdash;in other words, under suspicion&mdash;then, given that the person has committed an offence, there needs to be a capacity to progress rapidly to prosecution where possible. We need prosecution services to back up detention arrangements&mdash;if I may put it like that&mdash;so that the reputation of the airport and of England internationally is one of dealing forcefully with people who deliberately intend to breach arrangements.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/23">I am talking not about asylum seekers, but about people who seek illegal entry into the country knowing that they are doing so. In Liverpool only a few weeks ago, there was a case of a Nigerian who arrived with a Belgian passport. We would all agree that Belgian passports are among those most commonly used by people who arrive with fraudulent intent. The said person was sent out of Liverpool and back to France, from where they had come. They were not prosecuted there and then in Liverpool, although perhaps they could not have been; I do not know the circumstances as precisely as I might. However, I do know that after they were sent back they reappeared a few days later with the same document at Stansted airport, and that there was the same outcome. Had that person been more forcefully addressed at one port of call, they would not have appeared at the other.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/24">The last thing that I want to do is discourage the expansion of regional airports, which are huge economic drivers in many regions and can do a great deal for regeneration. I hope that John Lennon, Coventry and Blackpool airports do the business in their areas and become a basis for increased prosperity. However, it takes only one major incident to destroy all the good work and public relations of a good, thriving local airport. At any airport, the under-resourcing of the immigration&mdash;or any other&mdash;department, and inadequate contracts with private firms that are supposed to provide security, will ultimately undermine sound immigration policy and sound security.</p>
	<p pid=".190.1/25">I do not come here in a spirit of aggression or of trying to find difficulties, but with a problem that has, as it were, arrived on my desk and that I have endeavoured to solve. We ought not to mask that problem, but to address it. I look forward to the Minister's reply and hope that he will accept that we have a problem, although he may describe it differently. I hope that we can all join together in considering how it can be addressed and in believing, as I am sure we all do, that it ought to be addressed, and addressed fairly rapidly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-06-08.196.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1678" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="196"  time="16:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050608/halltext/50608h05.htm#50608h05_spnew2">
	<p pid=".196.1/1">I can a little. The system will provide much better management of information on passenger flows through Liverpool, and it will be rolled out to the airport before the end of this year. It is a staged process, which is happening with other airports&mdash;Bristol, Coventry, Humberside, Leeds, Bradford, Prestwick and Newcastle&mdash;being the priorities. All other permanently staffed non-POISE enabled airports will have the system by <phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2005</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/2">The duty to provide port facilities for the operation of immigration control is in section 25 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. That provision commenced in April 2003 and obliges the manager of a control port&mdash;a port where a control area has been designated under the Immigration Act 1971&mdash;to provide free of charge to the Secretary of State such facilities at the port as he may direct as being necessary.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/3">Each port is unique, and a dialogue is maintained between the immigration managers and port control managers to provide, refurbish or extend facilities in line with the volume and nature of passenger traffic arriving at the location. Solutions may be devised and implemented during the project, which is targeted to complete work on <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2005</phrase>. Some work has already been undertaken, and more is ongoing, to improve the provision of services and service delivery at regional airports. For example, as the hon. Gentleman may know, the immigration service moved to new accommodation at Liverpool John Lennon airport in April, and that provided a larger immigration hall and new office facilities.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/4">The hon. Gentleman mentioned absconders. A great deal of work is being done on that and is being put into detention capability at airports across the UK. The new escort and holding room contract, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2005-05-01">1 May</phrase>, provides both an enhanced response time to escorting requests and additional support for regional airports. Holding room cover has been extended to include provision for 24-hour cover at both Manchester and Ramsgate, and in addition arrangements are now being effected to extend contractual coverage to Liverpool, with a new temporary holding facility becoming operational from <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July</phrase>, which is in about three weeks.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/5">To conclude, all these steps are contributing to significant progress in securing the UK's borders. Asylum applications fell from 8,770 in October 2002 to 4,225 in September 2003, a drop of 52 per cent. That success has continued; monthly applications have fallen a further 22 per cent. in the first quarter of 2005, compared with the first quarter of 2004, and are now down to the lowest monthly levels since March 1997. That has been achieved by deploying a wide range of measures, some of which I have outlined today, to strengthen our border controls both in the UK and abroad.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/6">Having said that, I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are not complacent. I think that he wanted an assurance that we will continue to keep the problem under review and deploy resources where necessary. The Government have a significant number of steps under way to improve further the security of our borders, such as the e-borders scheme, which will further develop the technology used to monitor passenger flows into the country. Other procedures under way include a MATRA&mdash;a multi-agency and risk assessment group&mdash;at each airport. I assure him that Liverpool has such a team, bringing together all the diverse players in the airport environment to put security at the very heart of what is done. Liverpool now has such a team in operation, and we believe that it will continue to enhance the security there; issues raised can be addressed through that group.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/7">I shall write to the hon. Gentleman with more detail. I congratulate him on securing this debate; it is an important subject and he has raised it assiduously. He and I, as north-west MPs, are as one in wanting the highest standards of security at our regional airports.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".196.1/9" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at Five o'clock.</p>
