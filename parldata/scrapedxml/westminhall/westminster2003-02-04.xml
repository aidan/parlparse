	<p pid=".1.3/1">I am grateful to be called to address an issue that is of such widespread public concern. In the previous Session, 128 hon. Members of all parties joined me in signing an early-day motion calling for a public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four young soldiers at Deepcut barracks in Surrey. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/897" name="Michael Jabez Foster">the Member for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster)</phrase>, one of whose constituents died, regrets that he cannot be present today and sends his apologies. The Minister knows of his interest in the case, but my hon. Friend is where I should be&mdash;at an important meeting of the Standards and Privileges Committee.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/2">Since last October, the families of Sean Benton, James Collinson, Geoff Gray and Cheryl James have been joined in their quest for a full investigation of Army deaths by the families and friends of Paul Cochrane, Ross Collins, Richard Donkin, Tony Green, Dale Little, Aled Martin Jones, Alfie Manship, Gary Riches, Richard Robertson, Alan Sharples, David Shipley and Christopher Young. The issue goes far beyond Deepcut barracks. Young soldiers are dying needlessly in barracks in Great Britain and Northern Ireland, in Germany and Bosnia. Whatever the circumstances of their deaths, those young people joined the Army full of hope and expectations of a great career. Their families grieve for the waste of young lives. It is a matter of worry for every Army family and every hon. Member.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/3">I wish to pay tribute to the courage of the mothers and fathers who have placed the intimate circumstances of the deaths of their sons and daughters in the public domain. I have been overwhelmed by the love that has given those families strength. The force of their determination has broken through a wall of silence. Despite their loss and profound grief, the families have told their story and acted with great dignity. They are bound by a common search for truth, but also by the conviction that it is worth persevering if other families may be spared the loss and heartache that they have suffered.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/4">Whatever the cause of death, families in such a situation experience hardships over and above their immediate loss. In many cases, they were far away from where the death occurred and were usually excluded from the scene of the death. They have experienced great difficulties in discovering how their children died, and they felt that the Army establishment closed ranks against them. Hon. Members will be well aware that it was the pressure of the families that was instrumental in persuading Surrey police service to extend or re-open investigations into the four deaths at Deepcut barracks. I am not seeking to pre-empt the findings of that inquiry in any way.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/5">I am pleased that the Surrey chief constable and his team have drawn from the Macpherson report and made considerable efforts to involve the relatives and their legal representatives in the investigation. Uniquely, that courtesy has also been extended to hon. Members who have expressed an interest in the outcome. It is not for the police to reach conclusions. In due course, the results of their investigation in each case will be passed, in the first instance to the Director of Public Prosecutions, if appropriate, and the coroner.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/6">In those cases where an inquest has already been completed, it will be for the coroner to decide whether to re-open the case on the basis of fresh evidence. The chief constable is acutely aware of the public interest in the investigation and has been at pains to demonstrate the service's resolve to identify systems issues in the course of the inquiry. In the jargon of modern policing, his officers have established a &quot;learning account&quot; on which our colleagues on the Defence Committee, which is looking into such matters, could draw, as could a wider public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/7">I pay tribute to the journalists in press and broadcasting media who have encouraged the families to tell their stories and to bring the matters to the attention of the general public. I have been taken, too, by the spontaneous generosity of the experts who have given their services freely to assist the families in their search for truth. The insight of forensic specialists, legal advisers, public relations professionals and academics, as well as that of agencies such as the Commission for Racial Equality and the Equal Opportunities Commission, has been enormously important. I have benefited from the input of hon. Members from parties across the political spectrum, as well as from my own. This is not a party political matter, but a matter of national importance and interest.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/8">I want to develop further the case for a tribunal of inquiry to be established under the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921. I believe that there is an overwhelming public interest in establishing a judicial inquiry with the powers necessary to appoint investigators, hear evidence and determine the truth. There is a feeling throughout the country, whether or not it is justified, that complacency and cover-ups are rife in the deaths and other issues. I believe that public confidence can be restored only by an inquiry whose independence is beyond doubt.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/9">I am aware that the Ministry of Defence is not generally well disposed towards public inquiries. However, no one is looking at an inquiry on the scale of the Saville tribunal&mdash;a very necessary one in my view. A modest inquiry can satisfy the required terms of reference. I am not looking to undermine the Army or to challenge military discipline. On the contrary, an Army looking to the future has everything to gain by co-operating fully and learning from such a tribunal. I want a positive and open-minded response from the Minister. I hope that he can find words to express his support for the families of victims and understand some of the frustration that they have experienced. I trust that he can honestly acknowledge the scale of the problem and, with his ministerial colleagues, undertake to engage in a dialogue that can assist in the search for truth.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/10">An inquiry into Army deaths must listen to all those families who have so far expressed doubt and suspicion about the death of their loved ones, and it must be prepared to hear new cases. When a fresh investigation is required, it should be conducted wholly independently of the Army and the original investigating force. The inquiry should be UK-wide and cover all sections and all ranks of Her Majesty's armed services. It should invite the views of victims and the opinions of experts. It should meet in public and publish its findings.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/11">The inquiry needs to address two issues. First, it must examine and make recommendations concerning the environment in which the deaths are occurring, so that deaths may be prevented in future. Secondly, it must study and make recommendations that will provide a prompt and effective remedy.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/12">On the environment in which the deaths occur, I make a number of observations. Each year, there are around 9,000 new recruits to the armed services. Up to a third of the total are child soldiers. The policy of recruiting under-18s must be re-examined. The Ministry of Defence has a general duty of care towards employees, especially when potential misuse of lethal weapons by under-18s is involved. Too many young recruits at barracks such as Catterick are dying through a lack of adequate supervision and proper pastoral care.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/13">In October last year, the Minister responded to public pressure by asking external consultants to conduct a tri-service review of internal practices involved in initial training of non-officer recruits. However, some of the incidents went beyond the period of initial training. While we welcome the publication of new research, the transparency of the process leaves something to be desired. The families of the victims have yet to be approached for their views. According to Ministry figures, between 1984 and 2001 there were 445 recorded suicides in the armed services, which is too many, and the figure is disproportionately high for a disciplined and secure service environment.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/14">There must be better safeguards against suicide and self-harm which provide in-house assistance independent of the chain of command. Too often, the problem has been that a person has to complain about his bullying to the person who is the bully. Military discipline and punishment must not override the protection of soldiers at risk. Doctors and welfare professionals must be given appropriate standing. They must be independent of the chain of command.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/15">After the locum at Deepcut was asked to leave last November, I was surprised to discover that the barracks have used no fewer than 32 civilian medical practitioners in the past three years. In many regiments, there is evidence of a culture of extreme bullying, routine violence and sexual harassment that constitutes torture and inhuman and degrading treatment. Preaching zero tolerance from the sidelines is no longer enough; the perpetrators must be hunted out and prosecuted relentlessly, and such practices eliminated.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/16">In too many cases in which criminal offences have been committed, the Army is perceived to clam up, close ranks and protect its own. It must demonstrate through exemplary action that there can be no impunity for perpetrators. Whistleblowers should be encouraged, and potential witnesses guaranteed protection. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye pointed out, the Army has taken a cavalier attitude towards coroners' inquests. Although it recorded the decisions made, it did not take notes of what took place&mdash;or at least did not keep them.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/17">On the means by which to provide an effective remedy, at the most simple level we need effective monitoring and the provision of statistics concerning deaths, injuries and internal discipline. The pervasive culture of secrecy within the military is entirely inappropriate for modern management, and it fosters abuse. According to the Minister's headline figure, 1,748 members of service personnel have died from non-natural causes in or around barracks since 1990. It is evident that a large number of those are victims of road death, as traffic accidents have been included in the total. However, it is clear that at least 100 of those deaths were firearms-related, non-combat fatalities, but I have found it well nigh impossible to get a clear picture of how, why and in what circumstances they took place, and what disciplinary action, if any, was taken.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/18">Bereaved families and the local media have named 23 victims at Catterick barracks, but the Ministry of Defence has been consistently unwilling to provide information that would enable the public to identify clusters of suspicious deaths. The information is not held centrally or in the form requested and, it is said, could be provided only at a disproportionate cost. I hope that public concern will cause the Minister and the Department to change their attitudes, and that the Minister can give an undertaking that he will provide such information.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/19">If deaths are to be prevented, we should establish a complaints procedure that is independent of the chain of command. It is worth considering the case for a new body that would provide oversight. Perhaps there could be an inspectorate of the armed services. The European Court of Human Rights now insists that, in cases of death involving members of the security forces, the independence of the investigation must be structurally guaranteed. The Deepcut investigation has led to some adjustments to the standard operating procedures allowing for police primacy over investigations of suspicious deaths, but I do not believe that they go far enough. If bullying and other malpractice is to be eliminated, there is a strong argument for putting serious assaults, rape and sexual harassment of males and females under the same scrutiny, outside of the police force.</p>
	<p pid=".1.3/20">When criminal charges can be brought, there must be provision for greater public scrutiny of decisions made by the prosecuting authorities. The key to justice being seen to be done at all levels is the involvement of the families of victims at a very early date. Uniquely among the cases that I have identified, the family of Tony Green at last saw his killer prosecuted by the courts, but they had no input into the decision to charge the perpetrator with manslaughter through gross negligence. They had no involvement in the prosecutorial service and no access to information. Particularly at a time when the Government are encouraging public debate&mdash;</p>

	<p pid=".5.0/1">With the greatest respect, I am not questioning or challenging any verdict; I am talking about the family.</p>
	<p pid=".5.0/2">At a time when the Government encourage public debate on the introduction of a five-year mandatory sentence for the mere possession of a handgun, is the Minister surprised that the family consider that a two-year sentence adds insult to injury?</p>
	<p pid=".5.0/3">There is already a public debate about the procedures and verdicts that are available to a coroner's court, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hastings and Rye has referred to those in correspondence with the Department. However, that debate also concerns Northern Ireland. The relatives of victims of army deaths have been ill served by an inquest system that is at least 50 years behind the times. There is an issue about a coroner's powers to demand documents and to compel witnesses. There is an issue about the disclosure of witness statements prior to an inquest hearing.</p>
	<p pid=".5.0/4">There are issues about the provision of legal representation for bereaved families at public expense, the training and regulation of coroners, the role of coroner's assistants and the financial resources available to coroners. The latter is especially pressing in Northern Ireland. The shortcomings of the Deepcut inquiry have thrown up several issues relating to the practice of forensic experts. It is remarkable that there is no adequate system for the training or regulation of forensic pathologists or ballistic experts.</p>
	<p pid=".5.0/5">I have tried to give a flavour of the issues that must be addressed. I have tried to reflect suggestions and proposals put forward by the families of those most concerned. On our behalf, and looking to the future, the Army asks a great deal of its young recruits, and we have a responsibility to ensure their protection. The number of Army deaths speaks for itself. There are clear public interest reasons for establishing a tribunal of inquiry, and, to restore public confidence, that must be conducted independently under the direction of a senior judicial figure.</p>
	<p pid=".5.0/6">If the Minister is not prepared to concede my case&mdash;and those made by hon. Members of all parties&mdash;for a full inquiry, I hope that he will give an undertaking to investigate cases brought before him, to remove barriers to the free flow of information and to set out a programme of transparent measures that will address issues that are identified.</p>

	<p pid=".5.3/1">Thank you for calling me in this debate, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I have a clear reason for being here, and that is to highlight the case of my constituent Des James whose daughter, Cheryl Marie James, died on <phrase class="date" code="1995-11-27">27 November 1995</phrase> at the age of 18. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">The hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> clearly highlighted the general strategic points that relate to that case and covered the issue in general. I shall support his points and his request for action by highlighting that individual case. I do not intend to take long but by your leave, Mr. Deputy Speaker, I shall be specific about what happened to Cheryl James.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/2">Cheryl James's parents are not confident about the open verdict on her death that was given at the inquest, and that is the heart of my concern. It is important to underline that the parents do not necessarily say that the open verdict was an unreasonable conclusion, but they cannot be confident that a different conclusion would not have been reached if there had been a more detailed inquiry. Des James has highlighted specific concerns that I wish to put on the record. I hope that the Minister will assure me that he takes seriously the request of the hon. Member for Hull, North and myself for an independent and extensive inquiry into Cheryl James's death and into the deaths of others.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/3">The heart of Des James's concern is that his daughter should not have been armed and alone at the gate when she died. The Army confirmed that in a letter to him and described the procedures at the time as having been &quot;misunderstood&quot;. In addition, it took the Army eight hours to inform Des James of his daughter's death, which is a very long time. The family did not even know the name of the camp commander in 1995, because he did not contact them. They have only recently found out that it is Nigel Barry Josling.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/4">Mr. James is concerned about how the family were treated with regard to that crucial information. Some family members learned that Cheryl James had died by listening to the news, which shows laxity about how individuals were contacted. It is not right that people find out from the news that they have lost a close family member. Des James was not even given the opportunity to identify Cheryl. A local undertaker returned her body to the village on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-01">Friday 1 December</phrase>, so for the four days following her death the family hung on to the hope that there had been a misidentification.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/5">Nobody from Surrey police contacted the James's family or visited them at any time following Cheryl's death. The first time that the family spoke to the police was in June 2002&mdash;some seven years after the death. It is peculiar that the parents were not involved earlier. The greatest single concern, however, is that the only people to have claimed throughout that the death was a suicide were Army representatives. The board of inquiry concluded that Cheryl James committed suicide, but others are more sceptical. The James family are not saying that it was not suicide, but they feel that the evidence was not convincing. The inquest recorded an open verdict, which suggests a degree of support for that view. The James family have evidence that the Army documented the death as suicide one week before the coroner's court was convened. The family worry that there was a desire to come to that conclusion more quickly than the details of the case implied.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/6">The procedural chaos at the time of the death is another worry. Immediately after the death, there was discussion about whether the Surrey police should be involved in the inquiry. However, the relationship between the Army and the police should be clarified. The case for an independent inquiry in all such cases is watertight. At the very least, the James family do not feel that justice was done in the public eye. There should have been a clear differentiation in the inquiry between the Army and those who decided the verdict.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/7">The family do not understand why an apparently thorough initial investigation was completed in only two weeks, but we have already had six months of a new inquiry and it is still not complete. If I had been Cheryl James's parent, I would probably have drawn the same conclusion as Des James and asked the Army the same questions. How can the Army give me a watertight assurance that what it claims took place actually did? How can the Army assure me that there was no bullying and that there were no extraneous circumstances leading to Cheryl James's death?</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/8">I hope that I would take Des James's circumspect and measured approach in not pointing the finger of blame explicitly at the Army and by not claiming a different cause of death. His comments have been logical, objective and measured. However, I share the concern that he harbours. If he were able to speak in this debate, he would probably say, &quot;Convince me that I have nothing to worry about and that the tragic death of my daughter was indeed a suicide. Convince me that there is not an endemic problem in the way in which our young people are treated in the Army that caused Cheryl to take her own life. Perhaps most importantly, convince me that there was not a more sinister cause of death.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/9"><i></i>Des James does not hate the Army or think that it is a corrupt or rotten institution. The Army does a difficult job and, especially in these troubled times, most people are happy to pay their taxes for the services that it provides. However, even the Army should accept that uncertainties such as the ones that we have discussed work against it in terms of recruitment and also against the interests of natural justice. The parents in these cases have a right to expect more considered and cast-iron conclusions on the deaths of their sons and daughters.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/10">The Minister should listen seriously to the examples of Cheryl James and others, and move in the direction suggested by the hon. Member for Hull, North. An independent inquiry into the deaths would aim to provide certainty for the parents about what actually happened. The inquiry would be effective only if the Army is duty bound to provide information in an upfront, clear and non-evasive way, which it would probably be prepared to do were the mechanisms of an inquiry in place.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/11">What is the Minister's perspective on the request for systemic change to ensure that we do not need debates such as this one to get to the truth? Is it possible to set up an arbiter or other independent inspectorate of the armed forces? In the old phrase, if people have done nothing wrong, there is nothing to fear. An inspectorate would reassure young people who are thinking of joining the Army and their parents, and the public at large, that joining the Army does not expose an individual to particular dangers and stress which could be avoided by openness.</p>
	<p pid=".5.3/12">I am pleased that the hon. Member for Hull, North secured the debate and that the Minister is willing to reply to it. Above all else, for the sake of parents and our young people joining the Army, I hope that we can make significant progress by regarding this debate as a watershed. We seek nothing more dangerous than the truth. If we find that truth, we can clear up question marks left by the past and ensure that such questions do not arise in future.</p>

	<p pid=".8.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> on securing this debate and on his wider campaigning efforts with the families who have lost loved ones at such a young age. My primary aim is to raise the case of a constituent whose death occurred 11 years ago. In so doing, I am aware of the difficulties of investigating events after such a long time. However, there are striking similarities between my constituent's death and those that we have discussed, and they merit further examination.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/2">I am adding my voice to the plea for an inquiry so that questions can be asked and, I hope, answered. As things stand, we do not know what happened in many of the cases, and that is the most frustrating aspect for the families concerned. There is a perception that there is no robust and effective mechanism in place in the Army to ensure proper scrutiny of unexpected deaths.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/3">The Ministry of Defence and Ministers say that there has been no cover up of any sort, but that has not convinced aggrieved families, the members of which have become increasingly angry about what they regard as a failure to account for their loss. They feel let down by a general lack of concern and what they feel to be a haste to suggest suicide as an explanation and quickly draw a line under the deaths. As a consequence, many people believe that the service that these young people gave to their country has counted for very little.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/4">Alfie Manship was a 20-year-old young man from Ayr, who died on <phrase class="date" code="1992-04-06">6 April 1992</phrase>. I pay a special tribute to Alfie's mother, Jan Manship Milligan, who now lives in the USA, but who has never stopped campaigning with instinct and determination to get at the truth of her son's death. Alfie's case was raised soon after his death by Phil Gallie, my predecessor in Ayr; he was not satisfied by the answer he received and he too believes that the case should be looked at again. For a long time, Alfie's mother thought&mdash;like a number of other families&mdash;that she was fighting an individual battle. She has, however, communicated with the other families and joined their campaign. She was stunned to hear about the more recent deaths. In her own words:</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Reading the story of Private Gray's death brought shivers to my spine. You see, on <phrase class="date" code="1992-04-06">6 April 1992</phrase> my son Alfie died in exactly the same manner and I do not just mean similar&mdash;I mean exactly. He had also been on guard duty, he had two gunshot wounds to the head, both of which would have killed him outright. However, only one bullet casing was found.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/6">Alfie died in Osnabruck barracks, Germany, but just before that he had left what is now known as Deepcut barracks, where he was bullied to the extent that he needed treatment at Aldershot hospital. By the time that Alfie reached Germany he was in a far more relaxed state of mind. According to his mother, he was coping well and had put the bullying behind him.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/7">Mrs. Manship Milligan was informed of her son's death by a police officer and an officer from the Territorial Army in Ayr, but they could not tell her about the cause of death. She spoke, therefore, on the telephone to an officer at Osnabruck, who told her, &quot;One bullet, one body, end of story.&quot; It had already been decided that Alfie's death was suicide and a post-mortem was carried out before his mother was informed about his death. The Minister stated, in an answer to a parliamentary question, that an internal investigation into Alfie's death had taken two weeks. In Mrs. Manship Milligan's view, however, it was clear from the officer's words that the result was a foregone conclusion. That was not just a despicable way to speak to someone who had just suffered bereavement, it was patently not the end of the story.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/8">There are various contradictions and inconsistencies in what has been said about Alfie's death, which I believe merit investigation. It was three years before the family saw a copy of the post-mortem report. Mrs. Manship Milligan obtained a copy of that report from someone who was unhappy with the finding of suicide. At the time of Alfie's death, the Army claimed that he had been depressed and drinking heavily. It is an alarming thought that, although the Army indicated that he was drunk, he had nevertheless been handed an SA80 and sent about his duties. The fact is that the subject's body contained no alcohol or other substances, according to toxicology tests performed during the post-mortem. His hands were also free and clean, indicating that there was no gunpowder residue.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/9">In answer to another parliamentary question, the Minister stated that Sapper Manship died from a single gunshot wound to the head while on guard duty at Woolwich barracks, Osnabruck. However, the funeral director informed Alfie's mother that there appeared to be two bullet wounds: there was a hole in his cheek and under his tongue and there was an exit wound at the top of his head, which had also been mentioned by the doctor who declared that Alfie was dead. The pathologist had advised that there was also one at the base of his skull. It appears that Alfie's weapon was not checked to ascertain whether it had been fired.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/10">I am dwelling to some extent on the details of this case, but I could say more if time allowed. The more recent cases are under police investigation and therefore it is not appropriate to comment on the details, or to try to pre-empt an outcome.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/11">Alfie's mother was denied an inquest in 1992 because it was deemed not to be in the public interest. The procurator fiscal in Scotland will not hold a fatal accident inquiry if a death has not occurred in Scotland. Alfie's family did not get the opportunity for these contradictions to be raised in public. There was no police investigation. I have spoken at length to Alfie's mother: she knows that re-opening his case and examining it in the context of similar deaths will not bring Alfie back, but doing so may enable her to put her son to rest at last.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/12">If there was a sinister cause behind any of these deaths, a thorough and independent inquiry may prevent the loss of other young lives, which is extremely important. At the very least, it might restore parents' confidence that they can send their children to the Army in the knowledge that they will be safe. My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North referred in detail to the Army's duty of care. I was pleased to hear that the Defence Committee will carry out an investigation, and I look forward to welcoming its report at the appropriate time. However, there is a case for a public inquiry that would enable an in-depth and broad report to be produced, as outlined in my hon. Friend's remit.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/13">I have 16 years' experience of supporting the victims of bullying and harassment. I know how the abuse of power operates. I know the isolating and secretive mechanisms that are used to make it impossible&mdash;especially for what are, essentially, captive victims&mdash;to protest. The victims are left with nowhere to go if they have no confidence that action will be taken against the perpetrator, and especially if they are not believed. The families of the victims feel that they have not been believed and that they have nowhere to go. This matter is important, and it must be addressed as there is widespread concern about it.</p>
	<p pid=".8.0/14">If any parent in this Room were to have any doubts about the circumstances of their child's death, they would leave no stone unturned until they received satisfactory answers. I look forward with optimism to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid=".10.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I had unsuccessfully sought a debate along similar lines, and I am therefore pleased that we are able finally to discuss this distressing and disturbing issue.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/2">There is widespread concern at Westminster and among the general public about the worryingly high number of non-combat deaths at Army barracks over recent years. We have heard in detail about the matter from the hon. Gentleman. That concern is reflected in the fact that hon. Members of all parties wish to speak in this debate and have signed the hon. Gentleman's early-day motion 63. It calls for a full and independent public inquiry into the Army deaths at Deepcut barracks and elsewhere, and it has attracted 122 signatures.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/3">I fear that public confidence in the Army and the Ministry of Defence has been badly affected by the concerns that have come to light about the deaths at Deepcut Army barracks of four young soldiers over the past seven years, and by how the Ministry of Defence has dealt with the issue. The alarming statistics with regard to the number of non-combat deaths of soldiers at UK Army barracks has added to this increasing public concern.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/4">The concern is increasing in my constituency. I have a constituency interest in this debate because the family of a young soldier who was found dead at Deepcut in March 2002 reside in my constituency. Their son, James Collinson, was aged only 17 when he was found dead last year. I know that his family are listening closely to the debate because they, too, seek answers to what happened to their son and to all the other soldiers.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/5">Hon. Members will be aware that there is a continuing investigation into the four deaths at Deepcut. I do not, of course, want to say anything that could impinge on the outcome of that investigation, but the significant concerns about how the Army and the Ministry of Defence have dealt with the deaths at Deepcut and elsewhere must be aired today.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/6">I suggest that the Army's handling of these non-combat deaths has been entirely inadequate, and that the Ministry of Defence procedures for dealing with such deaths in Army barracks raise significant concerns that can be properly addressed only by a full and independent public inquiry. The James Collinson case is one example. The Army was quick to reach the conclusion that his death was a suicide. When his father had to contact Deepcut to ascertain the status of the investigation shortly after his son was buried, an official there told him, &quot;What investigation? One bullet, one body&mdash;draw your own conclusion.&quot; That eerily echoes the information that was given to the family of Alfie Manship. It is a disgraceful way to treat bereaved families of Army soldiers.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/7">The Army rushed to such a conclusion even though no proper investigation or forensic post-mortem had been conducted. There had been no securing of the crime scene, as evidenced by the fact that about eight to nine months later, James Collinson's cap badge was found in the Deepcut perimeter. It had somehow become separated from his cap, which was on his head at the time of his death. Something is surely wrong with a system that allows such conclusions to be reached without any proper investigation. There would be no proper continuing police investigation if it had not been for the efforts of the Collinson family and all the other families involved. That, too, is nothing short of a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/8">The fact that the Collinson family had to exhume their son's body in December last year to try to secure a proper post-mortem starkly illustrates the total inadequacy of the initial approach at Deepcut. That was shortly before what would have been James Collinson's 18th birthday. It is unacceptable that the Collinson family had to go through such an ordeal. I would be interested to hear the Minister explain to us all why that had to happen. Why was there no proper post-mortem in the first place? The Collinson family and others have had to fight tooth and nail to have the deaths of their sons and daughters properly investigated. Will the Minister explain why that was so?</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/9">The Collinson family and other families involved in this sorry saga had to deal with what they regard as the MOD's excessive secrecy. There have been disturbing developments over the course of their campaign to secure justice. The Minister will know that the Surrey police recently instructed Tayside police to visit the Collinson family home to sweep for electronic bugs. That arose from concerns expressed by the Collinson family and other families. The fact that the Surrey police acted on those concerns shows how seriously the Surrey and Tayside police forces took them. The results of the sweep appear to be inconclusive. The MOD's response, which appeared in a local newspaper, <i>The Courier and Advertiser</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-27">27 January 2003</phrase>, is somewhat curious. Its report states:</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/10" class="indent">&quot;However, when contacted by The Courier an MoD spokesperson was quick to deny the suggestion. 'This is somewhat misguided', he said. 'The army do not go round planting bugs in houses. They are subject to the same laws as everybody else. The military would not bug anyone&mdash;only the Home Secretary can sanction such an activity.'&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/11">I find the MOD's response, as reported in <i>The Courier and Advertiser</i>, somewhat ambiguous, if not curious. Will the Minister reassure the Collinson family and other families that no UK Department or agency under the responsibility of a UK Department has been involved in any bugging of phones?</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/12">The hon. Member for Hull, North rightly said that the MOD has a duty of care, particularly to young soldiers in its charge. Serious questions have been raised as to whether that duty has been properly exercised. The extensive concerns now raised can be properly dealt with only by a full and independent public inquiry. I, too, welcome the Defence Committee inquiry, but it is no substitute for such a public inquiry, which is the least that the Collinson family and other families&mdash;not to mention the public at large&mdash;deserve. Basic notions of justice dictate the necessary approach.</p>
	<p pid=".10.0/13">These young soldiers joined the Army to serve their country, and the military establishment has treated their families shabbily, which is a disgrace. The circumstances surrounding the deaths of these soldiers must now be properly investigated.</p>

	<p pid=".12.0/1">I, too, shall highlight a particular case, which was brought to my attention only yesterday as a result of the publicity surrounding Deepcut. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I had not realised until yesterday, as I said, that a family in my constituency was affected by a much earlier case.</p>
	<p pid=".12.0/2">Paul Stanley Lowith was training in the military police in Chichester in 1978. Aged 17, he was the youngest of five orphans. His sister, who was just 20 and had recently become a mother, was aware that he was unhappy, and she suspected that he was being bullied. She thought that his mood was strange because he was used to being away from home; like the rest of the family, he had been to boarding school.</p>
	<p pid=".12.0/3">All his sister knows is that one night, her 17-year-old brother allegedly took some live ammunition shells, went to the Army firing range and shot himself. The family was told that he committed suicide. His funeral was given full military honours and his military records were sealed for 30 years. The family requested a copy of the death certificate and the coroner's report, neither of which was made available to them.</p>
	<p pid=".12.0/4">I have already said enough for everyone to realise that several questions need to be answered. This was a young man without a mother and father, whose guardian believed that the Army would make him a man. Bullying may well have taken place, or perhaps the official version of his death is correct. The truth is that the family do not know, but no evidence was presented to support the official view.</p>
	<p pid=".12.0/5">I spoke to the young man's niece on the phone this morning. She is now in her 20s and spoke about the culture of secrecy. The Army, as an institution, must open up and fully answer the families' questions. The world has changed in the past 25 years. This family must know what happened to their brother and they need to have confidence in the information that they were given. For their own peace of mind, they need closure on the issue. Young men and women joining the Army need to know that it can deal with these cases openly, in a way that is subject to public inspection. They and their parents should have confidence that they will be afforded the care that we have heard about in the debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.13.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1238" speakername="Martin Smyth" colnum="13"  time="010:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h01.htm#30204h01_spnew9">
	<p pid=".13.0/1">I welcome the opportunity to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/776" name="Patsy Calton">the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton)</phrase>, who said that things have changed in the past 25 years, as all of us recognise when we look at what is happening in society. Although there may be a place for measures to train young soldiers for what they may have to face, people will not accept bullying as part of that system.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> on securing the debate. On opposite sides of the House, we often spar, but we are at one on this matter: we both want the best for our armed forces and their families.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/3">Paul Robert Cochrane died in July 2001. I had a visit shortly afterwards from his senior officer, who assured me that there was no bullying in the forces. As I served in the Army cadets and have known a number of people in the services over the years, I took that with a pinch of salt. However, it must be put in the context of the publicity. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1146" name="Sandra Osborne">the hon. Member for Ayr (Sandra Osborne)</phrase> said, we were told that a person was killed with one bullet, yet there was evidence that there were other bullets. That is the most remarkable form of suicide I have ever come across. These matters must be faced with much more realism than they have been.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/4">I am the Member of Parliament for the constituency adjacent to that in which the Cochranes live. I have met them; they were in touch with me early in the proceedings. They continued the campaign with my colleague in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Sir Reg Empey, and with our defence spokesman, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/859" name="Jeffrey M Donaldson">the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr. Donaldson)</phrase>. We must face issues, or we will not be able to give people satisfactory answers.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/5">I have copies of Ministry of Defence answers to colleagues which remind me of a sermon that I read in my early ministry; it was well set forth, but there was no life in it. I discussed the sermon with some senior colleagues, including the man who delivered it, who said, &quot;Yes, you missed the thunder and the lightning&mdash;the atmosphere.&quot; Those in the Ministry of Defence who responded to the letters missed the atmosphere of Mr. Cochrane's telephone conversation with his son, who told him about being bullied, which is on tape. Then came the sound of the shot, as the young man committed suicide.</p>
	<p pid=".13.0/6">The Ministry of Defence does not say that the young man did not commit suicide, but it wants to discover what drove him to such a situation, and there are no answers that will satisfy anyone. In one answer, it states that it cannot say anything because the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Royal Ulster Constabulary were involved in the investigations. The nation of Northern Ireland has discovered latterly that there has been interference in police investigations; therefore, it is rather suspicious to say that the matter was investigated by the PSNI if no satisfactory evidence has been brought forth. Can the Minister tell us when the board of inquiry is likely to complete its investigations and say whether it has informed the Cochranes of its latest view? Unless there is a public inquiry into the pattern of the deaths, there will be no real satisfaction, and we will hinder proper recruitment for the Army.</p>

	<p pid=".14.1/1">I shall not take long to make my remarks because it is clear that this morning there is unanimity across the parties, not only in the early-day motion, but in Members' contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and I pay tribute to the families, whose perseverance and fortitude in ensuring that the issues are on the public agenda have enabled them to be addressed in the open way that we all want. It is now for the Ministry of Defence to respond in a similar fashion, as it must want to ensure that the deaths are properly investigated and that lessons are learned for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/3">The Army's equal opportunities statement declares:</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We have zero tolerance of any form of prejudice, harassment or bullying.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/5">However, the Army's words do not always match up to its efforts. The MOD has a steep hill to climb when 43 per cent. of troops believe that bullying and harassment are rife and over 5 per cent. have been victims of such abuse. The focus of this debate has naturally gravitated towards the Deepcut cases. The issue is not just the questionable verdicts of suicide and the deaths of soldiers, but why questions were not automatically asked when such a high suicide rate among young soldiers at one Army base was recorded.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/6">It is almost impossible to believe that that did not raise questions about the circumstances of the tragic deaths. Why was not better care taken of the young recruits? What resources, such as counselling and contacts with non-military welfare organisations, were available to them, if they needed them to cope with the stress of Army life? I welcome the investigation by the Surrey constabulary, but will the Minister assure us that all the evidence secured by the investigation will be available to the families and their representatives, so that they can draw their own conclusions?</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/7">The MOD reports that, over the past five years, there have been 93 deaths recorded with an open verdict or as suicide. The fact that the families of 40 of those service personnel are now threatening legal action surely reflects a huge dissatisfaction with, and distrust of, Army protocol and procedure. That must be addressed, and I am sure that the Minister will agree once again that perception matters. We need to ensure that the matters are fully investigated and the findings made public.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/8">The position of the military police, the constabulary and the coroner must be clarified. I say that because in recent years there have been two questionable suicide verdicts in my constituency, although not, I hasten to say, at Army barracks or a military centre. However, those verdicts have raised many questions about the relative responsibilities of the police and the coroner and the way in which families are able to engage in the process with the coroner. When one adds the further significant contribution of the military police and the MOD to that already difficult situation it amplifies the need for clarification. I know that the Government are already examining coroners' courts. I hope that as part of that review they will take into account the issues surrounding these cases, and the way in which coroners' courts act in conjunction with the police and the military police. That is an area of civilian life that needs to be sorted out and clarified.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/9">There should also be a review of the support services available to soldiers. Life is stressful enough, and when we recruit young soldiers, particularly those under 18, we have a particular responsibility to ensure that their welfare is looked after. Our soldiers must be in no doubt that the Army and the MOD are right behind them and will defend their interests in every circumstance. It is clear that many soldiers feel unable to discuss or even to raise issues of personal safety with anyone, and that they often suffer in silence.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/10">I also recommend an urgent review of the way in which contact is made with families. We heard some distressing stories about the way in which families are advised of the tragic deaths of their loved ones. That seems to be done in a very cold-hearted way. Regrettably, that was also part of the clarification needed in the cases of civilian deaths that I spoke about earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/11">Families should be engaged at a very early stage. They have rights concerning attendance at post-mortems and what happens after a suspected questionable death, but many families do not realise that they have such rights. Unfortunately, many are not advised of their rights until much later, and by that time they cannot make a valid contribution or become part of the process. That situation needs to be urgently reviewed, so that when the fact of a death is relayed, families are counselled and made aware of their rights.</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/12">These are tragic cases. Many of the contributions this morning have been very disturbing. If average members of the public were here listening to the debate, they would want to raise many of the issues that the families are raising. I believe that the families and the general public want answers. Questions have been raised about what happens in our Army barracks and military centres, and the MOD should take the opportunity not only to give its answers through a public inquiry, but to ensure that real lessons are learned. It must ensure that the Army lives up to its statement, which I read at the beginning, that it has</p>
	<p pid=".14.1/13" class="indent">&quot;zero tolerance of any form of prejudice, harassment and bullying.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".15.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the hon. Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> on his persistence in the matter, and on bringing it to the attention of the House. He is nothing if not tenacious. I also congratulate those hon. Members who have spoken, some very movingly, about the particular circumstances affecting their own constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".15.0/2">No one who has any knowledge of these matters can have anything but the deepest sympathy with the families, not just those who are in the public eye at present, but others who are grieving privately and quietly. There can be no greater tragedy in life than to lose a child who is just embarking on what would have been their career, and we take the matter very seriously. However, in a sense the debate is somewhat premature because, as has been mentioned, the Surrey police inquiry is under way. It is difficult for any of us to comment while that is so, although it provides us with an opportunity to put on record concerns, some of which have been expressed publicly, and some of which have not.</p>
	<p pid=".15.0/3">I come to the debate double-hatted, as I am both Vice-Chairman of the Select Committee on Defence and a shadow Defence Minister. For the assistance of the House, I shall mention what the Select Committee said about the matter in a press release last summer:</p>
	<p pid=".15.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The Committee is concerned by events at Deepcut barracks. We are aware, however, that police inquiries are continuing. We have no wish to cut across or interfere with those inquiries. We believe that there are grounds for a Defence Committee inquiry into conditions at Deepcut. We will decide on the scope and nature of that inquiry once the police inquiries are complete.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".15.0/5">That, I hope, puts the record straight on what the Committee has decided to do about the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".15.0/6">It is important that the military recognises its duty of care to those in its charge. However, we should be quite clear that we are preparing young men and women to take their place in an army trained for combat. That means that training has to be rigorous, and that is more difficult in today's society than it was 20 or 30 years ago, or even, dare I say it, when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1008" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk, West (Mr. Joyce)</phrase> was enlisted in the Army. Fewer people live away from home today. On a recent visit to Catterick, we went to the rehabilitation centre, where those with broken bodies, leg injuries, fractures and so on were being rehabilitated, because today's young people are not the same as those who previously joined the armed forces. That is not a criticism of them; it just means that the Army has to adjust.</p>

	<p pid=".16.1/1">I do not think that anything I said could possibly be construed in that fashion, and certainly that was not my intention.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/2">It is important to put the statistics in context. Figures from the Library show that in 1994 there were 19 suicides in the Army. That is the equivalent, at a rate per million, of 154. That compares with an overall United Kingdom average among males aged 15 to 24 of 115. In the most recent year for which figures are available, 1999, the number of suicides in the Army had fallen to five, which equates to a rate of 45.6 per million. That compares with a UK average of 106 among males aged 15 to 24. The figures show that the Army is conscious of the need to address the issue, and has done so with some success.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/3">The hon. Member for Hull, North mentioned the learning account initiative, which I understand is under way, in tandem with the police inquiry that has been undertaken. The police are giving the Army information from their inquiry to date, and they are telling it some of the things that they think it could usefully learn from the inquiry. The Army should examine two issues. First, it should consider the risk of bullying because it is completely unacceptable that a young person, or anyone, should be subject to bullying.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/4">The Army must also consider the question of unhappiness. I was encouraged when I visited Catterick and talked to the young recruits. I asked whether they would know if one of their fellow recruits was unhappy and whether they would rally round. To a man and woman&mdash;boy and girl&mdash;they responded, &quot;Of course we would.&quot; We should not underestimate young people's capacity to be aware of difficulties faced by their peers. I spoke to the brigadier in charge of the recruit centre at Catterick who said that the Army is trying to find ways of being more proactive in recognising the signs of potential unhappiness.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/5">As other hon. Members said, the Army must consider who has unsupervised access to weapons. That is important, and the Army need not wait for the outcome of an inquiry but could undertake such consideration immediately.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/6">The services need a better system of family liaison. Individual cases cited by hon. Members today show that there has been inadequate liaison between the Army and families after a tragedy. The Army must get to grips with that and ensure that there is better liaison. Part of the problem is that the Army Training and Recruiting Agency covers a tremendous number of young people. The hon. Member for Hull, North said that there are 9,000 recruits a year, which is a fantastic turnover. After the recruits have finished their training, they go to a regiment, corps or unit. They are nurtured, and an esprit de corps exists, but that is not prevalent in a large training establishment such as Catterick, so more needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid=".16.1/7">Mention was also made of the need to maintain barrack-by-barrack statistics to determine whether problems are clustered&mdash;I think that that word was used earlier&mdash;and whether specific problems exist at specific barracks. The Ministry of Defence said that it would be expensive to collate that information, but I find that difficult to accept. That is one step that could be taken to help to tackle the problem that we face.</p>

	<p pid=".17.0/1">Would the hon. Gentleman accept that what made me pursue this course of action was the fact that the Ministry of Defence kept no records of how, why, where and when these events occurred that it was prepared to give to the House or hon. Members in answer to questions?</p>

	<p pid=".17.1/1">The Minister will undoubtedly want to address that.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/2">The Army has taken several steps, and I have described some. I understand that there has been much greater clarification of procedures to be followed in the event of a death in barracks. The original standing order was ambiguous, and I understand that there is a new one that clearly provides primacy for the local police force, not for Army investigators. That will be welcome.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/3">I do not believe that the Army is uncaring. On the contrary, it has a vested interest in being seen by young people and their parents as a good employer that cares for those in its charge. Given the need to recruit 9,000 people a year, the Army must recognise that if it does not have a reputation for being a good employer and for caring about people's personal development, it will not get those recruits.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/4">The Army has made it clear that it is recruiting people in a narrow pool. Thankfully, there is limited unemployment in this country, so it is having to compete against all types of employer for its recruits. The position could not have been put better than by my noble Friend, Brigadier Lord Vivian, when he wrote to Lord Bach in June last year:</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/5" class="indent">&quot;I believe that it is a matter of great regret on the part of all concerned for the good name of the Armed Forces that the Ministry of Defence and the Army have failed to respond to this series of incidents by volunteering sufficient and timely information in each case . . . This is the sort of case that can affect recruiting and retention, especially if the general public start to think that The Army is a poor employer and does not care for its men and women, which you and I know has no foundation.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/6">That is why all of us have a vested interest in ensuring that the lessons are learned from the recent tragedies.</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/7">In a newspaper article in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i>, an MOD official was quoted as saying,</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/8" class="indent">&quot;we will publicly accept mistakes were made in the way the tragic deaths of these soldiers was handled.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/9">What plans does the Minister have to ensure that those mistakes are not repeated? Are lessons other than those to which I have referred being taken on board today? It has been widely reported that the Army has responded to the deaths with an investigation into how suicides can be prevented. Can the Minister confirm that? Have any preliminary conclusions been reached? Can he confirm that, from now on, the police will investigate all similar deaths?</p>
	<p pid=".17.1/10">I have received a letter from a Lieutenant-Colonel Tinckler, a consultant surgeon in the Royal Army Medical Corps volunteers. Mention was made earlier about the number of medics at Deepcut. I accept that today's debate is about not only Deepcut but other barracks, but the lieutenant-colonel was dismissed from his post as a locum after only two days of a one-month contract, without being given a reason. Does the Minister have any information on the matter which he can share with us? Can he say something about the provision of medical care at barracks throughout the country?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.18.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1118" speakername="Lewis Moonie" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence"  colnum="18"  time="010:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h01.htm#30204h01_spmin0">
	<p pid=".18.0/1">I should make it clear at the outset that I have recently taken over all training, personnel and welfare functions from my right hon. Friend the Minister of State, Ministry of Defence, with the exception of the Deepcut inquiry. He has been involved in that for some time, so we both felt it appropriate for him to deal with it until the end of the investigations.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/2">I am grateful for the chance given to me by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1081" name="Kevin McNamara">the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara)</phrase> to make general points and reply to the debate. As Members are well aware, the Surrey police investigations into the deaths of the four soldiers at Deepcut remain ongoing and will not conclude until early March. I cannot pre-empt the results of those investigations, nor will I comment on matters that are related directly to them, other than to say that it is my belief that the Army has co-operated fully with Surrey police during the inquiries and continues to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/3">In addition, Mr. Frank Swann, the independent ballistics expert employed by the soldiers' families, has been given full access to each of the sites where the incidents occurred so that he can conduct his investigation. I assure Members at the outset that all their points will receive my careful consideration and, when appropriate, a written reply. I also assure them that any warranted changes in procedure will be made. I make no mistake about that.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/4">My ministerial colleagues, the Army chain of command and I are well aware of the interest that has been expressed by the House, the media and the general public, particularly over the past 12 months, in the number of deaths of Army personnel resulting from non-combatant injuries sustained in Army barracks and elsewhere. While that has, understandably, centred on the deaths of the four soldiers at Princess Royal barracks, Deepcut, it is acknowledged that some concerns expressed have wider implications for the Army as a whole, as is illustrated by the cases that Members have raised today.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/5">I recognise that every death in the Army, however caused, is a personal tragedy that has a devastating impact on the partners and families of those concerned. It is a sad fact of life that non-natural deaths occur in all walks of life. Non-combatant deaths in the Army, and indeed the armed forces as a whole, are no exception. The Army's approach is to be constructive and proactive&mdash;to minimise, through training, education and welfare support, the likelihood of incidents occurring that may result in loss of life, and to ensure that, when such incidents happen, lessons are learned to minimise the possibility of them occurring in the same way in future.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/6">While parliamentary and media attention over the past few months has primarily focused on the incidence of alleged suicide in the Army, it must be placed properly in perspective. In doing so, I believe that it is rather arbitrary to make a distinction between the deaths of Army personnel in barracks and elsewhere. Not all deaths that occur in barracks are the result of suicide, as accidents and injuries resulting from training activities also make up a proportion of the total. Similarly, not all incidences of suicide among Army personnel occur in the barrack environment.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/7">Statistical information provides the basis for analysing the number of Army non-combatant deaths due to injury. Substantial work has been undertaken over the past few months to refine that data and bring reporting in line with the Office for National Statistics. The most recently available statistics from January 2003 show that there were 1,763 deaths of Army personnel due to non-combatant injury from 1984 to 2001. That represents the total of deaths through injury, irrespective of how they were caused, where they occurred and whether the individuals concerned were on or off duty. Of that total, 276 were awarded a coroner's verdict of suicide. A further 49 were recorded as open verdicts and 41 still await a coroner's verdict. Of those 366 deaths, 29 individuals were aged 18 or under.</p>
	<p pid=".18.0/8">Comparison with the wider civilian population is complicated by the different age and gender mix of the armed forces. In particular, the armed forces have a lower proportion of females compared with the civilian population. That is allied to the fact that females have a lower propensity to take their own lives than males. Allowing statistically for those differences, published research shows that the suicide rate and deaths subject to open verdicts are broadly comparable between Army personnel and the population at large.</p>

	<p pid=".20.0/1">Does the Minister accept that the statistics are spread throughout the country on an averaged basis? Our concern is the number of deaths at a particular place. If they had occurred in a town or a village, it would have been recognised that something had to be done.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.20.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1118" speakername="Lewis Moonie" colnum="20"  time="010:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h01.htm#30204h01_spnew18">
	<p pid=".20.1/1">Speaking as an epidemiologist, which I was in my previous incarnation, I should correct the hon. Gentleman's misconception on the distribution of conditions. It is natural for clusters to occur. If clusters did not occur, I would be suspicious about any condition. When checking information on vital statistics, it is important that we check them carefully against the experience in the rest of the population and that we use standardised methods, whenever we can. Only then can we honestly tell whether something is worthy of special note, as opposed to the attention that should be given to any case of non-natural death. With that proviso, it is important that we use the best available standard of scientific information. We have reallocated our cases according to nationally accepted guidelines.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/2">The incidence of suicide and open verdicts in the Army is lower than in the civilian population in the 24-to-39 age group and broadly similar in the 20-to-24 age group, but higher in the 16-to-19 age group. Although the available figures permit a broad comparison with the wider civilian population at this time, the information must be treated with caution for the reasons that I have outlined. The Ministry of Defence is working with the Office for National Statistics, the General Register Office for Scotland and the General Register Office for Northern Ireland to produce a more detailed and refined comparison.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/3">The Army Individual Training Organisation&mdash;now known as the Army Training and Recruiting Agency&mdash;has come under particular scrutiny as a result of the reporting of events at Deepcut. Fourteen soldiers undergoing initial training died within the categories of suicide and open verdict in the 21 years between 1982 and 2002. A further case&mdash;that of Private James Collinson, which has been raised&mdash;is still awaiting a coroner's inquest. The Army and the Ministry of Defence share the sense of loss that each of the families feel in such circumstances, and recognise that it is made more acute by the fact that many individuals concerned had been living away from the family home for only a short period.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/4">It is also fully understandable that the families look to the Army to take care of their loved ones, and that they seek to understand all the circumstances surrounding such regrettable events. Nothing can take away the pain, grief and sense of loss that they experience when such things happen. However, the number of deaths must be put in context. During the period in which those 15 deaths occurred, 250,000 soldiers passed through basic training.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/5">Broader concerns have been raised about initial training in the armed forces. On <phrase class="date" code="2002-10-17">17 October 2002</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Minister of State announced to the House that he had commissioned a special review of the initial training of all non-officer recruits in each of the three services. That work is being undertaken independently of the service and its respective commands, and my right hon. Friend will be in a position to make an announcement to the House on the findings of the review in due course.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North raised a further specific concern about the incidence of death in barracks as a result of injuries sustained from firearms. Although we are especially concerned about that&mdash;in particular, with regard to young soldiers on guard duty&mdash;the majority of deaths and suicides do not result from firearm-inflicted injuries.</p>
	<p pid=".20.1/7">Firearm injuries are responsible for under a third of all suicides and open verdicts, although the incidence of those in the Army is significantly higher than in the civilian population because of the ready access to weapons. The risk to the individual must always be balanced against the need for the Army to undertake operational and other security duties. We carefully examine such matters. We have been studying this one closely, and we will continue to do so to see whether other changes in procedure can be made that will lessen the chance of such deaths occurring.</p>

	<p pid=".21.0/1">Will my hon. Friend undertake that no recruits under the age of 18 will be left alone with Army munitions or guns and so forth, and that that will not be left to the discretion of the camp commander?</p>

	<p pid=".21.1/1">On that, I can say that I will take any action that is necessary to ensure that good practice is observed at all times, as I will with regard to bullying. We adopt an attitude of zero tolerance to bullying. A training regime may be felt to be quite harsh by people who come out of it and those who go into it from a domestic environment, but there is a difference between being harsh and rigorous in training to produce good soldiers and bullying, which is totally unacceptable to my ministerial colleagues and I, and to all the senior officers I have spoken to. Any further changes that need to be made will be made to maximise the chance of being able to report bullying and get rid of it, wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid=".21.1/2">As usual, time is catching up with me. In summary, commanders at all levels in the Army deeply regret all incidents that result in loss of life, however those might have occurred, and they take very seriously their duty of care towards those for whom they have responsibility, in respect of training and procedures. We have tried to enable soldiers to undertake activities while minimising the dangers involved.</p>

	<p pid=".22.1/1">It is a pleasure to be here this morning, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/2">This debate started in an unusual way. I was shocked last weekend when Grace, my five-year-old&mdash;like all five-year-olds, she knows everything that there is to know about nature and wildlife&mdash;asked, &quot;Daddy, what is a starling?&quot; It occurred to me that she had never seen a starling. These birds were once regarded as pests and they were all over the place when I was a kid. However, it struck me that in our small garden at home in Nottingham we have seen neither a starling nor a sparrow, although wood pigeons, blue tits and robins have passed through, and we were thrilled to see a weasel last week. Birds that were common a decade ago seem to be disappearing, even from the acute radar screen of a five-year-old. Alarm bells began to ring, and I thought about the thrushes, blackbirds and many other species that are going missing. The purpose of the debate is to ask the Minister, &quot;What can we collectively do about it?&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".22.1/3">We have recently debated the common agricultural policy, and I would certainly hold the Minister tightly accountable on that issue. On this occasion, however, I look to him to give us a few lines on what we can do together to revive some of the species of urban wild birds. Wild bird numbers matter in their own right, but they can also be regarded as a thermometer with which to test the environmental health of the United Kingdom. To their credit, the Government are using breeding bird populations as one such thermometer, and it is obvious from reading it that the UK environment is running a bit of a temperature.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.22.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="22"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h02.htm#30204h02_spnew1">
	<p pid=".22.2/1">My hon. Friend will remember that five or six years ago my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister used starlings to monitor environmental pollution. Perhaps my hon. Friend will induce the Minister to tell us how that survey progressed. It was interesting that the starling was picked as a disappearing bird that could reflect what was happening to its environment.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.22.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="22"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h02.htm#30204h02_spnew2">
	<p pid=".22.3/1">My hon. Friend the Minister is well known as a starlingist in government circles, and I am sure that he will tell us about that survey.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/2">During the past 30 years, the numbers of certain birds have drastically declined. The numbers of some thrushes are down by 57 per cent., skylarks are down by 52 per cent., great partridge numbers are down by 58 per cent. and some of our closest neighbours at home have suffered too&mdash;starling numbers are down by 71 per cent. and house sparrows are down by 62 per cent. These declines are catastrophic. If we were talking about white rhino or panda populations, everyone would rightly be up in arms. This is happening in the UK, and although the most recent surveys show a modest recovery of common birds since 1998, especially woodland birds, there is still a continuing downward trend in respect of farmland birds.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/3">To pick up on the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" name="Ian Gibson">the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson)</phrase>, perhaps the Minister will take this opportunity to bring hon. Members up to date on the state of research. What research is being conducted, what have the researchers reported and what is in the pipeline? We need to know why woodland and urban birds, and especially the house sparrow, have vanished from many of their former haunts. The decline in sparrow numbers has been so steep that many people have commented on the situation. <i>The Independent</i>, to its credit, ran a campaign to save our sparrows in order to bring the trend to the attention of the public. There has also been a lot of publicity in greater London that is intended to generate public awareness.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/4">As far as I can tell, no one knows the reason or reasons for the disappearance of sparrows, although it is evident throughout the country from Liverpool to Glasgow, London and my own city of Nottingham. Many explanations have been proffered. Perhaps the Minister can synthesise the current thinking on which is the most likely and perhaps add some further suggestions. The current explanations are as follows: that pollution is killing off small insects and even young sparrow chicks; that there is predation by an ever greater number of cats and birds such as sparrow-hawks and magpies; that there is a lack of suitable nesting nooks and crannies in modern buildings&mdash;certainly the highest number of sparrow nests were in buildings and houses dating back to at least 1919&mdash;and that the use of pesticides by domestic gardeners, as well as those that we are used to being used on farmland, may reduce the availability of insects.</p>
	<p pid=".22.3/5">I spoke to Friends of the Earth this morning. Its representatives talked about a noticeable reduction in aphid numbers and, because of the use of slug pellets, a reduction in other bird foods that would normally be available in domestic gardens. As well as telling us what research is in the pipeline, will the Minister bring together some of the answers as to why there is a clear decline in the number of urban birds?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.23.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/911" speakername="Ian Gibson" colnum="23"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h02.htm#30204h02_spnew3">
	<p pid=".23.0/1">I wonder whether we might induce the Minister to reflect and pronounce on articles that suggest that radiation from telecommunication masts may have some effect on sparrows. I do not see sparrows using mobile phones, so the masts must be the problem. It may sound trivial, but the environment can change rapidly and have effects on animal life. Does the Minister take this claim seriously?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.23.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/695" speakername="Graham Allen" colnum="23"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h02.htm#30204h02_spnew4">
	<p pid=".23.1/1">Indeed. In a previous debate we touched on the common agricultural policy, which because of its subsidy regime has undoubtedly contributed to predation of bird populations throughout Europe, not only in farming areas but also in urban contexts. When the Minister goes invigorated&mdash;as I know he will be&mdash;from our debate to seek further reform of the CAP, I hope that he will feel that he has the massed ranks of bird lovers at his side as he tries to resolve some of the knottier issues. They do not affect only householders and farmers; they have a drastic impact on wildlife in general and wild birds in particular.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/2">I hope that my hon. Friend will seek to use the good work carried out by him and his Department in respect of farmland birds and to point that effort also at urban wild birds. The Government have done a great deal&mdash;I commend them for that&mdash;and I am sure that he will give us a list of things that they are doing. A great deal is also being done by the voluntary sector. Perhaps I may focus on what is happening in my own county. In Nottinghamshire, the wildlife trust is working closely with farmers and the farming wildlife advisory group to advise them on how to manage their land more sympathetically given the current crisis.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/3">At Attenborough in Nottinghamshire, the trust is creating reed beds for the endangered bittern. The Sherwood Initiative, thanks to a lottery heritage fund, is working towards restoring Sherwood forest as a stronghold for the woodlark and nightjar. The Nottinghamshire wildlife trust is working with a variety of farmers, local authorities and the Environment Agency to restore habitats along the Trent valley. Wet marsh land is being created for lapwings and waders, reed beds for bittern and marsh harrier, and shallow water to create habitats for thousands of wildfowl and waders.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/4">This has knock-on benefits because we can combine enhanced amenities for birds with economic regeneration and the establishment of sustainable flood defences. That focus is clearly on farmland birds. I seek to draw the Minister not necessarily away from them but into a broader focus to encompass the urban bird population as well.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/5">There are some greater problems that I do not have time to mention. Certainly, we should commend the Government's effort to slow and check global warming. If left unchecked, it will have catastrophic effects on all species, including human beings. However, in the medium term, we must plan for the impact of climate change, which is likely to alter the mix of species in the United Kingdom, with some habitats moving northwards and the complete loss of other habitats due to the rise in sea levels.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/6">Bird habitats in the UK are highly fragmented and often isolated, which means that it is more difficult for species to shift naturally if their habitats migrate. The Government should consider that as part of their land use and development policies. The combination of rising sea levels and hard sea walls leads to coastal squeeze with habitats such as inter-tidal mud flats and salt marsh often being lost to the sea because they cannot move inland past artificial man-made barriers. In turn, that has an impact on the numbers of wintering wading birds such as red shank, curlew and wildfowl, including Brent geese and widgeon, for which the UK is internationally renowned.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/7">Wildlife and wild bird numbers in the UK tell us much about the health of our environment. They also matter to those who elect us. I do not need to talk crude electoral politics to my hon. Friend the Minister because although it is part of his Departmental brief, his heart also in the issue. However, it may serve a purpose to remind Ministers and other Members that the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds has more than a million members, a figure for which any of the parties represented in the House would be most grateful.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/8">Given the importance of the issue, can the Minister assure us that the Government will specifically investigate the plight of urban wild birds, especially the fate of the sparrow, to try to get to the bottom of the decline in numbers and to find solutions to the problem? Do the Government intend to use planning legislation to protect birds?</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/9">Rather than this issue being an aside in diary columns or a funny piece in newspapers, I hope that it is mainstreamed, which I believe is the Minister's intention. There should be a public campaign led by the Government to alert farmers and town dwellers about the problem of the decline in wild bird numbers and to recruit us all to assist with solutions.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/10">I do not want to sound like a &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter, but we would welcome the Minister's advice on nesting boxes, the sort of food that householders can supply to assist bird populations and other hints of that type. I do not know whether I should embarrass the Minister by asking whether he has a bird box at his Department or in his garden, but, knowing him, he has several.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/11">Advice on avoiding the use of pesticides should be given across the range to householders and gardeners who care about their environment but may unwittingly add to the problem. They need to grow more shrubs and trees to provide more habitats for the insects that birds feed on.</p>
	<p pid=".23.1/12">We are all enthralled when we see David Attenborough on television creating brilliant and beautiful documentaries about the global ecology featuring whales or primates, such as in Sunday's episode. They are riveting to us all. This environmental crisis, however, is literally in our back yard. I hope that the Government agree that this problem is one that they need to address. They need to gather all the different layers of UK society together into one family&mdash;farmers, ordinary householders, Members of Parliament and the voluntary sector, which is working so hard on the problem. The Government have some great ideas, especially about farmland birds. With a great public campaign, we may see the revival of some of the species that were once commonplace in our back yard.</p>

	<p pid=".25.1/1">Will the Minister give credit to the work of the British Trust for Ornithology of Thetford in Norfolk, whose news is regularly distributed to many Members? It works in isolation, in some ways, although Norfolk is a great county&mdash;a mecca, indeed&mdash;for many birds. My hon.

	<p pid=".25.2/1">I am happy to compliment the work of the BTO, which works for the Department and undertakes a great deal of scientific analysis. Indeed, I shall say a few words about that organisation, as I had the privilege of launching a joint BTO-RSPB woodland bird study at Thetford not very long ago. I should say for the formal record that I am a member of the BTO, the RSPB and various other conservation organisations.</p>
	<p pid=".25.2/2">My hon. Friend raised the issue of the decline of starlings and house sparrows. They were once common birds, but their numbers have seriously declined over the past 25 years. The starling is now on the red list of high conservation concern. Its numbers declined by 65 per cent. between 1970 and 1998. Recent research by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs shows that over the past 30 years, house sparrow populations have declined most in the south-east of England. Urban and suburban gardens have seen the most marked fall. In contrast, however, the good news is that they are thriving in urban and rural areas in Scotland and Wales, and there has been a slight increase in populations.</p>
	<p pid=".25.2/3">House sparrow breeding, however, has fallen from about 12 million pairs to fewer than 7 million. About 60 per cent. are found in rural and urban gardens. There is no doubt that a combination of factors account for the decline, such as food source and food availability, including for the young, and nesting availability. House sparrows, in particular, nest in old buildings. These days, farm buildings are much tidier and more modern, and modern houses are insulated and draught-proof. It is believed that insulation has denied nesting to house sparrows and starlings.</p>
	<p pid=".25.2/4">As my hon. Friend mentioned, pesticide use has had an impact on the availability of seeds and insects. Predation is also a factor, although separate studies of sparrow-hawk predation indicate that it is unlikely to have affected these populations, as sparrow-hawk populations and those of many other birds of prey declined significantly in the 1960s due to the use of pesticides. I am glad to say that many of these species have shown a recovery, but populations are much dictated by food availability. Interestingly, principal prey for sparrow-hawks, such as woodland birds, has increased over the same period, so there is no evidence that they are having a detrimental impact.</p>
	<p pid=".25.2/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North asked about the theory of increased telecommunication use and telecommunication masts. I have heard that theory, and have discussed it with some of our scientists. It does not stand up to examination. In Paris, for example, the house sparrow population has not declined. I am sure that my hon. Friend will agree that the French are no less averse to using mobile telephones in Paris than in any other city in the United Kingdom. They might, in fact, be a little keener. I do not believe that there is a correlation between mobile telephone masts and the decline of sparrows. It seems more complicated than that. A study is being conducted by several organisations. The BTO common bird census provides an invaluable database for observing trends in British birds. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee is examining the research and will produce recommendations on the problem of house sparrows.</p>

	<p pid=".26.0/1">I want to underline the Minister's personal reputation on, and commitment to, this subject, not only while he has been a Minister, but since he first walked through the portals of this place. Whenever we received queries about the subject, we always referred to him, even before he secured his current exalted position. I will not go into the stories of the Minister doing bird imitations in Committee, because I know that you want me to get on with my point, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".26.0/2">When does the Minister think that the committee is likely to report?</p>

	<p pid=".27.0/1">I do not have the details on that, but I will write to my hon. Friend. Indeed, he may want more details on what is being done about house sparrows, so I will arrange for that to be done, too.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/2">My hon. Friend asked what the public can do to support birds generally, and house sparrows in particular. Many people feed wild birds in their gardens, which is important, especially during the winter as it means fewer mortalities and a larger potential breeding population in the spring. It is sometimes useful to provide food throughout the summer for supplementary feeding, and water availability is important.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/3">It appears that nesting sites are a factor for the house sparrow. Many people are keen on nest boxes, and my hon. Friend asked what I do. I have a range of nest boxes in my garden&mdash;I think that I have seven. They are designed for a range of species including tits, and I have open-fronted nest boxes for robins and two colonial nest boxes that are designed for sparrows. I have my personal biodiversity action plan on tree sparrows in my garden, as I am trying to establish a breeding colony. I have established a wintering flock in a feeding station in my garden, and they are colonial nesters, so I have two boxes of three, which is like a little tenement block for sparrows.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/4">The difference with house sparrows that most people do not understand is that they have a problem with nest boxes. Most nest boxes that people buy are for blue or great tits. That is understandable, as people like to see them in their gardens, but the holes are generally too small for sparrows, and if one wants to encourage breeding sparrows in nest boxes, one needs a larger entrance hole. The boxes are easy to make, and they can be bought. I have specialist boxes and know that as part of several studies into sparrows, suitable boxes have been erected with considerable success. I know that one farm has a line of them and, with it, a successful colony of house sparrows, so the boxes are significant for populations. I also have boxes for breeding tawny owls and artificial house martin nests. I have perhaps gone a bit overboard on boxes, but most of them are occupied and effective.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/5">DEFRA has committed &pound;600,000 to the woodland bird study, which has already received contributions from English Nature and the Forestry Commission. The study is being carried out by the RSPB and the BTO. It is a detailed examination of our woodlands birds, which is interesting in itself, as there appears to be a decline of certain woodland species. There is a decline in the south-east of England, which is strange because it is one of the better forested areas, but an increase in the midlands, including Nottingham. My hon. Friend will be pleased to know that. They are thriving in different parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/6">There are some issues that we have to understand about why certain species&mdash;the woodpecker and marsh tit, for example&mdash;have declined, while other woodland species, including most of the tit species and the greater spotted woodpecker, have increased significantly. There have also been increases in a number of wetland species. We have sites of special scientific interest, which are important protected habitat areas, and that protection has been strengthened by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. In the area of my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, North, there are three SSSIs: Sutton and Lound gravel pits; the River Idle washlands; and the Welbeck estates, which are well known not least for the honey buzzards that nest there.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/7">As my hon. Friend says, in many instances the numbers of farmland birds have declined catastrophically&mdash;the tree sparrow population, for example, has declined incredibly by 95 per cent. Much of that is linked to changing farming practices. These changes are not in any way malicious; they have been driven by intensification, trying to achieve outputs, economies and efficiencies. I have to agree with my hon. Friend that many of them have been driven by the common agricultural policy, which has had a negative effect on the way in which the inducements have encouraged intensification in certain farming practices which, in the longer term, may not be desirable or sustainable in relation to the climate and habitat.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/8">It is likely that we will see changes over time. In the interim, we are arguing for changes to the CAP. We are also extending the countryside stewardship scheme and the environmentally sensitive areas scheme, which have been very successful. Schemes targeted at species in decline such as stone curlew and red kite have had considerable success in rehabilitating the populations. I was pleased recently to be in Derbyshire to launch the first RSPB's peak birds project annual report. Part of its purpose is to examine how to arrest the declining population of twite, which breed on the Pennines. I am confident that we will make progress on that issue.</p>
	<p pid=".27.0/9">Our new entry-level agri-environment schemes, as part of the reforms recommended by Sir Donald Curry, will have benefits in relation to the measures that we can implement in farmland areas. The organisation of our agri-environment programmes is undergoing its mid-term review. I know that concern has been expressed about the specialist schemes that can be targeted on species recovery. I would like to reassure my hon. Friend that in terms of future reforms there is no reason why we cannot continue to have specialist schemes designed to bring about species recovery within agri-environment programmes.</p>

	<p pid=".28.0/1">As time is running out, I am keen that my hon. Friend should refer to my point about wider public awareness and a possible campaign, not least on urban wild birds. Would it be possible, even arising from today's debate, for the Department to issue, if not guidelines, a press release listing some of the things an average person without a great deal of knowledge who wants to do their bit, as well as the farming community, can do to help?</p>

	<p pid=".28.1/1">That is a practical suggestion. We support the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group, which works with farmers and landowners on conservation. English Nature does a good job with its range of leaflets and information on how people can support biodiversity and wildlife. It is the Government's main conservation arm, and perhaps the most appropriate body to deliver that advice. I shall speak to its representatives on how we can collaborate with non-governmental organisations and wildlife groups on the matter.</p>
	<p pid=".28.1/2">I recently took part in the national garden birdwatch, which is run by the RSPB every year. It is a good awareness raiser. I am glad to say that it was launched in No. 10, because it demonstrates our commitment as a Government to biodiversity, conservation management and the issue of wild birds. As my hon. Friend rightly stated, the Government have set public service agreement targets, both in terms of restoring farmland birds but also in relation to birds as a quality of life indicator, which is important.</p>
	<p pid=".28.1/3">I appreciate my hon. Friend raising this serious quality of life and conservation issue today. We take it seriously and I shall look closely at his helpful and considerate suggestions.</p>

	<p pid=".30.2/1">I was lucky to be chosen to lead the debate, but the issue goes beyond party politics and my constituency all the way up the River Thames. Some hon. Members had worse experiences than mine, and they were at least as heart-rending.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/2">I asked for the debate because I want help from the Government, not because I want to play the blame game or to point a finger, although it may come to that. We also need help from elsewhere, but that is not the subject of the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/3">I want help from the Government on three counts. First, I want to get the facts and the truth. Secondly, I want the Government to draw up plans for the future now that we know what can happen. Thirdly, inevitably&mdash;I am sure that the Minister guessed what I would say&mdash;I want to request money.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/4">It may be self-evident, but the message time and again from people who have lived in my constituency for a long time is that they know about flooding, they have seen it before and they understand it, but this time something different seems to have happened. I keep hearing that; it is a subjective view, but we need to address it. Some have argued that there was more rain than there had been before, and some that there was less, but there certainly was rain, and the river rose rapidly. Some say that they have never seen it running so fast and we need to know about that.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/5">The result, inevitably and predictably, was flooding. The flooding of land is inconvenient and a nuisance, but if open spaces flood, up to a point one can say, &quot;So what? That is what open spaces are there for.&quot; However, it is the flooding of properties that hits the headlines and in that respect the constituencies of other hon. Members may have fared worse than mine. It surprises me how difficult it is to get the facts, but the best estimate is that between 100 and 150 properties actually had water inside them, but hundreds of others nearly did and the residents are worried about next time.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/6">I do not suggest that people whose properties were flooded with river water and rain water did not suffer a huge personal crisis, but I want to concentrate on flooding with sewage, which is in an entirely different category; it can be linked with other flooding, but it can occur on its own. In some groups of houses in my constituency, the sewers were blocked because the pumps would not work, with the result that people had sewage all over their gardens or in their houses. They had to use a mobile toilet at the end of the road, whatever their age, and whatever the weather and the time of day or night. That was a horror above all horrors, and that is what hugely exercises my mind.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/7">The overarching debate about flooding has two parts. First, what happens to the rain and river water and, secondly, what happens about the sewers? The first concerns the Environment Agency and the second Thames Water. The issues overlap, but they can be considered separately.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/8">I speak only for Spelthorne, and leave other hon. Members to say what happened in their constituencies, but in the most recent emergency the councils certainly came across as having learned from the flooding two years ago. Their response was better. I would not say that it was perfect, but lessons have been learned. The police have also learned some lessons, as their gold and silver command response appears to have worked better than two years ago. The fire and rescue services have similarly improved. I think that they have been buying boats, and I plead with the Minister to let them buy a few more. The emergency plans have been worked on, and I will say something about the need to improve them, but it would be churlish of me not to recognise that lessons have been learned since the last flood.</p>
	<p pid=".30.2/9">Before we say what we should do about the flooding, we need to understand the causes. I am the first to admit that I do not yet understand what happened.</p>

	<p pid=".31.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for securing the debate and apologise to hon. Members that I will not be able to remain for the full debate because, as they know, I am deeply involved in the subject that is being debated in the House.</p>
	<p pid=".31.0/2">I want to congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his tone of inquiry. The most important task is to find out why the flooding happened and what can be done in future. I am concerned by the speculation in and around Slough about whether the Jubilee river is the cause. The case is not proven, and I hope that in the debate we will be able to uncover what difference the river has made and the lessons that we need to learn.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.31.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" speakername="David Wilshire" colnum="31"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h03.htm#30204h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".31.1/1">I agree absolutely with the hon. Lady. Like her, I have many constituents who are convinced that the Jubilee river caused the flooding. My response is that it could have. I can see the argument that it was the cause, but I can also see the argument that it was not. As a layman, I do not know. That is why my first plea is for the truth, because only when we have it can we make plans. If the Jubilee river is not the cause, we will have wasted money spent on trying to improve it. If it is the Jubilee river, we must do something further.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/2">We must get to the facts. Three themes and theories have emerged from my constituency about the river and rain flooding. The Jubilee river theory is the first. Some of my constituents are convinced that the Thames barrier was the cause, and other constituents believe that the flooding was caused by a lack of dredging. They believe that, and we have to give them enough information to work out whether their beliefs are right or wrong. We cannot just leave them with those assumptions. I hear regularly that Thames Water has not invested enough money in the sewers, has lacked interest in the problem and was incompetent during the emergency. I say that with some trepidation, because I do not believe any of that, but it has to be put in the open. It is being said, and if it is untrue, we have a duty to dispel the myth. If it is true, we must act on it.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/3">I hope that the Minister will respond. The first question is whether the Government can help us get the facts. There is no point in having plans for the future based on fiction; we need them to be based on fact. We need to know whether the flooding was different and, if so, why. We have made some progress. During the emergency, the Environment Agency was available and frank, and I thank it for that. It has improved its response in the two years since the last flooding, and it was accessible at least to me. I defend it for having its priority as the emergency. Since that finished, it has been open. It has held two all-day public sessions, taken the abuse on the chin and said that it wants to find the facts, for which I applaud it. It is now conducting research and re-running the computer model used at the public inquiry, which had to happen.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/4">During the emergency, Thames Water was overwhelmed, and there must be a lesson to learn from that. It was difficult to get hold of, although I accept that it had enough people demanding help without being annoyed by an MP. However, it has also been difficult to get hold of since the flooding. I am sorry to say that it has been a little coy, so perhaps we can work on it to be as open as the Environment Agency. It must tell us&mdash;the Government can persuade it if necessary&mdash;exactly where the real sewer problems are, as they are not always where they appear to be. It must tell us what needs to be done to solve those problems, and when it is going to take that action.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/5">We also need independent verification. Understandably, when people face such difficulties, they tend to say, &quot;Ah, well, how do we know that the body that we hold responsible is being open and honest when it does the research?&quot; I applaud Spelthorne borough council, which is running Elmbridge borough council, by all accounts. It has jointly commissioned an independent expert to do some research to be compared with that done by the Environment Agency. That might sound wasteful, but I support it because people need reassurance. Will the Minister lend his support to that independent verification and reassurance, rather than merely saying that it is the agency's responsibility? There is a limit to how much local authorities can afford to do, but the Government have the power to make grants available. If they do nothing else, will they help to fund the exercise of reassuring local people and commissioning research to be compared with other research that is being done?</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/6">We must decide what we intend to do to protect people in the Thames valley against further flooding. Nature being what it is, I accept that there will always be problems, but what do we intend to do to minimise the risk and the damage? It would be churlish not to admit that there have been improvements. The Thames barrier and the Jubilee river stop flooding, whatever one might say about them. Whatever one might say about local issues, a scheme at Stanwell Moor in my constituency has prevented some 150 houses, which are regularly flooded, from being flooded.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/7">Work has been done and progress has been made, but it is blindingly obvious that more must now be done in the light of what happened a few weeks ago. I accept the Environment Agency's argument that the recent floods were comparable to, but not as severe as, those in 1947. However, it also says that if we want a quick fix, we will have to double the width and the depth of the Thames to cope with the extra water that goes down the Thames past my constituency. I am not calling for that, as it would lead to the destruction of heaven knows how many houses and most of Staines town centre. It is not a solution. I mention it merely to indicate that quick fixes are not necessary available to us. We must consider how we can take immediate action, which means focusing on smaller schemes if necessary, as they can be designed and implemented quickly.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/8">I hope that the Government will support the argument that a short-term solution would be to find ways of diverting the floodwater away from properties on to open land. We should try to find quicker and cheaper ways of taking limited action. There is a caravan park in my constituency that is right by the Thames, and I am told that it should be possible to send the water around it rather than through it. Such a measure would help. We could become locked in a debate about dredging. However, this is not such a debate but a request simply to clear the rubbish from the tributaries. My attention is regularly drawn to the fact that that work has not been done. All these measures are short term and easy to carry out if there is the will and the Government help.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/9">There must be a commitment greatly to invest in upgrading the Victorian sewerage infrastructure. I look to the Government to help with that. Other practical measures need to be taken that do not cost money. The Minister will be pleased to hear that I shall leave the subject of money&mdash;the best bit&mdash;until last, although he will not escape a request for a cheque or two.</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/10">With regard to the planning guidance, much comment is made about inappropriate building in the flood plain. Planning policy guidance note 25, which was introduced in July 2001, is scheduled for review in 2004. Will the Government please review it now to see whether it is still appropriate in the light of what has happened?</p>
	<p pid=".31.1/11">I draw the Minister's attention to the Deputy Prime Minister's wish to build more and more houses in the south-east. My constituency has a quota to be met. We do not have much choice but to build on the flood plain because there is nowhere else left. Will the Government get rid of the ridiculous request to build more houses in Spelthorne?</p>

	<p pid=".33.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. Is he aware that the current absence of regional policy means that houses are being built on the flood plain in the south-east, while in Hull 10,000 houses are being knocked down?</p>

	<p pid=".33.2/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/710" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> is more about flexibility around housing targets than housing need, which in my constituency is very high. We have to find places to build houses, especially affordable ones, but I accept my hon. Friend's point that inflexibility leads to pressure for inappropriate development.</p>

	<p pid=".33.3/1">Exactly so. I do not want to go down that route. All that I am saying is that we do not want any more houses in our flood plain, thank you, whatever the debate about need. If there is a need for houses, put them somewhere sensible, not in Spelthorne flood plain or anyone else's flood plain.</p>
	<p pid=".33.3/2">The Minister might want to consider another practical and technical issue. Some roads in my constituency needed closing. The procedure for closing roads and keeping them closed does not work. The result was fisticuffs and the police became involved. The Government could deal with that issue.</p>

	<p pid=".34.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that a principal problem, which I also experienced in my constituency, was the lack of manpower available to Surrey police, which as we all know results from the swingeing cuts in grant to that force?</p>

	<p pid=".34.1/1">Absolutely right. I would love to have a debate about that too, but I might get a chance tomorrow afternoon to slag the Government off about the way they have treated my local police. For the moment, I shall stick to flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/2">I noticed in <i>Hansard</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2003-02-27">27 February</phrase> last year at column 1351W that the Government said that they were reassessing the methodology governing their economic appraisals of flood schemes. Quite right too. Will the Minister tell us how that appraisal is going? Has he now changed the methodology? Will he also tell us what plans he has to get emergency plans revised quickly, and will he publish the results when he obtains them?</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/3">Financial matters are the key area in which the Government have a role to play. When we have plans to implement, when we have the facts and have done the design work and know what has to be done in the short term, will the money be available? Who will provide it? I hope that the answer is the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/4">The outcome of the floods in 2000 was that, as recorded in <i>Hansard</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2002-05-14">14 May 2002</phrase> at column 555W, the Government made available &pound;16.35 million to meet the emergency costs and repairs. How much money will be available this time? The problems have been worse. Can we therefore assume that the amount of money will be greater, and, if so, by how much? Are the Government willing to help us meet the cost of independent verification?</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/936" name="Philip Hammond">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr. Hammond)</phrase> spoke about police grant. The same is true of the fire and rescue services. The formula does not seem to take any account of the need to deal with such emergencies. Will the Government review their formula for funding fire and rescue? More boats are needed by the Surrey fire service and, I suspect, in Berkshire too. How much money will be received?</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/6">What will we be told about the flood defence committee grant? I understand that the Thames region grant in the year 2002&ndash;03 was &pound;1.1 million, and that it has just been announced that for this year that amount has been cut to &pound;300,000. What is it about the Thames valley that means that the same amount of money is no longer needed? If the Government are tempted to say that that is because the flood committee has balances of &pound;17 million, I have a further question for the Minister. Why have those balances been allowed to build up when work needed to be done? The Minister cannot hide behind the issue of balances because those balances should not have been there. Why have the Government allowed those balances to develop?</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/7">My final question with regard to finance concerns what should be done about Thames Water. Thames Water has spent a huge amount of money on the priorities of the day, which are, generally speaking, Government driven. The amounts of money available for investment through Thames Water are determined by Ofwat in its settlements. I accept that a large amount of money has been made available for improvements to the sewers. However, the past few weeks have demonstrated that nothing like enough money has been released to Thames Water to carry out the work needed on the sewerage systems of my constituency and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/8">What will the Government say to Ofwat about releasing more money into the system to make those improvements? I could go on at length. Sometimes, in a debate such as this, one has the wonderful opportunity to speak for an hour and to put the entire world to rights. There are many other things that should be said, and many other things that are important. However, I urge the Government to accept the debate in the spirit in which it is intended. This is a request for help and not for finger pointing. We need help to establish the facts, to develop practical solutions and to pay for those solutions.</p>
	<p pid=".34.1/9">I reiterate that this is not merely an academic exercise, nor is there a need for another report, another debate or a committee meeting. The image that I leave with the Minister is that of some of my constituents, who have had to walk around their living rooms with raw sewage up to their ankles. That sewage is still in their gardens and in the roads. This debate is about individuals in crisis and is a problem that cannot be ignored. I urge the Minister to accept that we need help now, and that action must be taken very quickly.</p>

	<p pid=".35.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" name="David Wilshire">the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase>&mdash;a place where I spent some time when growing up&mdash;on securing the debate. I remind him that the floodwater that passes through his constituency flows through mine a few hours earlier and through that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> a day earlier than that. It is a problem that we share.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/2">I will adhere to your strictures to be relatively brief, Mr. Deputy Speaker, not least because I had prepared a speech on reform of the House of Lords, which would probably not go down very well in this Chamber. I have considerable interest, both as a Member of Parliament and as a fisherman, in the levels of the River Thames, and in some of the appalling devastation as a result of the floods this year and in 2000&ndash;01.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/3">What is the cause of flooding? I shall come to the urban myths later, but primarily flooding is caused by the quantity and location of rainfall, which catchments are most affected, and the state of the aquifer at the time. That is the difference between the flooding in 2000 and the flooding that we have just experienced. The aquifer&mdash;the underground reservoir&mdash;was denuded during the exceptionally low rainfall in the late 1990s, and so was not fully charged as we approached the winter of 2000. Consequently, although there was a phenomenal amount of rainfall&mdash;some of the heaviest rainfall to be recorded in recent years&mdash;it was able to go somewhere before the rivers overtopped and the flood damage occurred. Sadly, that did not happen earlier this year. The aquifer was fully charged and the combination of heavy rainfall in the Thames catchment in Gloucester, in the Cotswolds and further down the valley resulted in the highest levels since 1947.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/4">I shall describe what happened in a small part of my constituency called Purley on Thames, which is not well known. It has an interesting history but, sadly, as the hon. Member for Spelthorne said, it was built slap bang in the flood plain, and perhaps even in the functional water meadows.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/5">The Environment Agency, which was responsible for providing flood warnings, did its job. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-31">Tuesday 31 December</phrase>, a flood warning was issued to local authorities and to the local population. The floodwaters did not begin to enter the properties in Purley until the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-03">Friday 3 January</phrase>, three or four days later, and 200-odd properties in my constituency were affected.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/6">Purley is on a bend in the river, just below Mapledurham weir, downstream from Pangbourne and up from Reading. It was a camp site in the 1930s, which slowly transformed itself into a collection of shacks and riverside bungalows. I know it from the 1970s, when I drove there from west London&mdash;ironically from the hon. Gentleman's constituency of Spelthorne&mdash;to go fishing. I always thought that one day I would like to live in one of those little shacks, although I do not think that any more.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/7">The shacks were developed, some without planning permission and intuitively, as people nailed cladding to the outside of temporary buildings and after five years established user rights. The community was not built by Barratt or Wimpey or to planning guidance. The ad hoc building activities in Purley would have caused a lot of problems, but Purley parish council, an organisation not renowned for its commitment to socialism, did its job diligently and spotted the problem, and in 1966 it produced local planning guidance. A datum level was established some 1ft above the 1947 high water mark. Some of the properties were built to that level and some were not. The question for the local authority is how efficient or effective was their building control and planning enforcement process.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/8">What happened to the people I represent earlier this year? I received a call on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-04">Saturday 4 January</phrase> from Mr. John Chapman, the Conservative councillor for Purley, for whom I have a high regard. John and I get on fine; we are both passionate about representing our constituents to the best of our ability. I provided John with a set of waders that I borrowed from the local fishing tackle shop and we spent that Saturday morning paddling round Purley.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/9">We saw a good many distressed people who were angry because of the lack of emergency response. People who had just moved into the area and did not realise the house that they had bought was below the 1966 flood planning guidance level were livid. We looked along rows of houses, none more than 30 or 40 years old, and saw properties where the garden had flooded but the house had not. In others, built a foot or so lower&mdash;you do not notice that until the floods come&mdash;people were distraught and crying because their houses had flooded. One young woman had invested her life savings in a property and the local shop, and was completely flooded out. For the people of Purley on Thames, the planning regime might as well not have existed.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/10">As one would expect in any flood-risk area, there was a compound that held sandbags. Despite a flood warning from the Environment Agency, West Berkshire council failed to provide sandbags. People in the know got the few remaining available sandbags and the rest fell apart in their arms, because despite being given four days' clear notice by the Environment Agency, it was beyond the wit of West Berkshire council to fill bags with sand and make them available for the council tax payers in the flood-risk area. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/710" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> is listening, because West Berkshire is a Liberal-controlled council and it has many questions to answer about its conduct.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/11">The emergency response, of which I am most critical, was mixed. I have nothing but praise for South East Berkshire emergency volunteer force, but the sad fact of life is that its members were the only people on site that Saturday. Did I see anyone there from the local council? In fact, the police were pretty tardy: not many turned up on time. SEBEV was there only because one of its prime co-ordinators happened to live in Purley on Thames. The organisation functions from Bracknell. I have repeatedly looked into this problem. There was no guarantee that it would have done such an excellent job of using its boats, evacuating people from property, liaising with the parish council and putting people in emergency accommodation had it not been for the lucky coincidence that one of its co-ordinators lives in Purley.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/12">Yes, the Environment Agency did its bit. The flood warning went out. I advise constituents who live in flood plains to subscribe to the automatic flood warning system. It sends an automatic message to the telephone answering service. Sadly, the Environment Agency's website crashed. I see one or two people from the agency in the Room. I should like to receive assurances that that will not happen again, because people rely on such information. I would not be so forceful if it were not for the arrogant way in which it has behaved subsequently, but my most damning criticism is of West Berkshire council and its failure to trigger an effective emergency planning procedure.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/13">Not only was there a lack of presence on the Saturday&mdash;apart from my good self, some volunteers and the local council&mdash;the West Berkshire council did not even set up an emergency incident point until the Sunday. People had been flooded for some 36 hours and were distressed. The icing on the cake was the e-mail from West Berkshire council. I am sure that hon. Members would not want a council that they have affection for to send such an e-mail. The council's emergency planning officer sent it to the volunteer chair of Purley parish council, Mr John Southall. Purley parish council has a budget of &pound;46,500 per annum. West Berkshire council has a budget of more than &pound;50 million per annum. We should bear in mind the fact that the e-mail was sent on Friday evening, when floodwaters were entering people's properties. It stated:</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Dear Mr. Southall . . . In view of the flooding situation in Purley I was wondering how you are holding out as I am always, especially concerned for the vulnerable people affected by the situation. Perhaps you could call me or email me on Monday to see whether we can help in any way.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/15">The e-mail was sent by the assistant emergency planning officer of West Berkshire council, who is paid to send such garbage at council tax payers'expense. It said that</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/16" class="indent">&quot;the Parish Council is the place to co-ordinate and organise the help on the ground.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/17">Yes, of course it is, with its budget of &pound;46,000. It went on to say that Mr. Southall's neighbours knew their requirements</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/18" class="indent">&quot;better than the council ever could. We do not want to take that responsibility off you but re-assure you, that we will do everything we can to make Purley as resilient as can be against flooding.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/19">Presumably, that meant the Monday morning. Best of all is the closing line of the e-mail:</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/20" class="indent">&quot;Best regards and our hopes for a dry weekend&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/21">My constituents pay their council taxes for that sort of stuff.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/22">I attended a meeting the following Friday with Councillor John Chapman. Hon. Members should bear in mind the fact that I am a member of the Labour party and he is a Conservative. We were treated to a display of breathtaking arrogance from the Liberal Democrat party, especially from its chief executive, Jim Graham. In my presence, Councillor Chapman was told by the chief executive that he took a dim view of councillors criticising his council in the local paper, and that it is the job of a councillor to represent the interests of the council to the people of Purley, not the other way round. What a perverse notion of democracy.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/23">I have vented my spleen long enough on West Berkshire council. I imagine that hon. Members have taken the point. I can assure them that, for all the nonsense that West Berkshire council has come out with in private, in public it has finally set up a review chaired by Councillor John Chapman into the reasons for the flooding and how the emergency response procedure can be improved. I give the councillors credit for that, but only with their hands twisted half way up their backs were they prepared to concede any point. The review should be completely unnecessary because lessons should have been learned from the floods two years previously.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/24">What can we say now and what can be done to reassure my constituents? Some of the urban myths must be debunked comprehensively. I have heard it said&mdash;I am sure that it was also said in Spelthorne, Oxford and elsewhere&mdash;that the Thames flooded because the Woolwich barrier was not shut. Absolute nonsense. If that were the case, St. Paul's would have flooded regularly. The Jubilee river can have no effect upstream of the point at which it leaves the River Thames, because water does not flow uphill.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/25">However, other measures can be taken. The civil defence grant available for England, Wales and Northern Ireland, which funds emergency planning officers, is about &pound;19 million for the current year. My local authority in Reading receives only about &pound;67,000 to fund its entire emergency planning operation at a time when we are at risk from not only flooding but terrorism. That paltry sum must be reviewed urgently. The Emergency Planning Society and the Local Government Association have suggested that &pound;70 million is a more realistic budget for the civil defence grant.</p>
	<p pid=".35.2/26">Engineering solutions could help the people of Purley, and I hope that the Environment Agency is able to fund those. I want the Government to ensure that no local authority can hide from the fact that its emergency plan is not working as it should due to lack of support from central Government. That is a challenge to us all, especially to the Minister.</p>

	<p pid=".39.0/1">The recent flooding of the Thames had severe consequences for many of my constituents, especially for the communities of Datchet, Sunnymeads, Ham island, Wraysbury and Hythe End. I visited those places, as did my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" name="David Wilshire">the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1209" name="Martin Salter">the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter)</phrase>, when the river broke its banks, and I saw the disruption and distress caused. People were understandably angry, but it is vital to point out that people performed many acts of kindness and helped their neighbours.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/2">As my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne said, it was clear from the start that local people blamed the new Jubilee river for the problems. Although there was substantial rainfall at the end of last year, most people did not think that it had been exceptional. They thought&mdash;probably intuitively&mdash;that they had seen rain just as heavy and continuous during recent years, but that that had not caused the dire consequences that they faced. One of my constituents wrote,</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/3" class="indent">&quot;the rainfall and the conditions were nothing like as bad&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/4">as the great flood of 1947. Moreover, some of the flooded houses had never flooded before. People asked themselves what had changed, and everyone thought that the difference was the new river.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/5">I remember the inquiry into the Jubilee river well, and I often visited the scheme during its construction. There were remarkable civil engineering achievements. The river had to go under the old Great Western line, and engineers had to burrow under the M4. The environmental side of the project has been a great success.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/6">However, important questions were raised from the start about how the scheme would work in practice and the effect that it would have downstream of the settlements of Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton, which it was designed to protect. I remember struggling with the complicated mathematic formula&mdash;the hydraulic model&mdash;that was used to show what should happen in different circumstances.</p>
	<p pid=".39.0/7">We were told that when the rivers met at Datchet, a certain volume of water would arrive faster than it otherwise would, but that the river level should not rise significantly. That should have meant that there would be no change downstream of Datchet, but given recent experiences local people who live there do not believe that. Datchet is significant because the Jubilee river rejoins the Thames at Black Potts, which is just above Datchet, to make one river again out of two. That is where the flooding in my constituency began. Hon. Members should also take note of the fact that there was unusual flooding above the point where the rivers bifurcate at Cookham, Bisham and Hurley. I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1106" name="Theresa May">the Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May)</phrase> is concerned about that issue and is acting to deal with it.</p>

	<p pid=".40.0/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that some of my constituents in Marlow and Medmenham are convinced that they experienced similar problems to those encountered by my hon.

	<p pid=".40.1/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. I will return to that point in a minute. People who live upstream of the beginning of the scheme feel intuitively&mdash;I hope that this is not an urban myth&mdash;that there may have been a bottleneck effect.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/2">The Environment Agency tells us that the Jubilee river performs the service for which it was designed, which is to protect Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton. That seems to be correct. From the point of view of people who live there, the scheme can be judged a success. Downstream, however, the story is different. The word &quot;sacrifice&quot; came up many times in talking to people and in correspondence. People downstream feel that their interests have been sacrificed for those of Maidenhead and Windsor. One correspondent wrote:</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/3" class="indent">&quot;It is quite clear that the residents of Wraysbury have been made sacrificial lambs.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/4">Another referred to</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/5" class="indent">&quot;this sacrificial flood . . . Surely, shifting the problem from one area to another defeats the whole object of this construction.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/6">One local inhabitant reached this conclusion:</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Maidenhead and Windsor have been protected at the expense of Datchet, Wraysbury, Ham Island and others downstream.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/8">As my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne said, the central issue is about what happened. My constituents want to know whether the problem has been shifted rather than solved. What effect has the Jubilee river had downstream from Datchet? I agree entirely with my hon. Friend: we need to know the facts. An immediate independent inquiry is needed to test the effects of the new river. It is right that the Environment Agency should carry out its own review and re-run the model that it presented at the original inquiry. However, that is not enough. I was encouraged by what my hon. Friend said regarding the local authorities. They had independent professional advice at the time of the public inquiry, so they should get together and secure independent, expert, professional advice to check the Environment Agency figures and they should run their own model, if that is necessary. Only then will the local communities be confident that all that can be done is being done.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/9">We must investigate how the Jubilee river was operated during the recent events, and we need independent professional advice on that. There have been many theories&mdash;some of them are surely urban myths&mdash;about the operation of weirs and sluices. I am not an expert on such operations. The December floodwaters were the first real test for the Jubilee river. It is important for its future operation that a judgment is made on how it behaved overall, and that a conclusion is reached about how it was operated.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/10">The maintenance of the river must also be considered. The Environment Agency has told us about the dredging that has been done in the last half century, but we should consider urgently whether more dredging could be done. A constituent who lives on the river told me that jetties and landing stages may not have been constructed properly and they must be examined, as they may be causing obstructions. Ditching and drainage have been mentioned. There were some apparently isolated examples of water welling up some way inland from the river. That was perhaps due to a raised water table being compounded by poor drainage and ditching. That must be considered.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/11">The flood warning system was not satisfactory. For example, the telephone system did not work well in my area. Good local plans must be in place, and I would advocate the return of sirens along especially vulnerable stretches of the river. I remember the old post-war civil defence siren system, which was tested every so often and people knew when it was going to be tested. As a child, I thought that that was wonderful. The people who lived on the banks would have been saved from a great deal of trouble if a siren had sounded when the situation became acute. The other systems did not work well.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/12">I believe that the Government, the Environment Agency and local authorities should consider a range of questions relating to the management of the Thames and its flood plain. Much has been said about building in the flood plain and about terminal 5, which will surely have some effect on the Colne, Colne brook and the Thames. I support my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne in his comments on planning policy guidance note 25.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/13">It is important that we reconsider the plans put forward during the original public inquiry for a further scheme to cover the stretch of the Thames from Datchet downstream. Much was made of those plans some years ago, but it has been lost sight of in the intervening years. When I inquired a few years ago, it was perfectly clear from the Environment Agency's answer that the plans had been dropped. A new scheme should be considered as a matter of urgency, and the Government have a role to play in that.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/14">Key responsibility for the management of the Thames belongs to the Environment Agency, although some of the matters that I have raised, such as ditching, sandbags and cleaning up, will have to be dealt with by local authorities. The royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead did well in that regard. However, some of the main issues can be pulled together only by the Government. I ask the Minister for a number of assurances. First, I ask the Government to play a part in the investigation into the effects and operation of the new river, which is a substantial public project of national importance. The Government have sources of expertise and experience that could be very helpful.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/15">Secondly, a major review of the various factors that cause flooding throughout the Thames valley needs to be undertaken. That is clearly too large a task for local authorities, and I ask the Government to take overall responsibility for such a review. Thirdly, the Government should try to clarify where liability lies. If it can be shown that the problem originally faced by the towns of Maidenhead and Windsor has not been solved, but simply transferred to Datchet and places downstream, then surely there is an important question of liability.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/16">Finally, I ask the Government to revisit the question of flood insurance for homes such as those belonging to my constituents which were recently flooded. As we know, a new system was introduced on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-01">1 January</phrase>. The Association of British Insurers speaks of using its best efforts for people living in areas liable to flooding, and has said that flood insurance</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/17" class="indent">&quot;should continue to be available for as many customers as possible.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/18">As we all know, that means that insurance will not be available for many households in future. If my constituents could not get insurance, the value of their properties would clearly be damaged, and that is not fair. The ABI has tried to pass on to the Government the responsibility for dealing with the problems of flooding. In my view, the Government will have to deal either with the problems or with the ABI.</p>
	<p pid=".40.1/19">People in my constituency who have suffered so greatly in recent weeks must know what happened, and why. I look to the Government to help us to discover the answers.</p>

	<p pid=".42.0/1">I shall be brief. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" name="David Wilshire">the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> for securing the debate, and for introducing it, and I join him in paying tribute to the work of the emergency services in combating some of the distress, anxiety and difficulty that my constituents in Marlow and Medmenham experienced during the recent flooding. They believe, rightly or wrongly, that the Jubilee scheme was either partly or wholly to blame for the exacerbated levels of flooding, but I agree with my hon. Friend that we do not know whether they are right.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/2">The written answer that I received from the Minister on the matter last month is significant. It said that</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/3" class="indent">&quot;the Environment Agency takes the view that the Jubilee River has no impact, adverse or otherwise, on either community.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-01-15.612"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 January 2003; Vol. 397, c. 612W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/4">The Minister will forgive me if I do not take that as a categorical denial; the agency merely &quot;takes the view&quot;. I notice that the agency is also conducting its own inquiry into what happened. Trevor Goodhew of the agency was quoted to that effect recently in the <i>Marlow Free Press</i>:</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/5" class="indent">&quot;We do not know whether it worked&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/6">I believe that the &quot;it&quot; is the Jubilee scheme&mdash;</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/7" class="indent">&quot;as it was intended to but rather than look at it ourselves and be accused of prejudice, we are asking independent regulators to do it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/8">I understand that that independent element is a separate branch of the Environment Agency. Perhaps the Minister will clarify that.</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/9">In a further written answer, when I asked whether all the information gained by the EA about what happened would be published, the Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/10" class="indent">&quot;As with previous floods, there will be an analysis of what happened and the Agency will make available to the public lessons learnt from this information.&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2003-01-28.734"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 January 2003; Vol. 398, c. 734W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".42.0/11">My constituents feel that unless the agency is open and publishes in full information about what happened in January, an independent inquiry along the lines of the one suggested by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1287" name="Michael Trend">the Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend)</phrase> is needed. Unless the Minister can persuade me otherwise, I am inclined to think that that is correct. The levels of flooding were so exacerbated that my constituents are right to ask for an explanation for what happened. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid=".43.0/1">I would like to take this debate upstream but not necessarily upmarket from some of the excellent contributions that we have had, and talk about the flooding that occurred in parts of Oxford&mdash;in South Hinksey, Kennington and on the Botley road&mdash;just as it did two years ago. For the first time, there was flooding in a few properties in Old Botley and Abingdon, as a result of the River Ock flooding. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1209" name="Martin Salter">the hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter)</phrase>, I spent much of my Saturday and Sunday seeing the problem first hand&mdash;working with the emergency services and council workers and trying to let people know what options were available. I fear that I was not as well equipped as the hon. Gentleman. I had no waders. I had only a pair of inadequate wellingtons that were too short. There is concern about whether the equipment provided for the workers was adequate.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/2">We have heard about the impact of flooding, which can be set out in various ways. First, there is the stress from the fear of one's property being inundated, which is followed by the impact of the actual flooding. I do not recommend removing properties in the flood plain and building them somewhere else, so the only solution is the provision of adequate flood defences.</p>
	<p pid=".43.0/3">With the exception of Abingdon, all the areas that I mentioned are affected by the same tributaries to the Thames flooding over the flood plain, so the key question for the west Oxford area is whether there will be an adequate flood defence system. Without one, I fear that it will be difficult to overcome the problems of insurance. I entirely endorse the wise words of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1287" name="Michael Trend">the hon. Member for Windsor (Mr. Trend)</phrase> about insurance problems.</p>

	<p pid=".43.1/1">The hon. Gentleman and I have constituencies with a similar geological make up. A substantial gravel seam in the Thames valley runs from Reading upstream to Oxford. Does he acknowledge that one of the problems is that, as the aquafer rises, water can literally enter people's properties without overtopping the river purely as a result of the rise in the water table? It is important that we do not give false hope to our constituents by talking about flood defences that may not yet be technically feasible.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.44.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" speakername="Evan Harris" colnum="44"  time="014:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h03.htm#30204h03_spnew18">
	<p pid=".44.0/1">That may apply to a small number of properties, but the ones that I am concerned about could be improved by flood defences because they suffer from direct inundation from the street rather than from within. Flooding has an effect on house values and, therefore, the mobility of the population, because people find it difficult to sell their houses and move. The problems experienced by houses in the flood plain have been exacerbated by subsequent developments in the flood plain when those involved in the planning system should know better.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/2">Guidelines could be toughened up in the review of PPG25. The Vale of White Horse district council in my constituency has a new policy. It not only treats the Environment Agency as a statutory consultee on developments in the flood plain, but never disagrees if the EA advises against planning permission for flood plain developments. That is not the case with other local councils, but such practice could be included in guidance to beef it up.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/3">During flooding in the Oxford area, some things went well and some went badly. The emergency services performed well, particularly the fire and rescue services. They were there, they were available, they had their mobile phones and went from house to house when requested. Another thing that went well were some functions of the Environment Agency&mdash;their workers on the ground and the supply of pumps, which in many cases kept the water at bay.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/4">I pay tribute to Innes Jones, Geoff Bell and Peter Collins, the engineers, who were on the ground with me on those days. They made themselves available to see the situation at first hand and helped to deploy their facilities. Council staff worked hard and the supply of sandbags was better. The flood defences that had nearly been completed in Kidlington were not called into action, but at least people in that area were not as stressed as they feared that they might have been in view of the 1998 floods. Another thing that worked well was the action and initiative taken by local people, such as Mr. Andy Webber of Earl street, and Mr. John Mastroddi of Kennington road in Oxford, who took matters into their own hands by alerting their neighbours and getting stuck in with the deployment of pumps.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/5">What did not work well, according to a council debrief that I attended, was the command structure, which was not up and running quickly enough and was not centralised enough. Road closures were not clear. The Botley road should have been closed; the wave effect from large vehicles going down it directly exacerbated flooding and it was not clear why the police did not close it earlier. The warnings were inadequate. Websites are there to be updated and they can be specific. They can warn, &quot;People in Botley road in Oxford ought to know that flood waters are not predicted to peak until tomorrow, so even if one thinks it is getting better, please do not remove the precautions.&quot; It would have been better for us to have had loudhailers, because that would have got across the message. Some hon. Members perhaps do not need loudhailers in the Reading area, but they would have been a boon, because they would have got the information directly to the people who needed it.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/6">Thames Water did not work well. We have heard about the sewage problem. There will always be sewage contamination of the highway drainage and vice versa, but Thames Water has since got its act together and has set out a second stage study. It will take six months to complete, at a cost of &pound;25,000. In a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-29">29 January</phrase>, Thames Water states:</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Whilst we hope that this study will help us identify a solution to the flooding problem, we must make the best use of our resources and, with this in mind, I regret that I cannot confirm that funding will be available for any suitable scheme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/8">That question has already been raised by the hon. Member for Windsor.</p>
	<p pid=".44.0/9">Finally, we must consider the performance of Railtrack in dealing with the culverts for which it is responsible under the railway line at Kennington. It has delayed and that is still considered to be a problem by people in that area. Therefore, there is a great deal for the agencies to do and I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid=".45.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" name="David Wilshire">the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> on securing the debate. I want to express sympathy to my constituents and my thanks to the Surrey fire and rescue service and Runnymede borough council for their sterling efforts during the crisis. My hon. Friend said that we are not in the blame game. Everybody here will understand that the initial reaction of people whose houses flooded just two years after what they thought was a once-in-a-lifetime event is anger. As that sentiment subsides, cooler heads are prevailing and, as my hon. Friend said, people want to make sure that they find out what happened, so that there is a firm base of evidence to build on in planning for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".45.0/2">Hon. Members have mentioned the maintenance of water courses, the contribution of the Jubilee river; and the operation of weirs and barriers on the Thames. There is a huge need for an independent element in the analysis of those problems. The Minister was shaking his head earlier, when my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne was talking about the lack of independence in that one department of the Environment Agency audited another. However, I think that the Minister will accept that there is at least a problem with the public perception that the Environment Agency is both the promoter of major infrastructure projects, such as the Jubilee river, and the regulator that ultimately has to assess whether those projects are working.</p>

	<p pid=".45.1/1">I will deal with that in my reply. First, the EA schemes are subject to independent assessment by Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs engineers&mdash;who are not part of the EA. As for the Jubilee river, which I will look at in detail, the assessment was made by a completely independent consultant who is not part of the EA.</p>

	<p pid=".46.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister. If he can elaborate on those remarks during his reply, it would be helpful. As my hon. Friend the Member for Spelthorne said, Runnymede, Spelthorne and Elmbridge borough councils have immediately taken the initiative in appointing an independent hydrologist. He will review the events, so that they can talk to the EA on a qualified basis, rather than retelling residents' anecdotes, which is important, but not definitive. I join my hon. Friend in asking the Minister whether he can help with the funding of that initiative by councils.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/2">There are questions about the effect of the Jubilee river, other man-made influences and river maintenance, but there is also a willingness to recognise that the end result of the analysis might be that climate change is ultimately responsible for what occurred. If that is the case and we must accept that such events will happen more frequently, given that river defences in London were improved 30 or 40 years ago to good effect&mdash;there has been no flooding since&mdash;are the Government prepared to support the major expenditure on infrastructure that would be required to take that approach further up the Thames to secure the defence of areas such as Chertsey, Egham and Staines? We know that the Government propose to abandon the flood defences of several rural areas, but I hope that the Minister will assure us that the flood defences of urbanised areas will remain a Government priority.</p>
	<p pid=".46.0/3">May I suggest to the Minister that if climate change is responsible for the floods, there would be no more appropriate source of revenue for the funding of flood defences than the climate change levy? When that was announced, it was supposed to be revenue neutral, but the Government have since reneged on the reduction of employers' national insurance contributions that made it revenue neutral.</p>

	<p pid=".46.2/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, but the financing of flood defences is an essential part of the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/2">If it turns out that heavy rainfall and climate change are the root cause of the problem, we shall look to the Government for investment in effective management in order to allow those of us with constituencies along the river to live with the changed situation. That will mean making necessary resources available to the Environment Agency and other bodies.</p>
	<p pid=".46.2/3">Tomorrow, the Deputy Prime Minister will announce his communities plan to the House of Commons. The Government recognise that development in the south-east is inevitable and necessary in order to maintain national economic growth.

	<p pid=".47.0/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" name="David Wilshire">the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the way in which he presented his case. May I offer my sympathy to his and other hon. Members' constituents who were affected by floods? My constituency of Lewes was severely hit in 2000 and I am only too aware of how severe and traumatic floods can be for individuals who are caught up in such unfortunate events.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/2">I understand from a parliamentary question answered by the Minister earlier this month that the flood was the third worst in the Medmenham and Marlow areas since records began. The flood was worse than that in any other year except 1894 and 1947. We know that 645 homes were flooded during the new year holiday period, and we have seen on our televisions that this is the anniversary of the terrible floods of 1953. Floods are sadly always with us, and they will always be with us. There is nothing that any Government&mdash;not even this Prime Minister&mdash;can do to stop floods from occurring. We can try to ensure that we put in place measures to minimise the impact of floods on our citizens and the Government can put in place measures to slow down climate change, which several hon. Members rightly mentioned.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/3">Climate change is undoubtedly occurring. The Thames barrier has been mentioned, and hon. Members might be aware that in 1982, it was planned that the barrier would last unchanged until 2030. It was anticipated that there would be 10 closures per year in this decade and 30 closures per year by 2030. However, there were 24 closures in 2001 and there were 19 closures this winter. It already seems that the Thames barrier is under increasing pressure, which must be caused by climate change.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/4">I understand that the Environment Agency has a &pound;4 million project to plan for flood risk management in the Thames estuary. It would be useful to know what progress has been made on that and what further expenditure the Minister anticipates along the Thames to protect London, which is key to our national position.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/5">In the context of climate change, it is important that we put in place measures that minimise the requirement for flood defences to try to solve the root problem rather than deal with the sore that arises as its consequence. It is interesting that building is now taking place on flood plains, although the Government are taking steps to stop it. However, we have an overheating of the south-east compared with almost dereliction in some parts of the north, because the Government fail to have a proper regional policy. It has been predicted that carbon dioxide emissions from air travel will double between 1990 and 2010, the Government are abandoning road traffic reduction targets, and the amount of energy generated from renewable sources went down last year from 3.3 to 3.1 per cent. There has also been an international failure to ratify the Kyoto agreement by some of the key players, not least the Americans and President Bush. All those factors, which may seem a long way away, have an impact on the Thames valley, as they do on my constituency and all others in the country.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/6">The Minister can do his best to erect flood defences, but it will not solve the problem unless his colleagues in Government take the necessary steps to deal with climate change, and I am sad to say that they are not. However, there are steps that the Minister can take to improve matters in his own Department as well. We are seeing an increase in the money allocated for flood defences, to which the Minister will doubtless refer. However, we have not yet seen any Government action to sort out the bureaucratic and shambolic arrangements that have been in place for so many decades, if not centuries, in this country to deal with flood defence. So many bodies are involved. All have powers, but none has a specific duty to get on and do something.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/7">When a flood occurs, after we have tried to deal with the immediate aftermath, the question is who is responsible. Is it the Environment Agency, the water company, the Highways Agency, the county or district council, the internal drainage board, Railtrack or the riparian owners? The Government need to get grip on that and ensure that a clear, workable structure is in place. By putting money into flood defences, the Government have put more fuel into the car, but they have not dealt with the fact that it is barely roadworthy. Until they do that, we will continue to struggle.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/8">We need to ensure that we do not always leap to the assumption that the best solutions are always hard engineering measures. It may be that they are the best option for individual towns, but I do not think that sufficient attention has been paid nationwide to the opportunities presented by soft measures. We could examine the use of farmers' fields for flooding and riverbank heights to the north, south, east and west of towns. Those measures have a role to play, but the Environment Agency seems to look to hard engineering measures first, just because it has always done that. I will stray briefly to the subject of Lewes. The Environment Agency has been able to come up with a complicated plan for Lewes, but it has been unable to reach agreement with half a dozen farmers south of the town to use their fields for flooding if necessary. If that is replicated in the Thames valley and elsewhere, something is wrong with the system.</p>
	<p pid=".47.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1209" name="Martin Salter">The hon. Member for Reading, West (Mr. Salter)</phrase> raised the question of West Berkshire council. I thought that he was uncharacteristically acerbic in his presentation, and I wonder whether he would have been like that if it the council had been Labour run.

	<p pid=".48.1/1">I have barely raised the matter, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman will let me finish it.</p>
	<p pid=".48.1/2">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman brought into the debate a party political point that had been happily lacking in other contributions. I also think that he was wrong to refer to an officer of the council in critical terms rather than a councillor. Those officers are not elected, and it was wrong to say that he had a party allegiance.</p>

	<p pid=".48.2/1"><i>Hansard </i>shows that I was critical at Prime Minister's Question Time of my own party's lack of financial support for the civil defence grant. I had some stern words to say to Reading borough council about its sandbag policy. Even in this debate, I did not shrink from drawing to the attention of my hon. Friend the Minister the inadequacies in the emergency planning funding regime. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will accept that I have been anything but partisan.</p>

	<p pid=".49.0/1">I am grateful to hear that. I always have time for the hon. Gentleman and that helps to put the matter in context. I am always wary of attacking individual councillors and others in Westminster, when they are unable to answer back effectively. I could say many things about my own county council, which is not Liberal Democrat, but I usually restrain myself for those reasons.</p>
	<p pid=".49.0/2">Finally, I want to speak briefly about the planning of flood defence schemes for individual towns. Evaluation of properties is an important issue: they are often grossly undervalued, so the cost-benefit ratio of what can be achieved in a particular town is sometimes out of line. More proper calculations are necessary and we should also examine the Environment Agency's requirement to apply cells to specific towns. Again, they often fail to provide a townwide solution and leave some areas unprotected, causing conflict in the communities. Some of those undesirable aspects of the problem apply nationally, so when plans are brought forward for the Thames valley and elsewhere, I hope that the nationwide problems will be addressed as part of the process.</p>

	<p pid=".49.1/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" name="David Wilshire">the Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> on securing this timely debate and on the tone of his speech, which was greatly in the spirit of inquiry. He made some thoroughly practical suggestions and sparked off useful contributions from other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/2">This year we commemorate the 1953 flooding disaster when the North sea took England by storm. On the night of <phrase class="date" code="1953-01-31">31 January 1953</phrase>, wind speeds of 125 mph were recorded before the tidal flood descended on the east coast. Three hundred and seven people died, 24,000 homes were damaged or destroyed and more than 30,000 people were evacuated. Nearly 200,000 acres of land were inundated and 100 miles of road and 200 miles of railway were seriously damaged.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/3">Speaking on <phrase class="date" code="2003-01-30">30 January</phrase> this year at the 1953 floods conference in Norwich, the Minister assured his audience that the Government were committed and on track to meet the challenges of flood and coastal defence for today and tomorrow. He contrasted 1953 with today, stating:</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/4" class="indent">&quot;We do live in different times&mdash;not least because we are better at warning people. In 1953, there was no national warning service. Emergency plans were hampered by poor communications.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/5">In the light of the flooding disasters of Christmas and new year 2002&ndash;03, the Minister might be accused of a certain wishful thinking. Despite 136 flood warnings, 645 properties were flooded, some in my own constituency. Many were left stranded and without communication when the Environment Agency's website crashed due to over-use. Apparently, the problem was 40 times worse than in the year 2000 and, as we have heard, the Thames valley was particularly affected&mdash;not just by river water, but by overflowing sewers bringing the most stinking of consequences.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/6">I am concerned that the consultation of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the flood and coastal defence funding review explicitly excluded from its scope</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/7" class="indent">&quot;emergency planning and emergency funding arrangements&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".49.1/8">If the Minister acknowledges that flooding is a natural phenomenon that cannot be eliminated, and admits that the risk to people and property can be managed, why were contingency provisions omitted from the consultation? I recognise that it is also a Home Office problem, but we are told that we have joined-up government.</p>

	<p pid=".50.0/1">The answer is simple: the Home Office is carrying out its own review on emergency planning, dealing with some of the issues raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Reading, West, particularly in respect of funding and organisation.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.50.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1214" speakername="Jonathan Sayeed" colnum="50"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h03.htm#30204h03_spnew30">
	<p pid=".50.1/1">DEFRA is the lead Department. It is extraordinary that DEFRA's consultation paper, &quot;The Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review&quot;, did not deal with emergency planning and emergency funding arrangements. Will the Minister tell the Chamber when the conclusions to that consultation will be published? I have asked the Minister that question several times and have yet to receive an answer.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/2">Flooding is often mentioned in the same breath as admirable terms such as sustainability, strategic approach and integrated management, but how much of them did we see in relation to the flooding in the new year, and how far have they been put into practice in the Government's long-term vision for flood and coastal defence? Operational responsibility for flood defence rests with the Environment Agency, the internal drainage boards, the local authorities, the maritime local authorities, the water companies, the riparian owners, and so on. That is hardly conducive to an integrated strategic and streamlined approach that would have the flexibility to recognise and react to specific local needs.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/3">There is a case for a statutory duty for operational authorities to carry out flood and coastal defence activities rather than their current permissive powers. Will the water Bill, which is due to be published very soon, include powers to rationalise the two-tiered flood defence committees? How will the Government ensure that decision making does not become too remote from local interests? What consideration has been given to the establishment of a single executive operating authority, possibly the Environment Agency, funded by a central grant, that would require action to be taken in the event of an emergency and apportion responsibility and costs afterwards in order to prevent a problem from becoming a disaster? Such decisions could be subject to an appeal system, and should be monitored to ensure impartiality.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/4">When will the Government realise that flood plains contain areas that provide general economic and environmental benefit to the greater community, not for capital gain by the development and building industries, but as water-absorbing land that can reduce the risk of flooding elsewhere? Some 27 per cent. of new property by value throughout England and Wales, including &pound;80 billion of property in and around London alone, is built on flood plains. How many more millions of households are to be exposed to increased flood disasters, lack of insurance cover and a drop in property value that renders homes a worthless asset? Why are the Government putting more people at risk of flooding while planning to introduce taxes to pay for more, crucial flood defences? Why are more than one in three applications to build homes on flood plains being approved while the advice of the Environment Agency is ignored?</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/5">Last year, the Government approved 288 of the 758 planning applications that the Environment Agency objected to on the grounds that they would mean building on flood plains. One in five of the rejected applications were then passed on appeal, against the agency's advice. The Deputy Prime Minister's regeneration scheme for the Thames Gateway region would put another 1 million people at risk from flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/6">Will the Minister confirm that he is considering a new tax on property developers to pay for the erection and maintenance of flood defences on flood plains? Will local authorities also be expected to top up the flood defence funds in addition to all the other burdens that central Government places on their shoulders? Who will be required to pay for the increased drainage costs? Will it be the existing shareholders who, by and large, do not want even more urban sprawl? Will it be local authorities, which are usually opposed to building on flood plains? It may be the water companies, which will then pass on the costs to their existing customers, who do not want the development in the first place. Those costs may include the cost of new, otherwise unnecessary main drainage systems. How much of the money for flood defences promised by the Minister on a year-by-year basis has been spent on, or earmarked for, flood defence plans agreed by the competent authority? If there has been an underspend, how large is it, why has it occurred and what are the Government going to do to remedy the situation?</p>
	<p pid=".50.1/7">Surely it is time that the development of flood plains was capped. The Minister should spend more time and energy researching soft defences&mdash;sustainable farming practices that assist water retention and the streamlining of responsibility in view of the increased risk of disasters threatened by climate change and rising sea levels. The exercise of the forces of nature is out of our control, but the minimisation of their impact lies in the hands of the Government. The delivery of a policy that looks beyond sandbags to a long-term preventive strategy is essential before the next disaster catches us as unprepared and underfunded as we were in 1953.</p>

	<p pid=".51.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1327" name="David Wilshire">the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire)</phrase> on the way in which he has raised the debate. He made a number of pertinent points. I regret that in the 10 minutes available to me it will be difficult to answer all the points made by hon. Members. We have had some good contributions from my hon. Friends the Members for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) and for Reading, West (Mr. Salter), and the hon. Members for Windsor (Mr. Trend), for Wycombe (Mr. Goodman), for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris), for Lewes (Norman Baker) and, of course, for Mid-Bedfordshire (Mr. Sayeed).</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/2">I have every sympathy with those, in the Thames valley and elsewhere, who were affected by the floods over the new year. It is very unpleasant to have one's property flooded. I want to place on the record my appreciation for the Environment Agency staff, who worked long hours throughout the holiday period, the local authority staff, the emergency services and the volunteers, who, as my hon. Friend the Member for Reading West stated, gave their time willingly and freely.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/3">I echo the point that this is the anniversary of the devastating 1953 floods, which affected my constituency when the Trent burst its banks. Even though north Lincolnshire is quite a long way inland, the floods reached the edges of Scunthorpe. The hon. Member for Mid-Bedfordshire asked many questions, which I cannot answer in 10 minutes, but the Government are going to arrange a three-hour debate on flooding this month, which will be an opportunity to go into the details in greater depth.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/4">I point out that the hon. Gentleman might have arranged such a debate in his own party's time. This subject is of interest and there are serious issues at stake. We are confident that we are on track to reduce risk. We are not complacent. One can never entirely remove the risk of flooding, as hon. Members have acknowledged, but we have done a great deal in the past few years. There will be an opportunity to discuss the details of the funding review in the debate, and during proceedings on the water Bill, which I expect to be published around that date, we will be able to answer some of the questions raised by the review.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/5">Although the January floods affected about 600 people, for whom I have every sympathy, they were comparable to those of 2000 as there were similar groundwater levels. In some parts of the country the water levels were higher. In the Thames area water levels were at their highest since 1947. In 2000, 10,000 properties were affected. In 2002, 600 were affected. That is no consolation to those involved, but it shows that steps are being taken progressively to reduce the risk.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/6">The 1947 figures for people affected in the Thames region are dramatic. I must qualify them by saying that there are differences in every kind of flood, and the 1947 flood was caused largely by snow melt, whereas this year's flood was caused by intense rainfall over a short period. The way in which the tributaries behaved in 1947 also differed, although some of the tributaries were higher in 2003 than they were in 1947.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/7">I will give hon. Members some indication of the scale of the problems in 1947, although I am surprised at the figures because there has been a lot more building since then. In January 2003, approximately 120 properties in the region of the Thames from Windsor to Teddington were affected&mdash;the figures are not yet exact because information is still being received&mdash;whereas in 1947 the number was 6,956. We do not have information on whether all the properties in 1947 suffered from internal flooding.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/8">In Surrey, which includes the Thames, Bourne and Wey, 231 properties were affected in 2003, as against 333 in 2000 and 7,015 in 1947. In the area from Spelthorne borough, which involves the Thames and the Colne, the figure for 2003 was approximately 60 properties, whereas in 1947 it was 2,114. Those figures are evidence of the huge investment in flood defence made by successive Governments.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/9">I shall struggle to respond to all the questions that I have been asked. I shall respond first to the hon. Member for Spelthorne, since it was his debate, so he has perhaps a greater entitlement to answers.</p>
	<p pid=".51.0/10">I do not often do this in such debates, but I shall agree to the three points about which the hon. Gentleman asked me. First, he wanted the facts, and we are keen to provide those; secondly, he wanted the plans to be examined in an attempt to minimise the risk to his area, and we are happy to agree to that; thirdly, he asked about funding, and I can assure him that funding will increase year on year.</p>

	<p pid=".53.3/1">The actual details are published by the regional flood defence committee, and it has strong reserves to deal with the legitimate issues concerning contractors and land purchases which may arise from the plans. The committee has a very good record.</p>
	<p pid=".53.3/2">I shall comment briefly on the Jubilee river, because I know that it is of concern to hon. Members. I should make it clear that, based on the information that I have seen, I am satisfied that the Jubilee river did not have an impact on the properties on the Thames which were flooded.</p>
	<p pid=".53.3/3">The Jubilee scheme protected approximately 400 properties from flooding and a further 1,000 properties from disruption by the floods. I understand that people may be concerned about the scheme, which is new. However, its details were examined by a public inquiry in 1992 which concluded that the downstream effects would be minimal.</p>
	<p pid=".53.3/4">This year, the water levels rose very fast, faster than in 2000, both upstream and downstream of the Jubilee river. The impact of the Maidenhead flood release scheme on peak water levels upstream was also negligible. The water levels downstream were measured using the best data available from the gauges on the tailwaters of the weirs; the readings of the peak flood levels from those weirs cover all major floods since 1894. If the Jubilee river were causing downstream levels to rise, we would expect to see evidence of that at the gauges downstream of where the Jubilee river re-enters the Thames. However, there is no such evidence.</p>

	<p pid=".54.1/1">I have only two minutes, and I want to deal with the independent aspect. I will then give way if I have time.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/2">I may be able to reassure the hon. Gentleman about the reviews. The Environment Agency has commissioned Gibb Ltd., which is an independent engineering consultant. That is why there is no case for funding further independent reviews, although I can assure the hon. Gentleman that the Environment Agency and DEFRA will be happy to co-operate with any sort of review. Gibb Ltd. was commissioned to re-run an updated hydraulic model, using the 2003 flood data, to determine the impact on downstream flood levels. That model was run with and without the flood alleviation channel.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/3">The preliminary findings presented to the Environment Agency showed no significant difference between levels in the Thames just downstream of where the Jubilee river joins it, with or without the flood alleviation channel. Residents will, of course, be invited to examine the data that have been collected, and to speak to staff about their origin and the analysis. In due course, when the full data are produced, they will be made available to all interested parties.</p>
	<p pid=".54.1/4">I hope that in the three-hour debate there will be more chance to talk through the details, but I make it absolutely clear that although I understand residents' anxieties, and we will take steps to reassure them, the Jubilee river was not responsible for the recent flooding.</p>

	<p pid=".55.1/1">First, I pay tribute to my constituent, Mr. Mervyn Richardson, who brought the issue to my attention and who has been campaigning on behalf of his wife, Beryl, who has Alzheimer's. Much of what I shall say is personal to him, but I will make general points.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/2">There is no question but that the three Alzheimer drugs, which were reviewed in 2000 by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, enhance the cognitive skills of Alzheimer sufferers as well as the quality of life of the sufferers and their carers. It is important to remember the carers, too.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/3">My constituent made a video called &quot;A Sweeter Pill to Swallow&mdash;Beryl's Story&quot;, which emphasises the improvements that can be achieved. It should be remembered that Beryl started her galantamine&mdash;Reminyl&mdash;treatment with a mini-mental state examination score of 11. The NICE recommendation is a minimum of 12. By June 2001, within a month of reaching the full drug, Beryl's MMSE score had increased to more than 17. It fell off to 10 in March 2002 and, in accordance with NICE guidance, Beryl was taken off her Reminyl treatment when her cognitive skills fell dramatically.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/4">Beryl was put pack on the Reminyl treatment, at my constituent's instigation, when her skills improved. She was then administered 150 per cent. of licensed dose and she again improved. Her MMSE in November 2002 was recorded as 17. The fact that Beryl was able to contribute to the video made in October 2002 says a great deal about the benefit of the treatment with Galantamine.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/5">All three drugs, Aricept, Exelon and Reminyl, cost about &pound;1,000 per annum, as does memantine&mdash;Ebixa. Alzheimer's disease is a major killer in the developed countries; some put it as the third most lethal. My constituent feels strongly that it should be given a much higher priority, as are cancer and heart disease.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/6">All those three drugs inhibit the acetylcholine esterase. In addition, galantamine via the nicotinic receptors enhances the production of more acetylcholine, the brain chemical messenger, on which brain cell to brain cell communication depends. Hence, Galantamine is far more cost-effective than the other two NICE-approved drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/7">In October 2002, a fourth Alzheimer drug, Ebixa, was licensed in the United Kingdom. It works differently from the other three. Ebixa decreases in the brain the level of glutamate, which leads to neuronal disfunction. It has been successfully used in Germany for 10 years and in several other EU states for a varying number of years.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/8">Ebixa is reported to be of value for sufferers with more severe Alzheimer's disease than the other three drugs, and my constituent is concerned that it has not been referred to NICE for consideration. In a parliamentary answer, the Minister of State, Department of Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1234" name="Jacqui Smith">the hon. Member for Redditch (Jacqui Smith)</phrase>, made it clear that that would not happen yet.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/9"><i>Monthly Index of Medical Specialties</i>, in announcing Ebixa, does not refer to it having to be prescribed initially by a specialist, as is the case for the three other inhibitor drugs. Some 60 per cent. of sufferers benefit from the use of the three inhibitor drugs. For some like Beryl, the improvement is dramatic. Some sufferers who do not benefit may not do so because their carers have not been adequately trained in how to deal with the side effects.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/10">The cost of all four drugs is about &pound;1,000 a year, which is good value for money if it delays the onset of the disease and saves up to &pound;20,000 that may be needed to keep somebody in care. As cancer drugs are prescribed in combination, there is an excellent reason for Ebixa to be prescribed in combination with one of the other inhibiting drugs, especially Reminyl. My constituent would like that to be considered as part of treatment in future.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/11">The problem in Poole&mdash;there is the same problem in Bournemouth&mdash;is that the primary care trust has declined to prescribe Ebixa because its drug budget is about &pound;1 million overspent. Although Andrew Morris, the chief executive, whom I saw at the weekend, said that a much bigger provision is being made for next year, there is a real problem for many primary care trusts, as the Minister will understand.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/12">My constituent is concerned that mismanagement of drug budgets means that pressure is placed on some more expensive drugs, such as those for Alzheimer sufferers, and their not being delivered. His view is that people on prescriptions should be subject to blood tests to ensure that they are taking the medicine. There is a problem in ensuring that people who pick up repeat prescriptions take the drugs. We all know examples of people who do not. I suppose that there are civil liberty worries about that. Nevertheless, we need to manage the drugs budget much better if we are to provide more expensive drugs to Alzheimer sufferers.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/13">In the case of Alzheimer sufferers, drugs need to be used under the supervision of a responsible carer. Hence, the likelihood of an Alzheimer drug being administered as directed is far greater than for any other drug, especially for an aged out-patient. In many cases, the progressive nature of Alzheimer's leads to incontinence, which is degrading to sufferers and carers. The onset of that can be delayed by the administration of, for example, Reminyl. Incontinence pads are expensive and cost many thousands of pounds. My constituent was concerned to learn recently that Dorset health care trust has an 18-week delay before it can assess whether people should receive incontinence pads. Such delays will cause hygiene problems for sufferer and carer, and there is greater likelihood of depression and, sometimes, suicide.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/14">It is important that drugs are prescribed at the earliest possible stage. In times of obvious economic stringency in the NHS, my constituent fails to understand why primary care trusts are permitted to prescribe Aricept and Exelon when it has been clearly demonstrated that Reminyl has double action, and that its effects are greater and last longer.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/15">It is extremely unreasonable of Poole primary care trust to refuse to allow the prescribing of Ebixa when the signs are that that well-tried drug is effective for those in the far more advanced state of Alzheimer's. Additionally, far too many patients who qualify for inhibitor drugs are experiencing delays in referral by GPs. There are delays in assessments and, if a scan is required, the delays are even greater. As inhibitor drugs slow down the onset of the disease, such delays may have a real impact on their performance when they are finally administered.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/16">There is a difficulty with postcode rationing. Hampshire has a different regime from Poole, and there is a worry that people are treated differently throughout the country. If we study diagnosis and the treatment rate for Alzheimer's throughout Europe, we see that France, north America and Spain have a far higher rate of diagnosis and administration of the drugs than us. I wonder whether the disease has high enough priority in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/17">My constituent is concerned that he has had a long fight for the drugs that his wife requires. He is a chemist who has a list of qualifications as long as my arm. He knows what he is doing, and he worked for the United Nations for many years. His worry is about not only his case, but the cases of others who have to fight for drugs on behalf of their loved ones. The important point is that the sooner an assessment is made and inhibitor drugs are administered, the better the patient's chance of at least a good 12 months before the onset of more serious problems. We must bear in mind the consequent quality of life for them and the carer as well as the savings for the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/18">My constituent is extremely keen on the World Health Organisation's comment that every country, no matter what the constraints on its resources, can do something to improve the mental health of its people. The courage and commitment to take the necessary steps are required. He wants to hear from the Minister that that disease has the highest priority, that there will not be postcode rationing, that the drugs that have an appreciable effect in slowing down the disease are being delivered and that we can improve quality of life for people who face trying circumstances, sometimes towards the end of their years. Occasionally, however, young people suffer from Alzheimer's. It is not exclusively suffered by the elderly.</p>
	<p pid=".55.1/19">I welcome the support of my constituency neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/754" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mrs. Brooke)</phrase>. I am sure that our constituencies on the south coast have a high proportion of pensioners, that such problems occur regularly and that the Minister's response will be dear to the heart of many of my constituents.</p>

	<p pid=".57.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate. The issue is important, because our constituencies contain a high proportion of pensioners.</p>
	<p pid=".57.0/2">One of my constituents contacted me today, and I would like to ask the hon. Gentleman whether he has heard of similar cases. She wants her husband to get the best possible care, so she works in a caf&eacute; at lunchtime to earn the &pound;110 a month it costs for drugs that are not available locally. She is heartbroken that those drugs are available in neighbouring areas.</p>

	<p pid=".57.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a powerful point. As I said&mdash;I hope that the Minister responds&mdash;the drugs cost about &pound;1,000 a year. Problems can arise if primary care trusts are under budgetary pressures. In such circumstances, people sometimes have to spend their own money on their loved ones. One can understand that, but it is difficult and annoying when people see that neighbouring primary care trusts take a different view to theirs.</p>
	<p pid=".57.1/2">I have said enough. I have a great regard for my constituent, and for his caring and campaigning for his wife. I hope that the Minister clearly sets out Government policy on the issue.</p>

	<p pid=".58.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1266" name="Robert Syms">the hon. Member for Poole (Mr. Syms)</phrase> on securing this important debate. He has raised issues of wide interest and concern to people throughout the country, not just in his own constituency. I am aware of the campaigning work of the hon. Gentleman's constituent, who has produced a video&mdash;which was met with some acclaim&mdash;that highlights some of the issues, and I pay personal tribute to the work that he has done in caring for his wife.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the importance of carers and families at the start of his speech. We should all be aware that although such work is often expressed as being a burden, many people care gladly for their families. We must ensure that we put in as much support as we can for people who take on such responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/3">Alzheimer's disease affects a large number of people in this country; it involves not only the patients, but their families and carers. Although drug treatment is important&mdash;the hon. Gentleman has concentrated on that and I will refer specifically to those issues&mdash;care for such patients revolves around a series of health and social care interventions as well as the available medical drugs. It is important that we try to give as much holistic support as we can. Because the disease is so widespread, there is intense interest in new drug treatments that are being developed to alleviate or delay the progression of the disease and which may eventually result in a cure.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/4">It is estimated that there are about 600,000 people with dementia in the UK. About 5 per cent. of people over 65 have dementia, rising to about 20 per cent. of people who are over 80. The number of people who live to a more advanced age is rapidly increasing, so the number of people with dementia is also increasing, and we expect that increase to become significant in the coming years. It is estimated that by 2026 there will be 840,000 people with dementia, rising to 1.2 million by 2050. That is on the horizon, and it will become an area of increasing concern. Many people of advanced years have a wide range of medical conditions, which means that caring for them is a complex task.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/5">It is estimated that Alzheimer's disease causes up to 60 per cent. of dementia cases; the figures that I mentioned earlier are for dementia cases as a whole. Alzheimer's is characterised by a widespread loss of mental function, and features memory loss, difficulties with language, disorientation and, sometimes, a change in personality, which can be difficult to cope with. People with dementia and their carers need high-quality services to ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and wide support.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/6">We recognise the importance of meeting the mental health needs of older people&mdash;the hon. Gentleman outlined the World Health Organisation's statement on mental health needs&mdash;and that is why we have made it a priority. It is one of the eight standards in the older people's national service framework, which shows that it is one of the Government's clinical priorities. The NSF was published in March 2001 and covers a range of issues for older people such as rooting out age discrimination. That is important because age discrimination should not influence the way in which primary care trusts exercise their policies on the prescription of drugs.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/7">The NSF also contains a specific section on mental health care for older people. The standard says that older people with mental health problems should have access to integrated mental health services provided by both the NHS and local authorities which ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and support for them and their carers. That is a wide description of the Government's priority and the way in which requirements should be met locally.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/8">Standard 7 sets out a detailed service model that states what older people with mental health problems are entitled to. It also contains a series of milestones to allow us to monitor progress. They are due to be introduced in 2004, and we are gathering information about what local communities are doing to ensure that they comply with the milestones in the service model. The framework is pretty rigorous and the mental health services that older people receive in the future will not be hit and miss; they should be able to rely on the framework wherever they live.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/9">That is important because the hon. Gentleman made a great deal out of the postcode rationing of drugs, although we were all well aware of that several years ago, before the advent of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, when postcode rationing of services was just as much of a problem. The introduction of the NSFs will do for services what I genuinely believe that NICE did for new drugs and emerging technologies.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/10">Anti-dementia drugs are only a small element of the range of health and social services that older people with dementia need, but it is fair to say that they are becoming increasingly important. Three main anti-dementia drugs are available; their proper names are donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine. They are used as part of the treatment for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's, and although they cannot cure the disease, they can delay the onset of more serious symptoms.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/11">In January 2001, NICE recommended that the three drugs should be available on the NHS as one component of the management of people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. We provided that the NHS should be under a statutory duty to make drugs available after a ruling from NICE, and the statutory duty has bitten on the service. People are entitled to expect the three approved drugs to be available when they are deemed to be clinically suitable. If people with Alzheimer's disease meet the criteria for requiring the drugs, they should be able to access them on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/12">We are aware that there has been a steady increase in prescribing since the NICE judgment. When NICE considered the issue, it estimated that the total cost of the three drugs was likely to rise to about &pound;42 million a year, but it would take at least three years to reach that level because people would need to go through an assessment and it would have to be determined how the drugs could help with the holistic care of people with Alzheimer's.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/13">Data for 2001&ndash;02 indicate that about &pound;13.5 million was spent to meet the cost of dispensing the three anti-dementia drugs as a result of primary care prescribing. Prescribing has continued to increase during 2002&ndash;03, although we do not yet have figures for the full year. However, hospitals prescribe a considerable amount of Alzheimer's drugs and that is not included in the PCT prescribing budgets, which means that we do not have the figures on that. We expect prescribing to increase at a steady rate as more PCTs prescribe the drugs. Almost 100 per cent. of PCTs are prescribing the first of the drugs, and about 87 to 95 per cent. are prescribing the other two. Clinicians are finding the drugs an increasingly useful way in which to manage people with Alzheimer's.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/14">The situation is different for the new anti-dementia drug, memantine. It was launched in the UK in October, so it has not been around for very long. Because it is the only drug for moderate to severe Alzheimer's, there is inevitably great interest in its availability. We do not yet have any prescribing data with which to analyse its availability, but we know that some people are obtaining it on the NHS and some are obtaining it privately.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/15">The state of affairs is clear. NICE has yet to assess memantine for clinical and cost effectiveness, so for the moment NHS bodies across the country have to access the publicly available evidence and determine local policies for the drug's use. The same applies to any treatment that has not yet been approved by NICE; that is an established position, and it is for PCTs and clinicians to decide locally on their policy.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/16">We can perhaps anticipate what the hon. Member for Poole will ask next. The question now, obviously, is when will NICE appraise memantine. We are considering including an appraisal of the drug in the next&mdash;and eighth&mdash;wave of NICE's work. Announcements should be made about that wave in the next few weeks, so hon. Members will not have to wait months for it. Submissions for the appraisal are currently before Ministers, and NICE will then determine its timetable for the next wave. As I say, the drug came on to the UK market only in October, and some five months later, we are considering putting it before NICE for its next wave of work. That is a sign of the importance that the Government attach to the issue.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/17">I recognise that even that period is disappointing for those who think that memantine should immediately be available to all people with moderate to severe Alzheimer's, but we must recognise that there are enormous pressures on the NHS, and particularly on PCTs and their prescription duties. It is therefore essential that we assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of a drug before making it generally available on the NHS. We now have a statutory duty, once a drug has been before NICE, to make sure that we follow through and enforce its decisions.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/18">The hon. Members for Poole and for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Mrs. Brooke) both mentioned postcode rationing. Before the introduction of NICE, there was a free-for-all as to which patients could obtain which drugs. The introduction of NICE has led to a much more rational and coherent system of drug and technology use. I am sure that, as a result of the spending review settlement, both hon. Members' local PCTs will experience a real-terms significant increase in investment over the next three years. That increase will probably be in the region of 7 or 8 per cent. a year for most PCTs.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/19">I recognise that there are still pressures on budgets because PCTs have so much to do, and the expectations of their communities are so great, but, to be fair, hon. Members, should acknowledge that significant real-terms extra investment is going into the NHS at every level and in every community in the country. The Government have decided that it is right to make that investment to make sure that we can get not just drugs, but services and facilities for patients, wherever they may be.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/20">I am pleased to say that, in Poole, the PCT is able fully to implement the NICE guidance on the three Alzheimer's drugs that have already been approved. People can get referrals to the psychiatrist for older people, and are then able to access the drugs, despite the fact that there is immense pressure on Poole's budgets. I am also informed that the PCT has done an excellent job of managing its prescribing, and it provides some very good services.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/21">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the importance that his constituents attach to proper medicines management, and he said that there needs to be good, tight control on which medicines are taken. Obviously, that is an important subject for the Government, both in terms of being cost effective and ensuring that drugs are not wasted, and in terms of ensuring that patients take their drugs properly. One of the biggest reasons for admission to hospital is people not taking their medicines properly and having severe interactions between medicines. That causes extra cost and distress.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/22">I am pleased to say that, in Poole, 82 per cent. of GP practices have implemented annual reviews of medication for people aged 75 and over. GPs sit down with patients, go through all their medicines and see whether the prescription is up to date and which drugs are no longer needed. They actively manage the medicines that people are taking. That is happening throughout the country. Bournemouth PCT now has a multidisciplinary group that covers medicine management. High priority has been given by PCTs to ensuring that medicines are managed extremely carefully so that money is not wasted and patients get appropriate care.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/23">I understand that recent research suggests that we are getting much closer to finding the cause of Alzheimer's disease, and to working out methods of early diagnosis and of preventing its development. It is an exciting time for people working in the field. Although the drugs that are available provide only temporary respite, the future looks brighter than it did a few years ago. The theme of the Alzheimer's Society awareness week this year will be new treatments in the future.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/24">I wish the society and researchers in the field well in their work. I hope that, over the next 10 years, they will be able to produce more new drugs significantly to improve the quality of life of people with dementia. The new drugs approved by NICE have had a significant effect on the quality of some people's lives and those of their carers. We do not devalue or denigrate that important work. However, when we authorise the use of drugs nationally, we must ensure that we make the right decisions based on proper evidence put forward by NICE and that those decisions can be followed up in every part of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/25">I was interested to hear that the hon. Gentleman's constituent thinks that Reminyl is more effective than the two drugs approved by NICE. I will make further inquiries, because I was not personally aware of that information. There may be other research projects going on to examine the most cost-effective use of the drugs already approved.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/26">It is fair to say that improvements have been made to the care of people with Alzheimer's in the immediate vicinity of the hon. Gentleman's constituency&mdash;in the availability of medicines and the health and social care supported by the local council. Those improvements are mirrored in many different communities throughout the country. It may be accurate to say that Alzheimer's was a neglected disease, but as people are living longer, the problem will increasingly become all too apparent to hundreds of thousands of families who may have to live for a long time with Alzheimer's sufferers. Research, good drugs, good support and care for carers will therefore be extremely important.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/27">I am pleased to say that the carer's grant, which was introduced in 1999, was extended in July 2002 for a further three years until 2005&ndash;06. During that time, it will more than double to &pound;185 million to provide extended care and 130,000 further breaks to carers. That is a significant step towards recognising the work of carers in looking after members of their family and friends who unfortunately suffer from Alzheimer's. We have also implemented the invalid care allowance, which will be renamed the carer's allowance, to ensure that people have some independence and some financial recompense for their caring work. That will ensure also that there is an individual assessment of the carers' needs, as well as those of the people being looked after.</p>
	<p pid=".58.0/28">The framework shows sufferers from the disease and their families that the Government take this work extremely seriously and that we will continue to assess and evaluate each new drug and development. We are also interested in making sure that people have access to the highest quality care on the most equitable basis possible throughout the country. I thank the hon. Gentleman for raising this issue today. I know about the work of his constituent, who has done an extremely good job in caring for his wife in these circumstances. I undertake to ensure that this issue is kept at the forefront of the Government's thinking and that it remains a priority for us.</p>

	Severn Barrage
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.63.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1347" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="63"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h05.htm#30204h05_spnew0">
	<p pid=".63.1/1">I am grateful for this opportunity to initiate a debate on the vital topic of renewable energy in the United Kingdom, in particular on the potential of the Severn barrage. I want to thank the World Wildlife Fund and the Severn tidal energy group for submitting their thoughts, which have informed my views from different perspectives.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/2">The Severn barrage is a mythical creature, seemingly lost in the mists of time&mdash;or lost in the mists of the Severn estuary on a dank winter day. It is now a legendary apparition, somewhat akin to the Loch Ness monster, occasionally sighted rearing its curious form along the banks of the Gwent levels. Does it really exist? Is it just a fable from children's tales or&mdash;if one takes a different view&mdash;a nightmarish vision designed to send children quivering in fright to bed along the shores of Severnside? On the contrary, it is real&mdash;or, at least, it could be. In fact, it is like something in a fairy tale&mdash;a Peter Pan. If enough people believe in it&mdash;in particular, those strange people known as Members of Parliament and Cabinet Ministers&mdash;the Severn barrage could live again. It could return from folklore and become a part of a living, breathing, modern Wales and United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/3">The first proposals for a Severn barrage were made in the 1840s, so it could be argued that if it has not happened by now, it never will. However, the first proposal for the channel tunnel was in 1802&mdash;so you never know.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/4">My background has given me a special interest in this subject. More than 10 years ago, I was a student at that excellent seat of learning that is Swansea Institute of Higher Education, a leading light in vocational and applied education in south Wales. That is sufficient praise to satisfy my lecturers and former colleagues. As part of my MSc in European leisure resource management, I assisted peripherally in research in a European project known as the Esturiales study with my former professor and close friend, Graham King. The study involved a detailed analysis of several major estuaries in Europe, including the Severn, in an attempt to put forward proposals for estuary zone management.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/5">The study was complementary to my MSc, rather than an integral part of it, and although I was extremely grateful for the opportunity to work closely on such an important project and to travel to some interesting places in Europe, I still remember saying to Graham&mdash;who was also my dissertation tutor&mdash;nine months into the 12 months of my course, &quot;Don't you think that it is now time to start on my dissertation?&quot; His response was non-committal, and we turned our minds back to more important matters, such as the European project that we were engaged upon.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/6">One of the prime aspects of EZM is conflict resolution in marine and coastal environments that recognises the special contribution that estuaries make to biodiversity. Although the Severn is not identical to the Tagus, for example, it is a splendid exemplar of the many conflicts that exist in such environments. There are shipping movements, leisure craft, special marine habitats, wetlands, sand dredging and commercial fishing, historic sites along the tidal reaches, and, not least, it is an attractive leisure venue for walkers and tourists. In short, like all great European estuaries, it is a marvel of nature.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/7">However, it is also a marvel of the influence of mankind and womankind. It is a living, working, thriving animal that has co-existed with, and been modified by, humankind since historical records began. Ports and jetties have altered the shape of the coast. Extraction&mdash;currently a controversial issue&mdash;has fed the economic development along its shores. Farmers have helped to shape the coastline. Roads have skimmed its surface on bridges that link the Celtic homeland with the land of its former inheritance across the water, and rail tunnels burrow beneath it.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/8">The English and Welsh communities that inhabit the coast of the Severn are separated by a vast pool, but in many ways they have shared a common past, living with and off the bounty and beauty of this powerful stretch of water. Like many intimate relationships, it has always been about power to some degree. We have ever been the submissive partner, recognising that the Severn is a mistress of immense power. It is the second largest tidal reach in the world after the Bay of Fundy&mdash;where, by the way, tidal power is operational. We are, in effect, a houseguest, and we take what we are given and are grateful. The issue now is whether the long-term houseguest reasserts its rights and takes a greater share of what is on offer. If so, can the two live happily ever after? That is the great conundrum of sustainable development. The puzzle is never more illuminating than in discussions on the Severn barrage, which while offering huge potential benefits, has a direct impact on three sites of special scientific interest, a special protection area under the European birds directive, a Ramsar site and a proposed special area of conservation. Therefore, proposals for the barrage should not be taken lightly.</p>
	<p pid=".63.1/9">In 1989, the Severn barrage project general report derived from the tripartite studies examined the feasibility and impact of an ebb-tide electricity generating barrage stretching from Brean down near Weston-super-Mare to Lavernock point near Cardiff. It rapidly ran into confrontation, especially over costs and environmental concerns.</p>

	<p pid=".64.0/1">My hon. Friend's speech deserves support for its literary merit alone. Powerful environmental groups that could generally be described as friends of the mud spoke out against the ambitious Severn barrage. They made a strong case and stopped it. Does my hon. Friend consider that the best practical way forward would be the more modest proposals of islands that would use both the power of the tide and that of the wind to generate electricity, but in a way that would not be environmentally disruptive?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2003-02-04.64.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1347" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="64"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030204/halltext/30204h05.htm#30204h05_spnew2">
	<p pid=".64.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an intelligent point. I do not believe that either proposal should preclude the other at this stage. My sole purpose in having the debate is to ensure that all options are discussed. I agree that technology and the principle that small is beautiful have moved on substantially, but that should not make us too cautious about large-scale projects. Environmental concerns, as he rightly pointed out, are more significant in such estuaries than in other areas. If we fail to discuss adequately a major proposal such as the Severn barrage, with all its pros and cons, we are probably doing a disservice.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/2">After a brief sighting of the mythical barrage creature in 1989, it disappeared under the waves. It is a shy creature, so why is it back? Why has it been sighted once more off the shores of Barry and Weston-super-Mare? I shall explain. The conditions have changed markedly to make the barrage at least worth discussing. I shall highlight the significant factors that make it necessary to discuss this issue, and I shall explain why it must feature in the forthcoming energy White Paper and why it must receive a considered and balanced hearing. The changes are outlined in the recent report that was commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry, so it must believe that they are worth examining, and will be carried out by the Severn tidal power group.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/3">The three main factors of the report are the reductions in the cost of capital through such mechanisms as project finance, the expanding post-Kyoto market in renewables and greenhouse gas emission savings, and the possible role of the barrage in alleviating the forecast challenges of habitat erosion through global warming. I shall first deal with financial viability. A project of such scale can either cause sleepless nights or break ministerial careers. If 2001 prices were applied to the 1989 energy report, the staggering cost would be &pound;10.3 billion to &pound;14 billion. However, the reduced cost of capital of up to 40 per cent., the restructuring of capital funding for major projects, including public private partnerships, project finance, bond issues and reductions in construction and design costs since 1989 all combine to make the project more financially manageable in terms of capital costs.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/4">Billions of pounds can be psychologically damaging to Ministers and Back Benchers who can feel like rabbits caught in the headlights of an oncoming juggernaut. Surely the money could be spent better elsewhere. However, there is potential under a PPP and project finance approach to give the financial risk to the private sector, with a probable 25-year project cost payback against the backdrop of the Government's assurances on premiums for the energy created during that period. Depending on the financial restructuring, the barrage could be returned to Government at the end of 25-year payback to produce an estimated further 95 years of renewable energy with the minimum of maintenance.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/5">We should consider the forecast costs of the 2012 Olympic games, which official estimates put at more than &pound;2 billion and others at more than &pound;4 billion. No matter how fast the Olympic athletes run or how high they jump, they will not produce 6 per cent. of the electricity needs of England and Wales. The final cost of the channel tunnel was estimated at between &pound;12 billion and &pound;13 billion, but the chunnel does not offer electricity or protection against the effects of global warming, such as flooding and sea-level rises. We should also bear in mind the fact that the lifespan of the electrical dynamo is 120 years of low-maintenance, free energy, so balancing the admittedly huge initial capital cost against a 120-year cycle makes the project not quite so daunting.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/6">Tidal power by barrage has been used with success for 35 years at the 240 MW La Rance range at St. Malo. The Severn barrage could produce an estimated 8.6 GW of electricity, which is 36 times that of St. Malo or, in simple terms, 6 per cent. of the total electricity needs of England and Wales. It is not difficult to see what the 6 per cent. would do for the Government's ambitious targets on renewables, and it would move us away from reliance on carbon-based fuels. Whereas the original EP57 study suggested a capacity of 1.1 GW, the new, more ambitious figure reflects a more efficient use of the tidal energy and augments the overall viability of the project.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/7">The financial considerations are further supported by the fact that the project could be part of new Government thinking on project funding. However, such a project, with an estimated payback of 25 years, would attract private sector backing only if Government offered some surety of the premium for the electricity. Understandably, the private sector wants to reduce the risk in exchange for investing so massively. The cost of such a project is so vast as to be frightening, but the rewards&mdash;financial and otherwise&mdash;are so constant over the long term and the financial risks in proven technology so easily dealt with that the Government should not be scared. The project is not necessarily a monster; it could be, to coin the name of one of my children's favourite characters, a big, friendly giant.</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/8">I emphasise the conditional&mdash;the &quot;could&quot;. The WWF has kindly noted:</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/9" class="indent">&quot;While a Severn Barrage presents an exciting project for engineers and politicians that could provide a major contribution to our renewables in future, it would be a large, costly and permanent construction that would alter the environment of the whole area with major ramifications for the ecology and behaviour of the estuary as a natural system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".64.1/10">Like those who live along the Severn, it has genuine concerns that prevent support for the Severn barrage at present. Those concerns include restrictions on fish movements, the impact on designated wetlands and mudflats, and the impact on coastal birds, sand movements and beaches. There are also questions about the barrage's impact on shipping, especially any future demands by Bristol for larger shipping and dredging.</p>

	<p pid=".66.0/1">Does my hon. Friend share the perception that whenever schemes that have an ecological impact are proposed, people focus on the negative ecological impact and rarely examine the potential positives? I examined the project at university and noted that it would increase the amount of biodiversity in the land beyond the estuary, so it would have a net benefit on biological creatures living in that area.</p>

	<p pid=".66.1/1">My hon. Friend is correct. Although I do not intend to go far down that line of argument, the full cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact assessment of such a large project should take into account not only the possible negatives, but the possible positive externalities on the environment. Creating a stable water platform behind the barrage, with the increase in biodiversity that has been suggested, is a benefit and needs to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/2">These and other concerns must be investigated further. However, they will not be explored unless the barrage features in the energy White Paper. This is a case in which a few printed words can open a debate or stifle it before it has begun.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/3">The other potential benefits include the significance of areas of change in the post-Kyoto targets on renewables, which now create a viable market for renewables and for savings through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. The barrage could reduce emissions by up to 18 million tonnes a year or 3 per cent. of the United Kingdom's carbon-based emissions. The Government's own forecast suggests that the UK could be a net importer of gas by 2006, and could source up to 90 per cent. of our gas demand beyond our shores by 2020. In strategic terms, it is clearly in the UK's interests to explore methods of reducing exposure to non-UK sources and, as we all intend, of reducing our reliance on nuclear energy.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/4">DEFRA reports that the annual cost of flood damage in the Severnside region is &pound;120 million a year. That is estimated to rise to an incredible &pound;4 billion by 2075. If a barrage can mitigate those costs by managing the extremes of tide and flood, that should be included in the debate. In the absence of a barrage, the existing shoreline plan anticipates that the rate of coastal erosion through climate change will increase and lead to the loss of the habitat that we discussed earlier, but&mdash;it is a big but&mdash;much of the prevailing thinking on the marine energy contribution to sustainable development focuses on the smaller scale, such as tidal pools, small-scale barrages and wave energy.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/5">There is something of the Schumaker &quot;small is beautiful&quot; argument here. However, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/891" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> mentioned, there is a corresponding danger of piecemeal development and an incremental creep towards targets that are never reached and that recede into the distance. If we are firm in our intentions on renewable energy, all options, large and small, should figure in the discussion. That is not so much blue-sky thinking as blue-water thinking. Let us not rule out any options.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/6">Why should I be interested in the subject as a representative of Ogmore? That is not Ogmore-by-Sea, by the way&mdash;that delightful coastal village&mdash;but Ogmore, the thoroughly land-locked constituency. The potential benefits that I outlined could be good not only for the people along the Severn, but for the people of Wales, the rest of the UK and all the nations whose signatures embellish the Kyoto treaty, as well as those that regrettably do not.</p>
	<p pid=".66.1/7">These arguments make further examination worthwhile. If the barrage is viable, we should be courageous in our support. If it is not, we should rule it out and focus our energies elsewhere. It is time to see whether the mythic Severn barrage, like the channel tunnel, can be made real, or whether it should be consigned to folklore for evermore.</p>

	<p pid=".67.0/1">I shall be brief, as we want to hear the Minister's response.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1347" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> made an important, elegant and eloquent speech. As he said, the subject has been discussed for a very long time&mdash;longer, even, than the discussion on the reform of the House of Lords. We know that we need security of energy supply and a reduction in our CO2 emissions. Unless a new generation of nuclear power stations is to be built, which we do not want, we also know that we must find environmentally sustainable sources of new energy.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/3">Nuclear power will make a smaller contribution to our overall energy supply. It will, as my hon. Friend noted, be risky to depend increasingly on imported gas, and we should not look the tidal gift horse in the mouth. There is an enormous potential source of energy for the harnessing. Of course the wider environmental impact must be considered very carefully. As my hon. Friends noted, there are pluses as well as minuses to the environmental impact. The matter is complex, but we must consider it.</p>
	<p pid=".67.0/4">There will clearly be problems in financing such a vast project. However, we famously have the lowest long-term interest rates in a very long time and have gained the experience of public-private partnerships, so we can finance projects such as this if we decide that it is the right thing to do and if we have the will to do it. I join my hon. Friend the Member for Ogmore in hoping that the energy White Paper will include a commitment thoroughly to study the feasibility of the Severn barrage and the arguments for and against it. My hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West will agree that those living on the shores of the Severn are not frightened of open-minded and intelligent analysis of the project. Responsibility will straddle the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly, just as the barrage will straddle the Bristol channel. That provides an additional challenge, but there is no reason why the work should not be undertaken.</p>

	<p pid=".68.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1347" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has long taken a keen interest in renewable energy and, in particular, the proposals for the Severn tidal barrage. I had planned to say more about renewable energy, but time prevents me from doing much on that front. Members will be aware that the Minister for Energy and Construction cannot be here, so, as Wales Office Minister with responsibility for green issues, I am responding on the Government's behalf.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/2">The UK has spent considerable sums&mdash;&pound;20 million in all, of which the Government provided &pound;12 million&mdash;in evaluating the potential of generating electricity from tidal barrages. The scheme, part of the new and renewable energy programme, ran from 1978 to 1994. Tidal barrages use well-established technology. Several locations around the world have been studied, but relatively few projects have been constructed. The first and largest, with a capacity of 240 MW, is on an estuary near St. Malo. When I paid a visit, I was greatly impressed by what I saw.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/3">The UK programme included a detailed study of the Severn and the Mersey barrages, as well as less detailed studies of the Wyre, the Duddon, the Conwy and the Loughor. As assessment of the overall UK potential was also undertaken, together with an underpinning programme of generic studies, largely addressing environmental issues.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/4">In July 1993, the Conservative Government announced the programme's closure. Energy Paper 62, a Government evaluation of the prospects for renewable energy published in 1994, estimated the total accessible resource at about 50 TWh per year&mdash;about 12 per cent. of our current electricity supply. Ninety per cent. came from eight larger sites and the rest was distributed across about 30 smaller sites around the country. Of the total, less than 40 per cent.&mdash;19 TWh a year&mdash;was available at less than 10p per kWh at 1992 prices, using an 8 per cent. discount. At the time, it was not seen as attractive as other options. Potential non-energy benefits were seen as relatively small, as was the potential for reducing costs.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/5">The Severn was the largest potential project studied and the total cost of the Severn evaluation programme was &pound;8 million, of which the Government provided &pound;4.8 million. With a capacity of nearly 9,000 MW and an output of 17 TWh per year&mdash;more than 4 per cent. of total current UK supply&mdash;the Severn barrage would be one of the largest civil engineering projects in the world and by far the largest renewable energy generation scheme in the UK. It would mean building a 10-mile barrage between the Severn estuary and the Bristol channel, just downstream of a line between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare, enclosing about 140 miles of coastline.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/6">At 1994 prices, the cost of generation was estimated at 7.5p per kWh at an 8 per cent. discount rate, rising to 17p per kWh at a 15 per cent. discount rate, excluding grid reinforcement costs. As with all such capital-intensive schemes, generation costs are highly sensitive to the discount rate.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/7">In July 2001, the Government commissioned the Severn tidal power group, an industry grouping that co-sponsored the earlier programme, to undertake a short study of the project to establish whether developments since 1994 justified a more substantial review of the project and to define what issues such a review would need to cover. The report was published last month, making it clear that significant changes have occurred that would affect the scheme, though not all point in the same direction.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/8">Since 1989, the cost of power generation has gone down and the completion of the second Severn crossing has reduced the potential benefits of a road crossing over the barrage, while existing and planned increases in the size of shipping using the Bristol channel and the Severn estuary could have a significant impact on the scheme, throwing into doubt the size of the shipping locks in the earlier design. Any restrictions on the port of Bristol would have severe commercial consequences. We have also, of course, become much more aware of environmental issues, as other Members mentioned earlier.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/9">There is no doubt that, with the loss of approximately 65 per cent. of the inter-tidal area, a barrage would have a major effect on the ecosystems of the Severn estuary. Constructing the barrage would result in the loss of the unique tidal nature of the estuary and cause major problems for migratory fish such as salmon. The Environment Agency believes that substantial environmental loss to conservation and biodiversity would be likely.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/10">However, the study group pointed to the likelihood of increasing flood damage in the Severn estuary due to global warming, and therefore pointed out the possible additional benefits of the barrage in protecting the Severn valley. I should note, however, that although the barrage would afford protection against tidal surges, the Environment Agency believes that that would be a very expensive way to provide flood protection.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/11">The study estimates that the cost of the scheme would be between &pound;10 billion and &pound;14 billion at 2001 prices. Pre-construction activities, including a &pound;30 million environmental assessment, might cost &pound;300 million over five years, and construction would take a further five to seven years until barrage closure, with full power generation about two years after that. Those are significant sums by any stretch of the imagination. However, peak employment during construction might reach 30,000 to 40,000 people, about half of whom would come from the Severn side.</p>
	<p pid=".68.0/12">The report suggests that the project might be financed by the private sector through the bond market over 40 years or more at a cost equivalent of about 6p per kWh. That would, however, be about twice the amount of UK sterling project bonds issued to date, and it would require a high degree of security in terms of the future income stream from the project. The study group suggested that that could be achieved by a public-private partnership contract let by the Government or by underpinning obligations for the purchase of the output. In effect, the private sector would underwrite the construction risk, but the Government would underwrite the future income stream needed to secure the project's financing.</p>

	<p pid=".70.0/1">I am sorry to intervene in such a time-limited debate. Will the Minister acknowledge also that the nature of the project is such&mdash;it involves proven technology&mdash;that there is less long-term risk? It would not be like other PPPs or large schemes such as the channel tunnel, because it does not have that element of risk.</p>

	<p pid=".70.1/1">That would depend on when the project started, were it to go ahead, and on design costs and the market. If there were to be a public-private partnership, we would have to make a commercial judgment on that matter. It is clear, therefore, that the project would not proceed on a fully commercial basis in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid=".70.1/2">On the basis of the study, the group concludes that a more substantial reappraisal of the project would be needed. The Government have not yet reached such a conclusion, but plan to set out their policy towards large-scale tidal barrage developments in the forthcoming White Paper, which will be music to the ears of my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid=".70.1/3">The further studies recommended by the report would cost about &pound;3 million, although, as has been made clear, much larger sums would be needed for a complete environmental appraisal. We are considering whether that would represent good value for money. Clearly, I cannot pre-empt the publication of the White Paper, but in reaching our conclusion we will take full account of the report and of the views expressed in the debate.</p>
	<p pid=".70.1/4">I conclude by emphasising the Government's commitment to renewable energy. We have set ambitious targets, and believe that this is an exciting time for renewables. The Government are determined to push forward on that agenda. Our task in meeting the demanding targets that we have set requires the vision to carry forward our objectives and to turn that potential into reality. There are many barriers in our path, but the rewards are immense&mdash;reliable sources of clean energy, a reduction in carbon emissions and a developing renewables industry will be crucial to our country's future. We all need to work together to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid=".70.1/5">I commend my hon. Friend for securing the debate, and I am grateful to him and to other Members for their contribution. I am sorry that there was not sufficient time to give a fuller reply. We must await the White Paper's publication to see whether it sheds any light on my hon. Friend's ambitions for the Severn barrage.</p>
