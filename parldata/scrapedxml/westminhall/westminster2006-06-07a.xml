<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.77.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0138.htm#06060755000409">
	<p pid="a.77.4/1">I appreciate that contribution. It is fair to say that the Gurkha veterans have been dignified in the extreme in their campaign. It is a tribute to them that they have been able to maintain that attitude. I hope that their courage and due diligence will pay dividends.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/2">A review of the general issues has been carried out, and its publication by the Ministry of Defence is eagerly anticipated. Perhaps today's debate is pushing at an unlocked door, but how far will the Government open it? Shortly after coming into office, the Labour Government rightly took action towards putting serving Gurkha soldiers on an equal footing with the rest of the British Army, which is to be both welcomed and applauded. However, I seek the Minister's assurance that the 3,000 Gurkhas currently serving in the British Army have equal terms and conditions of service, in all respects, to their British counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/3">Today's debate relates to veterans who retired before July 1997. It will no doubt be claimed that it is not possible to make amends for the unfair way in which serving Gurkhas were treated by successive Governments prior to then, but I trust that no one will defend the continued unfairness that Gurkha veterans who retired prior to that date have experienced over many decades. That shameful legacy tarnishes British military history and must be ended without further delay. Those veterans were short-changed when they served in the British Army, and they and their families must not be short-changed in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/4">I declare a personal interest. I once served with the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles. Admittedly it was while I was on the armed forces parliamentary scheme, and it was for only four days, but those days on a live exercise in difficult terrain in Kenya are ones that I shall never forget, and I have the T-shirt to prove it.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/5">Two weeks ago I had the honour of welcoming about 50 members of the Nepal-based United British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen's Association to the House of Commons, after which I accompanied them to the Gurkha memorial off Whitehall where wreaths and tribute ribbons were laid, and the last post and reveille were played. We then went to Downing street, where a detailed appeal was handed in calling on the Government to put right the many years of wrong, and to treat Gurkha veterans in the same way as others who have served in Her Majesty's and, in some cases, His Majesty's armed forces. The oldest veteran there had served in Burma in the second world war. Another was the holder of the Victoria cross from a conflict 40 years ago. That medal was one of13 Victoria crosses to be awarded to Gurkhas among more than 6,500 decorations for bravery.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/6">Gurkhas have frequently been portrayed as the bravest of the brave. They are renowned for their valour on the battlefields and for being exceptional soldiers who are loyal to those they serve. Their tenacity, strength, fearlessness, courage and ferocity are without equal. To Britain's shame, however, there is a parallel history of discrimination in the 190 years in which successive generations of Gurkha soldiers have served the Crown.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/7">The United British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen's Association, which was formed in Nepal in 2003, is an umbrella group of six different Gurkha ex-servicemen's associations in Nepal. It is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the welfare of Gurkha veterans and to highlighting the problems faced by them and their families. That unifying organisation has been lobbying both the British and Nepalese Governments for equal rights for Gurkhas in relation to pay, pension and other facilities. The association's background briefing tells me:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/8" class="indent">&quot;That the Ministry of Defence has discriminated against the ex-Gurkhas is a fact, which needs no further elaboration. There is no need to further justify this grave injustice perpetrated 'to a friend by a friend'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/9">The briefing goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/10" class="indent">&quot;The Gurkhas have fought with utmost bravery and loyalty for the British Crown and its citizens for the last 200 years. They have made enormous contributions towards the British colonial expansion and have safeguarded the British Empire across the Globe. They fought in both World Wars. They have continued to serve British interests in subsequent conflicts. They have proved to be the most trusted and loyal friends of the British in the most difficult of times...As a reward the Gurkhas are left destitute today. They live a life of misery and shame back home. They are forced to sell their medals of bravery to make their ends meet and many have been forced to beg on the streets of their own villages.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/11">How can we ignore such a situation? Something must be done. I trust that the Minister will say that urgent action will be taken to answer this cry for help. We should collectively hang our heads in shame.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/12">The Minister might suggest that the tripartite agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom, India and Nepal, which was signed in 1947, or thereabouts, prevents Britain from improving the lot of Gurkha veterans, but I am advised that the Indian Government have written to the association refuting that, and saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/13" class="indent">&quot;This is an issue between the UK and Nepal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/14">The pension is arguably the most important and contentious issue, and needs to be resolved immediately. Pensions paid to Gurkha veterans need to be brought into line with those paid to British veterans&mdash;proportionate to years of service. The same should be done for the pensions paid to widows of Gurkha veterans. There is no social welfare policy in Nepal, and the widows of Gurkha veterans often suffer extreme financial difficulties. Gurkhas who were discharged without any pension should be considered for a preserved pension, like British soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/15">The medical expenses of retired Gurkhas should be borne by the Ministry of Defence in full. The current system, in which the Gurkha Welfare Trust coughs up funds for veterans' medical expenses, is totally unacceptable. The GWT is a charitable trust and the moneys in it were raised by the Gurkhas themselves or were donated. Rather than allow the current situation to continue, the MOD should bear the full costs of ex-servicemen's medical treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/16">Compensation is another important issue which needs to be addressed. I have been given details of the discrimination in relation to the pay and conditions of Gurkha soldiers while serving in the British Army. I invite the Minister to respond positively to the following point put strongly to me on behalf of the veterans:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/17" class="indent">&quot;It is only logical that the post-1947 Gurkhas are awarded compensation for the loss in pay and allowances during their entire service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/18">Another issue of great importance that, because of time, I shall address briefly is that of discrimination against Gurkha veterans who left the British Army before July 1997 regarding the granting of indefinite leave to remain in the UK. The Minister need not necessarily respond today; he could do so in writing later. I am advised that veterans who retire after that date are granted leave, and I agree with the association that</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/19" class="indent">&quot;It is morally and legally important that the British Government allow all Gurkha Ex-Servicemen and their families, regardless of when they retired, to enter, work and live in the UK with dignity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/20">Does the Minister agree? If not, why not?</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/21">Another issue that needs to be resolved is the citizenship status of children born to mothers who accompany their Gurkha soldier husbands who serve in the British Army, whether in the UK or overseas. Why cannot they have British citizenship?</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/22">In conclusion, I shall quote from the heartfelt appeal made last month by the association when it sent a special delegation from Nepal to London:</p>
	<p pid="a.77.4/23" class="indent">&quot;As Gurkhas, we feel that the current Review is a wonderful opportunity to address and solve all the aforementioned problems affecting the retired Gurkhas in a just and fair manner, with all sincerity for once and all, acceptable to both the Gurkhas and British Government, thus ensuring that the state of dissent and conflict that now exists between them is resolved forever. It would also ensure that the Ministry of Defence position would be beyond reproach, both legally and morally. Additionally, we feel this will enhance, even more, the warm and friendly relation between the two countries.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.82.0/1">I, too, offer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> who has set out his case in his usual passionate, humorous, colourful and casual manner. He is a great asset to the Liberal Democrat Benches and I am sure that all hon. Members agree that he has made a great contribution to today's debate. I am sure that the Gurkhas are delighted to have him on their side.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/2">Fairness and justice; recognition; dignified; equality; destitution; short-changed; begging and discrimination. These are words that have been used in the Chamber this morning and I think that they sum up the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/3">As we have heard, the Gurkhas have served the Crown since 1815. In 1947, the tripartite agreement set out their terms and conditions of service. While their numbers have decreased over the years, the Gurkhas still play an important role, having been deployedin Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Afghanistan and many other conflicts throughout the world. In nine years, the Gurkhas will have served this country for two centuries&mdash;200 years of dedication, protecting a country that is neither their birthplace nor their nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/4">One of the key principles of the tripartite agreement was that soldiers in both armies should serve under broadly the same terms and conditions of service. That is an important principle and was an enlightened one at the time. I repeat that soldiers in both armies should serve under broadly the same terms and conditions of service; that is a principle to which I shall return, because it is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/5">I like to give credit where credit it is due, and the Government deserve some credit on this issue. Since they came to power, there have been three important developments, which are rooted in the principles of the tripartite agreement. First, in 2000, the increase in death gratuity to rates comparable with those for British soldiers was a welcome step. Secondly, the introduction in 1997 of married accompanied service for Gurkhas serving in the UK is worthy of praise. Two months ago, all married Gurkhas with three years' service became entitled to married accompanied service. They are also entitled to accommodation for their families, which is charged at the same level as for British servicemen.</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/6">Finally, until recently, Gurkhas could not get indefinite leave to remain in the UK when they were discharged from service. In 2004, the then Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1630" name="Paul Keetch">my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Citizenship should not be something that former Gurkhas should have to apply for. It should be given as a right.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.82.0/8">That plea was backed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1984" name="Menzies Campbell">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for North-East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase>, the leader of my party. Shortly after, our call to allow Gurkhas to have British citizenship was finally granted by the Government, albeit upon completion of four years' service and only on application. However, those new rules apply only to those discharged on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>&mdash;the date on which the Brigade of Gurkhas moved its headquarters from Hong Kong back to the UK following the handover to China. It was a step in the right direction, but the situation today is unacceptable and is still discriminatory.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.84.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" speakername="Mark Harper" colnum="84"  time="010:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0138.htm#06060755000417">
	<p pid="a.84.1/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the way in which he presented his case. Noting the ever-decreasing length of hon. Members' service with the Brigade of Gurkhas, with the hon. Gentleman having undertaken f<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">our days and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> two, I have to say that having been in my post for only a short period, I have yet to do any.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/2">I should like to pick up on a point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made about the dignified way in which the Gurkhas have presented their case. He questioned whether it has been to their detriment compared with those who present their case loudly. Speaking for myself and for other hon. Members, I respect those who make a well argued and logical case, and I tend to pay more attention to people who make their case in that way than to those who shout from the rooftops, and I hope that the Gurkhas, who have campaigned in the former way, have not disadvantaged themselves. As far as my party and I are concerned, they have not, and I urge all who campaign for change in policy to do so in that way, so that we can engage in a logical and sensible debate, rather than yell at each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/3">I, too, pay tribute to the service that the Gurkhas have provided to the Crown since 1815 and in the British Army since 1947. The British public understand and respect that service. That is why the Gurkhas are held in high esteem, and one of the reasons why the subject has been raised in the House on numerous occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/4">When thinking about the history of this issue, it is worth thinking also about the way in which we approach it and from which end of the telescope we look at it. If we consider it in the context of today's circumstances and conditions, we can understand why people use such terms as &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;injustice&quot;. However, if one considers how the current arrangements were arrived at, when the British Army took in some Gurkha regiments, the Indian army took in others and the tripartite agreement was signed in 1947 in a different world and in different conditions, one can see why the arrangements were made in the way that they were.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/5">The Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase>, drew attention to the tripartite agreement and the fact that it set down that Gurkhas serving in the British Army should serve under broadly comparable terms and conditions to those under which Gurkhas serve in the Indian army. It is one of the principles that was established at the beginning. The tripartite agreement has not been revised since 1947, although it is true that when British Governments have made changes, they have made them in accordance with the its original principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/6">It is worth welcoming the several changes that the present Government have made since they came to power in 1997, but it might be sensible also to recognise that piecemeal change might not be the way forward. That is why in January 2005 we welcomed the then Secretary of State's announcement of a comprehensive review of Gurkhas' terms and conditions of service. That is probably a better approach than making changes incrementally and without thinking through the whole package. We welcome a comprehensive review. It is disappointing that it has taken a good deal of time, but I know that the Minister will say more about it today. I understand that he hopes to complete the review and make an announcement later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/7">Frustrating though the delay might be, having considered other issues during my time in my present post, I have concluded that it is greatly to be preferred to take the time to get the review right and investigate all complexities at this stage, so that when the Minister comes to the Dispatch Box later this year to announce the results of the terms and conditions review, it is comprehensive, well thought through and results in a change that endures. It should not be rushed, so that we end up returning to the matter every year to put right issues that were not thought through properly. One has to spend only a brief period considering the issues and the complexities that might arise to understand that. I welcome the review, and I am glad that the Minister is taking the time to undertake it properly.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.3/1">The Minister says that he does not know either.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.3/2">When the Minister comes to the House later this year with the results of the review, we will consider the review in detail, and if we consider it wise to give it our full support, we will. With the work not having been done yet and without having seen the review, however, I do not want to commit us in advance to whatever it may propose.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.3/3">As part of the review, it would be wise to ensure that we discuss with the Government of Nepal the review's implications and any impact that it may have on the situation in Nepal. It would be useful if the Minister could confirm whether that will happen. I am conscious that we must consider the impact of our changes on those areas of Nepal from which Gurkhas have been traditionally been recruited. In making changes in Britain, we must ensure that there are no unfortunate effects in Nepal. Despite what hon. Members have said about the terms and conditions of service under which Gurkhas serve, and notwithstanding the questions that the hon. Gentleman has raised, if we consider the number of Nepalese who apply to join the Brigade of Gurkhas, which is about 100 for each available place, it seems that in their assessment, serving the Crown and serving in the British Army is attractive and rewarding. We should take the review forward in consultation with the Government of Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.3/4">Without wishing to broaden the review, I ask that when the Minister is undertaking it, he considers this final point. There are more than 7,000 other foreign nationals serving in the British Army, and it may be worth him considering whether any changes need to be made in relation to them. The last thing that we want to do is change the terms and conditions of service for the Brigade of Gurkhas, and then find that a significant number of other issues arise.</p>

	<p pid="a.86.4/1">The figure that the hon. Gentleman gave for the number of foreign nationals serving in the British Army is, I think, somewhat greater thanthe figure in reality. However, the big difference is that the Gurkhas serve in their own units and regiments, whereas other foreign nationals who join Her Majesty's armed forces serve in British Army regiments, battalions and other units. In terms of pay and conditions and, as far as I am concerned, all other respects, they are immediately treated as though they were British. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the significance is that the Gurkhas serve not in British Army units but in their own regiments?</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I have the latest figures, and there are just over 7,000 foreign nationals serving in the armed forces, most of them in the British Army. I am simply saying that if the comprehensive review considers indefinite leave to remain and the appropriate qualification for British citizenship and the Minister makes decisions on Gurkhas in those areas, another set of questions will be raised about what expectations those serving in the British Army should have in relation to indefinite leave to remain and becoming a British citizen. It would be sensible to think about that while resolving one set of issues, so that we do not create another set of issues and end up coming back to this place to debate them. I am conscious that if we do not think about the overall position, we could make changes that, although welcome in themselves, create a whole set of other perceived unfairnesses. I urge the Minister to think about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">In drawing my remarks to a close, I reiterate my congratulations to the hon. Member for Colchester and to those who participated in the debate. I look forward to what the Minister has to say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.90.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1919" speakername="Tom Watson" colnum="90"  time="010:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0139.htm#06060755000428">
	<p pid="a.90.1/1">I think I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's question as I continue my speech. If I do not, he can pull me up on it again.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/2">The Nepalese Government were, and remain, rightly sensitive to any suggestion that British Gurkhas were mercenaries, as has been said in other areas of this discussion. They saw exclusively Gurkha units serving in the British Army with their Nepalese identity preserved as reflecting on honour and prestige on the reputation of Nepal. Even now, Gurkhas usually serve as members of formed Gurkha battalions, squadrons or companies within the Brigade of Gurkhas, although there are notable exceptions. Although the working language of the Brigade is English, the structure enables the Nepali language to be spoken, and provides religious and cultural support to every Gurkha family.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/3">There have been improvements in the intervening years. For example, in 1972, Gurkhas serving in the UK received a cost of living allowance that, added to their Indian army rate of pay, gave them broadly comparable take-home pay to that of their British counterparts, and when they served in Hong Kong they were paid an allowance that reflected prices there. Over time there has been a constant review of and improvement to support and services for Gurkhas.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/4">However, the presumption has always been that Gurkhas would retire in Nepal, and their terms and conditions, particularly their pension arrangements, continued to reflect that understanding. When the time approached for the UK to hand over Hong Kong, through a gradual process, the Gurkhas were withdrawn from that country. The hon. Gentleman will know that that process ended on <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>, when what had hitherto been a force enlisted and based overseas was now predominantly based in the UK. It was only natural at that point that Gurkhas and their families would increasingly regard the UK as an alternative home to Nepal, and that their expectations and aspirations would develop accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/5">In my view, it was inevitable that the terms and conditions appropriate to a force based in the far east would have to adapt to that change in circumstances. In evolving these terms and conditions, we have always sought to protect the unique identity of the Gurkhas and their relationship with their homeland, which the hon. Member for Colchester has talked about, and the presumption of their retirement in Nepal has remained.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/6">Worldwide parity of take-home pay was brought in as part of a package of changes introduced in that great year of 1997. It included a new universal addition, which brought a Gurkha's take-home pay&mdash;wherever he was serving&mdash;up to the same level as that of his counterpart in the wider British Army. Gurkhas were allowed to be accompanied by their families in UK, as was already the case in overseas stations such as Brunei, although under the tripartite agreement, that was limited to 25 per cent. of all personnel. At the same time, Gurkhas retained some privileges not available to other members of the Army, such as the traditional &quot;Nepal long leave&quot; of five months every three years at the public expense.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/7">Some differences stemming from the original Indian army terms and conditions were retained because they were seen as more suitable for the Gurkha's unique status as a Nepalese citizen. The Gurkha soldier was virtually guaranteed 15 years of service, which earned him a pension for life immediately on discharge&mdash;often at the age of 32, 33 or 34&mdash;and after that for his dependants. The Gurkha pension scheme provided pensions that are modest by UK standards but represent a substantial income, annually updated for inflation, in Nepal. Such an early payment of pension is not available to other members of the British armed forces. Over 80 per cent. of ex-Gurkhas, if they had been members of the armed forces pension scheme, would have returned to Nepal with only a preserved pension payable at age 60.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/8">The Gurkha's expectation of service depends on his progress through the ranks. A corporal would have to retire after 15 years, whereas a warrant officer class 1 would serve for 22 years. The 22-year notice of engagement in use for all ranks in the wider Army is only manageable because in recent years British junior ranks have tended to leave voluntarily if not promoted, sometimes after four or five years. Traditionally, Gurkhas serve for as long as they can, and it would not have been possible to offer them all 22 years' service because that would have resulted in a stagnant, unmanageable manpower structure in the brigade's exclusively Gurkha units, and it would have denied to many Nepalese citizens any opportunity of British Army service.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/9">I believe our predecessors tried hard to get the balance right between the maintenance of traditional Nepal-facing terms and conditions and their assimilation, where appropriate, into those of the wider Army. However, since the move of the Gurkhas' base to the UK and the progressive alignment of their roles with those of their counterparts in the wider Army, the differences between their respective terms and conditions of service have increasingly come under scrutiny, as they have today. The Government have responded to that in order to ensure that fairness is at the heart of how we treat the modern Brigade of Gurkhas.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/10">Improved arrangements for Gurkha married accompanied service were announced in August. In 2003, seven Gurkha veterans had challenged many of the differences in their terms and conditions of service, particularly their different pension arrangements, by way of judicial review. The judges accepted that the differences were still justified because of the Gurkhas' unique status, and that a full like-with-like comparison with the wider Army could not be made. The courts dismissed all complaints and subsequent appeals, although they did, exceptionally, warn that the 25 per cent. limit on married accompanied service should be reviewed. We have done that, and from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April</phrase> this year, all Gurkhas with at least three years' service will have the same entitlement to be accompanied by their families at their duty station as soldiers in the wider Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.1/11">The immigration rules were changed in 2004 to make it easier for Gurkhas to return to this country on discharge from the Army. Successive Governments have maintained the policy that British citizenship is not automatically given in return for military service, but granted on grounds of residence, towards which such service might not count.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.1/1">I think I can. If I cannot, I will clarify that by letter. I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman an assurance on behalf of another Department, particularly the Home Office, dare I say.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/2">Both Gurkhas and Commonwealth citizens usually serve in our armed forces while maintaining their own nationality. Although the presumption of retirement in Nepal has been accepted by the courts as part of the unique arrangements for Gurkha service, ex-Gurkhas had always been able to apply to return to this country under normal immigration rules, such as under the work permit scheme. I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/3">In 2004, we accepted that from the time the Gurkhas became based in the UK in 1997 they should be able to apply for settlement here in the same way as Commonwealth citizens leaving our Armed Forces. On discharge, they could count four years of their military service towards the residential qualification for indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom and, subject to entry clearance, could settle here with their families. They could subsequently apply for British citizenship, if they wished to do so, under normal rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/4">The Prime Minister announced the new Her Majesty's forces immigration rule on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>. We understand that virtually all Gurkhas discharged since the rule took effect have applied for visas to enter the UK. Those discharged since <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> have until October of this year to apply. It became clear that more serving and retired Gurkhas and their families would be living in the UK than ever before and the Government determined that the remaining differences in their terms and conditions of service, especially the Nepal-facing ones, should be reviewed. That is what we are doing now.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> made a point about the remit of the review. I shall give a bit of the context. The former Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon)</phrase>, asked in January last year for a comprehensive review of Gurkha terms and conditions. It is by far the widest-reaching review since 1948 and is examining every remaining difference between Gurkha and UK terms and conditions. Much of what I have said, inasmuch as it refers to Gurkhas' current terms and conditions, may be affected by the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/6">We have consulted serving Gurkhas through surveys and focus groups, and we are in close touch at official level with the Nepalese Government. We have tried to be as inclusive as possible and have invited other interested parties, including groups representing Gurkha veterans, to express their views. The complexity of the review has proved even greater than we expected, and I welcome the support that we have had in ensuring that we have time to ensure that the review is comprehensive and wide-reaching. I hope to be able to report back to the House with the outcome of the review as soon as I can, and I take the matter very seriously. I want to be able to give good news to the House that will satisfy some of the aspirations that have been expressed today.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/7">Meanwhile, I am pleased to say that we have been able to introduce some improvements in advance of the review's final report. In addition to the immigration concession and improved facilities for married accompanied service, which were the two main concerns that were raised by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald, as everyone knows, the Gurkhas have been included in the national insurance scheme so that they can qualify for national insurance benefits, including the state retirement pension and the state second pension. From April this year, collective settlement of their income tax and national insurance contribution liability by the Ministry of Defence and the provision of free food and accommodation, offset by corresponding abatements of their universal addition, ceased, and Gurkhas will now see full details of their pay, tax and charges and be eligible for rebates of food and accommodation charges when appropriate in the same way as any soldier in the wider Army. Those improvements were widely welcomed by serving Gurkhas and the groups that represent them.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/8">I have to emphasise that the review is focused on the terms and conditions of service for serving and future Gurkhas.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.101.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" speakername="Gillian Merron" colnum="101"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0140.htm#06060755000438">
	<p pid="a.101.1/1">In its second local transport plan, East Riding of Yorkshire council has considered further dualling of the A1079 north of Hull to address the safety issues that arise, particularly when drivers are overtaking. It is exploring the prospects of dualling schemes for the highway between Killingwoldgraves roundabout and Dunswell and between Shiptonthorpe and Pocklington. My Department will consider those ideas if and when firm proposals are made and they receive regional support through the regional funding allocations process.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/2">Without a doubt, safety on the A1079 is a major concern. I am pleased to say that the Humberside safety camera partnership is installing six safety cameras on Market Weighton's Arras hill. A further seven cameras will be installed on Beverley bypass by the end of this month. Judging by the record of the Humberside safety camera partnership so far, that should, I would hope, halve the number of accidents and save the pain and misery suffered by many families each year.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/3">In view of the time, I shall now discuss the York to Beverley railway line. Before its closure, the line served a number of settlements, and in recent years there has been interest in reopening the line. The most recent local transport plan refers to the potential for reopening, bearing in mind the need for careful evaluation and the realities of funding constraints. I am aware of a study commissioned by the Countryside Agency and published in 2003, which examined the possibility of reopening disused railway lines in Yorkshire and the Humber. The study identified a number of potential benefits of reopening the line in question, but it also highlighted several major obstacles in the form of development across the track bed. It suggested that those might be dealt with through new alignments, but it also noted that at Stamford Bridge and Market Weighton, creating new alignments would be more difficult due to the level of development that has occurred. The study concluded that although the York to Beverley line should be considered for reopening in the longer term&mdash;10 years or more into the future&mdash;it should be protected from further development in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/4">As the hon. Gentleman said, a further study was undertaken by the consultants at Carl Bro for East Riding of Yorkshire council, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to consider it. As he also said, it reported that the operation would not be financially self-supporting from fare income and would require ongoing public subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/5">The decision to protect a section of railway is a matter for local planning authorities, in line with national, regional and local planning policies. I would expect such decisions to be based on discussion with relevant stakeholders, including Network Rail, and consideration of the costs involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/6">It is important to note that, although the railways are growing faster than ever and we have not closed our mind to the expansion of rail, the Government's investment priorities must be driven by an objective assessment of where the greatest benefit, economic and environmental, is to be delivered. Generally, that follows strong patterns of established demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/7">For that reason and because of the poor historical performance of a range of branch lines and experimental services, it would be unfair of me to suggest that consideration of the proposal outlined by the hon. Gentleman is likely to be a realistic priority for the Government in the immediate future. Of course, it is always open to local planning authorities to produce their own proposals on the basis of their own committed funding, but such a proposal must also be subject to rigorous scrutiny, starting with consideration of whether it offers the most effective transport option. The production of a business case involves a considerable investment of time and resources, and any authority would consider carefully its own priorities in the context of local, regional and national plans, just as central Government do.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/8">This year, the Government are spending &pound;110 million every week to improve the railways. That commitment to our rail network is helping to bring in further substantial investment from the private sector. In addition, there have been significant improvements in the railways in recent years, which have led a considerable increasein the number of rail passenger journeys. For example, in 2003-04, for the first time since 1961, more than1 billion rail journeys were made. Importantly, the Government recently announced &pound;370 million to deliver access improvements to stations across the network in line with the new provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/9">I confirm that we are working to improve transport connectivity in east Yorkshire as a whole. The local transport plan system has provided more certainty of funding for local authorities, so that they can tackle local issues. We are making progress on improving transport and we are committed to continuing to do so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.104.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="104"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0141.htm#06060755000440">
	<p pid="a.104.2/1">I thankMr. Speaker and your good self, Mr. Cook, my parliamentary neighbour, for giving me the opportunity to discuss the vital issue of the middle east peace process. This is a crucial time, and 2006 could well be seen as a key year in the peace process. Of course, every year could be seen as key, given the frustrating nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the wider middle east peace process. I could, for example, mention 1993, when the Oslo accords were signed, 2000, when the Camp David summit was held and the second intifada started, or 2003, when the international Quartet's road map was published, Prime Minister Sharon commented that Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories must end and the Israeli disengagement policy was unveiled. However, 2006 seems to be emerging as a landmark year in the peace process, with the removal of Sharon from active Israeli politics on <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-04">4 January</phrase>, the Palestinian elections, which brought Hamas into government, and the Israeli elections in March. I shall first discuss those two hugely significant elections&mdash;one in Israel and one in Palestine&mdash;and then, if possible, widen the scope of the debate to encompass the security barrier and the behaviour of Iran.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/2">The middle east peace process remains full of problems, paradoxes and controversies. Last week, I was privileged to introduce Ambassador Dennis Ross at a meeting of the Labour Friends of Israel, which I chair. As right hon. and hon. Members will know, Ambassador Ross is a distinguished expert on the middle east, who played a leading role in the first Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration and who has dealt directly with Israel and the Palestinians. At last week's meeting, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/3" class="indent">&quot;today we are not in the peacemaking business&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/4" class="indent">Instead, there is a pressing need to control and improve the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/5">The Israeli elections in March saw the formation of a new coalition, led by Kadima, with the Israeli Labour party as senior partner. I congratulate the Labour party leader, Amir Peretz, on that success. I met Labour Members of the Knesset when I led an LFI delegation to Israel and Palestine in February and I was impressed by the party's domestic social agenda, which had a familiar ring. The party was even using footage from the British Labour party's 1997 and 2001 election broadcasts to promote their key policy&mdash;a minimum wage. That is incredibly encouraging. The success of the Labour party in March demonstrates a willingness among Israelis to debate what sort of society they want theirs to be, and it is clear that that society will be more socially inclusive and embrace a greater redistribution of wealth.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/6" class="indent">The Israeli Labour party is also progressive and innovative on security matters. It is committed to a two-state solution and a negotiated final status settlement. It has emphasised the importance of sustaining talks with President Abbas's office and is determined to heighten his status. The appointment of Mr. Peretz as Minister of Defence is also a positive development, and I hope that the Labour party's leading role in the coalition will see a greater push towards negotiation. In his own words, Peretz is committed to a</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/7" class="indent">&quot;policy to continue waging war on terrorists while trying to ease restrictions on the Palestinian people&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/8">wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/9">There is much to support elsewhere in the coalition. The new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, will visit the Palace of Westminster next week for an open meeting with Members of this House and the other place. At that meeting, I hope that he will explain how he will implement the clear mandate that the Israeli people gave him in the March elections to continue withdrawals from the west bank. What is known as the convergence plan involves withdrawing from all settlements east of the fence, dismantling illegal outposts and potentially resettling 70,000 settlers from the west bank. The policy, which is still in its formative stages, would establish provisional borders in accordance with the road map and would not deviate wildly from the map drawn up under the Geneva accords.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/10">Right hon. and hon. Members would be right to have reservations. Obviously, a unilateral plan is far from ideal, and we should continue to strive for negotiation, but we are where we are, and in the absence of a partnership for peace, unilateralism remains the only option. If we are to keep the peace process moving, we should recognise that fact and reluctantly and cautiously welcome that unilateralism. Concessions on the Israeli side could, I hope, catalyse similar developments on the Palestinian side to produce a state of what some commentators have called, perhaps oxymoronically, parallel unilateralism.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/11">That brings me to the Palestinians and specifically Hamas. On the one hand, the fact that there were free and fair elections in January&mdash;an event matched in the region only in Israel&mdash;is to be welcomed and is a cause for optimism. On the other hand, the fact that Hamas was the victor is a setback. Clearly, the Palestinian Authority, whatever its political complexion, needs to address severe domestic challenges, such as severe economic hardship, the need for social, education and health care improvements and the need to tackle corruption. When I was in Palestine in February, it was evident that it would take time for Fatah really to come to terms with the fact that Hamas was simply better organised politically on the ground, with a shrewd and sophisticated awareness of the simple need to get out the vote. There are domestic challenges, but perhaps parallel unilateralism will allow progress to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/12">However, the election of Hamas remains extremely worrying. The organisation unequivocally calls for the destruction of the state of Israel, which is simply unacceptable in a governing party.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.106.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="106"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0141.htm#06060755000446">
	<p pid="a.106.4/1">I agree absolutely. As I said, time is running out, not only in this debate, but on that wider, more fundamental point.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/2">When a suicide bomber attacked the busy streets of Tel Aviv over the Passover holidays in April, killing nine people and injuring nearly 100 others, Hamas leaders condoned the attack. What could possibly be gained from that? However, I am struck by the recent comments by Rashid abu Shabak, a Fatah leader whom President Abbas appointed in April 2006&mdash;against Hamas's wishes&mdash;to the post of security director for the West Bank and Gaza. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/3" class="indent">&quot;Hamas is acting as if it is isolated on the moon and can keep two identities, government and opposition. Hamas jumped overnight from being the group that attacked Israel to the government that has to arrest people who do that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/4">In the meantime, the Palestinian people have the most to lose. Regimes that are committed to religious fundamentalism have dangerous consequences for the populations over which they rule&mdash;not least for women, minorities and political activists.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/5">Furthermore, there has been the danger that the necessary sanctions may lead to an economic crisis. The international donor community has had to tackle a serious dilemma because of the need to continue to provide aid and assistance to ordinary, decent and innocent Palestinians while bypassing, at the moment, the Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/6">A way has been found to do that. On <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase> the international Quartet agreed on a new funding mechanism to be administered by the EU, whereby money can go directly to humanitarian causes such as schools and hospitals. Individual state donors have also increased their humanitarian budgets. That includes the UK, led by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development, whose Department has pledged an extra &pound;15 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for humanitarian funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/7">I draw right hon. and hon. Members' attention to the document &quot;Aiding Peace&quot; produced by Labour Friends of Israel, which was submitted to the Treasury as part of the consultation on the economic aspects of the peace process, led by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. It details other crucial elements needed for peace, including political stability; improving access to markets and supplies; stimulating employment and building up the Palestinian private sector; and establishing microfinance for Palestinian small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby strengthening the business environment and improving economic competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/8">Arguments persist that economic improvement cannot be addressed until Israeli security restrictions are addressed too. I urge understanding, however, that such restrictions are a consequence of the conflict. At last week's meeting, Ambassador Ross made the point that Israel daily faces about 60 security threats; I shall return to that point shortly. The reason why there are so few suicide bombings is that the Israeli defence force pre-empts many of them. I hope that the reduction in Israeli security restrictions and an increase in Palestinian economic activity and prosperity can, with the right leadership, occur in tandem.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/9">The debate on security must now take in Hamas as well. It may have come to power by democratic means but it has not embraced the democratic tradition and responsibilities of a democracy. Hamas has allowed the streets of Gaza, which was fully evacuated by Israel last year, to be controlled by militant factions engaged in running battles. Members of the Palestinian press reporting on those clashes have received death threats from Hamas because of their critical reporting of the Government and their sympathies with Mahmoud Abbas's office. Meanwhile, rocket attacks from Gaza on civilian targets in small Israeli towns have continued. Those attacks are crude and relatively inaccurate and therefore, thankfully, unsuccessful, but crucially they add to the Israeli sense of insecurity, especially because of the fear that a hit on the Ashkelon industrial zone, with its fuel and chemical depots and power station, would cause a major disaster. The attacks have provoked retaliation from Israel and the re-spinning of the cycle of violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/10">I believe that those daily rocket attacks by Palestinian militants are the biggest short-term obstacle to peace. The Israelis fear that if the attacks cannot be stopped in Gaza, from which they have withdrawn, they will spread to the west bank, from where every major town and population centre in Israel will be a target.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.109.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="109"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0141.htm#06060755000452">
	<p pid="a.109.1/1">My hon. Friend and I went on the same visit and saw together, at first hand, the wall and its ugliness&mdash;in all senses of the word, but we also saw how it provides security and reassurance to Israelis. I certainly accept my hon. Friend's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/2">In effect, the Israeli courts have had a veto over the route of the fence, and as a result, since February 2005, the proposed route has run for much of its length along the 1967 border, as my hon. Friend mentioned, and is much closer to that line than it previously was in other areas. Where the fence deviates from the green line its aim is as a tactical restriction to fulfil the aims of hindrance, detection and deterrence.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/3">Let me be blunt. In the end, armies can be negotiated to armistice and walls and fences can be negotiated back or down. The victims of terrorism cannot be negotiated back to life. It is the success of the barrier and its halting of the cycle of violence that created the political space for the Gaza withdrawal to take place and, from that, for the concept of territorial concessions to become the consensus approach to the peace process.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/4">The checkpoints and road blocks around the west bank have made it extremely difficult for Palestinians to travel in and around towns in the west bank&mdash;a reality that has, as I have said, had a detrimental affect on their trade and business. Israel continues to assess its road blocks policy but has found it hard to reduce restrictions when armed Palestinians are stopped on a regular basis and terrorist networks continue to operate. Similarly, Palestinians have found the Gaza-Israel border crossing at Karni closed for, so far, nearly half of 2006, which means that they have lost millions of dollars in wasted agricultural exports that were unable to leave Gaza. Peretz has promised to try to seek a solution to keep that area open more frequently, but there is apprehension from the security forces, which continue to thwart potential terrorist attacks from militants who hope to use the area to gain access to Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/5">I stress that Israel needs to ensure that all its security measures are proportionate and in accordance with the rights of ordinary, decent and innocent Palestinians. We should continue to press for that, but that pressure will be more effective if there is greater acknowledgement of the concerns of both sides, of the dilemmas Israel faces, and of the effectiveness of constructive, contextual, case-by-case criticism rather than the sometimes hysterical and uniquely disproportionate commentary that the conflict often receives.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.1/6">Practical work can also be done. The deal agreed in November 2005 on the Rafah border between the Gaza strip and Egypt is an example of how the international community can make a difference not only in wide and impersonal regional politics but in humanitarian issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.3/1">Yes, I can confirm that. I am not certain how that advances the argument, but I can confirm those facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.3/2">The regimes in Iran and Syria continue to support, fund and train terrorist organisations that operate in the middle east and threaten regional security. Groups supported, bankrolled, armed and, in some cases, even controlled by Iran and Syria include Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. State-sponsored terrorism undermines prospects for peace in the middle east peace process, the UK's commitment to regional reform and threatens the UK directly where there are troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hezbollah, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate(Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> mentioned, receives most of its funding from Iran. It continues to threaten Israel's security along its northern border, and only last week it launched attacks against Israel.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.3/3">Iran's rhetorical attacks against Israel together with its attempted procurement of nuclear weapons pose an existential threat to Israel. There have been calls from right hon. and hon. Members for a nuclear-free middle east, but there have also been calls for a middle east stabilised by nuclear deterrence. I suggest that neither is possible when the president of one nation is unrelenting in his call for another to be wiped off the face of the map.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.3/4">Once again, the UK has led the international community with patience and innovation, led first by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, and lately by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The latter carries with her, in her first few weeks in the job, the support, wishes and hopes of this House and all hon. Members' constituents in her current endeavours with our European and international partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.3/5">Over the years, we have all seen the ebb and flow of progression and setback which has characterised conflict in the middle east. With each progression, it is easy to become over-optimistic, and with each setback, it is all too easy to slide back into pessimism. I have tried to demonstrate to right hon. and hon. Members that whatever stage we may find ourselves at in that cycle&mdash;as I said at the start, 2006 is a key year in this process&mdash;the overall trend is and always should be towards democratic negotiation, resolution and peace.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.1/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing the debate. The sheer attendance illustrates the importance of this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/2">It is easy for people here and in the middle east to get depressed about the situation given that the state of Israel has existed for 60 years and it has been 90 years since the Balfour decoration. It is almost like a new100 years' war that never comes to an end. However, when one looks beyond those bald statistics, one sees that there has been enormous change in that period: the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which has held; an exchange of ambassadors and a peaceful relationship; the Jordan-Israel peace treaty, which is an equally important treaty with Israel's second neighbour; and, most significantly, both Israel and the Palestinians have accepted that there should be a two-state solution. That would have been inconceivable for the Palestinians and many Israelis until relatively recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/3">What made those things possible? One should not underestimate the significance of national leaders. It is rather like the situation in South Africa with the end of apartheid: it needed not only Mandela, but de Clerk&mdash;two leaders from each community who were able to look to the future, not just the past. In relation to the middle east, considerations such as Anwar Sadat's flight to Israel to address the Knesset, King Hussein's courage with the Jordan treaty, and Yitzhak Rabin becoming a peacemaker having been a warrior all show what can be achieved. The challenge is whether Olmert and Abbas can both come up to those important standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/4">Clearly, a negotiated solution is the best way forward. I almost hope that Hamas will reject what has been put to it so that a referendum can go ahead. I can think of nothing more important and significant than a referendum of the Palestinian people endorsing Abbas's call for a two-state solution, so that thereafter discussions and negotiations could take place with that clearly being the will of the Palestinian people, and Hamas being clearly sidelined on that issue at least. If that turns out not to be possible, for whatever reason, we should not reject out of hand the Israeli commitment to a unilateral approach, because it reflects two fundamental changes that have taken place in Israeli thinking among those who are traditionally on the hard-line right of Israeli politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/5">The first change is the recognition that, giventhe demographic changes taking place, Israel as a democratic society simply cannot hold on permanently to the whole of the west bank and Gaza. In a sense, the Israelis have concluded that in future the state of Israel will not be the same as the land of Israel. The land of Israel may be a biblical concept, but the state of Israel will have to have more modest aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/6">The second change in Israeli thinking is strategically very important. For many years Israel said, and reminded anyone who went there, &quot;Security requires us to occupy the west bank. Look how small Israel is; look how quickly we could be overcome if a conflict broke out&quot;, but the reality is that it no longer has any fear from conventional Arab armies. Egypt and Jordan are at peace with Israel and there is no Arab state that could conventionally defeat it, and the Israelis are comfortable with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/7">Israel faces two kinds of threat. The demographic threat if it holds on to the whole of the west bank and ceases to lose its Jewish identity, and, perhaps more important, a missile threat. Whether nuclear or otherwise, missiles can attack Israel, which is not protected from that simply by holding on to the west bank. For that reason, even those on the right of Israeli politics are now prepared to contemplate a unilateral withdrawal from the west bank, should it prove necessary. That offers a major new opportunity for a peaceful solution to the crisis, which we have not had in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/8">Given the time limit, I shall just make some brief points. I hope that the Israelis will take them on board should the negotiations go forward, or should they not and a unilateral solution is required. The first is that they should not feel too guilty about the wall or fence. It is not aimed at keeping people in, like the Berlin wall was; it is to keep terrorists out. That is a pretty fundamental distinction. However, as part of any ultimate agreement, unilateral or otherwise, the fence will have to go, because the economic future of the region requires close economic co-operation between Palestine, Israel and Jordan. Such co-operation is not possible with the long-term existence of the wall.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/9">Secondly, the 1967 boundaries cannot be an absolute determinant of where the new frontier will lie. If the Israelis want, for understandable reasons, to hold on to some settlement areas, they must be willing to contemplate exchanges of territory, so that the overall Palestinian territory is not seriously diminished as a consequence.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/10">Thirdly, nobody in their right mind wants a new barrier through the middle of Jerusalem. There are solutions to this. The Vatican-type status in Rome does not detract from the sovereignty or security of Italy any more than recognition of the holy places in east Jerusalem as non-Israeli territory would in any way damage any fundamental interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/11">Fourthly, the right of return is very important from the point of view of Hamas and some Palestinians. The Israelis cannot be expected to concede that, but they can be expected, perhaps with American help, to offer generous financial compensation as part of an overall package. The current plans of the Israeli Government appear to envisage holding on not just to settlement areas, but to a whole section of the Jordan valley. I do not see any military need from them to do so. I believe, and hope, that that is simply a negotiating ploy so that they will have something extra to concede as part of an overall peaceful solution. They cannot expect to hold on to the Jordan valley; it has to be part of a Palestinian state, although a demilitarised valley should clearly meet Israeli requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.1/12">Given the time pressures, I should just like to make one final point. Although Israel and Palestine can be a source of deep worry and depression, we should never lose sight of the fact that there is a fundamental difference between the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, despite the length of time that it has existed, and other disputes, such as those over Kashmir and Cyprus or the Tamil problem. The difference is that we already know what the final structure will be: the Israelis and Palestinians will each end up having their own state. Therefore, the problem is not what kind of ultimate structure there will be; it is exactly how we get there and what the details should be. That is different from any of the other problems that bedevil the world as a whole, and it is a source of hope and confidence rather than one of worry and depression.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.113.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" speakername="Richard Burden" colnum="113"  time="015:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0142.htm#06060755000459">
	<p pid="a.113.0/1">I shall be as brief as possible. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the debate and the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> on his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/2">Although I am sure there will be differences of opinion on the substantive issues involved, today's attendance indicates something. This has been one of several Westminster Hall debates on this subject in recent months, but we have not had one on the Floor of the House for as long as I can remember. It is time that such a debate was held. I think that we all agree that it should take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/3">My hon. Friend mentioned that we need to examine the situation on the ground and keep it in mind. He is right about that. Although this is an area where statistics hit us from all angles, we must understand, at this stage more than at perhaps any other time, the grinding poverty that is affecting the Palestinians. We are talking about unemployment levels of 31 per cent.; in Gaza the figure is 40 per cent. Poverty levels are rising. Food insecurity has risen by 14 per cent. in the past 10 months, and the United Nations is predicting that it could reach 51 per cent. this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/4">Access for Palestinians in the occupied territories has got worse in the past 12 months. Three ambulances were attacked by Israeli troops in the last week in May. There were 376 road blocks and checkpoints prior to disengagement from Gaza in September and there were 515 by mid May this year. Karni, which is a lifeline of goods going in and out of Gaza, has been closed for44 per cent. of the time since the start of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/5">I give those statistics not only because they are part of the reality on the ground that we need to bear in mind, but to say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that, while I understand and have a good deal of sympathy with the international community's demands on Hamas, it is not a simple thing to say, &quot;Cut off assistance from the Palestinian Authority and somehow you can protect the Palestinians anyway.&quot; The Palestinian Authority runs 75 per cent. of all schools, and 62 per cent. of primary health care clinics are run by the Ministry of Health. We are talking about hitting essential operations: water, maintenance of refuse services, sewage collection, and so on. When the Minister sums up this debate, will he say how the alternative mechanisms that will somehow get assistance through to the Palestinians, while bypassing the Palestinian Authority, will work? The statistics that I cited are not from February or March; they are published in a United Nations report from the end of May, after the Quartet's announcement of the alternative mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/6">This week, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian President, engaged in a brave proposal. I believe that Hamas should recognise Israel. I do not say that Hamas should accept the two-state solution, because one thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool should understand is that, to all intents and purposes, it has already done so. There are legion comments from its spokespeople&mdash;most recently, the BBC reported one such comment yesterday by the parliamentary speaker&mdash;saying that Hamas accepts the two-state solution. Recognition is a different issue, and it has some way to go on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/7">If we are to ask Hamas to recognise Israel, the point that I made to my hon. Friend about which borders was not one simply of academic significance. It is of real significance. People are living under occupation. If at this stage there are no guarantees about what their state will be and what the Israelis will recognise, what are we asking them to recognise? The deal might be to recognise the 1967 borders, although there needs to be negotiation about whether that ends up to be the final settlement. Let us accept that international law is the kernel of a settlement. Such a deal would mean that Israel withdraws from land it occupies and it means that the Palestinians accept the internationally recognised borders of Israel based on the 1967 borders. That would be something real, but it is not the situation that we are in.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/8">This issue is of more than academic significance, because if we are to say vote for recognition to Palestinians, who are suffering the poverty that I was describing, we must be as clear as possible that when the referendum or whatever is used comes, they will vote for that. They should not see, one more time, the international community adopting one set of standards for them and another set for the Israelis. If they were to get that impression, given that they are faced with that grinding poverty, we will probably be heading not for an acceptance of the two-state solution but for greater conflict, with all the tragedies that that will mean for Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/9">I ask the Minister again to clarify whether, when he is asking the Palestinians to recognise Israel, he is saying that they should recognise Israel within its internationally recognised 1967 borders or within somewhere else? If he is saying the former, does he accept that it is only reasonable also to say to Israel that it should recognise a state of Palestine on those 1967 borders? For good measure, if we are asking the Palestinians to have a referendum, perhaps there could be one in Israel as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/10">Will the Minister clarify a couple of other things? The first is about the dividing up of the west bank. It is being split into different &quot;Bantustans&quot;&mdash;to use a term that some employ&mdash;which are segregated from each other, with no proper transport continuity let alone territorial continuity. That is a real barrier to a settlement. That process, through settlements and the wall, is almost complete. One area is standing in the way of that happening: the E1 area, which is part of the so-called Jerusalem bubble. Israel has said that it will build on E1, but it is illegal and is regarded so by the United States, the British Government and the European Union. Does my right hon. Friend the Minister attach the significance that I attach to the E1 plan and what will Britain do to ensure that it does not go ahead?</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/11">I want to make two further points. First, while we demand, rightly, that the Palestinians end the violence, will we make the same demand on the Israelis? Can we at least suggest to them&mdash;or perhaps more than suggest&mdash;that it might be a good idea if they committed themselves unambiguously to abiding by the provisions of the fourth Geneva convention in the occupied territories, because they are not doing so at the moment? In that context, can my right hon. Friend update the House on what is happening in the Hurndall and Miller cases following the decisions of the coroner here?</p>
	<p pid="a.113.0/12">Secondly, on the humanitarian crisis, I have asked my right hon. Friend to clarify the alternative mechanisms, but will he also explain how Britain intends to respond to the UN appeal? It is estimated that the emergency needs of the Palestinians require approximately$385 million extra. Are we going to respond to that and, if so, how?</p>

	<p pid="a.116.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool(Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. He is right to say that this is a crucial time for the middle east and an appropriate moment to consider what steps Her Majesty's Government can take to help to resuscitate and support the peace process involving Israel and the Palestinians&mdash;the conclusion of which would, of course, send a powerful message to the wider region that peace and democracy are the future, as well as providing the conditions for safety and prosperity for their own populations. In recent months and years it has been difficult to identify any clear chinks of light in a rather gloomy scenario, but they are there and I want to focus on a few of them in my brief contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/2">It is important to recognise that although unilateral disengagement by Israel, including withdrawal from certain settlements, the continuation of the security fence and the fixing of its borders, will not amount to a peace settlement, it does represent a courageous and vital attempt to achieve some lasting security for its citizens and an end to occupation of the Palestinian territory. In the current scenario, that is a logical course of action and deserves the active support of the international community, but it is not a peace settlement. Even more so than in the final years of Yasser Arafat's leadership, which was characterised by broken promises and missed opportunities, Israel does not currently have a partner in the peace process, and it needs one. If there were any doubt about that, the election of Hamas in January settled it.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/3">In no sense can Hamas be described as freedom fighter turned statesman. It is a terrorist organisation that speaks the language of bloodshed, both against Israel and within the occupied territories. Between 1989 and 2005, Hamas was deemed responsible for murdering 579 and wounding more than 3,200 Israeli men, women and children, 93 per cent. of whom were innocent civilians. The Hamas leadership condones that record and refuses to condemn the attacks that have been carried out since its election. In fact, all the signs are that it sees no incompatibility between being a democratically elected Administration and encouraging terrorist atrocities.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/4">Indeed, Hamas has set up a new 3,000-strong security force led by a former commander of the popular resistance committee. The violent clashes in Gaza city in recent days between Fatah-dominated security forces and Hamas forces have again left the Palestinian leadership with innocent blood on its hands. The United Kingdom and the EU cannot and must not do business with Hamas. Yet we cannot turn our backs on the Palestinian people. We must do everything we can to isolate Hamas and encourage a strong constituency for peace and democracy within the occupied territories&mdash;a constituency that will recognise the fundamental need for peaceful co-existence with the Jewish state.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/5">The Palestinian elections represented something of a paradox. On one hand, they brought about the election of an anti-democratic terrorist organisation and, on the other, it must be recognised that they were something of a victory for democracy. They reaffirmed the overwhelming commitment by the Palestinian people to determine their political future by democratic means. In a region where Israel has traditionally stood out starkly as the only real democratic nation, the relatively trouble-free elections sent a signal that there is a strong appetite within the troubled Palestinian territories for democratic solutions. That represents an important chink of light that we must do all we can to foster.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/6">Having read the European Union election observation mission's report on the January elections, one cannot fail to be impressed with the exercise of democracy in the Palestinian territories. As the report concludes, the elections amounted to</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/7" class="indent">&quot;an open and fairly-contested electoral process that was efficiently administered&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/8">by the Palestinian Central Elections Commission. I strongly encourage the Minister to read the recommendations in the report to see what extra support his Department can give to improving electoral arrangements for Palestinians in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/9">Another significant chink of light is President Mahmoud Abbas's intention to call a referendum on Palestinian statehood that would implicitly recognise Israel's right to exist if Hamas will not directly accept his two-state proposal. His dialogue with Hamas on the matter seems to be failing, but all the opinion polling in recent days seems to suggest that if he takes his call for a referendum directly to the Palestinian streets he will win, and that support for Hamas is declining. I have huge sympathy with the powerful point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> who wants Hamas's destructionist view to be buried by popular opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/10">The border plan drawn up by Palestinian prisoners from Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who are being held in Israeli prisons, forms the basis for the Abbas proposal, but may not represent a final peace settlement with Israel, However, it could at least provide the bedrock for a united Palestinian approach which is committed to peaceful co-existence and which can engage with a meaningful peace process. The Israeli Prime</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/11">Minister said again at the weekend that his country wants to talk with Abbas and to restart the peace negotiations, but that will bear fruit only when Hamas accepts the three conditions set out by the Quartet.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.1/12">I am conscious that I have focused overwhelmingly on the Palestinian side of the peace equation, because I believe that the next substantive steps towards peace must come, and can only come, from the Palestinians, whose people have been impoverished and betrayed yet again by bad leadership.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.121.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="121"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0142.htm#06060755000469">
	<p pid="a.121.0/1">I start, as is obligatory but highly appropriate on this occasion, by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool(Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing the debate. This is the highest attendance I have ever seen for a debate in this Chamber, and it reflects not only the interest in the subject, but, regrettably, the entrenched views in this House, which perhaps mirror the entrenched views of people in the area that we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/2">It was a privilege to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase>, who drew on his expertise as a former Foreign Secretary and, before that, Defence Secretary. In six minutes, he encapsulated the kernel of our entire debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/3">Drawing on the contributions, I want to touch on four subjects. First, my party and I strongly believe in the necessity for a two-state solution. The right hon. and learned Gentleman's most telling point was that this conflict, unlike others, has an end point, on which almost everybody, regardless of their opinion, can agree. For the Israelis, that end point is security and being seen as legitimate by their neighbours, by people across the middle east and by the world. To balance that, for the Palestinians, it is having a viable state.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/4">Politicians can be so immersed in conflict resolution, especially in troubled areas of the world, that they lose sight of what much of day-to-day politics is about. I was particularly struck by what the hon. Member for Hartlepool said about the minimum wage in Israel and about the elections, in which some slogans and themes of Labour's 1997 and 2001 campaigns were drawn on, perhaps unwisely&mdash;well, given the success of the outcome, perhaps it was wise. Relating politics to people's day-to-day concerns is extremely important; politics needs to address people's concerns. Ultimately, politicians should not be judged solely on their ability to strike poses and negotiate settlements in protracted disagreements that have lasted for many decades. They also have to be able to bring tangible economic and social benefits to the people whom they serve.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/5">My second point is on Israel's place in the wider middle east. It is extremely welcome news that Israel continues to enjoy cordial relations with Egypt and Jordan. That points the way forward for mature relationships with other parts of the middle east. Everyone would agree that the Iranian president's rhetoric about the existence of Israel is alarming, but there is some cause for optimism even there, although I do not want to exaggerate it. We should not underestimate the leap that the Americans have made in the past week or two in offering to have dialogue with the Iranians. Also, interestingly, the Iranians have shown imagination&mdash;something that is not always displayed&mdash;by at least engaging in that process. I do not wish to overstate the progress made, but nor do I wish to understate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.0/6">My third point is about the security wall, which has been touched on in nearly every contribution so far. People disagree on how to describe it, but let us call it a wall for the time being. I well understand the reasons why that wall was built. We need only go back to events in London just under a year ago to understand the threat and the terror that suicide bombers pose to people going about their normal business, and we should never lose sight of that concern and that menace. However, it is also reasonable to observe that the wall is aggressively placed, and that it divides communities both economically and socially. I do not particularly wish to make a judgment, other than to say that no wall has ever offered a lasting solution to a political problem, whether it is in Northern Ireland, Berlin or elsewhere. Some people may take the view that it is necessary in the short term, but I caution anyone against thinking that it is anything other than a short-term measure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="138"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0145.htm#06060762000078">
	<p pid="a.138.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this important debate, given the joint announcement on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase> by the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence of the proposal to move forward with the part-privatisation, as I interpret it, of the search and rescue helicopter service provided variously by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency through private providers, by the Ministry of Defence through a branch of the RAF and by the Royal Navy. In my constituency, in which the Royal Navy air station Culdrose is based, there is, as I am sure the Minister will understand, a significant sensitivity about the impact that the proposal will have not only on the base, but on those who have enjoyed the safety and security of knowing that such an excellent search and rescue service is available. Indeed, it is a vital service. The capability of the Ministry of Defence both on land and at sea provides significant reassurance to mariners and to those who have enjoyed the benefits of the search and rescue service and whose life has been saved by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/2">In a written answer to questions that I asked the Minister about the future of the 771 Squadron at Culdrose, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/3" class="indent">&quot;In contributing to Search and Rescue (SAR) in the coastal waters of the south west extending 200 miles out to sea, 771 Squadron of the Royal Navy was scrambled 211 times last year and rescued 154 people.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-10">10 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446, c. 293W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/4">The importance of the service is known to many, and certainly from my consultations prior to this debate with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the National Coastwatch Institution, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations and many other voluntary organisations, I know that there is widespread recognition of its significance and importance. I am sure that, when considering any change to any service, the Minister will be quite used to the expression&mdash;I think it is American&mdash;&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it&quot;. That phrase will surely be ringing in his ears when he considers what changes are appropriate to such an important service and the potentially detrimental impact if any decision is wrong. Those are the issues on which I seek reassurances from him today.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/5">The 771 Squadron at Culdrose provides two Sea King Mk 5 aircraft, which are primarily located on site, although sometimes the aircraft on duty can be taken up to five hours' flying time away from the base. A back-up aircraft is therefore needed. In providing the important search and rescue service&mdash;going as far out as 200 miles off the west coast of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, as mentioned in the written answer that I quoted&mdash;the squadron needs a greater capacity than one aircraft with a back-up.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/6">As the Minister is also aware, the service fulfils an important maritime anti-terrorism function, to which he referred in his letter to me on <phrase class="date" code="">26 May</phrase> this year:</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Additionally, the new UK SAR-H will not undertake the counter-terrorism role currently undertaken by 771 squadron. This is a military role, the continued requirement for which will be assessed in due course.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/8">Both he and the Minister of State, Department for Transport, have written to me about the new opportunity to bring the service together, but I am concerned, as I am sure many others are, about the possible break-up of the service and the potential for it to be salami-sliced, instead of brought together as a more harmonised service. If the maritime counter-terrorism role is taken away from the search and rescue capability, that is another service that the Ministry of Defence will need to consider how best to provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/9">In my area, as I believe in many others, the search and rescue service also doubles up as the night-time air ambulance. The air ambulance in my constituency, which is very much appreciated and is supported largely through voluntary contributions from the local community, can fly only during daylight hours. The service can be provided out of hours because 771 Squadron backs it up, providing an excellent service itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/10">The search and rescue service also provides a medevac service. For example, my constituents on the Isles of Scilly are 30 miles out to the sea and cannot get to the main acute hospital at Treliske, in Truro, very quickly. They are sometimes evacuated from the isles when there is an emergency and that service is very much appreciated. The search and rescue service also provides other medevac services in other situations and a casevac service&mdash;in other words, a service for casualties, for instance in road traffic accidents. Where the air ambulance cannot get in, the 771 Squadron search and rescue service will come in and provide an important service.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/11">The search and rescue service also provides important support in major incidents, with its standby helicopter and its back-up helicopter. However, if there were a major incident, more helicopters would be required than those two. For instance, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-16">16 August 2004</phrase> there was catastrophically heavy rainfall in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase>, particularly in the Boscastle area. Many people know the name of Boscastle because it has been etched on their memories from that day, when 50 or more cars were washed away from the village and out to sea. Many buildings were also washed away, because of the torrential rain and flooding that hit the village. Some 91 people were saved by the helicopter services, with three helicopters from RAF Culdrose and three from RAF Chivenor. If we simply have a search and rescue service but we do not have the capability, training and back-up of the military service, we will not have the capacity to provide that level of flexibility and respond to such catastrophic major incidents, for which we clearly need to ensure that the service is available.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/12">There are other important dimensions to the service. The significance of the training for military pilots, crew and divers is often overlooked. Surely it is better for them to have real-life experience, rather than simulation exercises. If pilots, crew and divers are to be engaged in combat situations or combat search and rescue, it is surely far better for them to have had the opportunity of experiencing those real-life situations rather than&mdash;I should like the Minister to clarify how firm the Government's plans are on this&mdash;finding themselves taken away from the many civilian situations to which they are currently scrambled.</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/13">There is also the question of the tests necessary for the capability of future aircraft. In letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, written in answer to questions from me, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/14" class="indent">&quot;With regard to the training concerns you raise, whilst it is true that 771 squadron currently conduct residual Sea King training for Sea Kings Mks 5/6 and 7, the planned withdrawal of these aircraft types, in the years 2014 and 2018 respectively, means by definition that the requirement for this training will diminish and eventually disappear. That said, whatever optimum method is ultimately identified for the provision of future SAR coverage, this will of course encompass full delivery of the necessary training for the aircraft types involved.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/15">The problem, however, as I indicated in a letter to which the Minister replied on <phrase class="date" code="">1 June</phrase>, is that all the evidence seems to suggest the Merlins that have been brought into base to replace the Sea Kings have neither the capability nor the flexibility to perform the search and rescue function, despite costing &pound;104 million an airframe. The question remains: what aircraft will be used to perform those important functions, despite all the expense and investment going into the Merlin project?</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/16">The Sea Kings have been excellent workhorses, for the Royal Navy in particular, and they have been much appreciated at Culdrose since they were first brought into commission in the 1960s. They are being phased out in coming years, but the Ministry must surely consider what aircraft will replace them before it engages in such an exercise and considers the part privatisation of the service. How will those aircraft be provided and can we be sure that they will be sufficiently tested and proven capable of providing such a service?</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/17">I have mentioned combat search and rescue. I am sure that the Minister will also have reflected on the experience that civilian search and rescue can provide for personnel who are then engaged in combat search and rescue. My noble Friend Lord Garden tabled a written question about what plans the Government had for</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/18" class="indent">&quot;development of combat search and rescue capabilities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/19">Lord Drayson answered:</p>
	<p pid="a.138.1/20" class="indent">&quot;The UK is developing a combat recovery operations capability, of which combat search and rescue is a subset. This will be achieved through the utilisation of existing support helicopter assets from within Joint Helicopter Command.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 682,c.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.140.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="140"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0145.htm#06060762000079">
	<p pid="a.140.1/1">During the break I found a quote from the Minister of State, Department for Transport, which I failed to lay my hands on earlier. The quote is from a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase>, in which he responds to a letter of mine. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The decision to proceed to this next stage, however, gives an opportunity to bring together the current Search and Rescue helicopter providers into one harmonised service under a single contract providing the taxpayer with a service that is better value for money whilst remaining as effective as the current one...Indeed newer airframes, optimised training opportunities and greater harmonisation between the providers, will enhance the service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/3">He goes on to say something that has been repeated in a number of responses and statements from both the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence: that the new service will</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/4" class="indent">&quot;continue to use a high proportion of military aircrew alongside civilian aircrew&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/5">Certain questions arise from this type of situation. In his letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, the Minister now present said that in incidents such as that at Boscastle, which I mentioned earlier,</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the military will always be able to be called upon to support the Civilian Emergency Services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/7">That raises questions about how the military can provide such support after the only airframe left in the service is the Merlin, which has shown itself not to be capable of providing such a service.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/8">In relation to the points made by the Minister of State, Department for Transport, in his letter of <phrase class="date" code="">5 June</phrase>, I would like to know how a more harmonised service will be provided if the maritime and counter-terrorism service is being taken away from the search and rescue service. We still do not know how a service including the air ambulance, medevac, casevac and other functions provided by 711 Squadron&mdash;I can talk only about that service, but this no doubt that applies to many other MOD-based services&mdash;that are not part of the core search and rescue function can be said to be part of a harmonised service if they are not included in the cost-benefit analysis of the proposal brought forward by both Departments.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/9">In order properly to inform those who are most concerned about this&mdash;many Members from across the country will be concerned about this&mdash;both Departments must give us more information on costs and savings, and on how they will underpin the maritime, counter-terrorism, medical air ambulance, RTA and other roles for which the search and rescue service currently provides services.</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/10">In cases in which civilian services are provided by Bristows, such as in the Solent, for example, how often have such services failed to respond because of unserviceable aircrafts? What proportion of jobs have they failed to attend for which the MOD has provided back-up? I understand that that has happened on a number of occasions. How will the training that I mentioned earlier be provided, especially given that it is important that the civilian function provided by the MOD provides that essential real-life experience for the combat search and rescue situation? How will it perform its combat search and rescue? Which aircraft will be used if the Sea King is coming out of commission in total by 2018? What will be put in its place, and on the basis of what training and experience will that combat search and rescue service be provided? How will the Government&mdash;I suppose it will have to be done across Government&mdash;deal with major incidents such as those that I mentioned? How will they scramble those aircraft and make sure that the service is a harmonised service of the type that the Minister envisioned in his letter to me? What preparation and training will be given? Which aircraft will perform those duties?</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/11">I am sure that the Minister understands that the future of the 711 Squadron is close to my heart and those of my constituents. It is interesting that in his letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-26">26 May 2006</phrase>, he says:</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/12" class="indent">&quot;No decisions have yet been taken on the future bases for this service. The PFI process will identify any gaps and risks, and only after full consideration of all these will decisions be taken.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.140.1/13">From that, I presume that he is saying that there is potential for the present search and rescue services to be moved off-base in future. He says that the military crew should be used, but there is no guarantee or surety in his response, given that it is unclear which bases the services will operate from and whether many, if any, of the services will be based on MOD sites such as RNAS Culdrose. I hope that the Minister will take on board my concerns, and appreciate that I want to engage constructively with him on this matter. I look forward to hearing his response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.142.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence"  colnum="142"  time="016:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0145.htm#06060762000080">
	<p pid="a.142.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing this debate and on providing me with the chance to speak on an unquestionably important issue. From his opening and closing comments, I know that he shares my appreciation of the excellent search and rescue helicopter service provided by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy under the Ministry of Defence, and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency under the Department for Transport. I hope that he accepts that it is our intention to maintain the current high standard of service. I want to touch on how that has been approached.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/2">The hon. Gentleman correctly referred to the written ministerial statement laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase> by the Minister of State, Department for Transport, which said that the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Transport are moving forward together to ensure that we continue to have an excellent service. That is a very positive step and we were able to announce it jointly.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/3">It may be helpful if I were to set out the background to that recent statement. The organisation of search and rescue in the United Kingdom is an amalgam of separate Departments, the emergency services and other organisations, all of which play a vital part. The Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency together provide a 24-hour military and civil search and rescue helicopter service.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/4">We cover the United Kingdom search and rescue region from 12 bases around the United Kingdom. Currently, the service is provided by the RAF from six bases&mdash;at Boulmer, Chivenor, Leconfield, Lossiemouth, Valley and Wattisham&mdash;and by the Royal Navy from two bases, which are at Culdrose and Prestwick, using Sea King helicopters. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency service is provided from its four bases, which are at Lee-on-Solent, Portland, Stornoway and Sumburgh, through a contractor, as it has been for many years. That is re-competed for regularly: approximately every five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/5">Over the next decade, the Ministry of Defence search and rescue Sea Kings, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, have given us good service since the 1970s, will come to the end of their useful life. I sense that he wanted them to continue in some shape or form, but they will come to the end of their useful life. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency service contract will also come up for renewal in 2012. It was therefore essential for us to decide the best way to ensure the continuation of that important service well into the future and to work together even more closely. We needed to ensure that the best possible service was delivered, while ensuring that it demonstrated value for money. That was the overriding priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/6">The hon. Gentleman made the point that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. As the Sea Kings are going out of service, they will not be available, so we need to replace them. Therefore, it is right, at this point, to consider what will replace them and what the replacement will do. He began to allude to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/7">As a result of that, a joint Ministry of Defence and Maritime and Coastguard Agency procurement team was set up under an inter-departmental steering group to assess options. Over the past three years, a rigorous joint assessment has been carried out. It concluded that we should move to a harmonised service, and that a service under the private finance initiative has the best potential to deliver the capability we need at maximum value for money.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/8">The decision is very much in line with the plan outlined in the defence industrial strategy, which states that the majority of search and rescue helicopters in the UK currently are provided by the RAF and the Royal Navy. The remainder are provided by civilian helicopters under contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It is planned to replace that capability with a single contract that retains a proportion of military aircrews to enable operational readiness of deployed search and rescue crews in the middle of the next decade. I understood that the hon. Gentleman's party supported the DIS. I suggest that he perhaps reads what we set out and his party supported in the construct of that document.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/9">The next stage is what do we do now that we have set out that definition, and we are moving forward to the joint search and rescue helicopter project as a competition under the private finance initiative. The decision to proceed to that next stage provides the opportunity to bring together the current search and rescue helicopter provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.0/10">We intend to provide a service that is at least as effective as the current one. We also anticipate additional benefits from the flexibility that harmonisation brings, from the improved capability and sustainability that modern aircraft and technology will deliver, and from military and civilian aircrew being trained to the same high standard. We believe that that will enhance the service and provide an excellent service that offers value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07a.143.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" colnum="143"  time="016:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0145.htm#06060762000082">
	<p pid="a.143.1/1">I was moving on to the process. Hopefully, the hon. Gentleman understands that it will be a thorough process. We do not enter such a process by being prescriptive. We must see what is out there and what the options are. We must test the range of opportunities that exist. I shall explain how that is approached, and hopefully that will deal with some, if not all, of his points.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/2">The competition is being carried out in accordance with the European Union procurement regulations and was launched through a notice in the European Union journal on <phrase class="date" code="">12 May</phrase>. It will benefit from the new European Union competitive dialogue procedure, which has been designed to deal with PFI projects. The process, in partnership with industry, promotes full evaluation of customer requirements and industry responses prior to selecting a preferred bidder. We will use it to establish a robust contract with industry and to ensure that we deliver an excellent service for the taxpayer. The first step will be to ensure that companies wishing to take part in the competition have the appropriate capability. That will be done by thorough assessment of their pre-qualification questionnaires later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/3">The hon. Gentleman asked me which aircraft will be involved and how things will be delivered. Is he therefore asking me not to go through a procurement process, and not to have rigorous examination and to be definitive before we see what the market has available and how things should be delivered? Given his strong European credentials, there seems to be a contradiction. We should ensure best value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/4">There has been some speculation about the implications of that decision for the standard of service. I shall provide reassurance on the issue and bring out two key points. First, the Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will continue jointly to manage and task the service. In particular, the search and rescue tasking, which is currently carried out by the aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre at Kinloss and the appropriate maritime rescue co-ordination centres, will continue to be jointly managed.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/5">Secondly, the principle that the service will be no less effective than the current one will underpin the detailed requirement specification against which the competition will be conducted and performance will be measured. Key performance indicators will be set to ensure that all aspects of the service are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/6">As with the current service, military crews will play a key part in the future delivery of the search and rescue helicopter service. This is not, as some have said, privatisation. People should not set hares running, because there is no evidence for the assertion. People should not raise it, because what has been said will not happen at the end of the process. We will ensure that a high proportion of aircrew from the RAF and Royal Navy will continue to form part of the future service. We will continue to develop and maintain those valuable search and rescue skills in the military. That is in line with current policy, which seeks to transfer search and rescue skills to our deployable military helicopter fleets. There is an essential defence role in all that we do, and we have no intention of moving away from that, because we need the skill capability for all the reasons mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, and for some others.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/7">I shall address three other areas where I am aware that there has been considerable interest: the specific aircraft, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned; basing arrangements; and contract duration for the future service. The very nature of a service provision competition places the incentive on industry to propose the optimum means of delivering the service. That will include consideration of many issues, such as basing, operational capability, safety and the ability of airframes and crew to cover simultaneous incidents. The specific parameters will be established through the competition, and all aircraft proposed by industry will be rigorously assessed to ensure that they are capable of delivering the level of service we require. Only once that process is completed will any decisions be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Merlin helicopters. He is right in saying that although those based at Culdrose are not designed for search and rescue purposes, they are used by other nations in a search and rescue role. It is for providers to decide whether they want an adapted airframe for that purpose. The hon. Gentleman seems to be writing off the Merlin, but that is not desirable given the importance of the airframe, so let us see whether it can be adapted for that use and whether it can meet our rigorous testing, against which it would be measured.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/9">Clearly, the hon. Gentleman has a particular interest in the Royal Navy air station at Culdrose. The future use of Culdrose as a search and rescue base will be fully assessed during the competitive phase. He set out various reasons why it should be retained and I assure him that all those factors will be taken into account. We are not setting out to close stations; we want to see how best we can continue to deliver where there is demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/10">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the maritime and counter-terrorism role of 771 Squadron, which will be unaffected by the future helicopter search and rescue plans. The search and rescue role of the squadron, which is based at RNAS Culdrose, will be transferred to an alternative, equally capable military unit in due course and where it is best placed. I am sure that he recognises that. The squadron needs to remain at Culdrose because its function is UK-wide, so let us see where it is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/11">Another issue that must be addressed is the duration of the contract, which will be established following dialogue with industry during the competition phase. The duration must provide a solid assurance of the future search and rescue service and is likely to relate to the potential lifespan of the new aircraft. It is anticipated that that will result in a duration of between 20 and 30 years, so when a determination has been made it will be for two or three decades, which is significant. It will depend on the airframes and other component parts selected. None of that has been fixed and will be subject to full and proper evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/12">Our plans for the future are of course relevant to the wider search and rescue community. There is no question about that and we shall continue to keep the UK search and rescue strategic committee and its operators group informed. They are a key aspect of delivery and monitoring because they bring together Departments, emergency services, charities and voluntary organisations that contribute to search and rescue in the United Kingdom. The wider public will be able to keep abreast of progress through the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's website. The process will be integrated. As each stage is reached, it will be defined and set out&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.143.1/13" class="italic">It being thirteen minutes past Five o'clock, the motion for the Adjournment of the sitting lapsed, without Question put.</p>
