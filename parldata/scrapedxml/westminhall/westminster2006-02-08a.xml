	<p pid="a.249.3/1">I am sure that everyone here is all too familiar with the tragic circumstances that led to the then Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1810" name="David Blunkett">the right hon. Member for Sheffield, Brightside (Mr. Blunkett)</phrase>, asking Sir Michael Bichard to lead an independent inquiry into child protection measures, record keeping, vetting and information sharing. Following his inquiry, Sir Michael was asked to make recommendations in the hope that strategic changes to the way in which our police operate could minimise the chance of another tragedy occurring, such as happened in Cambridgeshire on <phrase class="date" code="2002-08-04">4 August 2002</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/2">Sir Michael made 31 recommendations in his report of June 2004, all of which were accepted by the Government and some of which have been fully implemented. However, it can be argued that the first recommendation is the most important, and it is that on which I want to concentrate this morning. The recommendation was that a national information technology system for England and Wales to support police intelligence should be introduced as a matter of urgency. I am concerned because in February 2006 we are barely any closer to implementing that recommendation than we were when Sir Michael made it more than 18 months ago. That is despite the fact that the Home Office responded to the recommendation by announcing plans for the development of an intelligence system of information management, prioritisation, analysis, co-ordination and tasking, known as IMPACT. I apologise for the amount of acronyms that will pepper my speech. They all come from the Bichard inquiry and, for ease of reference, the glossary at the back of the Bichard report might be of assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/3">In December 2004, the Government announced in their first progress report that a full business case would be in place by March 2005 and that the IMPACT intelligence system would be completed by 2007. At the time, that statement was accepted at face value and everything was all well and good. The urgent action that Sir Michael had called for seemed to have been noted by the Government. However, in March 2005 when Sir Michael Bichard published his final report, he identified a six-month delay in producing the business case. By September 2005, only an interim case had been produced, which is not available publicly. We were promised a full business case by March of this year, which would mean that the business case would be more than 12 months late, yet it is now unlikely that the new date will be met.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/4">Perhaps more worrying is the fact that the second progress report of November 2005 revealed that both the time line and the budget had slipped, and that the IMPACT programme might not be in place until at least 2010. The implementation of the first recommendation is now looking less of an urgent priority. However, the Bichard report allowed for some interim measures, one of which was referred to under recommendation 2, which called for a police local cross-check system&mdash;a PLX system&mdash;to be introduced throughout England and Wales by 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.249.3/5">What stage are we at in respect of recommendation 2 and information cross-sharing? The idea was that, if we introduced a PLX system as an interim measure, it would alleviate some of the problems that the police force had experienced. It is important to remember that the PLX system, a local cross-check system, is exactly that. It can cross-check one piece of intelligence against similar intelligence across forces. It is not an intelligence system in itself, in that it cannot deal with intelligence and progress it. It simply flags up where intelligence is held throughout the country. In other words, if my name was put into a police computer in South Yorkshire, the PLX might flag up my name in another county. I hasten to add that that is unlikely, but the system might flag up my name in other forces. The force making the inquiry then has to contact the other force to ask for the intelligence to be forwarded to it. It is a cross-check system. It does not put the intelligence in front of the operator who is putting in the initial entry.</p>

	<p pid="a.250.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate. Let us suppose that the police in his constituency did not know who he was, but had a photograph of him. With facial recognition technology, his photograph could be entered into a system so that other forces could identify him without knowing his name. Will the hon. Gentleman support me in my calls for the Home Office to speed up its attempts to introduce a nationwide facial recognition system? Are not the PLX and IMPACT systems the perfect chance to advance that course?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.250.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" speakername="Eric Illsley" colnum="250"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h01.htm#60208h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.250.1/1">From my limited knowledge of police computer systems, I think that it would be a great advantage if there was a photograph recognition system. Given the technology that is now available, that cannot be too far away. As will become clear the longer that I talk about the system, even to achieve the intelligence system that was flagged up two years ago, a huge cost and a time scale are involved that have not yet been met even in respect of the more simple aspects of police intelligence. To include a system of photo recognition within the IMPACT technology&mdash;an incremental system&mdash;could be possible, and different aspects of police intelligence could be added to the system as it improves. However, given my current knowledge of the system that is a long time away.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/2">In his original report, Sir Michael said that the PLX</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/3" class="indent">&quot;offers an interim solution, pending the introduction of the national IT system. Although the PLX is not a substitute for a national intelligence solution, it is considerably cheaper and easier to set up&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/4">Yet, even though it is cheaper and easier to set up, we are still struggling to implement the PLX system, which was looked on as an interim system.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/5">The other problem with the PLX system is that, although it flags up intelligence in police forces other than the force making the inquiry, it duplicates the intelligence. If a police officer in South Yorkshire put my name into the police computer and it flagged up that that intelligence was being held by a police force in, say, Essex, the police officer in South Yorkshire would ask Essex for that intelligence. It would be sent from Essex to South Yorkshire. South Yorkshire would then make a file entry in its system, duplicating the entry in Essex. Therefore, we would have a system whereby, over time, a duplication of the intelligence that is held would be built up around the country as other forces access those pieces of information. That would then require us at some stage to do what is called cleansing the intelligence; we would have to weed out all the duplicated entries. That is a disadvantage of the PLX system.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/6">There is another disadvantage in respect of police forces that are up to date with their procedures. Let us say that South Yorkshire puts my name into the computer and it shows up in Essex, and South Yorkshire then includes that piece of intelligence in its system. In the meantime, if Essex police had had no use for that piece of intelligence after a certain period&mdash;12 months or two years, perhaps&mdash;it might have deleted it from its system. If South Yorkshire then took me to court and tried to use that intelligence against me, my defence would be the provenance of that intelligence; I would ask, where did it come from and how did South Yorkshire obtain it? South Yorkshire would say, &quot;We got it from Essex,&quot; and Essex would say, &quot;Sorry, but we don't have it.&quot; That piece of intelligence would have no provenance. It is unlikely that it would be of any use to South Yorkshire if it had been deleted by the original force.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/7">The interim police local cross-check system&mdash;the IPLX, to use another acronym&mdash;was launched in February last year. The IMPACT nominal index provides a similar function directly to police forces, and the PLX is part of that IMPACT nominal index system. IMPACT is the overarching computer intelligence system; it began to roll out last year. In a parliamentary written answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, my right hon. Friend the Minister said that the PLX system had now been rolled out to child abuse investigation units around the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/8">Therefore, the PLX system is now available to police forces, but only for child abuse investigation units. That is only one aspect of police work. Although the PLX system has been rolled out and the Home Office is saying that it is ready, it is available only to child abuse investigation units, and it cannot be used for aspects&mdash;or modules&mdash;of police work such as violence, domestic violence, firearms, custody, other crimes and intelligence, all of which will, hopefully, be part of IMPACT in due course. We are still awaiting the roll-out of the PLX system into all those areas&mdash;and, of course, the business case for IMPACT.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/9">Let us now consider some of the costs of implementing this system. In my right hon. Friend's written answer of <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, she said, in respect of the limited roll-out of the PLX system to child abuse investigation units, that</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/10" class="indent">&quot;preliminary modelling carried out by the IMPACT Programme last year indicated that using the system and responding to requests for information generated by users in other forces could theoretically require up to 600 staff costing around &pound;11 million per annum across the 43 forces if the INI was deployed to, and used to its full extent by, all CAIUs&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 369W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/11">Therefore, the cost merely for the IPLX appears to be &pound;11 million, with, perhaps, an additional 600 staff. We should take into account the costs currently imposed on our police forces, especially in respect of the estimates for police force reorganisation. Some substantial sums are involved, which the forces themselves will have to pay. They have to fund the system; the money will not come down to them from the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/12">It should also be noted that what we are struggling to put in place is an interim solution. A system has been operational in Scotland since 1992, and the system implemented there in 1992 has now been superseded by what is known as the Scottish intelligence database.Sir Michael Bichard considered the system in Scotland a possibility. The original Bichard report stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The inability to deliver an effective national intelligence IT capability in England and Wales should be contrasted, unfavourably, with Scotland's performance, notwithstanding the differences in scale.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/14">He was referring to the Scottish intelligence database, which has been fully operational since 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/15">We must bear in mind that police forces in England and Wales have been considering having a national intelligence system since 1994. Scotland's was fully up and running in 2004. When Bichard first reported, the then chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Chris Fox, wrote to his opposite number in Scotland, Peter Wilson, to ask about the Scottish system and the possibility of rolling it out to England and Wales to satisfy recommendation 1 of the Bichard report. The reply that came from Scotland was that Scotland was happy to assist the police forces in England and Wales, and the system was offered to England and Wales at no cost for the duration of the roll-out. The only costs would be for the hardware to implement it, and for the commercial licence for the company that developed the software. The total cost was estimated to be &pound;55 million with a time scale for implementation of 13 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/16">That appears to me to have been good value, given some of the cost estimates that are currently floating about. The Home Office estimate of costs so far for IMPACT and the PLX system is about &pound;163 million. The Home Office second progress report of three months ago stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Full costs of delivering the complete IMPACT programme are still to be finalised and will depend on which delivery option and business approach are selected.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/18">Perhaps more importantly, if the Scottish option had been chosen, by now we would not have simply an interim measure, but the national database that Bichard recommended, and at a fraction of the cost. As things currently stand, we are years behind on that, and there are estimates that the total cost of that over the coming years will amount to &pound;2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/19">Why was the Scottish system and that Scottish offer declined by England and Wales? In relation to Scotland, Bichard said:</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/20" class="indent">&quot;At an early stage in determining what they wanted, ACPO asked their Scottish colleagues to provide a high-level project plan outlining an option for implementing the Scottish approach within the police service of England and Wales. It was subsequently agreed that England and Wales would independently develop their own user requirements and business processes to underpin the IMPACT programme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/21">He went on to say&mdash;he was addressing these remarks to the Home Secretary&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/22" class="indent">&quot;Your officials have pointed out, as indicated in the progress report, that SID provides a system for sharing developed intelligence and would not by itself provide either the wider information-sharing capability for which ACPO has identified a need, nor the modernisation of the Police National Computer (PNC). These are convincing arguments that persuade me to support the IMPACT programme.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/23">If I have one criticism of Bichard it is that he accepted that at face value from the Home Office. He never challenged it or asked for an explanation. There was no explanation as to the evaluation of the SID as against IMPACT, but Bichard took the Home Secretary at his word.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/24">Actually, that was not strictly true. The Scottish system can deal with both evaluated and non-evaluated intelligence. Evaluated intelligence is that which has provenance and can stand up in court. Non-evaluated intelligence is simply intelligence for which there is insufficient provenance or no provenance at all. The Scottish system can deal with both. When the Scottish system was set up, the decision was taken not to include non-evaluated intelligence, not because the technical requirements of the system could not meet that; that decision was taken for operational reasons&mdash;Scotland was not prepared to use, or did not want to use, non-evaluated intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/25">The Scottish system was recently augmented to provide a vetting and barring facility and that upgrade took two days. However, even as an interim measure and unadapted, the Scottish system would be preferable to the current situation. Where is the analysis that was undertaken on the Scottish system? Given that we approached the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland with a view to using the Scottish system, where is the assessment that caused ACPO to conclude that the system was not appropriate to its needs? Who made that technical assessment, particularly as there was still no business case available for IMPACT when the Scottish system was rejected?</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/26">There is another aspect to the Scottish system that I should mention. Scotland has a much smaller population than the UK. Perhaps there was a worry that the Scottish system might not roll out well enough across England and Wales because of size factors. However, at 13 months' availability and a cost of &pound;55 million, that system was worth a try, because it is a bit of a bargain, given the costs of the systems that we are considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/27">Given the cost of the Scottish system, we could have it as an interim measure, especially as IMPACT is now due in 2010, and perhaps even later. The business case is due to be produced next month, but even that is not certain. The cost estimate for IMPACT is about &pound;2 billion. In England and Wales, we were looking for a system that we would like; we had a bit of a wish-list of what we could put on a computer. That meant that we took our eye off our aim, which is to have a workable system in place. Three police forces in England and Wales are already inquiring into signing up to the Scottish system. Obviously, we face the problem that if enough forces sign up to the Scottish system, they will not want to use the PLX or IMPACT systems in future; they will be tied in to the Scottish system.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/28">There are concerns about IMPACT, too. IMPACT will use an incremental approach, which I have tried to explain. It will take one step at a time, across various levels of police intelligence. The system builds on CRISP, the cross-regional information-sharing protocol. CRISP was designed by Cumbria police force and is being offered to other forces throughout the country. CRISP is an information-sharing platform&mdash;not an intelligence-sharing platform&mdash;that is reliant on a number of other systems being in place to feed into that database. In other words, CRISP is a sharing platform a little bit like PLX: information has to be fed into it. That information comes from separate sections of police intelligence. The six most commonly quoted are intelligence, crime, custody, firearms, domestic violence and child protection. Those have to be fed in. Those systems have to be in place to feed into CRISP in order for CRISP to be developed as part of IMPACT.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/29">I mentioned firearms. We were promised a firearms database after Dunblane, but there is still no firearms database in this country. That is how long we have waited for the systems to be set up. Like so many other things, the firearms database that we were promised did not materialise.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/30">There are also problems of constant duplication, weeding data, data being left on the system without provenance, and the system needing to be cleaned up. The cost of cleaning the CRISP database has already reached &pound;9 million simply to weed out irrelevant or out-of-date information on it. It is untested and not universally used; I think that 38 out of 43 forces have signed up to CRISP, so some have still not signed up. As I say, some are considering the Scottish system. We are still no nearer to a national IT system, and the more we look into the matter, the more complicated it becomes. Both Bichard and the Home Office stressed in their reports the idea of compatibility of intelligence, and of the whole system working together. That was the whole idea behind the Bichard report in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/31">There is no definite cost for IMPACT. Not only does there seem to be little will to implement it as a matter of urgency, but it seems that the Government might be trying to distance themselves from the responsibility that they were initially charged with. I note that the Home Secretary, in the most recent statement on the issue, said</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/32" class="indent">&quot;the IMPACT programme . . . is now in place&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/33">That is a bald statement, made in the second progress report. IMPACT is not in place, and it is nowhere near being in place. We do not even have a business case for it. Nothing from Bichard's first two recommendations are in place. Looking at the progress report in detail and at the tables in it, I see that in the fine print the Home Secretary refers to IMPACT 2005, which has apparently been &quot;de-coupled&quot; from the main IMPACT project. So instead of having IMPACT, we now have IMPACT 2005. The small print says that IMPACT has been &quot;de-risked&quot;&mdash;whatever that means&mdash;and de-coupled, so it looks like there are two IMPACTs.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/34">Why do the Government want to separate the initial steps to developing IMPACT and bring in IMPACT 2005? It looks like the Government now want to use IMPACT 2005&mdash;that is, the PLX system that went out live in December, but only to child abuse units&mdash;as a way of meeting the Bichard recommendations. Their attitude is: &quot;We have done it; we have got PLX and have met the recommendation. That's over. Now let's go back to IMPACT, which is due sometime never in the future.&quot; My fear is that we are looking to say that we have met the Bichard recommendations by putting in place much less of a system than we initially had. If so, that is unacceptable, and we should look at the Scottish system again.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/35">Recommendation 1 did not call on the Government slowly to improve existing pre-Bichard systems over a number of years; no, Bichard recommended providing a basis for central intelligence that could be fully operational as a matter of urgency. We still have not got that. The extent of what is required is now beginning to dawn on the Government and the police forces. We are talking about a lot of money&mdash;billions of pounds&mdash;and it will take many years to develop the systems, given the complicated manner in which we are going about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.250.1/36">In conclusion, I ask the Minister to re-evaluate the Scottish intelligence database, and perhaps to publish assessments made at the time&mdash;if any were made&mdash;of the comparison between IMPACT and the Scottish system. Perhaps she will consider rolling out the Scottish system in England and Wales as an interim measure. Finally, I ask her and the Home Secretary to reconvene the Bichard inquiry and ask it to report again on where we are.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" name="Eric Illsley">the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley)</phrase> on securing this debate on a topical and important subject that certainly deserves more attention. All of us here are concerned about the subject of child protection and the safety of our children. That has been heightened recently by the revelations about the number of sex offenders and potential sex offenders working in the education system, including in our schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">We all recall the horrors of the murder of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells in the summer of 2003, for which Ian Huntley was convicted on <phrase class="date" code="2003-12-17">17 December 2003</phrase>. The Bichard report, which was produced in swift response to the questions that those horrible murders threw up, was out on <phrase class="date" code="2004-06-14">14 June 2004</phrase>. As the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central said, that is some 20 months ago. The public and our constituents are entitled to ask, particularly in the light of recent revelations about the dangers to children from people working in proximity to children, what on earth has happened in those 20 months to procure a system along the lines that Bichard recommended, or an alternative to it. When are we finally going to see some action?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3">The hon. Gentleman rightly raised a number of questions about what is happening and whether things are on track. There is great confusion about how we secure greater joined-up thinking and co-operation on matters concerning the safety of children. The Bichard report specifically raised concerns about the procedures for sharing information between police forces, and between those forces and other agencies, particularly social services. Recent revelations on sex offenders have revealed a plethora of data and an enormous amount of lists of people. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills revealed in her announcement last month that there are at least seven different lists dealing with people who are deemed dangerous to children.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">The sex offenders register currently lists 28,994 individuals, list 99 has 4,045 people and the Protection of Children Act 1999 register, set up in 2000, contains 1,285 names. Yesterday, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, made an announcement about a scheme for the vetting and registration of another 750,000 people involved in social care. We do not have any details about how exactly that will work. Under the Children Act 2004, a database of every child in this country&mdash;some 11.5 million children&mdash;was set up and is currently being put into practice. We seem to have an awful lot of information floating around the system. However, the Bichard report highlighted clearly, and recent revelations have reinforced the finding, that that information is either of low quality, is not being joined up, or is not being acted on&mdash;or there is a combination of all three things.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">The database of children set up under the 2004 Act highlights the problem. A database is only as good as the quality of the information put into it, and its usefulness will be determined only by the effectiveness of the mechanisms and protocols for joining up that information like a jigsaw and acting on it. That process relies on the quality, presence and numbers of professional staff working in the field. It relies on them to act on some of the concerns that may be flagged up from a database.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/6">The database of children, which seeks to include the names of and basic data concerning 11.5 million children in England, provides nothing short of an overload of poor-quality information. That was one reason that the Information Commissioner described some of the developments in information division and data sharing as</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/7" class="indent">&quot;sleepwalking into a surveillance society&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/8">Who goes on the lists that I have mentioned? Who monitors the quality of the information about the names on the list? Who maintains the accuracy of the names and the information, and who updates it? Where does the buck stop regarding acting on information being procured and brought together to flag a concern that needs to be acted on? In the Bichard inquiry, that is referred to as weeding, reviewing and deleting.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/9">I am concerned that the recent publicity about sex offenders has focused only on schools and teachers. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills has mentioned list 99 and the list created under the 1999 Act. She promised a rigorous review of how the lists worked and on the nature of sex offenders who have a record and may be working in proximity to children at the moment. She promised urgently to bring forward some of the recommendations in the Bichard inquiry, although we do not know which ones. However, we have not heard similar promises and guarantees of rigour from other Departments, particularly the Department of Health. What about other professionals working in the NHS? What about social workers, doctors, dentists, nurses, foster carers and youth workers? Potentially, other people, who may have some form of record contained in some of the lists, pose more of a danger than people working in education, on whom the review has focused so far. Yet the Government appear to be doing very little in all those other areas, which is a great concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/10">We need a proper joined-up approach, particularly given the different routes of recruitment for people into those areas, whether through local education authorities, primary care trusts, hospital trusts, social care trusts and children's services departments&mdash;there are different structures, particularly in the health service&mdash;or through private health care providers. All those organisations employ people who are potentially a danger to children and on whom some input from a national police database is essential in a joined-up approach to whatever other lists we have to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/11">There is a question about the use of staff from agencies, which has come up in a number of recent cases. Whose responsibility is it to check the background of teachers, nursing staff or social workers employed through agencies, a great many of whom are employed from overseas? It is much more difficult to check their backgrounds, yet we are hearing little about what measures the Government are taking urgently, or proposing to take, to ensure that all those people are properly checked and vetted, that those who are deemed inappropriate to work with children are not allowed to do so, that everybody is clear that that is the case and that every appropriate person has access to that information.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/12">We have been asking a lot of questions along those lines and the Government have been found wanting. In the House of Lords recently, Baroness Seccombe asked Lord Warner, the Minister for Health, how many people</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/13" class="indent">&quot;who have been cautioned . . . or convicted of a serious sexual offence are&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/14">working</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/15" class="indent">&quot;in the NHS&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i><phrase class="date" code="2006-01-25">25 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 677, c. 1183.]</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/16">Lord Warner had to say that he did not know and gave no assurances as to what steps are being taken to procure that information and to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/17">An article in the <i>Health Service Journal</i> last month said:</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/18" class="indent">&quot;Known sex offenders could be employed in front-line children's services for up to six months before their records are revealed&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/19">and</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Trusts have been using a fast-track system since 2002, which clears recruits against government black lists, but does not cross-reference with either the sex offenders register or local police information.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/21"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase> asked the Secretary of State for Health</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/22" class="indent">&quot;how many individuals whose names appear on the Protection of Children Act list and . . . Protection of Vulnerable Adults list are employed by . . . NHS organisations&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/23">The Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/24" class="indent">&quot;The Department does not hold information of the kind requested about NHS and social care employees.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 1864W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/25">The answer to my question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills about foster carers was that details of individual foster carers are not recorded centrally. Fostering service providers are required to consider a range of information but not necessarily to act on it or to bar people against whom there are serious question marks about their suitability for working with children. We have many concerns about the system not being joined up and there are still too many potential loopholes through which unsuitable people are gaining access to roles that bring them in proximity to children.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/26">There is a great deal of confusion at the moment and, therefore, a great deal riding on the findings of the Bichard report&mdash;and, more importantly, on the development of some of the recommendations that he makes to join up the services.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/27">There are three main issues. First, will the physical computer system proposed in the Bichard report, or being considered by the Home Office, work? Will it do the job that it is intended to do? Secondly, how will the quality of the information be monitored? A system is only as good as the quality of the information that goes into it. If you put rubbish in, you get rubbish out. Thirdly, will the system encourage and lead to joined-up action by all the relevant agencies and appropriate intervention when required?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/28">I turn briefly to the question of software. Few of us have confidence in the Government's IT procurement programmes; they have form on wasting a lot of money to achieve little. The recent revelations about the &pound;6.5 billion so far spent on an NHS IT programme that is well behind schedule, and that nobody is convinced will deliver, only reinforce that impression.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/29">For whom will this computer programme be designed? As we speak, police force structures are changing compulsorily against many people's will because of the Home Office's determination to regionalise police force structures. Only yesterday we had a debate, in which you took part, Mr. Taylor, on the similar issue of the restructuring of primary care trusts and other health service structures.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/30">Under PCT structures, there is now a requirement that a lead medical person should take responsibility for child protection measures. If we are agglomerating all the PCTs into bigger structures, will there be more lead people with responsibility for child protection? We do not know, but the issue does not get any smaller because PCTs or other health structures are being agglomerated. Will any computer system designed for the police take account of what the police force structure will look like if the Government have their way, or will that system be redundant before it comes into force?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/31">The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central mentioned that the police are planning a national police intelligence system, or IMPACT. It was originally developed by the Police Information Technology Organisation, in which I have very little confidence, given that it completely mauled what was a very good child rescue alert system, based on the American amber alert system. The system was piloted in my own area by Sussex police with a company called Child Rescue Alert. The Minister knows of it because I took a delegation to see her about it. Three years ago, it was up and running and ready to be rolled out nationwide. However, that did not happen; the system was completely sat on by PITO and the Home Office. Today we have no equivalent system for alerting the police at an early stage to the disappearance of young children. That is an absolute scandal, and largely down to the internal politics of the Home Office and PITO.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/32">Responsibility for IMPACT then passed to the Home Office. As the hon. Gentleman said, the original estimate&mdash;that it would be completed by 2007 on a budget of &pound;160 million&mdash;is looking very fanciful indeed. The hon. Gentleman mentioned the Scottish system. What is being asked for is not rocket science. Alternatives are available now that are not being sought, even as an interim measure. We need to address the problem urgently now. That is the big concern. Will the Minister say what firm decisions have so far been taken about the form that such a computer system will take and when we are likely to see it?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/33">The next issue is that of monitoring quality. Putting the names of 11.5 million children, the vast majority of whom are not at risk at all, on a national database of children is a singularly pointless idea. That proposal was put forward in the Children Bill, and I led for our side and argued that we really needed a national database of vulnerable children. The more obvious candidates as vulnerable children, in respect of whom there are concerns about domestic violence&mdash;they may be looked-after children on the child protection register&mdash;should be placed on a national database, so that cross-referencing can take place. I also suggested that we needed a national database of people who have caused concern and who work with children, and that that should be properly joined-up and properly linked into a police database system.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/34">We recently heard about the scandal of the something like 40,000 children whose DNA is on a central database held by the police, even though none of them has committed any offences. At the moment, the Government seem terribly good at collecting information about the wrong people, but not at collecting and acting on information about the people we should be most concerned about. During the debates on the Children Bill, some of us argued that there should be a national database of people whose suitability for working with children caused concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/35">It may not be uncommon for foster carers working for an authority in, say, Newcastle&mdash;to pluck an area out of the air&mdash;to have standards well below those required of foster carers. Their actions against children may not quite have merited a criminal prosecution. Alternatively, there might not have been sufficient evidence to prosecute. Those foster carers may then do a flit, turn up, say, in Brighton and present themselves as potential foster carers to the Brighton unitary authority, which may be desperately short of foster carers. They may then lie about their background and be taken on. There needs to be a national database through which Brighton could, in that case, automatically cross-check with a national database that would route it back to the director of social services in Newcastle, who would say, &quot;Hold on, you should be wary about taking these people on&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/36">Sex offenders are notoriously good at covering their tracks. I spent an afternoon at the paedophile unit at Scotland Yard. The ways in which paedophiles use technology to cover their tracks on the internet as they download images are incredible and constantly one step ahead of the authorities. That is why it is so difficult to catch them.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/37">Criminal Records Bureau checks have great merit and the Government have relied heavily on them. However, such checks are very soon out of date and only present a snapshot. Many paedophile cases, including those that came to light in my own constituency, have involved people being investigated by police because of suspicions at one school. In the meantime, they had gained employment in other schools in neighbouring authorities. At that point, those people had not committed a criminal offence, but they were under severe suspicion.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/38">We urgently need a joined-up police record system that draws together all the strands of information gathered by the police and that can be accessed by the appropriate people easily and urgently. The people running it should talk to all the appropriate agencies, be they social services, education departments, children's services departments, GPs or the wider health sector. That is simply not happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/39">I turn to the issue of joined-up action. The Children Act 2004 set up local safeguarding children boards, a key component of which, as set out in section 10(4)(b), is:</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/40" class="indent">&quot;the chief officer of police for a police area any part of which falls within the area of the . . . authority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/41">The police are plugged into that whole system; police input is absolutely essential. The police must share the information among other forces and agencies. However, we are dependent also on the professionals in the field then carrying out the intervention work required. We know how desperately short we are of child protection and social workers in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/42">Also relevant is the issue of confidentiality. We hope that the 2004 Act has made it much easier for the different agencies to talk to each other, share the information and decide who will act on it and whose responsibility it is. One of the ramifications of the Bichard proposals is greater compulsion, particularly on health professionals, to reveal information about minors. We all want to make sure that minors are protected from predatory sexual advances, but there is another side to the issue. I gather that the measure was recently piloted in Sheffield. Many people within the health community there boycotted it because it obliged people working in sexually transmitted diseases clinics&mdash;genito-urinary medicine clinics, for example&mdash;automatically to report to police if a minor came to them with a sexually transmitted disease and to report details of the partner from whom it had been contracted, if those were known.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/43">If an adult is preying on a 12-year-old or 13-year-old, that will, of course, raise serious concerns. There are procedures whereby people working in the clinics already make a judgment about whether there is a clear danger to the child and whether the case should be reported to the police. Under the compulsion that will apparently be required&mdash;this was revealed in the press earlier this week&mdash;doctors and other health workers will have to reveal all those details. Some of the implications might be that people will not present at some of the clinics, minors will have sexually transmitted diseases and other problems untreated, and nobody will be made aware that they might be in an inappropriate sexual relationship. We must take care to get the right balance between confidentiality and ensuring that those people who it is inappropriate to allow near children are barred from being near children.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/44">As it stands, the whole system is a mess. The Government have been good at setting up new committees, tsars and structures, but all those things must be joined up. They are only as good as the information with which they are provided and the professionals that they have at their disposal to implement what needs to be done to protect children. We need such a system urgently; we need it now, because 20 months after the issues were flagged up clearly in the Bichard report is already too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/45">I hope that the Government will give us a clear indication today about when they will get their act together and when we will get some results at long last.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" name="Eric Illsley">the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley)</phrase>, to whom I am grateful for his clear explanation of many of the issues and much of the terminology relating to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/2">The broader debate is an upsetting one for those of us who are parents and who think about the risk to our own children. We all remember with sadness what happened to Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells and hope that their deaths might at least have led indirectly to improved safety for other children, such as our own.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/3">It has also been upsetting that this debate, which has a critical need for the kind of clear-headed arguments put forward by the hon. Gentleman, has often been clouded by media hysteria and headlines such as &quot;Pervs . . . rife in our schools&quot;. For the record, I do not think that pervs are rife in our schools. It is important that in that kind of climate we avoid a culture of total suspicion about anyone who works with children in any context. We must have the courage to defend civil liberties as the process goes onwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/4">It is also upsetting that a &pound;167 million database&mdash;the IMPACT system&mdash;recommended as a matter of urgency by Sir Michael Bichard, is potentially delayed from even 2007 to 2010. There have been a couple of unfortunate instances of Ministers spinning the delivery timetable. The Secretary of State for Education and Skills said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase> that no one thinks that 18 months is excessive for the combining of four computer systems into one. As someone whose professional career has some background in database systems, I would go along with that. However, we are not talking about 18 months any more, but about four years. That seems excessive for what is essentially an information system. Similarly, the Home Secretary said in his introduction to the Bichard inquiry recommendations second progress report in November that the IMPACT system was &quot;in place&quot;. It clearly is not in place. It might have achieved some of its milestones but it is not in place on a national scale. As the hon. Gentleman said, there is also the case of the police local cross-checking system, which was supposed to be more of an interim measure and was supposed to be in place by 2005. The implementation has been put back until at least November 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/5">Having said all that, I have some sympathy for the Minister. There is clearly an endemic problem in the implementation of Government IT systems. There is a catalogue of examples: the collapse of the 1999 benefit collection swipe card system, which left &pound;571 million to be written off by the Post Office alone, leaving aside other partners in that system; the probation service system was &pound;22 million over budget and was also late; the 2001 system for speeding up asylum applications had to be abandoned; and, as almost every hon. Member will know, the Child Support Agency's new &pound;456 million system still seems to be contributing to huge delays in sorting out child support cases, and leading to underpayments and to a lack of payments to single parents who are trying to cope with raising their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.0/6">There is an endemic problem and a lack of responsiveness by Government. In my experience, there is responsiveness to problems in the charity and business sector&mdash;</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.262.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1904" speakername="Dan Norris" colnum="262"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h01.htm#60208h01_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.262.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not accept that computer system delays, overruns and higher costs are not unique to Government? Such things happen in most well known and well established public sector companies in the UK and in international companies&mdash;even in some American companies. This is not unique to Government.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.262.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" speakername="Martin Horwood" colnum="262"  time="010:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h01.htm#60208h01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.262.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. The problems are not unique, but the question is how we respond to the threats. When I was involved in database projects, I had a rule of thumb that it could more or less be assumed that at some point one would be faced with the threat of the timetable trebling and the budget doubling. Already, the timetable for the IMPACT database looks as if it will double, and presumably at some point we will hear that the budget will exceed &pound;200 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/2">The questions is: how do we respond? In a national charity of the kind for which I worked or in business there is an immediate imperative, because such delays or cost increases cannot be afforded. Companies would simply go under in those circumstances. We have to look at remedial action. In the case of increasing complexity, which is one of the excuses for the delays in the IMPACT system, such action might to be to consider whether it is appropriate to stick to a specification based on that or whether it should be based on greater simplicity.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/3">One of the important elements of the IMPACT system appears to be a virtual information network, described in the Home Office document to which I referred earlier as</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/4" class="indent">&quot;providing forces with the ability to interrogate information held nationally via a virtual national information network based on advanced data search and analysis software&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/5">To me, that sounds like a relatively simple element that might deliver a huge benefit. The 80&ndash;20 rule might apply: with 20 per cent. of the effort put in, one might get 80 per cent. of the benefit from just that one element. That might not be correct, but the Home Office needs to review whether prioritising the simpler, more effective elements of the system might allow it to achieve considerable progress. That is how business might respond to the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/6">Another possible solution is to add in more resources. In my experience, that is rarely the best solution. If we are facing enormous delays, do Government need to consider providing the Home Office with more resources to tackle the problem? There is also the possibility of considering whether we have the right solution. The hon. Gentleman pointed out the speed and cost-effectiveness of the Scottish intelligence database as a possible alternative. It is never too late to ask, &quot;Have we got the right solution or is an alternative staring us in the face?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/7">It is news to me that the Scottish intelligence database system is capable of incorporating soft intelligence data. If right, that is an important piece of information that the Government need to take on board. As I understand it, one of the principal reasons why the Scottish system was not simply taken as a potential roll-out for the UK as a whole related to that. They need to consider that carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/8">All of this matters because, as Sir Michael Bichard pointed out, Humberside may not be alone in its failings in intelligence. That means that Ian Huntley might be far from the only person who slipped through that net. Some of the statements in the Bichard inquiry are enough to make one's hair stand on end. It was stated that there was a</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/9" class="indent">&quot;widespread failure to appreciate the value of intelligence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/10">Another statement was that there was</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/11" class="indent">&quot;not one single occasion in all of the contacts with Huntley when the record creation system worked as it should have done.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/12">The process of creating records in Humberside's main intelligence system was described as &quot;fundamentally flawed&quot;. The guidance and training given to officers were &quot;inadequate&quot;. There was</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/13" class="indent">&quot;little evidence of sufficient strategic review of information management systems and no real awareness among senior managers of the scale and nature of the problems&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/14">That might still be the situation in some forces, and it might be allowing people to slip through the net. There are therefore extremely serious issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/15">Some things in the Government's approach are, however, to be welcomed. Obviously, we would support all their efforts to improve the situation in the light of Bichard and of recent debates, including, in particular, those directed at the Department for Education and Skills. We look forward to the new measures to ensure that any individual who is convicted of, or cautioned for, sex offences against children will be added to list 99. We also hope that that list will replace the current confusion of lists to become the definitive reference point.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/16">In <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1662" name="Edward Davey">the House, my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr. Davey)</phrase> welcomed the setting up of an expert panel to take all barring decisions. There is a slight risk that that might be seen as absolving Ministers of responsibility and removing the potential embarrassment of taking such decisions, but they will ultimately remain Ministers' responsibility. The involvement of an expert panel under Sir Roger Singleton would be a welcome development. We also welcome the fact that the Government accepted all 31 of the Bichard inquiry's original recommendations and that they have, by our count, implemented 13 of them and are planning to implement the other 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/17">However, important worries are still being raised. The hon. Member for Barnsley, Central referred to the language that is creeping into some of the Government's reports on progress, and I have to say that talk of &quot;de-coupling&quot; and &quot;de-risking&quot; obscures whether progress is being made. The language used in progress reports is important and needs to add to their clarity, not to the confusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/18">The hon. Gentleman also mentioned the important issue of the deletion of intelligence, which was a critical failing in dealing with the Huntley case. Intelligence was deleted in Humberside. The issue is not that intelligence was shared with another force, leading to problems over its provenance, but the mere fact that that intelligence was deleted at all. If it had not been shared with another force, it would have been lost altogether, which would clearly be an extremely serious issue. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">the hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> said, a database is only as good as the information in it, so it is important that we avoid deleting accurate and appropriate intelligence from any system.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/19">As the hon. Gentleman also noted, there are questions about whether all professionals working with children will be subject to the same vetting requirements. A lot of attention has been paid to schools, but does that include independent schools, for instance? Does it, as the hon. Gentleman said, include foster carers or NHS social care professionals?</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/20">There is the question of whether guidance and training will be put in place to safeguard professionals from false and inaccurate allegations. That issue has to be raised in the present climate of sometimes rather hysterical attitudes towards child protection. The rights of the children remain paramount, but the civil liberties of professionals whose careers are at risk are also important.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/21">There is the question, particularly for the Home Office, of whether cautioning policy needs to be reviewed in the light of Bichard. Indeed, given some of the examples brought to me by my constituents, I wonder whether there is a case for a general review of cautioning policy and its operation. The Home Office, or perhaps the Home Affairs Committee, might take that up at some stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/22">I, too, would ask whether the planned restructuring of police forces is contributing to the delay with the IMPACT system. Presumably, the initial plan was based on a 43-force model and it might now have to be delayed while the police force data systems are reorganised and reshuffled in the new reorganised and regionalised police force model.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/23">The Government therefore have delicate balances to strike and urgent and important work to do. It is important that they should not be criticised for project delays and complexities that would present the same problems to an Administration of any political colour. However, I hope that they accept the urgent imperative to take remedial action where delays threaten to undermine the safety of our children. If they do, they will have our support.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" name="Eric Illsley">the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley)</phrase> on securing the debate, which follows the appallingly tragic murders in Soham. The Bichard report illuminated a whole range of poor procedures, poor record-keeping and poor professional standards. What struck me most was the blind acceptance on the part of some social workers that it was not only the norm, but acceptable for many of the girls they were supposed to be looking after&mdash;especially working-class girls&mdash;to have abusive relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/2">I shall not deal in great detail with all the report's recommendations, because the hon. Gentleman focused particularly on the national database. However, I should like to mention three other issues. First, there is the question of overseas personnel who wish to work with children. Bichard found that many countries provide data only on the convictions of those from overseas who work with children and that they provide that data only to the data subject, not to organisations such as the Criminal Records Bureau. There is co-operation with Canada and Australia, and Bichard urged the Government to speed up the development of bilateral agreements with other countries or of EU-wide arrangements. He suggested that EU proposals might be taken forward as part of the UK presidency, and I should like the Minister to tell us whether they were and what the outcome was. Bichard also noted that even if such arrangements were agreed, they</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/3" class="indent">&quot;could take several years to set up . . . Even then the failure to exchange intelligence . . . means a real risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/4">He recommended that we engage in discussions to achieve an exchange of intelligence. What is happening in that respect and what are the prospects? There are about 12,000 overseas teachers in this country, and we do not have the same level of information on them all as we do on teachers who come from this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/5">The second issue relates to recommendation 19, which deals with arrangements requiring those who work with children and vulnerable adults to be registered. One recommendation was that parents should be able to check easily whether a potential music teacher, for example, is on a barred list. Sir Michael said that that would be feasible, but a recent parliamentary answer to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1785" name="James Duddridge">my hon. Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend, East (James Duddridge)</phrase> suggested that it is certainly not feasible yet. The Department merely advises parents</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/6" class="indent">&quot;to check the background of home tutors by requesting references and checking a tutor's registration with the relevant General Teaching Council.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 1970W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/7">It also advises them to have an adult present when such home tuition takes place. Again, I ask the Minister when that will be implemented.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/8">Sir Michael said that employers should be notified if new information becomes available about those who are already employed, but it is not clear when that will be implemented. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/9" class="indent">&quot;I accept that it will not be impossible to implement the barring scheme any earlier than 2007.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/10">The upgraded police computer with the full police local cross-checking system will not be available until the end of 2006, so are those still realistic delivery dates? What are the legislative and procurement milestones? Have they been met? Bichard gave a very clear warning:</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Along with IMPACT, the new barring scheme represents the most difficult challenge arising from my recommendations. The current proposals . . . need to be very effectively project-managed&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/12">but I am sorry to say that there is not a great deal of evidence that IMPACT is being effectively project-managed.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/13">We then come to the question of whether to inform police of offences that have been committed, or which it is suspected have been committed, against children. That relates to recommendations 13 to 15, to which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> referred. Bichard said that he was</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/14" class="indent">&quot;pleased to have been told that this&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/15">the new guidance to be developed under the Children Act 2004&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/16" class="indent">&quot;has been brought forward to December 2005.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/17">In other words, it would be available in December 2005. Yet, on Monday, the <i>Daily Mail </i>said that health workers spoke as if the guidance was still being developed. It said that they had discretion to contact police if they were concerned for a child's safety, and mentioned the proposed guidance, which would make it compulsory for GPs, social workers and nurses to inform police if a girl of 13 or under begins a sexual relationship, even if she says that it is consensual. Can the Minister tell us whether the target date of December 2005 for publication of the guidance was met, or is the guidance still in preparation?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/18">What will be in the guidance? I emphasise, for the benefit of my hon. Friend, that Bichard said that it is clear that some health professionals are resisting the clearest possible recommendations that either those who commit sex offences should be reported, or the reason for non-reporting should be noted. He also observed that the clarity and lack of ambiguity in the existing guidance is valued by many, especially the police, but added that it was clear that professional judgment was being used to act outside the guidance. He was not saying that everybody should be prosecuted, or even that everybody should be reported; he was saying that the reason for every decision should be recorded. After all, the Children Act 2004 laid down a duty to co-operate for the best protection of young people. While it might be in the interests of one young person that her partner be not reported, it might not be in the interests of other young people that somebody who has a habit of having relationships with young girls should not be reported. Therefore, I hope that that recommendation, too, is followed up effectively in the new guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/19">Finally, I come to the national intelligence system. I will not repeat everything that the hon. Member for Barnsley, Central said so effectively. However, Bichard spoke of the full business case for the programme that was due to be considered by the Home Office investment board in March 2005. Now, we realise that the full business case has still not been published, even though last March the target remained September 2007. With the best will in the world, it is impossible to believe that the project can be implemented by 2007 when the business case is not now due to be set out until March of this year. Bichard was assured that the delay in presenting the final business case to the Home Office investment board would not delay its ultimate delivery. Well, it has now slipped, as hon. Members have said, to some point in 2010, according to the second progress report, so we need to ask not why things have slipped but what the Government are doing to ensure that they slip no further, and what remedial or temporary action they are taking to ensure that an adequate system is in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/20">That brings me to the Scottish system, which had the support of the Police Federation and the Police Superintendents Association, albeit not, at the beginning, of the Association of Chief Police Officers. However, as the hon. Gentleman said, it was not at all clear why ACPO did not support the Scottish system, and Bichard did not inquire as to why that was the case. Now, I understand, when police forces in England wish to subscribe to the Scottish system&mdash;I thought that one or two had already done so, although the hon. Gentleman says that three are thinking of doing so, including Cumbria and Merseyside&mdash;the Home Office is advising them not to do so. That is because it has its own scheme in its back pocket, ready to bring out with a flourish one day, some time, near, in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/21">As if &quot;guidance&quot; from the Home Office were not enough, the Government have said that they will pay. Why would anybody else want to take the trouble to prepare a new system or pay for one when the Home Office has promised to come up with the money at some time in the future? The hon. Gentleman started by saying that we are barely any closer than we were 20 months ago. The Scottish system was offered to England and Wales. Can the Minister tell us specifically why it was rejected and, even more importantly now, why it is not acceptable as an interim measure? Why is it unacceptable for English forces to sign up to the Scottish system as an interim measure until IMPACT is available?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/22">I suspect that the answer to those questions is, sadly, the not made here syndrome. That is the attitude&mdash;held in England in general and the Home Office in particular&mdash;that says that if it is Scottish it must be worse. The Government and ACPO want a Rolls-Royce, preferably one built on home ground, but we are being offered a BMW. I do not see that a BMW is much worse in this circumstance, particularly given that it is available today, and I would caution against going for the perfect model&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Even if it is German built&mdash;we are talking about a Scottish-built model, and I shall not try to compare the two. We should not try to put every conceivable bell and whistle on a system if that means delaying the implementation of the system and leaving children at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/23">We have heard of vanity publishing. I suspect that what the Home Office is indulging in is vanity computing, and I fear that we will be left with yet another example in the long line of Government computer projects that do not work.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/24">The hon. Gentleman made one or two other points, and I shall repeat them very quickly. Who made the decision to rule out the Scottish intelligence database, and when? Do the Government still intend to provide a national firearms database, and when? Will Bichard continue to report on the speed with which IMPACT or its substitute&mdash;I believe that it should look again at the SID&mdash;is implemented?</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/25">However much this Houses tighten the rules, we should never believe that Government action, local or national, is a substitute for parents and, in the case of schools, head teachers, exercising vigilance and good judgment. While all sex offences are serious, some are more serious than others. Thankfully&mdash;and we ought to make this clear to parents&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.268.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1802" speakername="Hazel Blears" speakeroffice="The Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety"  colnum="268"  time="010:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h01.htm#60208h01_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.268.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1384" name="Eric Illsley">my hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central (Mr. Illsley)</phrase> on having raised this important issue and, in particular, on having provided the detailed information that has been of such benefit to all Members who have spoken. We have heard some good contributions, and I shall do my utmost to respond to all the issues that have been raised. However, they have involved a great deal of detail, ranging from the computer issue to matters that affect other Departments, including the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health. If I do not address every issue, I undertake to give further information in writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/2">I reaffirm at the outset that the Government remain fully committed to the implementation of all the Bichard recommendations and to ensuring that the resources are provided to enable that implementation to take place. We do not see Bichard as a matter of simply ticking the 31 boxes of the recommendations. It is important that we implement all of them, but I see Bichard more as a challenge to the police service's management of information and intelligence, and an opportunity to review our business processes. It uses technology as a catalyst to redesign the way in which information and intelligence are shared, in order to enhance the operational capability of the police service&mdash;not simply to protect vulnerable people, whether children or adults&mdash;and its criminal operational capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/3">The Bichard recommendations&mdash;the development of IMPACT and the interim steps along the way&mdash;are among the most significant things that have happened to our police service in the past few decades, and I hope that they will provide a firm foundation for the way in which the police service manages information and intelligence and uses its capability in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/4">As hon. Members have said, the Bichard recommendations followed from the tragic circumstances of the Soham case. We are all acutely aware of that; it is one reason why we are absolutely determined to ensure, as far as we can, that those circumstances are eliminated from our system. No Government can give an absolute guarantee that a piece of information will not go through the system, but we want to ensure that it is as tight as possible to ensure that that does not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/5">Hon. Members talked about Government computer programmes in general. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1494" name="Martin Horwood">The hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> mentioned several computer programmes that we have not delivered on time and to budget, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1904" name="Dan Norris">my hon. Friend the Member for Wansdyke (Dan Norris)</phrase> said that that is not unique to Government projects and that it happens in the private sector as well. There have been difficulties, but the Government have a good record on programmes relating to the Passport and Records Agency and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, which now work extremely well. I was pleased to hear the supportive comments of the hon. Gentleman that these matters are difficult to manage and that developments do occur. That is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/6">When we first got the Bichard recommendations, the time scale was that we would implement the IMPACT programme by 2007. However, we then set up a programme team and considered the scope of the recommendations, and concluded that if we are in the serious business of not simply providing a technological database but redesigning our business processes and coming up with a new way in which to manage information, that is a bigger programme that will take longer to implement in full. That did not stop us from saying that we will have a series of interim incremental programmes to ensure that we strengthen the system at every level as we go through to 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/7">We said that there would be an interim local PLX system so that the Criminal Records Bureau can be alerted to information held by other forces, and that was put in place earlier last year. We said that an interim nominal index with which forces would be able to access searches by name against the six business areas of the other forces would be implemented by December 2005, which it was. The system is now available in the child abuse investigation units in each of the 43 forces. It has been put into those units first because child protection is at the centre of our concerns. When we appraise the system towards the end of this month, we will look to roll it out across the other units and offices in every force so that they will be able to search the index across the areas of crime, domestic violence, firearms and child protection. This is the first time that forces have had the ability to search across other force areas. In one case, a family moved to an area and there was some concern about a grandparent who was caring for a child. The force in the area into which the family moved was able to search against that name and to get information.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/8">When a new system is introduced, there is a huge demand to use it, so it is right that we should phase in the roll-out. My hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley, Central pointed out that there will be an increased demand and that 600 extra staff and &pound;11 million will be needed to service that demand. We are talking about a new operational capability that the police have never had before, which they will welcome because it will enable them to have more intelligence and, hopefully, catch more criminals. It will enable them to do the work that they want to do and to protect vulnerable children and families, but it needs to be phased in.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/9">My hon. Friend talked about the Scottish system. I understand that it was considered initially, but was thought by the Association of Chief Police Officers not to be suitable because it is predicated on the use of intelligence rather than information; there is a difference. My hon. Friend rightly said that intelligence is information that has been evaluated and assessed. ACPO wants access to the millions of pieces of information, not just intelligence, that can enhance the operational capability of the police to do the job that they need to do. I am informed that it would be extremely difficult, at this stage, to reprogramme the Scottish database to take information as well as intelligence.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/10">My hon. Friend recognised that the Scottish system deals with a smaller number of forces and a smaller population than any system that is introduced for England and Wales will have to deal with. We must question whether the use of the Scottish system as another interim measure, at an estimated &pound;55 million, would be a good investment, because it would not bring us any closer to our goals of being able to use all our information across eight business areas, not just the current six, and of shared intelligence. I understand the strength of feeling about the Scottish system, and I know that officials have met the people who are responsible for designing it, so it is not simply a matter of us closing our minds, but there are real difficulties with seeking another temporary, interim solution when we need to build on the current system until 2010 when the IMPACT system is fully operational.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1944" name="Tim Loughton">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> rightly expressed concern about the safety of children and adults, and said that we need a joined-up approach. I hope that I have convinced him that we are trying to have a joined-up approach. It would be relatively easy&mdash;I say that, but technology is never relatively easy&mdash;simply to have a computer, but if business processes and the way in which information is used are not redesigned, a joined-up approach will not be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/12">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the quality of information use. In November, we published a code of practice for the police on managing information. We are still working on the detailed guidance that will underpin that code of practice, which will be published by April. The guidance will go into immense detail about the way in which information should be managed and about inputs, because, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, if we put rubbish in we will get rubbish out. Making sure that all forces and other partners abide by the code of practice on information-sharing is a new development for the police service to ensure that there is quality in the way in which we take that forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1654" name="Andrew Turner">The hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr. Turner)</phrase> asked about the timetable. The full PLX functionality is due to be delivered by November 2007, and the police national computer will be replaced by 2010, but if we need to make interim improvements to the police national computer, we will consider taking that decision earlier if we can. All of these issues will be considered in the business case, which will be fully appraised in March. We are committed to that time scale; I am informed that the business case will definitely come and will be fully considered. No doubt my hon. Friend will press me to ensure that the time scale is complied with.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/14">I can tell from the sense of the debate that hon. Members appreciate the complexity and wide-ranging nature of the steps being taken to implement the Bichard recommendations. I am as determined as any Member in the House that we should make swift progress on this matter because we have to protect the public, but I am also determined that our decisions will be properly considered and measured. We will consider cost, impact and value for money, because, as has rightly been said, there is a history of such projects not being delivered in the right time scale or with the right functionality.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/15">The programme is ambitious. Members have talked about the role of Sir Michael Bichard. He has been hugely helpful in getting a sense of momentum behind the programme, but now wants to step back and be an interested observer&mdash;I think that is the phrase he used in his report. He has been kept up to date with the launch of the PLX system and the IMPACT nominal index system and he will be kept informed of the development of the vetting and barring system that the Department for Education and Skills will bring forward in legislation in the next few weeks, so he will remain an important factor in this programme. Now that we have the programme team, that is the way in which we want to progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.2/16">I appreciate entirely my hon. Friend's strength of feeling on this issue. He has a huge degree of expertise and I have no doubt that in the months and, hopefully, years to come he will continue to have a real interest in making sure that we get the best system for our police service to be able to protect people in this country. I know that he has the highest motives and that he wants to ensure that we get excellent value for money out of the significant Government investment that we will make over the next few years to ensure that the system works.</p>

	Meals on Wheels (Lancashire)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.272.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" colnum="272"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h02.htm#60208h02_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.272.1/1">May I say what a great event it is to come to this Room for a debate? This is the first time that I have taken part in a debate here, and I am happy to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor. I am pleased to have secured the debate, because it is on the very important subject of meals on wheels in Lancashire. We are also talking about meals on wheels throughout the country, because the danger is that, when one local authority does something to save money, that is replicated by other authorities for the same reason. I thank my hon. Friend the Minister for giving up his time to respond to the debate. We must ensure that we get on the record the situation in Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/2">Meals on wheels is a service that works very well in Lancashire, delivering hot meals to pensioners and usually vulnerable pensioners at that. It is a crying shame that we have to have this debate because there is a proposal to reduce the county council's costs by &pound;1.2 million by withdrawing the subsidy for meals on wheels. I believe that the service provides good value and I would like to think that the council will reverse the decision and ensure that the subsidy remains.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/3">At present, the cost of delivering a hot meal in Chorley is &pound;2.20. In other areas of the county, it is less than that. Of course the service is not just about receiving a hot meal; it is also about the person delivering the meal taking time out to have a chat with the recipient. That is so important. We are talking about the value not only of the hot meal, but of the visit&mdash;the value of being able to talk to someone and that person taking notice of the person to whom they are delivering the meal. The person delivering the meal acts almost as a social worker or health visitor, because they check on the well-being of the recipient and if something is not right, that will be reported.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/4">In a county council meeting, someone said that the meals were delivered on the doorstep. They are not; they have to be delivered to the person in the home. I must clear that up straight away. The service is so important that the cost should not matter. Of course we need value for money but, as I said, we are talking about the most vulnerable members of society. It is the people who are genuinely the poorest, the most vulnerable and the least able to look after themselves who need this valuable service. However, the benefit of meals on wheels is not just the hot meals; there is a social and welfare aspect to the service, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/5">The meals in Chorley and throughout Lancashire are delivered in general by the Women's Royal Voluntary Service. Age Concern also delivers meals, but in Chorley it is the WRVS that does so. I should declare an interest: my wife delivers meals on wheels in the Chorley area with the WRVS. The WRVS delivers 100,000 meals a year, with 700 volunteers engaged throughout the county. The volunteers do not simply deliver meals; they act as a point of contact, which is so valuable.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/6">I was dragged in to help on a snowy day when people were struggling to deliver meals and I saw that even those who were not taking a meal enjoyed the visit. The fact that people took time out to have a few words with them mattered so much. I have witnessed at first hand the value of such contact. If someone wants their chair pulled up to the table, the person delivering the meal can do that for them and help in many other ways. We can tell that pensioners like that by the way in which they respond to the service. At Christmas, they give the people who deliver the meals chocolates, because they respect what is being done. They value the service so much.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/7">I wonder how on earth the county council has got itself to the point that it has with the proposal that we are discussing. If we consider what the WRVS does, we see that the issue should not be all about financial savings. In fact, we should be asking the WRVS how it does such a good job and how we can enhance the service. Instead, we hear people say, &quot;There is an alternative. We will employ a company to deliver a freezer and people can have seven meals.&quot; The price will be more than the price of the hot meal that they are already receiving: it will cost more for a frozen meal than a hot meal and there will be the running costs for the freezer. Heating the meal, which will also involve costs, poses its own dangers. People may struggle to do so. They will have to cook a meal from frozen and ensure that it is cooked properly. We all know the consequences of not getting that right.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/8">Who will go round and check that things are okay? How much will it cost to check on pensioners and the vulnerable? Will that mean more social workers and more home visits? What if someone does not cook a meal properly? What will be the cost of that? We all know what the consequences will be. All the value that people get from a hot meal could disappear and their nutrition could be affected. There will be a reduction in social contact, which could lead to a deterioration in people's well-being and a subsequent reduction in healthiness. Those are real issues that pensioners in Lancashire will face if the proposal is implemented. Who will carry out regular assessments, which are currently done every day? We have not heard anything from the county council about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/9">Of course, when a service begins to be withdrawn, it ebbs away continuously. People may say, &quot;There wasn't much uptake of frozen meals&quot; or, &quot;We still offered a hot meal, didn't we?&quot; The fact is that it will be so much dearer for a hot meal to be delivered that pensioners will not be able to afford that. They will be priced out of the market. Therefore, the proposal should not be implemented and certainly not for the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/10">In a debate some three years ago, we argued against the closure of county care homes. We were told at the time, &quot;You've got this wrong. The view has changed. People do not want care homes any more. We want to support people in their own homes, which will enable them to enjoy a better quality of life.&quot; Three years later, that does not ring true, because part of supporting people in their own homes is ensuring that the hot meals service that they are enjoying at the moment continues to be provided. In fact, we should perhaps have been considering how to reduce the cost to pensioners of a hot meal. That would have been a better way forward. Care homes in the county have been closed and boarded up. At the same time, pensioners must have begun to wonder what the county council meant about supporting people in their own homes. I certainly wonder.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/11">I have been challenged on the matter in the press by the county council, which is always an interesting experience. The issue is not only hot meals; there have been proposals relating to libraries and proposals to reduce the provision of educational psychologists and welfare officers. One of the county councillors challenged me to say where the cuts should be made. I did not think that it was my job to consider the budget of the county council, but if it is serious, I do not mind helping out and having a look at the budget for the council. The challenge is to find something to cut, but I do not believe that we should be cutting front-line services. If &pound;4 million can be spent on consultants, perhaps we ought to prune things there. If we are talking about &pound;1.2 million and we are spending &pound;4 million on consultants, perhaps we should reduce that to &pound;2.8 million. That could be a better way forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, since the unitary authorities of Blackburn and Blackpool were created, county hall has remained the same size and the county council has enhanced its estate by taking on other buildings. Perhaps that is where it should be looking, rather than cutting this vital service.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.1/1">We should not be cutting front-line services, which is what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/2">Not only is there the challenge of looking at the budget and finding the cuts, but the other claim is, &quot;It's the Government's fault. They don't give us enough money.&quot; I always agree to campaign to get more money and support grants to the county council. I will always support that. That is not a problem. But we must reflect a little on just what the county council has had. In 2001&ndash;02, there was a 5.6 per cent. increase in the grant; in 2002&ndash;03, a 3.7 per cent. increase; in 2003&ndash;04, a 5.4 per cent. increase; and in 2004&ndash;05, a 13 per cent. increase. This year, the increase is 3.1 per cent. We all know that the retail price inflation average has been 2.6 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/3">There has been a huge increase in Government grants&mdash;higher than inflation&mdash;yet at the same time, from 2001 to now, we have seen a 22 per cent. increase in council tax. Things do not quite add up. Of course I will support the council's call for more money, but we must reflect on how generous the Government have been, as well as recognising that this is one of the highest county council taxes in the country. If the council is collecting extra money&mdash;more money from the Government and from council tax payers&mdash;the council tax payers will not expect front-line services to be cut. I find it offensive that vulnerable people&mdash;our old age pensioners&mdash;have to bear the brunt of the cut. They pay council tax, as well, so why should they? If we are lucky, we all get old and we would all like the benefit of a hot meal. All that is being put at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1590" name="Michael Jack">The right hon. Member for Fylde (Mr. Jack)</phrase> mentioned Blackburn. My understanding is that Blackburn is not going to cut its meals on wheels. We have a doughnut. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1650" name="Greg Pope">My hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope)</phrase> is here as well. He and I adjoin Blackburn. There will be people who live across the street who have a beneficial service. How do we explain that? We cannot. Has the time now come for us to have a unitary authority, if we cannot get the service that we expect out of the county council? That is one consequence that the county council must consider. People do not feel that they should pay such a high council tax and have front-line services cut. The question to ask is: &quot;If you're going to cut the service, why can't we have the benefit that Blackburn has and have a unitary authority?&quot; At least the service would still be provided. The money would be collected locally and the service would be delivered locally. We may have to ask that question.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/5">What can we do? I hope that the county council will reflect on what it has done and drop the proposal as a matter of urgency. In Chorley, I have already arranged for a meeting with the primary care trust and the hospital, because there is a consequence for them, as well. Hopefully, social services from the county will come along and we can have a meeting to see whether we can ensure that there will be hot meal provision in Chorley at no extra cost compared with the situation at the moment. I feel that it is not my job to get down to that level, but, if need be, I will always ensure that the pensioners among my constituents do not come second to a decision taken by the county council. I hope that the council reflects on that and will help to fund that service in Chorley. That is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/6">Quite rightly, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" name="Liam Byrne">my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr. Byrne)</phrase>, is going to sum up. There are things that we must ask for and need to ensure, because this will end up being a health issue if we are not careful. First, what does he see as the benefit from meals on wheels? What does he think it does to help elderly people in Lancashire and across the United Kingdom? I have no doubt that the situation is replicated elsewhere. What does it mean when we talk about supporting people in their own homes? I wonder what his views on that will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.1/7">Secondly, I would be grateful for the Minister's comments on the suitability of frozen meals for the elderly, the additional cost involved in checking up on pensioners to ensure that they can cope with the reheating of frozen meals without support, and the effect that that will have on social services.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is important that Lancashire MPs speak with one voice today, across both sides of the Chamber, in asking the county council to reflect on the decision that it has made and to look again at the issue. We are talking about the most vulnerable people in the county. There is a real opportunity for the county council to have a second look at the matter. Perhaps the Minister will join that call in his response.</p>

	<p pid="a.275.1/1">I could not agree more with my hon. Friend. The fact that the right hon. Member for Fylde is here as well shows that this is about not scoring political points but being united politically to send a clear message to county hall that we would like the council to reflect, reconsider and not put the more vulnerable at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/2">Thirdly, what impact does the Minister believe that the increased cost will have on the take-up of meals and the future welfare of individuals, whose health may deteriorate as a consequence, and what will be the extra pressure on the NHS? As we know, the present system provides an affordable hot meal for the elderly and the housebound. The increased cost proposed by Lancashire county council will result in a reduced uptake of meals, which will put an extra cost on social services and a burden on hospitals. I hope that, when we have finished the debate and the Minister has summed up, we can get that message across, that minds at county hall will not be closed, and that the council will reconsider and look to preserving those valuable front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/3">The county council will say that it is always under the cosh and under attack, but that is not the case. It runs an excellent education system. I am very proud of the schools in Chorley and of the education system that is provided by Lancashire county council. However, when the council provides one valuable service, it should not tarnish other services by proposed cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.275.1/4">I look forward to the Minister's response. I am sure that he shares the concerns of Lancashire MPs as we unite to send a clear message to county hall.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.276.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1414" speakername="Liam Byrne" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="276"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h02.htm#60208h02_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.276.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1501" name="Lindsay Hoyle">my hon. Friend the Member for Chorley (Mr. Hoyle)</phrase> on securing the debate and thank him, quite profoundly, for giving us the opportunity to discuss this important issue. My view is that we need far more debates such as this in the House, because older people's issues are rising up the agenda, and so they should. We have more people over 60 in this country than under 16. The number of people who are over 85 is forecast to double. That is not just a strategic issue for us as policy makers, but a political issue, because there are four times as many older voters as there are younger voters.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/2">Meals on wheels are an important component in packages of care that are designed to help people to stay in their own home. Why is that important? It is important because people want to keep their independence for as long as possible and having meals delivered to them at home helps them to do that. There is absolutely no doubt that meals on wheels is an extremely valuable and much needed service. I pay tribute to all those volunteer services in Lancashire, including WRVS and Age Concern, that deliver meals on wheels. They contribute an enormous amount to the fabric of the life of the local community. We would do well to recognise that.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/3">I was thinking about the heart of today's debate and how I could be most helpful to my hon. Friend, so I shall set out two things. First, I shall set out why the issue is important from a policy point of view and then I shall talk about the situation in Lancashire. The policy context begins with the fact that we have made enormous strides in improving health and well-being for older people in this country. We have done that, in part, by tackling age discrimination that once prevented older people from getting health care. We have changed that situation and heart surgery for the over-75s, for example, has now risen from 2 per cent. to 10 per cent.&mdash;it has increased fivefold. Death rates from diseases that particularly affect older people such as heart disease, strokes and cancer are plummeting. Life expectancy for men and women over 65 is increasing very quickly.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/4">We have done things that have affected the quality of care for older people, such as cutting delayed discharges by two thirds. We have released 1.5 million bed days by tackling that issue head on. The policy questions begin with this issue: we have added years to life, but how do we now add life to years? That is the question posed by the World Health Organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/5">I want to draw my hon. Friend's attention to three policy areas to consider as he presents the arguments locally. First, in the White Paper on social care and health, we set out a new direction of travel for national health and social services. At the heart of the White Paper is the question of how we shift services much closer to people's homes, so that care is available not just round the clock, but round the corner. Secondly, how do we ensure that health services work together far better with local authorities? That is extremely important, as he knows from his long experience of campaigning on these issues. Thirdly, and this is particularly relevant to his argument, how do we increase investment in preventative health services? We spend far less in this country than our European neighbours on health care that prevents people from becoming ill in the first place. We set out a clear ambition in our White Paper to increase resources for preventative health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/6">One incredibly important policy argument concerns the recent report by the social exclusion unit, which considered the views of older people. If my hon. Friend has not seen that, I shall happily send him a copy because it underlines a lot of the arguments he made today. The report shows that almost one in 10 of those aged 65 and over report feeling lonely often or always. The older people were, the more they reported feeling lonely. About 30 per cent. of people aged over 65 do not see friends at least once a week. That is an incredible number. We know that social isolation and loneliness are connected to inadequacy of social relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/7">Thanks to the social exclusion unit, we now know that people often descend into ill health because of a trigger event, such as the death of a carer or loved one, or when someone has to go into hospital. Often, it is the social exclusion that follows that means people are lonely; they do not access mainstream services and their health begins to decline. The White Paper addresses that issue for older people by saying that the NHS and local authorities need to work closer together to invest more money in preventative health care services, so that we can confront that issue head on.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/8">Another policy area is the importance we attach to delivering more care in the home, and my hon. Friend alluded to that. We know that older people overwhelmingly say that they want to live at home, and we also know that people who are getting older have extremely strong views about that. When the Commission for Social Care Inspection surveyed the under-60s, only between 3 per cent. and 11 per cent. expressed the desire to move to a care home. More than 90 per cent. said that they wanted stay in their own home for as long as possible. During the past three years, we have seen a steady increase in the proportion of people receiving intensive help at home. The Department of Health has a target of providing care at home for at least 34 per cent. of those supported. At the moment, 65 local authorities are already achieving that target.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/9">My hon. Friend said that the debate was of national significance and he is absolutely right because the target extends nationally. If we consider inner London, for example, all councils are now hitting that target of 34 per cent. of people being supported at home. In outer London, 90 per cent. of councils are hitting that target and we expect the rest of the country to fall in line behind them.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/10">The policy background to this question is a White Paper that says that we must move care closer to home and support people in their home. The social exclusion unit says that tackling social isolation is extremely important, and the direction of travel of policy is to increase the number of people living at home. The question that the local NHS and local authorities have to answer is how those three elements work together.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/11">That brings me to two questions regarding Lancashire county council. First, are we resourcing Lancashire county council sufficiently well, given the agenda that has been set nationally? Secondly, what are the implications for meals on wheels? As my hon. Friend said, we have increased resources for local government significantly. We are in the ninth successive year of real-terms increases in investment in local government. Between 1997 and 2007&ndash;08, funding will have increased by nearly 40 per cent. in real terms. In Lancashire, in 2005&ndash;06, the adult social services budget was &pound;241 million, which is an increase of about &pound;15 million on the year before. Importantly, there is now a three-year settlement for Lancashire county council, so that it can plan ahead more effectively. In our White Paper, we said that we would ensure that the health service has a three-year budget, so that it is a little easier to make those plans work.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/12">On the issue of Lancashire county council spending on meals on wheels, it is important to say that it has a strong track record of looking after older people. Its social services have received two stars and it has been commended on its performance by CSCI. It has been assessed as excellent by the Centre for Policy on Ageing and it is on track to meet the requirements of a number of public service agreements. I particularly welcome three things: the increase in people receiving direct payments, the increase in the number of extra-care housing tenancies and a 50 per cent. reduction in residential admissions over a five-year period. Clearly, more people are able to stay in their homes, which has big implications for the services supplied to people living at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/13">The county council spends just under &pound;1 million a year in providing meals through its in-house service, another &pound;3.2 million in spot-and-block contracts and &pound;2.9 million is then recovered through charges to service users. The council is currently subsidising provision of meals on wheels to the tune of about &pound;1.3 million a year. The track record is reasonably good because Lancashire provided more meals than any other council in 2004&ndash;05 and there are more clients in Lancashire receiving meals on wheels than in any other council area as of <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-31">31 March 2005</phrase>. That is due, in part, to its enormous size&mdash;it is an extremely large authority. The Lancashire average is that 22.3 older people per 1,000 receive meals, compared with the English average of 13.6, which is something to be proud of. In addition, as my hon. Friend said, the average cost of the meal is about &pound;2.70, which is quite a way below average. The average cost in England as a whole is &pound;3.30.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/14">I shall write to my hon. Friend on two points of detail relating to costs and assessment. We would expect all assessments of social service clients to take account of whether they can use the meals that they have been given. My hon. Friend is quite right: if we are moving to a situation where frozen meals are being delivered, someone cannot just turn up in a truck and give people frozen meals. That is not good enough. We have to ensure that people are assessed on their ability to make use of those meals, which has further implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.0/15">Our direction of travel is to support people in their own homes for longer, in line with their own wishes. We have to be alert to the risks of social isolation, as the social exclusion unit report points out.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.1/1">Mr. Taylor, may I be the first to welcome you to the Chair of what I hope will be a constructive debate?</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/2">Few things matter more to our constituents than their health and their ability to access high quality care. Things are going wrong in Hillingdon, and the scale of concern is reflected by the presence in this debate of all three Hillingdon MPs. I am pleased to have the opportunity to share some of the problems with the Minister and other Members whose constituency experience may confirm or contradict a sense of growing crisis in west London health care.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/3">North-west London is suffering from two powerful factors that have come into play at the same time. The first is the lack of any credible strategic leadership. With the proposed reorganisation of trusts, it is a problem that may get worse before it gets better. The problem is not just the lack of a strategy, but the failures to listen to patients and local opinion, to back up an opinion with evidence that people can trust, to send consistent signals on which people can rely and to manage competently.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/4">That leads me to the second factor in play; the financial crisis that grips the North West London strategic health authority and the Hillingdon primary care trust, wrestling as they are with some of the largest deficits in the system. I think that at the six-month point, Hillingdon PCT has a deficit of &pound;25 million, although I am happy for the Minister to correct me. The result is a climate of uncertainty and mistrust in an area where people would be the first to admit that they have been relatively lucky over the years. Health funding per capita has been relatively high, if we can trust the official numbers, and residents have had access to some of the best hospitals in the system. We take great pride in living alongside the genius of Sir Magdi Yacoub and the research and surgical teams at Harefield hospital, as they push the boundaries of knowledge and excellence in cardiac care.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/5">Likewise, the local community is deeply committed to the Mount Vernon cancer centre. Some &pound;2 million a year is raised locally for the hospital and on-site charities such as the Paul Strickland scanner centre, the Sir Michael Sobell House hospice and the Lynda Jackson Macmillan centre. They complement the oncology service superbly. For example, the Paul Strickland scanner centre offers patients some of the most sophisticated scanning equipment in the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/6">That pride and commitment has been reflected in a long tradition of fighting for what we value. Some 18 years ago, Northwood residents physically occupied for three months the Northwood and Pinner community hospital to prevent it being closed. In the modern age, the tradition is proudly maintained by organisations such as Community Voice and Heart of Harefield, which under the leadership of Jean Brett ran such a tenacious campaign to expose the weaknesses in the case for the Paddington health campus; a campaign for which the village of Harefield and all who care about the hospital should always be grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/7">That determination and commitment is about to be tested again, because we face uncertainty on three fronts: first, the future of Harefield hospital; secondly, the future of Mount Vernon; and thirdly, the fallout from the financial crisis at Hillingdon PCT and the strategic health authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/8">I shall start with Harefield, because a key decision is imminent, and there are signs of good sense beginning to prevail, despite what the Minister and colleagues may have read in the <i>Evening Standard </i>last week. Harefield is a recognised centre of excellence as a specialist heart hospital. That was recognised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1387" name="John Hutton">the right hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (Mr. Hutton)</phrase>, when as a Minister of State at the Department of Health, he acknowledged that</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/9" class="indent">&quot;the hospital has been remarkably successful in its development of heart and lung services and has rightfully earned a reputation as a centre of excellence for that specialist work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.280.1/10">It is one of the few hospitals in the national health service whose reputation extends beyond our shores. The team remains&mdash;it always has been&mdash;at the cutting edge of pioneer technologies such as primary angioplasty, which means that patients can receive surgery at Harefield hospital within 25 minutes of a heart attack.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.5/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" name="David Gauke">my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire (Mr. Gauke)</phrase> for that intervention. He is right; it was the intervention, not least of Heart of Harefield and colleagues that encouraged the National Audit Office to take such an active interest in the project. As my hon. Friend knows, the NAO will publish a report in the spring that, I think, will throw a harsh spotlight on the management of that project.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.5/2">That the team at Harefield hospital achieves what it does is all the more remarkable given the fabric of the antiquated buildings in which it works. That centre of excellence would have been destroyed by the Paddington health campus project, not least because the staff made it clear that they would not move. That ill-starred project fell over because no credible business case was ever made after six years and &pound;14 million of consultant fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.5/3">The independent review pointed out that the cost was</p>
	<p pid="a.281.5/4" class="indent">&quot;dwarfed by the opportunity cost to the nation as a whole, due to building inflation over the long duration of the project.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.281.5/5">The same review pointed out that if appropriate risk management processes had been in place, the project would have been halted or terminated on at least six occasions between September 2002 and the end of 2004. The review made 43 separate recommendations about how those projects should be managed in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.5/6">Sir John Bourn, the Comptroller and Auditor General, noted in a letter to me that the report</p>
	<p pid="a.281.5/7" class="indent">&quot;provides a catalogue of missed opportunities; inadequate programme management and fundamental weaknesses.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.281.5/8">As a result of requests from myself and three other colleagues, including my hon. Friend the Member for South-West Hertfordshire, Sir John has decided to make a value for money study into the collapse of the Paddington health campus, which will be available in the spring.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.282.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1633" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="282"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.282.0/1">Very briefly, many of the problems that came to light were because of the hard-working Heart of Harefield campaigners, as my hon. Friend has mentioned. I put on record in particular the tremendous work done by Mrs. Jean Brett, a constituent of mine, who made great efforts to reveal the weaknesses in the business proposals for the Paddington basin project.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.282.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="282"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.282.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, with which I completely concur.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">The Comptroller and Auditor General in the meantime has written to the Department recommending that it take the independent review very seriously and publicly respond to it. May I press the Minister therefore to clarify whether it is the intention of the Department to respond publicly to the independent review, and, if so, when and how?</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/3">The Paddington campus is now important only in terms of the lessons to be learned from it. It is time to move on, not least because its collapse has left a strategic void just at a time of uncertainty about short-term leadership in west London health. Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Trust is stepping up to the plate. The new chief executive, Bob Bell, deserves great credit for his vigorous response to Paddington and the subsequent clinical governance review of Harefield hospital, a response that has the support of local stakeholders and clinical staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/4">The message is that, basically, the review is clear that clinical outcomes at Harefield are &quot;satisfactory&quot;. What is done at Harefield on bed and bench cannot be replicated elsewhere in the short term. The trust needs two sites. Primary angioplasty, for example, is an increasingly valuable local service requiring cardiac surgery, which in turn feeds into the need for transplant capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/5">The review rightly points out the inadequacies of the hospital's infrastructure. The trust believes that that can be fixed in the medium term by spending some &pound;20 million, which it believes it can afford to raise off its own strong balance sheet as a result of its competence in managing its own affairs, thereby making no call on NHS funds. It believes that it can fix the clinical isolation argument by specialist recruitment and the formalisation of agreements with local hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/6">The message seems to be, &quot;Let's get on with it in the interests of patients and medical advancement.&quot; It has a powerful logic that needs to be worked up into a credible business plan, and it seems to reflect a view that it is time for a more practical approach, taking medium-term decisions based on what we know, rather than pursuing grand, long-term visions supported by insufficient clinical data. It is time to back the competent rather than the incompetent. It would be disappointing if that logical initiative fell foul of financial crisis management or power-play in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/7">I shall close my comments on Harefield by simply asking the Minister to confirm that the Department has no objection in principle to the concept of specialist hospitals, as long as they have the support of senior clinical staff and a robust business plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/8">Moving down the road, the story of Mount Vernon hospital has parallels. Again, it is an acknowledged centre of excellence that has achieved great things for 40 years despite its poor fabric of buildings. Again, the hospital enjoys wide support throughout the community. During a bitter public consultation, 75,000 people signed a petition protesting at the proposal to close the cancer centre in 2003. Again, I am referring to a hospital that has to live with uncertainty about its long-term future. It suffers from a persistent lack of commitment from the centre and fragmented ownership, with four separate trusts being involved in service provision and commissioning. Again, I am talking about a hospital that is threatened by the latest vogue of medical opinion that the future does not lie in smaller, specialist hospitals, although there is no evidence that patients have been disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/9">We should remind ourselves of the wisdom of Nietzsche, who wrote</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/10" class="indent">&quot;whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/11">Those are wise words. The reality is that we do not know how we will be treating cancer in 10 years' time, but we know that, when the Mount Vernon cancer centre is moved to Hatfield in 2013, as is the current plan, about one million people will lose their cancer centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.0/1">Can my hon. Friend confirm that, as we speak, the site for the proposed hospital at Hatfield has still not been identified, so not even the planning process can be started?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.283.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="283"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.283.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. He is right that there is tremendous uncertainty about the future of Hatfield, which only compounds the sense of uncertainty and frustration in my constituency about the future of the Mount Vernon cancer centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/2">As I said, one million people will lose their cancer centre if it moves. The issue crosses borders. The strategic health authority has rejected the option of a walk-in radiotherapy centre at Mount Vernon to replace the oncology centre. It awaits the outcome of yet another review, the access and capacity review. It is expected to send a stark message to cancer patients in Hillingdon and Harrow that, if they suffer from cancer and require regular radio therapy and chemotherapy, they must travel to either Hammersmith or Hatfield.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/3">The Minister should be aware such a choice is unacceptable for Hillingdon residents. Recently, I chaired a meeting with local stakeholders and it confirmed that view. The intrepid reporters of the <i>Ruislip &amp; Northwood Gazette</i> have timed the journeys. To either facility, it is a one-way journey time of between 45 minutes and 90 minutes. Last year, my father-in-law died of cancer. He required regular chemotherapy. It would have been unthinkable for us to accept regular journey times of that length on his behalf. It would have exhausted him. I am sure that the Minister would apply the same standards for her family.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/4">If matters are not okay for us, why should they be okay for the one million people for whom Mount Vernon is today the most convenient location? Apart from a trail of broken promises, what most upsets local people is the deafness of the centre to their arguments, and a growing feeling that the matter concerns cost reduction rather than patient convenience and care. I emphasise that, on the SHA's own figure, the demand for cancer services is expected to grow by 50 per cent. between now and 2013. The travel times to Hammersmith and Hatfield are unacceptable. The cancer tsar himself admits that we have a shortage of radiotherapy capacity in this country. Calculations by Community Voice involving 2001 data from the national cancer services analysis team make a strong numerical case for at least three cancer centres in north-west London.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/5">Will the Minister consider seriously the option of an additional cancer centre in outer north-west London by 2013? It could be a satellite facility, spoke-linked to the hub. It could be free-standing. It should include chemotherapy, radiotherapy with oncologists and cancer beds on site treating palliative patients, but not necessarily all cancers. Where can it be located? The infrastructure is in place at Mount Vernon. The hospital enjoys superb community support. There is no hard clinical evidence to argue that patients are disadvantaged at Mount Vernon. If there were such evidence, why would the Department be sanctioning the &pound;20 million investment that is going into the site now? During public consultation, the community will express profound anger if that option were not evaluated seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/6">If there is a better site than Mount Vernon, the community wants to receive a signal that the hospital has a long-term future that is relevant to the community, which gives it so much support. A growing voice asks, &quot;Why not look harder at the opportunity to develop co-operation with another neglected and valuable site down the road, Harefield hospital?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/7">The final worry concerns the fall out from the general state of financial crisis in our local health institutions. Hillingdon primary care trust causes the greatest concern. All three hon. Members who represent the Hillingdon area recently met the temporary chief executive. It is hard to pin down the truth of what has happened. The special factor concerns the impact of Heathrow, and we should be grateful if the Minister received representations on the matter. However, there is a strong suggestion of overtrading over time and inadequate flows of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.1/8">Can the Minister enlighten us on the current deficit because the numbers seem to swing around? Can she explain the Department's view on what it considers to be the major drivers of the problem and why it was not controlled earlier? Given that outside help has been called in, will the right hon. Lady say when a recovery plan is likely to be proposed and what degree of consultation there will be? Residents are already beginning to feel the fallout. Much valued services have been cut, such as homeopathy, specialist orthodontics, therapy in the community and, most shamefully, therapy in specialist schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.0/1">My hon. Friend made an important request to the Minister about the current level of deficit. I hope that she will have the opportunity to gain that information during the debate. Some of the remarks that I have contemplated making depend a little on where we currently stand in respect of the deficit. If the information is in the Room, it would be helpful if it were introduced in the debate earlier rather than when the right hon. Lady makes her final remarks.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Is the Minister in a position to give us an update?</p>

	<p pid="a.285.2/1">I do not have the information in my immediate briefing, but I am looking for inspiration.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.285.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" speakername="Nick Hurd" colnum="285"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.285.3/1">I hope that the Minister's inspiration is fast in arriving.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/2">It is felt that worse is to come because the trust is fiddling at the margin of the problem, the cumulative deficit. Two questions spring to mind. First, are Hillingdon residents now to suffer as a result of managerial incompetence? Are the Government sending out a firm message that trusts have to trade their way out of the problem or is there scope to discuss some restructuring of the historic debt if the books are balanced in the current year? Can a primary care trust in such a condition really handle the new responsibilities being devolved by the Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/3">Dentistry is of particular concern. I accept that that is not the direct responsibility of the Minister, but I should be grateful if she took on board some specific concerns that may be reflected in other constituencies. First, I am led to believe that the Hillingdon PCT dental budget allocation contains a shortfall of &pound;453,000. I should be grateful for her confirmation in writing about whether that is the case and what the Department of Health intends to do about it at this late hour.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/4">Secondly, there is alarming anecdotal evidence about the intentions of local dentists to quit the national health service, due principally to inadequate funding, but also to uncertainty about whether children and exempt adult only contracts are being offered. Thirdly, it is a symptom of Hillingdon PCT's apparent difficulty in managing the process that no decisions will be taken on the matter before <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-22">22 February</phrase>, six days before dentists are required to make a decision on signature. Fourthly, I perceive cash-flow risks for the PCT arising from the new contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/5">I am worried about the flow of incentives. At the moment, I understand from local dentists that they are incentivised to send in data on treatments because that is how they gain access to NHS funds. However, under the new system, dentists will be sending in data only in order to allow the system to check how they are performing against contract and to calculate what needs to be deducted from their next gross payment from the PCT. If that is so&mdash;I stand ready to be corrected&mdash;where is the incentive to send in data on a timely basis? If there were no incentive, does that not carry a cash-flow risk for a PCT that is required to fund the contracted gross monthly revenue until an adjustment is agreed?</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/6">We are also worried that any money eventually recovered from inefficient or demotivated dentists will flow back to the Department of Health and be lost to Hillingdon. Is that the Minister's understanding of the position? Even if dentists submit timely returns, I detect significant IT risk arising from the fact that apparently every practice will be required to upgrade its software. A recent article in <i>BDA News </i>dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-02">2 February</phrase> confirms that</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/7" class="indent">&quot;Both the major dental IT suppliers agree that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to upgrade every practice before the new contract comes into effect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/8">Is the Minister aware of how many local practices have upgraded their systems in anticipation of the new contract? Does she accept the seriousness of this IT risk in terms of potential system chaos, and also in terms of compounding the PCT cash-flow risks?</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/9">As I mentioned, Hillingdon PCT is not the only concern. Redevelopment of Hillingdon hospital was two years in the planning. That is urgently needed to improve the fabric of a hospital that has suffered from persistent problems with hospital cleanliness, but the redevelopment has been called in. The community waits anxiously for smoke signals to emerge from the Department of Health. Can the Minister confirm when we can expect some clarity of intention in respect of that development?</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/10">On a smaller scale, the proposed redevelopment of the Northwood and Pinner community hospital has been frozen. Back at Mount Vernon, the plastics and burns service collapsed last week, following a number of consultant resignations. In his letter of explanation, the chief executive of West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust says:</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/11" class="indent">&quot;Over time it has become increasingly difficult to maintain the fabric of the buildings to a standard that is acceptable. Staff have become frustrated with the inability of the NHS collectively to resolve these issues.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/12">I have tried to throw a spotlight on to what is happening in the part of outer west London that I represent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.286.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" speakername="Jane Kennedy" colnum="286"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew14">
	<p pid="a.286.0/1">In respect of the question that was asked of me, the Committee might be interested to learn that Hillingdon PCT's deficit in the year 2004&ndash;05 was &pound;13,470,000. For the current year, the six-month figure is &pound;25,657,000. That is a significant deficit.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.1/1">I am grateful to the Minister for coming back to me with that data, which confirms the figures I gave earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">As I said, I have tried to throw a spotlight on what is happening in the part of outer west London that I represent. I sincerely hope it is not typical, although I note <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" name="Greg Hands">the comments of my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands)</phrase>&mdash;he cannot be with us as, ironically, our party leader is visiting Charing Cross hospital with him as we speak&mdash;who wanted to raise the ongoing huge deficit at Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, which is currently running at &pound;37 million, the second largest in England. My hon. Friend tells me that the effect of that is the axing of 200 beds in the trust, 300 redundancies and thousands of operations being postponed. Therefore, it is clear that the situation in Hammersmith at least is also very serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/3">I hope that the Minister will respond to my questions and be able to reassure me that the future of health services in my constituency and the London borough of Hillingdon is not as bleak as it appears to be. Labour came to power singing, &quot;Things can only get better.&quot; All I can do is quote to the Minister from the front page of today's <i>Ruislip &amp; Northwood Gazette</i>; the headline of an article on dentists deserting the NHS is, &quot;You're Having a Laugh!&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.287.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on his trenchant presentation of his concerns about his constituency's local health service. However, I congratulate him less on his concluding remarks on the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, which I intend to address at length, and about which he does not, perhaps, have such expert knowledge; he should not believe everything that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" name="Greg Hands">the hon. Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands)</phrase> tells him about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/2">I have the privilege of having two PCTs and two hospital trusts covered by my constituency. Although not all the hospitals in those trusts are within my constituency, they are all used by many of my constituents. I should begin by saying that in each of them I have encountered only the highest standards of clinical care, innovation and research, and I pay tribute to all the staff&mdash;professional and otherwise&mdash;at the Hammersmith, Charing Cross, Ravenscourt Park and Ealing hospitals, and at Hammersmith and Fulham PCT and Ealing PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/3">The Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust is currently under scrutiny, and for some good reason. I shall address the majority of my comments to that. As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, his comments and mine coincide with a visit by the Leader of the Opposition to one of the hospitals in that trust. In reading for this debate, I have learned about the real performance achievements of the trust's hospitals, and the serious concerns that there are about the deficit and about the future of some of the facilities at Charing Cross hospital. I must also say that there has been a great deal of black propaganda about what is said might be planned. So far as I am aware, no decisions have been taken in respect of closing or moving any facilities. In fact, the contrary is the case; there is a continuing commitment to all the hospitals that my constituents use. I hope that the Minister will be able to give me some reassurance on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/4">I do not know which of those areas&mdash;the achievements, the genuine concerns or the black propaganda&mdash;the Leader of the Opposition will address during his visit today. I can only conjecture; my sources within the trust say that when his office contacted them, it did not at first know why he was going, and then said that it was for world health month. That might be right, but the fact that he planned a half-hour visit to a major teaching hospital, and that the clinician he requested to see is the father of the leader of the local Tory group, suggests that the purpose of his visit might be the last of those categories; propaganda. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I am shocked, as is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, but that happens from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/5">The Leader of the Opposition has extended his visit, and I hope that now that he has done so he will see the genuine achievement of staff and management at that hospital in ensuring that&mdash;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" name="Ann Keen">my hon. Friend the Member for Brentford and Isleworth (Ann Keen)</phrase> had direct professional experience of this in the past&mdash;we have teaching hospitals of excellent standard. We should be proud of them, and we should continue to be. I believe that the Leader of the Opposition told the <i>Health Service Journal</i> yesterday that politics should be taken out of the health service. Let us hope that starts with his visit to Charing Cross hospital today; but, frankly, from the information I have gleaned, that does not seem to be the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/6">Let me talk a little about the achievements before going on to the concerns. It is important to do so, because unless one understands how the health service is currently being run in west London, it is difficult to see the problems in perspective. The Government are presiding over the largest ever increase in health service funding&mdash;a doubling so far, and a tripling by 2008. A substantial amount of that is going into the hospitals that serve my constituency. All of those hospitals have achieved the waiting time strictures, such as those of 13 weeks for out-patients and six months for surgery waiting times.</p>

	<p pid="a.288.1/1">It is my understanding that the current average waiting time for operations is about eight weeks. It comes somewhat ill from Opposition Members, whose party presided over a health service in which one in 10 people waited two years or more for operations, to criticise this extraordinary achievement of bringing waiting times down over the past seven or eight years, a trend that is continuing. In accident and emergency services, 98 per cent. of people wait for less than four hours and the general waiting time is far less than that. There has been a sea change in the service that my constituents receive from hospitals in the area. Whatever Opposition Members say, that is the real- time, every-day experience, and I contrast that with the now abandoned patient's passport, which, nevertheless, was the policy written up only some 12 months ago&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.289.0/1">Order. May I bring the hon. Gentleman back to the topic of the debate, which is the provision of health services in west London?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.289.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="289"  time="014:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew21">
	<p pid="a.289.1/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Taylor; I should not be provoked into bringing politics into the health service in that way.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/2">As I said, all the local hospitals are meeting targets. Let us look at the improvement in the performance of the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, for example. In the past year, it has treated 13 per cent. more emergency cases, 9 per cent. more elective cases, and 7 per cent. more out-patients. Quite extraordinary amounts of investment are going into such improvements, and into Charing Cross hospital, too. No doubt I will have the pleasure of accompanying the all-party kidney group&mdash;of which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> is co-chair&mdash;to Hammersmith hospital next week to visit the new &pound;40-million west London renal and transplant centre. It is the largest such centre in Europe and has 200 beds. It is a state-of-the-art facility available to all in west London. Notwithstanding that, dialysis and other local services are continuing at Charing Cross hospital and other hospitals in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/3">That combination of concentrating large investment and expertise on particular sites and still having local services available&mdash;as was suggested in the recent White Paper&mdash;is exactly the sort of development that I welcome. I hope that that will continue in the health service of west London.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.1/4">Significant investment continues to be made in Charing Cross hospital. There are new lineal accelerators, a new 72-hour day-and-stay surgery unit, new research facilities, and new mental health services. Quite possibly, there will be an emergency clinical decision centre on the site, too. That gives the lie to accusations that Charing Cross hospital is under threat and will close. There is continued, large-scale investment in that hospital, year on year.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.2/1">On that point, I worked at Hammersmith hospital in 1993, when the Conservative party was in power. The then Secretary of State for Health talked about the future of Charing Cross hospital in market terms, saying that we should let the market decide what would happen to it. That was very different from the discussion taking place today, in which we are consulting the wider public and health professionals in general.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. She is tempting me back into politics, because she and I remember a concerted campaign fought in the late 1980s and early 1990s to save Charing Cross hospital. That was not a Labour party campaign, but a campaign by all parties&mdash;although not the Conservative Government&mdash;and particularly local residents. The site was cynically going to be sold off simply because no investment was being made in the health service at that point. That contrasts with the amount of investment now.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/2">Of course, I pay tribute to Imperial college, which is a major funder and bringer-in of private funding. The Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, which includes the Hammersmith and Charing Cross sites, has &pound;28 million going into the construction of a clinical imaging centre that is to be completed this year. Also, &pound;63 million from the Medical Research Council is going into research facilities on the Hammersmith site. Those are sums of money and facilities that would make many trusts around the country green with envy.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.3/3">I have concentrated on the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, but I should mention the Ealing Hospital NHS Trust; the managing director asked me to point out that it is making a surplus at present.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.0/1">A surplus!</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.290.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" speakername="Andrew Slaughter" colnum="290"  time="014:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.290.1/1">Yes, a surplus. I know, the terminology is interesting. Some &pound;14 million of investment&mdash;the largest single investment for that hospital ever&mdash;has been made in Ealing hospital in the past 12 months. It has a new cardiac catheter laboratory and a new magnetic resonance imaging unit; it has refurbished wards; and it has firmly dealt with its previous problems. That is the story in west London and across the health service in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/2">I will limit the length of my contribution as you suggested, Mr. Taylor, but I shall now come to the real problems and will put them in some sort of perspective. There is a substantial deficit in the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust, but let us not be fooled into thinking that it is a permanent feature, or that the deficit per se is affecting services. The deficit is controlled to the extent that, month on month, the core trust at Hammersmith is breaking even; there is no accumulating deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/3">The amount of deficit is hugely enhanced by the issue of Ravenscourt Park hospital. I do not have time to go into that subject in detail, but I know that the Minister is aware of the issue. The problems that there have undoubtedly been with that hospital have turned a manageable deficit into a very large one, and clearly that needs to be dealt with. I draw that to the Minister's attention, if indeed I need to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/4">The problem has to be dealt with quickly, not least because it distorts the position of the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust and makes the problems there seem far greater. Also, it allows for a great deal of mischief-making about the link between the level of deficit and the future of services on the site. As far as I am aware&mdash;and I would be grateful if the Minister answered this point&mdash;there is no such link. Savings are being made through efficiencies, without loss of health services. To someone with a local government background like mine, that is a familiar trend. It may be somewhat newer to the health service; I do not know. Improving patient care and discharge times for orthopaedic and other injuries has meant that substantial savings of some &pound;20 million are being made this year without any loss of service. That is the context. Nevertheless, there is an accumulated deficit, and that needs to be dealt with. I am pleased to say that the Government have intervened by putting KPMG into hospitals to help address that point. I hope that it is clear that it is wrong to associate that temporary problem with the long-term future of facilities on the Hammersmith and Charing Cross sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/5">In conclusion, my constituents are looking for the following assurances from the Government. They want to know that there will be a continuation, and indeed improvement, of the excellent facilities on the Hammersmith, Ealing and Charing Cross sites. The latter serves a large number of people in the south of my constituency. It has been my local hospital all my life; all my family have been treated there, and some, sadly, died there. In fact, my uncle designed the electrical systems for the hospital, so there are long associations for me.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/6">Everybody in Fulham, Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush knows the Charing Cross hospital well. It was an NHS site long before the current buildings were there. The site is in the middle of a substantial, quite deprived population area and is accessible. It is an excellent facility and it must stay there, and investment in it must continue. I think that that view is held by all parties. The White Paper model looks for services to be available locally and to be accessible, and that must be right. That is what is provided by the hospital sites, and by other sites in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/7">I am delighted that the Hammersmith and Fulham primary care trust has plans for a new collaborative care centre, bringing together diagnostic day surgery and substantial general practitioner practices. That will be adjacent to the White City estate, on the old leisure centre site. A planning application is due to be made very shortly. That is perhaps one of the first examples in the country of how the White Paper proposals will come to fruition. All those are excellent developments, but they must be preserved so that future generations can benefit from the accessibility and the high standard of care provided by hospitals and other health facilities in west London.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.291.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" speakername="John Randall" colnum="291"  time="015:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.291.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Taylor; I shall endeavour to be extra brief. First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase>, not only on obtaining this important debate but on a speech that was such a tour de force that I really can be brief, as he has already touched on most of the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/2">Hillingdon is a living example of taking politics out of the health service; that is represented by the fact that we three Members representing that borough are here and pretty much singing from the same hymn sheet. It is pretty immaterial to us and our constituents who is actually in power, as long as they are delivering the services. I pay tribute to the current Government for putting money into the health service, as I believe all Governments have done; the problem is what is happening to that money, as we see with the current deficits in the PCT. There is no question that the PCT has a great deal of resources, but we are facing a problem with the deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/3">As my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood said, we are far from convinced that the PCT has got a grip on where the money is going. If it cannot understand where the problem is, I find it difficult to understand how it will rectify it. I was a little disappointed to see that, however capable he is, the gentleman acting as chief executive was doing it as a part-time job with a neighbouring PCT that also had a deficit. That situation has been changed, but in the meantime, while we try to appoint somebody else&mdash;I speak with a certain degree of business experience&mdash;things could be getting a bit out of control.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/4">In the meantime, my constituents and all of us in Hillingdon have problems with services that are labelled as low priority and are being cut. There are problems with district nurses, getting people seen by an incontinence nurse and with therapy, special schools and orthodontics. I will not go on about dentists, but the <i>Uxbridge and West Drayton Gazette&mdash;</i>published by the same group that publishes the <i>Ruislip &amp; Northwood Gazette</i> and the <i>Hayes &amp; Harlington Gazette&mdash;</i>is all about dentistry and related problems faced by people. That is a real issue. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> has been active on that matter. We have all met local dentists. There is a pressing problem, which we must look at.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/5">We want Hillingdon hospital to be rebuilt. The Government were going to do it with a PFI, but that has been called in and I am not surprised. I have reservations about PFI, but if it can be done properly, that is great. We might just sneak out one advantage while this matter is being looked at. I have asked the Department to consider, because of the slippage of time regarding a PFI, whether it might be possible to look again at re-siting the hospital on the RAF Uxbridge site due to be vacated by the MOD. That suggestion has not been dismissed by the strategic health authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/6">That site would be much better for everybody in Hillingdon. It would be a wonderful transport centre. Everything would be good about it. There was just the problem of tying it in and not wanting to lose the money that the Department of Health was putting forward, while, at the same time having to wait for the MOD to vacate. This might be the very moment. It is a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Something positive could come out of the situation. I urge the Minister to consider that.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood said a lot about Harefield hospital and Mount Vernon. I back the hon. Gentleman entirely on that and have done so in plenty of other places, as anybody can read. Just before Christmas, I asked the Prime Minister if he could find out why Health Ministers did not take part in the independent review into what went wrong with Paddington health campus. He said that he would look into that. He wrote me a letter, which just told me that Department officials took part, but not why Ministers did not. I wrote back to say that he had not quite spotted what I was after and found out he has passed the matter to the Department of Health, However, I have not heard anything for a while. If there is any way of stirring that up, I would most grateful if the Minister could do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/8">A letter from a local ambulance driver addressed to the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington and I came across my desk the other day. It is important, because it has implications all across London. I will not name the gentleman, because I did not have time to clear the use of his name, but he is asking me to bring the matter up with the relevant Ministers, so I am sure that he will not mind. The letter is to do with the</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/9" class="indent">&quot;policy in the London Ambulance Service to respond to calls with a single manned car (fast response unit) rather than in the first place send an ambulance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/10">I am sure that many of us have seen the motorcyclists as well. Although that policy has some potential in the crowded streets of London, it is also possible that there is an agenda, with the trusts wanting to meet their response times.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/11">I do not expect anybody to be completely conversant with my constituency, although <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase> spent some time there a few years ago. However, two Sundays ago, I saw some vehicles sitting across the Swakeley's roundabout all day. I wondered what they were; I thought that the local police had put them there because they looked a bit like police cars and that would get people to slow down on the A40. Although I am a layman and do not know, that did not seem a perfectly good use of resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/12">There were some repercussions. I think that I shall write to the Minister about this matter, which could have been severe and very serious indeed. I should like the Department and the Minister to consider this, because there is sometimes a danger that managers will get carried away trying to meet the targets. That should be looked at urgently.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.1/13">I shall conclude my remarks, because I am anxious to hear from the other two hon. Members who wish to take part. I say to the hon. Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush that with regard to the visit next week he has mentioned, I am afraid that his business managers have made it difficult to go on any visits next week.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.293.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="293"  time="015:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew28">
	<p pid="a.293.0/1">Can I enter this debate in the spirit in which the three hon. Members representing Hillingdon work together, relatively objectively and co-operatively? I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/2">I was elected in 1997. I was a member of the Hillingdon health emergency campaign, which was involved in the occupation of Northwood and Pinner hospital. I slept for six weeks in Hayes cottage hospital; well, I picketed it to save it. I was never sleeping. When I was elected, we inherited a system whereby three cottage hospitals&mdash;Harlington, Hayes and Uxbridge&mdash;had been closed. Hillingdon hospital was also in decline. There had been a lack of investment and it was in a poor physical condition. Despite some investment since then, I think that we all agree that the area needs a new hospital.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/3">The surgeries in my constituency were largely decrepit&mdash;they were largely converted houses&mdash;and provided appalling conditions in which people worked and patients were treated. There was a staff crisis in terms of recruitment and retention. Since then, we have had investment on a scale never seen before and we appreciate that. In my area, I have opened three new medical centres; I enjoy opening things. Cedar Brook, Hesa and the Townfield medical centres area are flourishing. GP's practices have been refurbished throughout the constituency. We are attracting more staff now, including health visitors, GPs, nurses, and so on. We still have the problem that a large number of GPs are retiring within a limited period; we still have that challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/4">Although we lost Hayes cottage hospital, it was reopened as a nursing home and we are now investing in a blood transfusion service on-site. We are still campaigning for a community hospital in the area. I notice that in the White Paper we now go back to the commitment to local community hospitals. We will be knocking on the Minister's door for some investment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/5">We have a proposal for the PFI scheme for Hillingdon hospital. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase>. I am not supportive of PFI schemes, but if this is the way to secure the money it is fair enough. However, there is a blip at the moment in terms of the Treasury review of the PFI, and this could be an opportunity not to delay the scheme, but secure it and consider an alternative site. I agree that the RAF site might potentially be available as long as we can get our act together and synchronise with the MOD.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/6">We have had a flood of investment on a scale never seen before, and I congratulate the Government on that, but sometimes the Government have to put their hands up to mistakes. I have to say that Harefield and the Paddington basin was a catastrophe. It is best to at least understand how the Government got there, admit the mistake and move on. The way to move on is exactly as the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said and exactly as Jean Brett, who was campaigning, said.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/7">I remember John Wilkinson, when he was the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood, predicting on a platform, which we all shared, that eventually this scheme would collapse because of bureaucratic inertia and its impossibility. We need to return to investment at Harefield to secure the site, because it is such a site of excellence. I agree with what the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood said about Mount Vernon. There is potential to build on existing strengths. We need to look again, but to be honest about the mistakes that we have made in the recent past.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/8">I turn to the issue of the PCT. Given our understanding and the figures that the Minister has given today, it looks as if the problem involves about &pound;30 million. I place on record my tribute to the hard work done by the previous, transient chief executive, Graham Betts, who took a hit for that deficit and resigned. He was an excellent chief executive who managed the system as well as he could and won the admiration of his staff. He was caught in a dilemma partly set by the Government, because of the issues around targets, and partly due to our need to learn lessons about the structures and systems required to ensure adequate control of overall expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/9">The issue for the PCT is that it is carrying a &pound;30 million deficit. We were advised that by the end of the financial year it could be taken down to about &pound;22 million, but that there would be a historic carry-over of more than &pound;22 million to the next year and probably beyond. That would mean that the whole system would be dragged down year on year. I agree with the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood that we should consider restructuring the deficit. My own view is that at some point the Treasury will have to write it off, because its scale is so large that otherwise it will encumber the decision-making processes of the PCT in the long-term.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/10">It looks as if the deficit has been caused partly because the influx of new money has laid down a new range of access points and pathways into care, but there has been inadequate triaging and assessment of how those pathways will link up, particularly at the local hospital. As a result of that, the hospital is building up an excellent service and treating large numbers of patients. The primary care trust has to pay for those patients and has no control over them; many staff on the ground believe that some elements of the service are using it as a simple referral point, partly to overcome their own heavy work loads and partly to shift some elements on the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/11">We need to consider how to change the systems to ensure the management of that budget in future. Indeed, we are doing so; that is why the hit squad went in. We shall never secure that adequate management if we have a continuing deficit on our backs of more than &pound;20 million&mdash;or anything between &pound;10 million and &pound;20 million&mdash;during the next few years. The three Members who represent the Hillingdon area would be happy to meet the Minister to go through the detail and ascertain what further assistance, such as restructuring the deficit or writing it off, can be given to the PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/12">The issue of Heathrow airport was raised earlier. I welcome the opportunity for the three Members who represent the Hillingdon area, with representatives from the primary care trust and the local authority, to meet the Minister to talk about our special problems in respect of Heathrow. A cost burden falls on our shoulders because visitors and others enter via Heathrow, fall sick and sometimes need intensive support and care, particularly in cases that involve mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/13">The cost of that falls on the local primary care trust, the local health service and the body responsible for mental care in the area. We also have Harmondsworth and Colnbrook detention centres, which have quadrupled in size during the past five years. All those costs fall on our local area. We would like to meet the Minister as we believe that we have a justifiable case for special assistance to be provided to our local area to overcome those problems in respect of Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.0/14">At the moment, the problem that needs to be addressed is specific to the PCT. However, I commend the Government for their investment into our area. The staff on the front line have risen to the challenge. Many members of the community appreciate that, and we do not want that reputation to be tarnished in any way by this currently intransient problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> on securing this debate and on how he introduced it. We have heard several knowledgeable contributions about the situation in west London. I should like to reflect on the level and pattern of provision for that area, and on the issues that have been raised, in the context of national policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/2">By way of apology to the two Front Benchers, I should say that, in the interests of the provision of dentistry in west London, I shall shortly run down the corridor to vote in the Committee that is considering delegated legislation on NHS dental services. The majority of those who have contributed so far will be pleased with how I shall vote in the Division. I hope that they will not think it a discourtesy that I shall not see the end of this debate; I undertake to read the contributions that the two Front Benchers make after I have gone&mdash;although I am not sure whether the Minister will be as gracious.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/3">The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood properly paid tribute to the international reputation of Harefield hospital, and I am pleased to echo that on the record. At present, the hospital clearly has problems that need to be addressed, but he is right to say that the Heart of Harefield Campaign has done a tremendous job. We need to value our centres of excellence and our specialisms because they are the way of the NHS. Increasingly, the all-purpose district general hospital is under threat. The sense is that more is going to be done in the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> mentioned the possibility of not exactly reopening but revisiting the idea of community hospitals in his area. There will be those hospitals and the high-tech specialist regional centres, but I am not sure what the Government's vision is for the all-purpose hospitals in the middle.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/5">The centres of excellence clearly need to be maintained. The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood talked about the future of Mount Vernon hospital and his personal family experience of it. For many of us, our experience of hospitals in our area is shaped not only by our professional role, but by personal experience. I was pleased to hear that he saw a place for such provision; he mentioned three cancer centres across the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/6">There is a danger of always trading off one constituency against another. For example, we might not want to lose a facility, but no doubt Hatfield wants to gain one. It is important to establish the optimal level of provision from a clinical point of view. There is a danger in saying, &quot;I want something that is world famous and world renowned and I want it at the end of my street&quot;. A degree of realism is needed. I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's idea of using Mount Vernon as a hub, with some satellite or spoke provision. We need to do such creative things to balance the desire for high-quality local services with the fact that inevitably there will be only a limited number of centres of excellence.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/7">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that, when there is consultation on the future of cancer centres such as Mount Vernon and more generally, the broadest possible range of options must be presented to the public. In my experience, there is increasing scepticism about consultations, which are seen as being stitched up before <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1949" name="Richard Taylor">they begin. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> referred to them as &quot;Blue Peter&quot; consultations&mdash;&quot;Here is something we prepared earlier&quot;&mdash;that the public are expected to rubber-stamp. Clearly, consultations need to be comprehensive and not rule out options before they begin. Critically, decisions about the future of services in west London, as elsewhere, should be about the priorities of the people in the area, informed by the guidance of the clinicians, whose judgment needs to be respected.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/8">My worry about the whole Paddington basin scenario, and a lot of what we have heard today, is the difficulty of following the thread to who was responsible. In too much of what goes on in our health service, it is hard to pin responsibility and accountability on anybody, particularly anybody whom we could vote out if we did not like the way they did things. Many more decisions about the strategic health framework for a local area such as west London need to be made by locally accountable people&mdash;not by Whitehall or unelected and unresponsive health authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/9">The PFI review was mentioned in the context of Hillingdon hospital, although schemes around the country are on hold for the same reason. From what we have heard this afternoon, it appears that there might be a silver lining and that at least the option of an alternative site might be explored. That ought to be seriously considered. However, I share <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">the scepticism of the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> about PFI, although I accept the practical comment from the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington: it is the only game in town.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/10">Many of us have to swallow our judgments on such things sometimes. However, the delay is not helpful to anybody, and I hope that the Minister will put on record a clear statement&mdash;I shall read it tomorrow&mdash;on where the Government are up to on all this. Is the review just routine? I have tabled questions on the subject, and the suggestion was that the review was just to check things through. Is the review more fundamental than that? When will it be resolved? Who is considering it? We need to know, and the people of Hillingdon clearly need to as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/11">The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked whether certain dentistry issues were unique to his area. I think he knew the answer; as he rightly suspects, they are far from that. We have concerns about the implications of the new contract. I genuinely do not know whether he is being too harsh on his PCT for its delay. In many cases, PCTs can move only as fast as central Government have allowed them to. The situation of his PCT may be extreme, but the fact that, as we speak, we are voting down the corridor on regulations to bring in new personal dental services contracts makes me think that central Government have more to do with the delays. His PCT might not be helping, although I do not know about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/12">Where do we go from here? The critical point must be to address the issue of deficits. We have heard a plea for them to be written off. We have all got local deficits and we all think that it would be nice if that were done. If that happened in aggregate, it would not be clear where the money would come from. My judgment is that trusts need far longer to adjust where there is financial imbalance. The manic pace of reform and the constant revolution that is creating the instability must be addressed. It might be that trusts need to adjust and that better financial control is needed. Doing all these things rapidly and at the same time is not a rational way to manage the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/13">Debates such as this are helpful because rather than dealing in generalities we are dealing in specifics. Many of the specifics that have been raised in a constructive and cross-party manner illustrate broader points about national policy and the instability that the constant reform is creating, not only in west London, but in the NHS as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.0/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity for the first time to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Taylor.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> on securing a debate that is important for him, his constituents and those who are equally affected by the issue. It is also timely, given the pressures of decision and the pent-up demands and concerns that exist. I thought his speech was particularly eloquent and discerning. It is clear that he has been unflinching in holding the health service to account at a local and departmental level on behalf of his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/3">We all know that my hon. Friend is a doughty campaigner for Harefield hospital and for Mount Vernon and its cancer centre. I, too, would add our party's tribute to the Heart of Harefield campaign and Jean Brett, and, equally, to all that has been going on at Mount Vernon, which is also world renowned.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/4">I think that my hon. Friend is the first person who has put on record, at last and through Nietzsche&mdash;as he says, it is power not truth&mdash;the real definition of the word spin. We have sought that for a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/5">It was equally powerful to see the three hon. Members who represent the area working in such close tandem and harmony on the issues. Such an approach needs to be taken on behalf of constituents and their interests, if we are to be genuine as politicians in saying that we want a patient-led NHS rather than a politics-led one. I hope that many will follow the example that has been in evidence in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood rightly emphasised that the cuts that the Strategic Health Authority is making in his area are not, as everyone would wish, as a result of patient choice or strategic health planning. We can all understand the pressures, but they are more of a simple knee-jerk response to the deficits that are faced in the NHS, especially the one created by Hillingdon PCT.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/7">I am glad to have the opportunity to cross swords with the Minister, although that phrase does not seem particularly appropriate given all that is being said. We had our first engagement in the debate on the Floor of the House about PCT restructuring yesterday. Many of the points made then are wholly appropriate to today's discussion. There was a lack of conclusiveness about yesterday's debate because for some reason, which I fail to understand, the Government did not agree with the official Opposition's motion, which would have helped us reach the answer. There was a small exchange during the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/8">At month six of the current financial year, Hillingdon PCT was predicting a year-end deficit of &pound;25.6 million&mdash;that was helpfully confirmed by the Minister&mdash;which is almost double the 2004&ndash;05 outturn. Some &pound;25.6 million represents 9.1 per cent. of its annual turnover. We do not know how high the figure has risen since then, as the Secretary of State, having published the figures once this year, is sitting on the updates.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/9">Interestingly, the Royal College of Nursing recently estimated that the expected deficit across the NHS has risen from approximately &pound;800 million in month six to &pound;1.2 billion gross now. By that reckoning, it is not unreasonable to suppose that Hillingdon PCT could be facing a year-end deficit of &pound;30 million&mdash;a figure mentioned earlier&mdash;or &pound;35 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/10">That is important because the Strategic Health Authority's recent board paper gives a month seven figure. It shows a marked drop in the deficit, which is why it is so baffling. We must ensure that we are talking about the right scale of figures. There are consequences of the deficits, about which we debate endlessly and about which Opposition Members rightly seek to hold Ministers and the Government to account. There seems to be a serious threat of implementation of a series of front-line patient service cuts. I accept that it might be that an extract does not necessarily tell me whether I am looking at a gross or a net figure. However, the board paper gives a month seven figure of &pound;12 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/11">We must try to get a handle on the matter. The Government have refused to publish more estimates of the NHS financial position&mdash;I know that it is currently an uncomfortable position for them. They said it was</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/12" class="indent">&quot;not appropriate to publish the data&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 469W.]&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/13">I simply ask the Department to consider carefully revising that. Many of our debates will be hugely dependent in terms of the options and the outturns on the real expectation of the figures. If the Department is working from one set of figures because it has internal, private information and we are examining another set of figures that they have published at month six, we are grave danger of having a false debate. That would be of no benefit to anybody's constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/14">We must ask ourselves where the deficit has come from. In no small part the problem has been caused by the disaster that was the Paddington health campus. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> mentioned a catastrophe. We eagerly await the National Audit Office's report into the fiasco. In the meantime, some fairly severe criticisms can be levelled at the North London West London Strategic Health Authority, the Department of Health and the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/15">If fault, or if a cause, is found in the design and implementation of policy, that would be the fault of Government. What flows from that is that the damage should not be visited on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1893" name="John Randall">the constituents of my hon. Friends the Members for Ruislip-Northwood and for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> or of the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/16">There is a thing in Government called the Contingencies Fund, albeit funded by the taxpayer; it is still taxpayer cost. It does not exist only for unpredicted events that need to be funded. Anyone who has been in business&mdash;my two hon. Friends to whom I referred have&mdash;knows that it is a valid and important self-insurance policy. The self-insurance should be used when the promoter of a policy has found that it is the cause of the fault. Blame should not always fall on the PCTs so that local people take the rap for a design fault by central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/17">As my hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip-Northwood referred in depth to the report, I will just pick out a couple of themes that run through it and apply them more generally. In addition, the Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase>, is currently absent, which is understandable as he needs to vote further down the Corridor; I fully support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/18">The independent review panel directly criticised the North West London SHA by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The extent of the problem (overcapacity in the SHA) was already becoming evident during 2004 . . . yet this was not used as an opportunity to fundamentally reassess the project's continued relevance&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/20">Instead, the SHA again unquestioningly signed off the outline business case.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/21">Such an attitude in SHAs across the country has led to the imposition of turnaround teams, at vast and avoidable cost to the taxpayer. The taxpayer has to fund the turnaround teams because of the complete failure of the people who have been employed, also at taxpayers' expense, by the NHS to performance manage&mdash;their single task. If they failed at that, they should be sacked so we would not have to pay twice. Such a situation has happened in trusts up and down the country&mdash;we know which ones. The SHAs have failed time and again in their performance management responsibilities. Clearly, as we have often argued, they should be scrapped. You and I, Mr. Taylor, had an exchange on the Floor of the House yesterday on that very matter. If they are not up to the task and have no other function, we can see no justification for retaining them.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/22">The Treasury and the Department of Health are each partly responsible for the fiasco. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury had concerns about the project as far back as October 2003, and that led to an independent review, which was not followed up. In January 2005, a Department of Health official wrote to the trusts inviting them to consider project termination, but that, too, was not pursued. I salute the hon. Members who are here today for their concern, and their measured criticism of a very sorry chapter, when they could well have been shrill.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/23">The trusts received different signals from different parts of the Department of Health about whether new space standards for beds were mandatory. According to the independent review panel, the project was also undermined by uncertainty about payment by results. At least that uncertainty has been resolved, albeit with effective stealth cuts for PCTs and acute trusts, as tariff increases beyond the rate of allocation increase. Stealth cuts in funding lead to cuts in patient services, as yesterday's press release from the six NHS organisations in Gloucester recognises. They face, as they put it, &quot;difficult choices&quot; over the coming months; a clear euphemism for cuts in patient services.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.0/24">Uncertainty is a common theme in today's NHS. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">The hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> made the valid point that that is causing deep instability, which is evident in the ongoing debates about drugs, practice-based commissioning and reforms to adult social care. It is especially apparent in the current farce of PCT restructuring, a departmental initiative with direct bearing on the provision of health services in west London. Nobody in the profession&mdash;apparently nobody in the Department, official or Minister&mdash;has a clue what the function of the new PCTs is to be, so to talk about restructuring now is farcical. Not only is the situation creating uncertainty among health professionals, it is seriously hampering joined-up local government, because social services and other council agencies involved in health have no idea who or what they might be working with in the near future.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.0/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman acknowledges that in London the proposed primary care trust will remain coterminous with local authorities, as I said yesterday. The main influence in London was the benefits to local people from that coterminosity. I hope that he will accept that that is the case.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.301.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="301"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h03.htm#60208h03_spnew32">
	<p pid="a.301.1/1">I certainly accept that. However, I am conscious that the west London area is not far from the edge of London, and that is where the knock-on effect is creating uncertainty. The one thing that can be said about a health economy is that it does not fit easily between the convenient lines that Whitehall departments might like to draw for it. While that might be a challenge, it should not be a driver for the way in which services are provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/2">Most gallingly for the taxpayer, no responsibility seems to have been taken for the colossal waste of money; &pound;14 million of taxpayers' money was spent on the Paddington health campus project, a sum dwarfed by the opportunity cost to the nation as a whole, due to building inflation over the long duration of the project, itself a consequence of unproductive effort. Let us hope that, once the Public Accounts Committee has looked into the National Audit Office's report, which we hope will be published at Easter, the Secretary of State will be prepared to give a proper account of what went on. She should acknowledge that on this occasion the Government have made a mistake, and accept the consequences, so that local patient services are not cut.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/3">It is not only Hillingdon that has accrued a huge deficit. Among others, Hammersmith hospitals trust is running at a deficit of some &pound;36 million, which the Prime Minister has acknowledged, although he is inclined&mdash;I suspect that the Minister might reflect his habit in her response&mdash;to shift the blame for such deficits back to the PCT, rather than recognising the accountability of Government. I hope that I demonstrated what would be my approach when we discussed the matter yesterday on the Floor of the House. In response to a parliamentary question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1610" name="Greg Hands">my hon. Friend the Member for Hammersmith and Fulham (Mr. Hands)</phrase>, the Prime Minister said that the obligation to correct the deficit</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/4" class="indent">&quot;applies to not only the Government, but the trusts, which must provide proper financial management&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-11">11 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 282.]</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/5">We would agree with him if only the trusts did that, but the Government's structures do not foster proper financial management. Leaving aside the fact that they continually decide on structures before they have sorted out functions, they seem incapable of holding officials accountable, so we have chief executives conveniently resigning or suffering from ill health while deficits balloon.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/6">The problems in west London will not be solved until the institutional problems in the NHS are solved. North West London strategic health authority has presided over the biggest PFI disaster so far, and it continues to drag its feet over the future of health care in north-west London. No plans have been published and there has been a complete abdication of commitment to public or patient involvement, even though it appears to be considering various options. That stands in stark contrast to the facts that we know west London to be a most active area, in which patients and public continually make successful and admirable efforts to ensure that their views are heard. The hon. Members representing them here today have demonstrated the same commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.1/7">Changes in hospital structure should be driven by genuine changes in demand, not bureaucratic plans. Until the Government realise that and pass that knowledge down to their administrative bodies, we cannot hope for anything other than a continuation of the current crisis and its inevitable conclusion; cuts to patient services.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.0/1">It is a pleasure to be here under your guidance and leadership, Mr. Taylor. I am sure that you will join me in wishing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1932" name="David Cameron">the right hon. Member for Witney (Mr. Cameron)</phrase> a successful visit to Charing Cross hospital where, no doubt, he is receiving treatment for the wounds that he received today at Prime Minister's questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/2">I join all hon. Members who have spoken this afternoon in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1792" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood (Mr. Hurd)</phrase> on having secured the debate. I know that he feels strongly about the issue. He spoke forcefully about what he perceives to be a lack of leadership and a lack of willingness to listen to local concerns, which was a theme of contributions this afternoon. I want to respond directly to some of his points. I acknowledge the strength of the international reputation of the clinicians who work at Harefield hospital. Indeed, I join with those who pay tribute to all NHS staff who work in the area. I know that they are committed to improving the quality of local services.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/3">I also acknowledge that the historical lack of investment in Harefield hospital has resulted in poor facilities and a long-standing uncertainty about its future. That lack of investment goes back over a long period. Failure to reach a definitive decision about the future of&mdash;for example&mdash;surgical services at Harefield will lead to a further decline in morale, with the inevitable loss of commitment to the trust. That would, in turn, threaten the quality of clinical services. The current uncertainties stem from 2004, when the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS trust contacted the strategic health authority because of concerns about the surgical services provided at Harefield. The trust was concerned about the persisting discrepancy between the respective post-operative wound infection rates at Brompton and Harefield. That is something in which I have an interest, and I was glad to be able to read about it in the briefing for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/4">In addition, there were reported differences between the two sites in early survival rates following coronary artery bypass graft, surgery and aortic valve replacement. There is also a recognised difficulty in accessing appropriate sub-speciality support for emergency conditions arising in Harefield patients following surgery. All of those matters are serious, and it is appropriate that we take time to consider the options for improvement. Hon. Members will know that a 90-day review has been undertaken by the Royal Brompton and Harefield trust into the short-term issues raised by the clinical governance report and the long-term development of the service. That report is due shortly and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on it while I am awaiting its results.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/5">Broadly, I agree that we need to base decisions about the future of important hospitals such as Harefield on whatever should lead to the provision of the best service to patients. I am more than happy to receive representations from hon. Members&mdash;I always do&mdash;about any concerns arising from the discussions that are taking place locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.0/6">The hon. Gentleman talked about Mount Vernon cancer centre&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.303.1/1">In my time as a candidate and as a newly elected Member of Parliament I became used to working closely with the kind of groups that have been described. I well know how dedicated local volunteers can be when campaigning for improvements in local health services, and I would be happy to meet a delegation if hon. Members wanted to bring one.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/2">The burns service at Mount Vernon is currently housed in temporary buildings. I know that it is a complex site; the hospital is a general acute hospital, but housed there are the West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust's burns and plastic surgery services and the cancer services provided by East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust. I accept the point made by the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood about the complexity of those sorts of service configurations.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/3">The Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire strategic health authority feels that the condition of the buildings means that they are not suitable for the delivery of 21st century care. The hon. Gentleman probably agrees on that point. A project board is considering a short-term replacement build and where it should be, and is receiving representations from the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire SHA, the North West London SHA, Hillingdon and Harrow PCTs and Community Voice. A lot of discussion is going on, and I assure hon. Members that I take a close personal interest in that debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/4">One of the biggest reviews of how and where health services are delivered to more than 1.9 million people in the capital is being carried out by the North West London strategic health authority. Notwithstanding the criticisms that have been levied today, I believe that is the appropriate place for these discussions, although I am following them closely.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/5">The hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood asked about the financial position at Hillingdon PCT. I said that I would receive representations on such issues. He asked detailed questions about dental allocations and raised concerns about dentistry. Rather than spend time today trying to answer questions about an area on which I am not most expert, it is better that I should write a detailed response to him. However, I agree that it is desirable that there should be a clarity of intent regarding the development of services in west and north-west London.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/6">The hon. Gentleman asked about specialist trusts. We support the development of specialist trusts and recognise that the UK's reputation of being at the leading edge of health service developments, new treatments and new medication comes from the quality of our specialist services. Indeed, I have a specialist trust in my constituency in Liverpool; a cardiothoracic centre. There is no animosity in the Government toward specialist trusts. The challenge that faces the NHS in west London is the same as that facing the NHS anywhere; not only how to maintain the clinical excellence and the services that are being provided in a rapidly changing environment, but how to do this in a way that maximises access and convenience to patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/7">What patients really care about is not how many beds are available to them locally, but that they can get high-quality care when they need it. It is worth me saying this, and I like saying it, so I shall take the opportunity to do so: under this Government, waiting lists are at a record low. The NHS is not in the crisis that it is too often portrayed as being in. Waiting times for operations have fallen to a maximum of 6 months, and 97 per cent. of people who go to an accident and emergency unit, even in west London, wait for less than four hours either to have their treatment determined, to be admitted to hospital or to be sent home. Death rates from heart disease are down by 27 per cent. since 1996 and death rates from cancer are down by 12 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/8">It is important that we recognise that bed numbers will decrease overall as the NHS uses beds more efficiently and provides more care closer to home, but where we need more beds, there are more beds. The number of critical care beds is 35 per cent. higher than in January 2000. In an environment in which NHS spending has more than doubled since 1997, bringing more doctors and nurses and better facilities, the intention of Government policy is now to bring about a similar revolution in the quality of care to that which has taken place with the quantity of care.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/9">Following the termination of the Paddington health campus scheme, the North West London SHA is undertaking a sector strategy review. Health services cannot remain static; they must change to meet medical advances and developments in clinical practice, as well as the wider interests of patients. The review is in its early stages. I understand that it aims to develop a 10 to 15 year strategy for health services in north-west London. Those services need to be not only high quality, but accessible to the patients who need them, in line with the recommendations of the recently published White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/10">As the hon. Member for Ruislip-Northwood is aware, many of the buildings that we are discussing provide health care in poor quality conditions. Almost a third of them were built before 1948, when the NHS was set up. I am talking not just about the facilities at Hillingdon, but about those described by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1559" name="Andrew Slaughter">my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush (Mr. Slaughter)</phrase>, which serve his constituency. Patients have the right to expect that health services will be provided in modern, fit-for-purpose facilities. That is why the strategy that is being developed considers options that will enable local services to be delivered in the best possible way.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/11">Hon. Members asked several questions, which I shall seek to answer now. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, Acton and Shepherd's Bush asked about the finances of the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust. I have received representations on many such matters since taking responsibility for services in London. The Under-Secretary of State for International Development, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1619" name="Gareth Thomas">my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, West (Mr. Thomas)</phrase> regularly speaks to me about such issues in the corridors. He would want me to remind hon. Members of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/12">The Hammersmith trust has worked hard to identify how it can reduce its costs while treating more patients and maintaining high clinical standards. I seek to reassure colleagues that where there are deficits, the work of the turnaround teams is not to cut services simply to make financial savings. I applaud the approach of the Hammersmith trust, which has worked hard to identify how it can reduce its costs. In the past 18 months, doctors, nurses and managers there have improved efficiency by reducing the length of stays, minimising inappropriate referrals, undertaking more day surgery, developing and implementing innovative care for patients, reducing dependence on locum and agency staff, better bed management, reducing hospital-acquired infections and on more effective prescribing. They have also sought to maximise income from additional activity where possible. All of those results are real improvements for patients.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.1/1">This probably qualifies as the most obscure Adjournment debate that I have had the pleasure of introducing in my time in the House, but the subject is important locally. Let me state clearly at the beginning that my objective in initiating the debate is to secure the removal of a highly intrusive electricity pylon in a prominent place in the area of outstanding natural beauty outside Lewes at Southerham in my constituency&mdash;a pylon that the Department of Transport, a predecessor to the present Department, caused to be put there, and which intended works to the A27 between Southerham and Beddingham provide an opportunity to remove.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/2">In 1974, a need was identified to provide a temporary diversion of an underground cable. I am talking about the moving of a 132,000 kV cable to facilitate the then A27 Southerham bypass. Seeboard&mdash;the South Eastern Electricity Board, as it then was&mdash;suggested a permanent overhead diversion. That was unanimously opposed by the local people and by the relevant local councils: Lewes district council and East Sussex county council. Seeboard then took the only available course, which was to publicise a temporary diversion. Notice of the diversion appeared in the <i>Sussex Express &amp; County Herald </i>on <phrase class="date" code="1975-02-07">7 February 1975</phrase>, and the statutory notice from Seeboard included the following paragraph:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The diversion is temporary and is necessary to facilitate the construction of the proposed Southerham By-Pass road and will be removed within one year of completion of road construction works.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/4">That was the official notice in 1975. Thirty-one years on&mdash;the anniversary has just passed&mdash;we are still waiting for the pylon to be removed. The powers that be, notably the Department of Transport, let us down, because that pylon is still there.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/5">I have always recognised&mdash;it was recognised at the time&mdash;that moving an underground cable or having an underground cable rather than an overhead one was more expensive. It can be 11 to 15 times more expensive. However, even in those days, when environmental awareness was less than it is now, there was a strong desire in the local population to have the cable undergrounded because of the picturesque views of the downs and the special nature of the landscape there.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/6">The cost of alterations to the electricity network and the reinstatement of the underground cable were to fall to the Department of Transport. That was quite proper, as it was the Department of Transport that caused the cable to be moved in the first place. The estimated cost in 1976 of removing the temporary pylon and reinstating the underground line, as was promised in the statutory notice in 1975, was &pound;84,000. What happened next was less satisfactory and caused some unhappiness. We are talking about a predecessor Department under a previous Prime Minister and regime and about something that happened a long time ago, so I am not criticising this Minister; I hope he takes that as read.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/7">On <phrase class="date" code="1977-02-11">11 February 1977</phrase>, Seeboard's wayleave officer for the Sussex area, Malcolm Hearn-Grinham, who is still one of my constituents, I am happy to say, and who helped me to prepare for the debate, was instructed to attend a meeting at East Sussex planning department in Lewes. He was not briefed on the subject of the meeting beforehand and assumed that it concerned a proposed wood pole overhead line elsewhere in his area. However, on arriving at county hall, he was surprised at the seniority and number of Department of Transport representatives at the meeting. It was made clear to him at that point that the subject of the meeting was highly confidential.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/8">The meeting was to inform Mr. Hearn-Grinham, and through him Seeboard, that the Department of Transport intended to retain the overhead line at Southerham, notwithstanding its promise and the statutory notice, which had been published in the local paper not long beforehand. As the relevant Electricity Act required consents from landowners, occupiers and the Secretary of State for Energy to alter the current temporary consents, only Seeboard could carry out the required negotiations, and Mr. Hearn-Grinham was sent away to do so under instructions, in effect, from the Department of Transport. He protested at the meeting that the proposal was completely out of the question. It was contrary to the statutory notice and he had met with uncompromising objections to the original diversion proposals from the landowners and the local authorities. Mr. Hearn-Grinham also pointed out that Seeboard had nothing to gain by retaining the overhead line, except bad publicity and problems in PR terms, and that organisation was, of course, part of the state at that time. He said that it was unacceptable to put Seeboard in that position, but he was told away to go and do it. He reported the details of the meeting to his senior engineering manager, who referred the matter to Seeboard headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/9">It is clear that the decision to overturn the statutory notice and the temporary pylon originated from the Department of Transport, and the clear motive in doing so was to save the &pound;84,000 that it would have cost at the time to reinstate the underground line. An official notice was published to overturn the previous notice. It was published not in the local paper but in a paper that circulates in an entirely different area, which was an attempt, in my view, to prevent local people from knowing that a U-turn was about to be undertaken. The notice was published in the <i>Mid Sussex Times</i>, which circulated, at the nearest point, about six or seven miles north of Lewes and was not the paper in which the original notice appeared. As I said, I believe that what occurred was deliberate.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/10">On <phrase class="date" code="1977-04-28">28 April 1977</phrase>, a representative of Strutt &amp; Parker, the chartered surveyors representing the trustees of Firle estate, on whose land the pylon sits, approached Seeboard's Sussex engineering group to discuss the conversion of the terminable wayleave covering the temporary overhead line to a permanent easement. The standard valuation principle for overhead line easements applied by the electricity supply industry is based on 20 times the annual wayleave payments. That formula takes into account rental, compensation for loss of crops and so on. In this case, the easement value for the section of overhead line and pylons to be included in the easement, based on the standard formula, would have been &pound;2,900. The Strutt &amp; Parker agent was not prepared to grant Seeboard an easement for that &quot;very low sum&quot; and said that he had been informed&mdash;he did not say by whom&mdash;that a far higher figure would be offered. That was contrary to the standard formula and contrary to Seeboard policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/11">In the event, negotiations were presumably carried out by the Department of Transport, not by Seeboard, and the easement was completed to the sum of &pound;9,750 by Seeboard's legal department and the money reimbursed by the Department of Transport. In other words, the figure of &pound;2,900 was multiplied by three or three and a half to get to the figure that was finally paid out. Of course, for the Department of Transport, a sum of less than &pound;10,000 represents considerably better value than one of &pound;84,000, which is what it was previously committed to in order to reinstate the pylon as an underground cable.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/12">It is clear to me that the Department of Transport participated in, and almost certainly instigated, what can only be described as a grubby act designed to save money at the expense of the environment. It was prepared to go back on its publicly agreed position, stated in a statutory notice in the local paper, and, it seems, to offer what amounts to a bribe to the local landowner to accept a higher amount of money than would otherwise have been the case for the pylon to remain in situ.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/13">That was a long time ago and no one can hold anyone who is in office now in any way responsible for what happened, but I do argue to the Minister that the Department for Transport, as the successor body to the Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions and various other incarnations of the Department, has a moral duty to remedy the historical injustice. I argue that the A27 works that are planned by the Government&mdash;which, incidentally, I by and large support in the proposed configuration; I thank the Minister for that&mdash;present an opportunity to right a historical wrong. The area of land in question will be subject to the A27 works.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/14">Let me outline the actions that I have taken since all this became apparent. I wrote at the end of 2004 to the Highways Agency. I wrote again on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-04">4 April 2005</phrase> to Ing Fischer at the Highways Agency. He is a splendid officer, by the way. He is off to Kent and I am sorry that we are losing him. He has been exceedingly helpful and very efficient in his job for the agency. I also wrote to Vincent de Rivaz, the chief executive of EDF Energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/15">On <phrase class="date" code="">18 May</phrase>, the Highways Agency looked into the issue and came back with the information that EDF, as a successor body to Seeboard, had provided an estimate of &pound;1 million for undergrounding the cable. The Highways Agency said that the A27 budget, as constructed, would not cover that sum, but it was sympathetic and said that it would refer the matter on to the Department for Transport for further consideration. EDF said that essentially it was not its problem and I have some sympathy with that. It is merely undertaking what it is required to do. It said that the overhead line and tower in question are fully operational and therefore it has no interest in moving them and I understand that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/16">The &pound;1 million quoted is not an accurate figure and has subsequently been revised downwards to &pound;800,000. It took no account of the opportunity savings that the A27 works present, nor did it take account of the fact that ducts were already in place under the relevant bridge and were put there to enable the underground cable to be reinstated. That work has already been done. I can confirm that the ducts are still under the bridge, waiting for the underground cable, 31 years on. I wrote back to EDF in July and had a meeting in August. EDF subsequently wrote to me and said:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/17" class="indent">&quot;We would be happy to undertake relocation of this equipment if . . . funded to do so by the Department for Transport&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/18">That may not surprise the Minister, but that is the official position that it has set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/19">In parallel, I wrote to the Secretary of State for Transport setting out the position and asking for the Department for Transport to take a sympathetic view, given the history that I set out in my letter. I received a response from the Minister of State about a month later. He referred to the figure of &pound;1 million, which, as I have already said, is inaccurate. He also referred to money from the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets that might be used to provide for some undergrounding of cables in AONBs. Although I was grateful for that information, I felt that there was no attempt to recognise that the Department for Transport has a moral duty in this matter, given the history that I have set out. I do not think that the Minister will dispute that history, although perhaps he will. If he accepts the accuracy of what I have said, there is a duty on the Department for Transport to be helpful and to try to remedy the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/20">In pursuit of the Ofgem money, I wrote to the South Downs joint committee, which has responsibility for advising on these matters. I received a response from the planning officer, Nathaniel Belderson, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January</phrase>, just two or three weeks ago:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/21" class="indent">&quot;I agree that the pylon . . . does have a detrimental impact on the AONB and would support the principle of its eventual removal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/22">As the Minister may be aware, the issue was raised at the recent public inquiry into the A27 works between Southerham and Beddingham and the proposed scheme there. It was raised by one of my constituents, Sy Morse-Brown. I will be interested to see whether the inspector takes that on board in his final report. Perhaps the Minister will say when he expects that report to be published.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/23">The pylon should have been removed 30 years ago. That was the undertaking given by the predecessor Department, the Department of Transport. It was not removed because of dealings by that Department to avoid its responsibilities and to save a small amount of public money. In doing that, it left an electricity pylon that is a scar on the landscape, is in a temporary and, in my view, not terribly stable position&mdash;it is on the edge of a cliff&mdash;and is visible for miles around. The Government have properly laid great stress on AONBs. I do not know whether the Minister has seen the pylon, but I know that his boss has because he was down to look at the road scheme. The pylon is ghastly. It is probably the worst example of a pylon that I have seen in a sensitive landscape. Aside from the issue of justice, that is why I wanted to raise the matter today.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/24">The pylon needs to be moved and the A27 works provide the opportunity to do that. Will the Minister seriously consider what the additional costs would be of removing the pylon as part of the A27 works? The EDF figure was worked out on the back on an envelope. It has already been reduced by 20 per cent. after being challenged. Workmen on the site might need to move the pylon slightly anyway as part of the works. It is only right for the pylon to be moved at that juncture, as part of those A27 works. If it is not moved as part of those works, the cost of leaving it there and dealing with it later will be even more enormous. Dealing with it later may also cause disruption to the highway and it is important that we have a free flow of traffic along the A27.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/25">EDF says that it will not provide the funding. After all, why should it? I have some sympathy. I would like it to make a contribution out of good will, but I cannot really argue that it should. EDF is not responsible for the pylon's being there. The only moral duty it has relates to caving in to Department of Transport pressure in the 1970s, rather than standing up for what it believed was right, but, apart from that, it does not have a responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/26">The South Downs joint committee believes that it is unlikely that money will be forthcoming from Ofgem, although that may be one of the hopes that the Minister holds out. The letter from the planning officer says:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/27" class="indent">&quot;Due to the cost of undergrounding 132Kv lines such as the one at Southerham it was agreed by the steering group that the current allowance effectively ruled out such lines as it would equate to one pylon per AONB and the cost per kilometre would exceed the guidelines set by Ofgem.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/28">Ofgem's guidelines allow lesser lines to be undergrounded, but they do not deal with major lines and therefore there is little hope that, in the foreseeable future, Ofgem will deliver the undergrounding of the line from the money set aside in its budget of &pound;7.7 million for such purposes. However, I hope that it will and I suppose that that is the backstop position if the Minister will not help.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/29">Money can be found for undergrounding lines. The Minister may be aware of a recent announcement relating to the Olympics, which I happened to pick up from <i>The Sunday Times</i>. The article states:</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/30" class="indent">&quot;The &pound;70 million award . . . is the first stage of a &pound;200 million project that will see more than 50 huge pylons&mdash;some higher than City Hall and which dominate the skyline&mdash;removed from the area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/31">It seems that there is money from the public sector for some pylon removal, where appropriate. I am happy that pylons are being removed in east London. I hope that that helps the Olympic project and makes it more viable. However, if pylons can be removed from east London, they can be removed from AONBs in sensitive locations in East Sussex. The Minister and his Department have a moral obligation to help to ensure that that removal takes place.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> on securing the debate, which is on an issue of great concern and interest to him. I am, of course, aware of the environmental sensitivities surrounding that area near Lewes, which lies in an area of outstanding natural beauty, scheduled to become part of the South Downs national park. Indeed, the preparation work on the A27 Southerham to Beddingham scheme, which he has welcomed, has been undertaken with regard to national park designation, although the final decision has yet to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/2">The south coast multi-modal study recommended in 2002 that the section of the A27 from Southerham to Beddingham, between Lewes and Polegate, should be a dual carriageway. However, Ministers considered that the environmental effect that that would have on the landscape was too severe and, in 2004, decided that the important safety scheme to remove a high-risk level crossing should be scaled down to a single carriageway, with two lanes westbound and a single lane eastbound. We have now been able to take forward a scheme through the draft orders stage, to a public inquiry. It has a reduced environmental impact on the area of outstanding natural beauty while still providing the safety benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/3">Environmental considerations have been at the forefront of our thinking on that scheme and that includes the issue of the pylon carrying the electricity supply cables at Southerham. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that we have to consider costs. The costs we have heard about today vary between &pound;800,000 and &pound;1 million. The costs attached to diverting the 132 kV overhead supply carried to the pylon are still sizeable, and high in relation to the &pound;18.3 million cost of the A27 scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/4">There are also a number of competing cost pressures on the Highways Agency's targeted programme of improvements. The improvements proposed to the A27 do not affect the existing cable route, so the agency does not need to divert the supply, and it does not need to move the pylon that carries it.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/5">I am not in a position to comment further on whether the diversion of the cables underground should be undertaken. The public inquiry into the A27 improvement proposals finished in early November last year. Southerham residents appeared at the inquiry, gave evidence to the inspector on the issue and asked him to recommend that the diversion underground should be provided. The hon. Gentleman asked about the timetable. We should receive the inspector's report before the end of February, and we anticipate the decision of the Secretary of State some time during the spring. I cannot confirm the absolute time scale, but that is roughly what is envisaged.</p>

	<p pid="a.311.1/1">I am not aware that we would normally do that, but I shall check and get back to the hon.

The events took place around 30 years ago. The 132 kV underground cable at Southerham was diverted overhead on a temporary diversion to enable the construction of the eastern end of the Lewes bypass. It is also known that the temporary diversion was subsequently made permanent through due process and that the decision to do so was unsuccessfully challenged in the early 1980s. The permanent diversion is therefore now legally in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/3">As I said, Ministers have to decide formally on any recommendation made by the A27 inquiry inspector, but the cables and pylon now form part of the permanent route that does not need further diversion. Furthermore, I am informed that the supply company, EDF Energy, does not have any operational reasons for diverting the supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/4">The hon. Gentleman referred to the fact that Ofgem has a scheme of grants to be used to place overground cables underground when there are environmental gains to be made. Although the Highways Agency and EDF have no current reason to divert supply, I am aware that together with the South Downs joint committee, which is the authority responsible for this area of outstanding natural beauty, they continue to be involved in the pursuit of possible grants for the work. We have given proper consideration to the issue of the Southerham pylon and we are aware of the environmental sensitivities locally, as evidenced by the scheme we have developed for the A27 between Southerham and Beddingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.311.1/5">We can only speculate as to what the intentions might have been 30 years ago. The cable diversion route has now formally been made permanent. It does not need a further diversion as part of the current road proposals, or for any operational reasons of the electricity company. To return to the hon. Gentleman's point about the inquiry and the inspector, the inspector cannot review any evidence after the closure of the inquiry, but the debate will be taken into consideration as part of the Secretary of State's decision. In the light of what I have said, and the inquiry, we shall have to wait for Ministers' decisions based on the inspector's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.0/1">The Minister's response is reasonable, but if he accepts the logic of my position, he accepts the historical accuracy of my version of events. He has not queried that in any way. I hope that he would accept that the Department has a moral duty to deal with such matters. It is not simply a question of a permanent pylon being there that I want to be moved; the pylon is there because of the Department of Transport's improper behaviour 30 years ago. That is what I want the Minister to address. Will he look into the version of events I have given?</p>

Gentleman makes but it is not possible to know exactly what reasons were behind the decisions made in the 1970s to make the temporary diversion permanent without the information we talked about. Unfortunately, the records from the mid-1970s relating to the statutory undertakers diversions required for the Lewes southern bypass no longer exist. I am also informed that EDF has no details from its predecessors either. It is reported that in the 1970s the cost of diverting the cables underground was &pound;84,000. At that time, that was a significant sum, so it may be reasonable to assume that that was taken into account in coming to a decision, but because the information is not available, it is not possible to say whether that was the only, or deciding, reason.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.1/1">I am delighted to start a few minutes before my allotted time, but I do not intend to keep the House longer than is necessary. I am also delighted to see my hon. Friend the Minister, and I believe he will have some interesting things to say. I make no apologies for reminding the House that I raised a similarly topical debate on this matter in January 2000. It shocked me to realise that that took place six years ago. We have not made a great deal of progress, but I hope that we can now do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/2">Not long ago, the European Parliament's scientific and technological options assessment unit ran an inquiry into the risks posed by the practice of selling chocolate eggs containing small component toys. I do not intend just to talk about chocolate eggs but they are the best-known and, I think, the worst offenders. The inquiry was broken up by a group of MEPs who were, sadly, working under the auspices of at least one manufacturer. There is no doubt within STOA that the disruption was associated with that manufacturer. One member of STOA, the late and greatly missed MEP, Phillip Whitehead, who solidly supported what we were trying to do, was personally threatened. That is totally unacceptable behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/3">In a meeting at the Department of Trade and Industry, officials admitted to a leading medical consultant that they were reluctant to take action on those products because of fear of legal reprisals by manufacturers. However, the official statistics suggest that there have been few incidents of harm caused by embedded items in foodstuffs, so it would appear that they do not have that much to worry about. I shall go on to say that there are more incidents than we would care to imagine throughout Europe. There have been some interesting recent statistics relating to such incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/4">The manufacturers and many others within safety and consumer bodies in the UK and across Europe know that there is a hole in those statistics, and the way in which they are counted. In the UK we have now discontinued the home accident surveillance system survey, which I am very sad about, and in other member states statistics are based on small-scale samples of accident and emergency departments. If a case has been referred to another hospital, or has been resolved at home or in a doctor's surgery, it will not feature in the figures. We have been collecting details of incidents throughout the EU, and the full picture looks very different from the one painted by HASS and its counterparts. Throughout Europe, there have been more than 100 incidents&mdash;many of them unreported&mdash;associated with chocolate egg products alone in recent years. Other products could be mentioned for which no statistics are kept.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/5">One medical school estimates that there could be as many as 2,000 incidents throughout the EU every year. Almost 40&mdash;some fatal&mdash;have been reported in the UK. Recently, the work of the European Child Safety Alliance has been brought to my attention by people who continually lobby me on the issue. I did not know about the group until comparatively recently. From Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January</phrase>, it called for urgent action, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/6" class="indent">&quot;In a statement sent to the EU Emergencies Committee <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-18">18 January 2006</phrase>, a request has been made for a thorough risk assessment, better warnings and an assurance that toys contained in foods are sufficiently large to avoid any risk of causing children to choke.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/7">The report talks about 2,000 child injuries in the EU each year, which confirms the numbers that I was talking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/8">In a letter that was copied to the Gloucestershire trading standards department, one parent wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/9" class="indent">&quot;I was washing up in the kitchen when my eldest son, who is 7, came rushing in and shouted that his younger brother, who is 4, couldn't breathe. I found him turning blue with his eyes bulging. I opened his mouth and saw half of a Kinder egg blocking his air passage. I was unable to remove it with my fingers so I performed a Heimlech manoeuvre and it flew out of his mouth . . . I dread to think what might have happened if my son had been by himself.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/10">That is one parent's testimony.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/11">I have sent questionnaires to all UK accident and emergency departments&mdash;an exponentially larger survey than HASS used itself. The 145 returns&mdash;a significant return, I think everyone would agree&mdash;revealed 10 episodes involving ingestion or an injury from toy parts in chocolate eggs, and experience of 16 episodes not involving hospital treatment. Some 60 per cent. of respondents&mdash;consultants&mdash;believed that the association of chocolate with toys made it more likely that the child would place parts of that toy in his or her mouth.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/12">There is a lot more evidence, much of it compiled by unimpeachable bodies such as the Swedish Consumer Agency. It suggests a strong case for the reassessment of the scale of risk posed by chocolate eggs, toy products or similar products&mdash;a risk described by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents thus:</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The two factors in estimating risk, viz. severity and frequency, put products such as chocolate eggs containing small plastic pieces in an inner casing (all presenting a choking hazard) well outside the level of safety that the legislation demands in our view.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/14">I invite anyone who has had any involvement with the issue or has their own children to consider what is involved with those products. We asked <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1763" name="Kim Howells">my hon. Friend the Member for Pontypridd (Dr. Howells)</phrase>, in a previous life when he had the responsibility which my hon. Friend the Minister has today, to consider Kinder eggs in particular, and he was somewhat taken aback by the nature of those products. They contain very small items that can be put in a child's mouth. The taste and smell of the chocolate would cause the child to do so. Sadly, in one case a child in this country died as a result of swallowing the capsule.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/15">I should like to summarise briefly the regulatory requirements applicable to those products. Article 2 of the directive on toy safety states:</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/16" class="indent">&quot;Toys may be placed on the market only if they do not jeopardise the safety and/or health of users or third parties when they are used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the normal behaviour of children.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/17">The directive requires manufacturers to meet &quot;relevant national standards&quot; based on &quot;essential safety requirements&quot;, and to submit toys&mdash;it obviously dates back&mdash;for &quot;EC-type examination&quot;. UK standards are set out in BS EN 71, which incorporates the European harmonisation standards in relation to, for example, mechanical and physical properties. Essential requirements cover toys, and their component parts, that are clearly intended for use by children under 36 months. They must be of such dimensions to prevent their being swallowed and/or inhaled. Toys, their parts and packaging must not present risks of strangulation or suffocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/18">Such matters are the subject of a live debate in the European Union, with discussions on the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995. Will the problems that I am identifying also be discussed because there is a particular problem with hybrids&mdash;foodstuffs that are also toy products?</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/19">Annex 2 of the directive sets out essential safety requirements, the general principles of which state that the users of toys must be protected against risks of injury to health, when toys are used as intended or in a foreseeable way, bearing in mind the usual behaviour of children. It covers the risks that are connected with the design or construction of the toy, or which are inherent in its use and cannot be eliminated by modifying its construction, without altering its function or depriving it of its essential properties. It states that the degree of risk present in the use of the toy must be commensurate with the ability of the users and their supervisors to cope with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/20">I refer now to eggs and other products on the market. Manufacturers will contend that they are satisfied with the conditions for Comformit&eacute; Europ&eacute;ene approval, citing article 5, which states that, if an article carries CE certification, it can be assumed to satisfy the requirements. The tests to establish mechanical or physical safety include a truncated cylinder test, which is satisfied if the toy cannot completely fit into a cylinder corresponding to the diameter of the trachea. However, given the number of incident reports that I shall call on my hon. Friend the Minister to check, it is arguable that they have been shown to be inadequate, not in a laboratory, but in domestic and hospital conditions, and that they should be subjected to review.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/21">There are prima facie grounds for article 6, which allows for references to the emergencies committee when a member state or the Commission considers that the CE standards do not entirely satisfy the essential requirements to be invoked. Of the 100-plus cases that I have mentioned, there were only two where the victims were under 36 months old. The emphasis is placed on not allowing the products to be consumed by children of that age or younger.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/22">Our concerns are shared by the Consumers Association, the Trading Standards Institute and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents. They fall within the general principles, as it would be reasonably foreseeable that children might place the toys or their container in their mouths and that is normal behaviour. Given the foreseeability of risk and the limited ability of intended users to cope with it, manufacturers are under a duty to take all reasonable steps to limit that risk. Some have done so. For example, Nestl&eacute; withdrew its chocolate egg/toy product and Cadbury changed its Yowie product for UK release&mdash;it has now been withdrawn&mdash;to a solid toy and enlarged capsule to meet the worries voiced by ROSPA and others. However, the market leader, Kinder has refused repeatedly to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/23">Despite representations from consumer and child safety organisations throughout Europe, officials concluded at a meeting convened by the European Commission on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-23">23 January</phrase> that they could not do anything under the existing toy safety directive and that the general product safety directive was the appropriate instrument by which to take action. Given that the GPSD does not apply when sector-specific legislation, such as the toy safety directive, is in place, it represents something of a fudge. I say to the Minister that, at the very least, there is a need for clarification of where the different directives stand. We have been round the course before. I mentioned the matter six years ago and the issue will continue with the threat of fatalities, but more particularly at a minimum level, with the threat of injury to children.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/24">That sets out the case. In light of that, I call on the Minister to undertake his own research to establish whether it is likely that these products have a more serious risk profile than has been suggested by official national statistics, and how many attempted domestic ingestion incidents there might have been where no reference to a practitioner or hospital was involved. That highlights a key point. It is no good counting just the hospital statistics. We need to look at the totality of child choking incidents, and that is difficult to do because we no longer formally count them. If the Minister maintains that the general product safety directive is now relevant, I hope that he will not be averse to the Food Standards Agency running a fresh review to look at the reported incidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/25">It comes as no surprise that the remaining manufacturers have refused to modify their products. They have carried out a very effective&mdash;if not somewhat robust&mdash;lobbying campaign at EU level. However, it remains perplexing that regulators have apparently sat on their hands when they could do more. The Department of Trade and Industry banned flavoured rubbers, and it banned toy bolas balls on the evidence of only a couple of cases of mild bruising. If it was so proactive in those cases, why has it failed to do more in this instance? It could go to the EU to make sure that it is one of the leading lights in demanding a tightening up of the directives. There is confusion over which directive applies in respect of these hybrid products.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/26">We would not be having this debate at all if we were in the United States. Such hybrid products are banned there. There is no truck with those who sell those products&mdash;millions of them&mdash;to young children, given the number of choking incidents. I will carry on in this vein until we at least get clarification and a toughening up of the standards, and I hope the DTI will take the lead in that.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.0/1">I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1850" name="David Drew">my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> has raised this debate in the way that he has done. As he has outlined, he has considerable experience on this issue, and I do not doubt for one second his sincerity in attempting to bring the issue to a head. However, I think we will disappoint my hon. Friend in respect of some of his reasoning.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/2">At the start of my hon. Friend's speech, he made reference to issues involving the European Parliament's scientific and technological options assessment unit, and to Mr. Phillip Whitehead, a former Member of this House who was a good friend of all of us. He is now a prominent MEP specialising in consumer protection and competition. It was my great pleasure to have worked with Phillip on many occasions on issues affecting consumers and competition policy. I am not aware of the issue around the meeting with the DTI that was referred to and of what took place, but I do not doubt that it happened, and that is not how we would want things to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/3">The debate gives us an opportunity to discuss my hon. Friend's concerns about embedded items&mdash;particularly toys&mdash;in food in the wider context of the Government's policy on consumer and toy safety. The UK is one of the safest places in Europe for consumers. My Department regards this as an important issue and is working to improve the situation by ensuring that the regulation of consumer safety is suitably robust and&mdash;importantly&mdash;proportionate. The effectiveness of the toy safety regulations is an integral part of that agenda. Our children deserve the highest level of safety and the regulations and safety standards for individual toys are in place to ensure that toys are safe for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/4">The DTI is fully aware of the concerns about the supply of inedible products in food, and particularly about toys in chocolate eggs. The deaths of the small children that were associated with those products are a tragedy. However, there was no evidence to suggest that the association of the toy with the chocolate egg was a contributory factor in the fatalities. In two cases, the deaths occurred a significant time after consumption of the egg. The important issues are that the toys in food comply with the toy safety regulations on the safety standards for toys and that the packaging is marked with the appropriate warning labelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/5">My hon. Friend has been actively interested in the issue of embedded items, particularly toys in food, for a number of years. He raised it in parliamentary questions, in correspondence with me and my predecessors, and under a ten-minute Bill in 2002. He has also had several meeting with officials from the Department of Trade and Industry and with manufacturers' representatives. I hope that he is fully aware of the seriousness with which the Department and others have considered the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/6">The deeply regrettable incidents to which my hon. Friend referred occurred a number of years ago. I believe that current measures under the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 are sufficient and appropriate for dealing with the potential risks of all toys, including current products. Manufacturers have taken steps to improve the visibility of warning labelling on their products and have made changes to improve the safety of the toys included in the products.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/7">Research previously commissioned by my Department provided no evidence to suggest that toys marketed in the way mentioned pose a greater risk to children than other small toys or toys with small parts. Again, there is the question of proportionality. The DTI research into choking incidents among children under four analysed non-fatal and fatal cases over a 10-year period between 1986 and 1996. The research established that the main causes of choking in under-threes are sweets, coins and food. After the age of three, choking accidents drop sharply. Research showed that, over that 10-year period, toys were involved in about 60 per cent. of non-fatal choking incidents, which is about 166 cases, and about 4 per cent. of fatal accidents, which is seven cases. That compares with 106 fatalities involving food. Although there continue to be reports of individual incidents, there is no new research showing that the products present a greater risk than other small toys. However, I will be interested to look at the evidence that my hon. Friend put to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/8">The leading manufacturer sells 10 billion chocolate eggs every year across the European Union. Over 1 billion are sold in the UK alone, so given the volume of products sold, if these products were a greater risk to children than other small toys, there would be a body of evidence of a demonstrable risk. That body of evidence does not exist. In fact, a recent study proves the opposite: a European survey on foreign body ingestion conducted in 2005 found that 73 per cent. of objects ingested by children aged 0&ndash;14 were of an organic nature, while only 26 per cent. were of an inorganic nature. Only 4 per cent of accidents, fatal and non-fatal, involved toys, and only 0.4 per cent. of accidents involved food products containing inedibles; there were no fatalities.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.0/9">I take the view that the toys supplied in chocolate eggs or other food products are no different from other small toys. All toys must comply with the stringent requirements of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995, which require small toys or toys with small parts to be labelled as unsuitable for children under three. Local authority trading standards officers have the power to take action if they consider a product unsafe. The meaning of &quot;unsafe&quot; extends to the absence of clear warnings and/or instructions. Further measures or restrictions would be disproportionate.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.0/1">My hon. Friend will be aware&mdash;I am sure that his officials will brief him on this&mdash;that the problem with trading standards services taking action is that they need enormous resources to see that action through. I accept that the cases are historical now, but they are not historical elsewhere in Europe, where cases keep coming up. I am sure that they could and will affect the UK unless we do something. Trading standards are taking on the very biggest, and the very biggest have to get their act together, as do the rogue elements out there. Does the Minister agree that that is a problem?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-02-08a.319.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1441" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="319"  time="016:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060208/halltext/60208h05.htm#60208h05_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.319.1/1">I hope that my hon. Friend takes what I say in the right spirit. As Minister with responsibility for consumer affairs, trading standards is a subject on which I want to concentrate. I have worked with the Trading Standards Institute on a range of issues. We need to take a better look at how trading standards are resourced across the country, and how trading standards services fit into the requirements and requests of consumers. The whole focus of our consumer strategy is to empower consumers so that they know their rights, and to have the right regulatory regime in place to deal with enforcement issues. Also, we have to look after the companies that do things right and tackle the rogue companies that do not. My hon. Friend makes a fair point about the role of trading standards, but I have to say that this particular issue has not appeared high up on the agenda in my discussions with the TSI, although I am sure that I can have further discussions with the TSI on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/2">We believe that the enforcement of consumer safety regulations, including for toys, is robust. Systems are in place not only nationally but across the European Union to notify enforcement authorities of products that fail to comply with safety standards. Any risk or hazard relating to any toy quickly comes to light and remedial action is taken to ensure that it is withdrawn from the market. Additionally, as a Minister, I have the power to issue a prohibition notice, banning products that present an immediate risk to consumers. That power is used sparingly, as a proportionate response based on evidence of potential harm. It has been used only once in the past 10 years, when my predecessor, Melanie Johnson, banned yo-balls in April 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/3">As my hon. Friend said, the European Commission considered toys in food and concluded that, although such products could constitute risks, those risks were no different from the ones associated with small toys, or any toys incorporating small parts. It is important to remember that no toys are risk free. It is to be hoped that consumers are now more knowledgeable about the risks of small parts, and of leaving small children to play unsupervised with toys with small parts.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/4">This issue, and the need for further measures related to toys in food, has recently been discussed by European member states and the European Commission as part of the review of the toys safety directive. The Commission's view remains unchanged: in the absence of any body of evidence of risk, toys marketed in that way do not pose a greater risk to children than other small toys, and the current measures in the directive are sufficient. At the moment, I share that view.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/5">To summarise, the Department's policy is to empower and to protect consumers. I believe that regulations put in place to ensure the safety of consumer products are robust and effective, particularly in the area of toys in food.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/6">I understand my hon. Friend's concern about the issue. He has meetings with officials at the Department. I am not against that happening again. I am certainly not against meeting trading standards officers, and the institute itself, to discuss many of those issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.0/1">Would the Minister include in such a meeting the officials who are making representations in Brussels? They are crucial. I sympathise with him, because he does not have the authority to redesign those products. Only Brussels can do that through the directive. It would be useful to know what formal representations are being made to the EU by the Minister's officials.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.1/1">In answer to that direct question, a technical experts meeting took place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-13">13 January</phrase> to discuss the draft text of the new toy directive. The meeting included a specific discussion about toys in food, but that discussion did not lead the Commission to change its mind. Again, the evidence required was not there and had not been submitted by anybody asking for further restrictions. Therefore, there is some difficulty in terms of the communication to the technical experts. Subsequently, the Commission came to the decision that my hon. Friend talked about in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/2">I do not want to be complacent about these issues. If there are real risks, we have to consider them and the proportionality of our response. On the current evidence, we believe that the regulations are robust and proportionate. However, I am sure that my hon. Friend will continue to raise the matter and to provide evidence, which we are happy to consider, as we have done over a period of time. We may agree to disagree on this occasion, but that does not mean that the door is locked shut if evidence is forthcoming. In that spirit, I hope that my hon. Friend accepts my explanation.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/3" class="italic">Question put and agreed to</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/4" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at seven minutes to Five o'clock.</p>
