	<p pid="b.418.2/1">Like other hon. Members present, I been contacted by many constituents on this issue, but I suspect that many more do not realise what is to happen or are only gradually realising and will be contacting MPs more and more. Is it not the case that as well as the obvious effects on incomes, what stimulates their anger is that they feel cheated by what has happened? As my hon. Friend said, the proposal was not in the coalition parties&#8217; manifestos and it was not even in the coalition agreement, so there is no way the Government can claim that they did not know the financial figures and they have to make this cut. They knew what the financial figures were when they did not include the proposal in the coalition agreement, so this is a double betrayal of many women pensioners. Does my hon. Friend agree that as we are now seeing U-turns from the Government daily, perhaps this issue should be the subject of today&#8217;s U-turn?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.420.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40252" speakername="Teresa Pearce" colnum="420"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0001.htm#11051169000332">
	<p pid="b.420.0/1">I certainly do and I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention. It was not that long ago, and it was certainly after the proposal was first made, that if someone went on to the website to look at their pension forecast, it was still set at the old rates. I think that that has been changed now, thank goodness.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/2">As I was saying, there has already been one movement forward so that people have to work longer. Now, there is another one. People are understandably angry about that and feel let down by the Government, because there was a covenant between them and the Government: &#8220;If you pay in, we&#8217;ll do this.&#8221; These people have done their part, but the other part is not coming forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/3">Many people who are approaching state pension age have already taken steps to reduce their hours of employment or have taken on caring duties with elderly parents. Where their children are getting married, they have promised to look after their young grandchildren in the next few years, when their children return to the work force.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/4">One constituent, Susan Harris, from Belvedere, was a teacher for 30 years. In 2005, she took early retirement and a reduced pension. She told me she had made calculations based on when she thought she would receive her state pension. She thought she was making an informed decision&#8212;she was planning. Sadly, she is now one of the unfortunate women facing a two-year loss in pension income. It is not surprising that she feels the Government are being unjust and have broken their promise to her about when she would receive her pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/5">What assessment has the Minister&#8217;s Department made of the proposal&#8217;s effect on the number of unpaid carers and child minders in the UK? The accelerated timetable means that many people who would have taken up caring for relatives or providing child care when they retired so that the next generation could join the work force will not be able to do so, because they will be at work for another two years. The Government must consider that important social policy impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/6">I would also be interested to hear the Minister&#8217;s thoughts on what the proposals will mean for volunteering and the big society. People who have retired are not inactive; they volunteer at local libraries, charity shops and lunch clubs. They also act as school governors and provide much needed care in our communities. If they are kept in the labour market for longer, they are less able to volunteer in those ways. In pushing people to work until they are much older, we are in danger of compromising activity outside the labour market, which we value very much.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/7">It may not be easy for the women affected by the proposal to get another job or to increase their hours to fill the two-year gap, especially at such short notice. I am sure that I am not alone in receiving an increasing number of letters from constituents in their 50s who are willing to take any kind of work, but who are finding it impossible to get a job. It is not easy for people to return to the labour market once they have left, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to hang on to a job in later years, too. If women are expected to work longer, there needs to be work for them to do, and that is particularly important given the current economic situation and the rise in unemployment. In looking for work, these women may well be competing against their own grandchildren in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/8">Many women will not have enough savings to fall back on if they cannot hang on in the labour market. Women who have been employed in low-pay work, or who have taken time out to have children or to act as carers, will have few savings to cover them for the period between when they expected to retire and the proposed state pension date. Those women now face an uncertain future. Will the Minister outline the measures the Government plan to introduce to help them work longer? Will he comment on how women who are not in work are meant to balance their finances in the two-year gap, given that they will be eligible for jobseeker&#8217;s allowance for only six months if they have savings and will not be eligible at all if they have a small occupational pension?</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/9">I want to focus for a moment on women who have worked in low-pay or manual jobs, because class differentials need to be taken into account, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40369" name="Michael Connarty">the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> said. The Minister has defended the accelerated timetable on the basis of fairness and has said that a balance must be struck as life expectancy continues to rise, because we cannot expect the workers and companies of today to shoulder all the costs. However, while overall life expectancy has increased by 5.5% for women and 6.5% for men, it has not increased uniformly, and there are still deep socioeconomic and regional differences in average life expectancy. Office for National Statistics figures show that women&#8217;s life expectancy at the age of 65 is highest in the royal borough of Kensington and Chelsea, where women can expect an additional 26 and a half years. However, in Greenwich and Bexley&#8212;the two London boroughs that cover part of my constituency&#8212;the figures are much lower, at 20 and 21 years respectively. Women&#8217;s life expectancy at 65 is even lower in Glasgow city, where women can expect just an additional 17 and a half years. The 2010 Marmot report into health inequalities found that people living in the poorest areas live seven years less on average than those living in the richest areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/10">Women in poorer areas, many of whom are from working class backgrounds and have been in low-income jobs, will be hardest hit by the accelerated timetable. They are the least financially equipped to deal with the change, and their lower life expectancy means they will get less time to enjoy their retirement. There is also the issue of women manual workers, who will struggle to continue to work if their jobs are physically demanding. A constituent in Plumstead recently wrote to me, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/11">&#8220;It is particularly hard on me because I am a manual worker. I have already been &#8216;pacing myself&#8217; if you like, for my retirement. I don&#8217;t think I will physically be able to continue fork lift driving and hulking boxes around at the later age. If I&#8217;d known I would&#8217;ve changed my job but it&#8217;s too late now. It&#8217;s not fair on me.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/12">I was hoping that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40191" name="Malcolm Wicks">the Member for Croydon North (Malcolm Wicks)</phrase> would be able to make the debate, because he has done some excellent research on the impact that the accelerated timetable will have on men and women of different social classes. I hope the Minister is aware of that research and that the Government will take it into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/13">Although the proposed accelerated timetable directly affects a comparatively small group of women, its impact will be felt more widely. Extended family members may have to contribute financially to help women cover the costs of the period between when they expected to get a pension and when they actually receive it. The change</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/14">will also affect many men of pensionable age because they cannot claim pension credit until their wife or partner reaches pension age. The change will therefore affect the whole household.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/15">The Government need to think carefully about what they are asking of a small group of women who have worked hard all their lives. These women are being told to pay a disproportionate cost with little notice. They have earned a decent retirement, but many fear they will be too old and frail to enjoy it. A constituent from Belvedere wrote to me recently to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/16">&#8220;I have been working since I was 16, have paid all my contributions and was looking forward to enjoying my retirement. But now it looks like I will be too old to do anything except watch telly if they keep altering the age. I suppose the Government does not care about the people who vote them in.&#8221;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.422.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40252" speakername="Teresa Pearce" colnum="422"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0001.htm#11051169000337">
	<p pid="b.422.4/1">I thank both my hon. Friends. That is exactly the point I was coming to. Moving the goalposts at the last minute has implications for public confidence in our pensions system, which has already taken a knock as a result of the changes to public sector workers&#8217; pensions. The unfairness of the Government&#8217;s accelerated timetable could undermine some of the more positive changes in the Pensions Bill. Clauses 4 to 9 are about automatically enrolling people in a workplace pension and creating the national employment savings trust. That is a positive step, which will do much to boost confidence in our pension system and address the low take-up of pensions, particularly among low-income workers.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.4/2">However, the accelerated timetable will make it harder for the Government to achieve that, because people will note that Ministers are happy to change the pension rules at the last minute. That will undermine confidence in the pensions system, which already suffers from low confidence among members of the public. Like the change to public sector pensions, the proposed change undermines public trust. People are likely to think, &#8220;If they move the goalposts again at the last minute, why</p>
	<p pid="b.422.4/3">bother? We may make our contributions now, but who&#8217;s to say the money will be there at the end when we expect it?&#8221; That is the opposite of the Government&#8217;s intentions on pension reform, but it is a distinct possibility. Will the Minister consider that point? I hope he will address it in his closing remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.4/4">The proposal has been developed too quickly. In the past, pensions Bills have been the product of detailed reviews that have taken an holistic approach to pension reform. Pensions policy needs to be planned stage by stage and for the long term through reviews such as the current workplace retirement income commission, which is led by Lord McFall. I am concerned that the Government&#8217;s hasty inclusion of the current proposal in the Pensions Bill will mean that key issues, such as socioeconomic and regional differences in life expectancy, are not given the proper consideration they are due.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.4/5">In making any changes to legislation, the Government should ensure that no group is disproportionately impacted on, and none more so than the post-war generation of women, who have had to battle for rights all their lives&#8212;from the Equal Pay Act 1970 to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Employment Protection Act 1975. Women born in the 1950s have seen so much change that they did not expect to be battling still&#8212;battling against a rapid acceleration of the pension age, which falls purely on their shoulders. I ask the Government to pause and look at the bigger picture before making these unpopular changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.4/6">I hope to show today that the campaign against the Government&#8217;s accelerated timetable has broad support. Earlier this year, I tabled early-day motion 1402 urging the Government to drop the timetable. It has already been signed by 138 Members from all political parties. Charities such as Age UK and companies such as Saga are also campaigning against the accelerated timetable, and it is very rare for the <i>Daily Mail</i> to back something that I am saying, so we really do have broad support. Some 10,000 people have signed the Unions Together &#8220;Hands Off Our Pensions!&#8221; petition, and I can see that many of them have contacted their local MP to ask them to attend the debate today, and I am grateful for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.4/7">I hope that the Minister will consider carefully the points I have raised and those that will be raised by other Members, and, most importantly, listen to the voices of the women themselves. I strongly urge him to drop the unfair plans to accelerate the equalisation of the state pension age&#8212;it is a shabby way to treat Britain&#8217;s grandmothers. People will embrace change, but only if it is implemented slowly and fairly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.426.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40592" speakername="Julie Elliott" colnum="426"  time="009:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0001.htm#11051169000349">
	<p pid="b.426.1/1">I totally agree with my hon. Friend. It is that feeling of injustice&#8212;almost that people have been conned; they thought that they were contributing to one thing, but were getting something else&#8212;that is so stark in these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/2">I shall give a few examples to explain the problems that the proposed changes will make to the lives of many women in my constituency&#8212;and, I am sure, across the country. The first is of a woman who has worked, planned and saved, but will still be caught out. She has done everything that people are being told to do. She has worked from the age of 16, with a couple of intermissions to have children, although in those days maternity provisions were not as good as they are now.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/3">This woman has three small private pensions from her various places of work; in some ways, she is in a good position compared with many, although two of those pensions will be deferred until she is 60. A couple of years ago, her parents became ill. She did all the calculations; she could release the private pension from her current employment, and she had some savings, so she decided that she could manage with her deferred pensions being paid at 60 and her state pension not being paid until she was 63. She did all that, and left work a couple of years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/4">One could argue that my constituent has saved the state money by looking after her ailing parents. However, she now finds that her state pension will be delayed. She has done everything right&#8212;she has worked, saved and contributed&#8212;but is being penalised, and will somehow have to find the shortfall. She is incredibly worried about that. She has never been well paid, but has been cautious in her financial planning.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/5">Another constituent who contacted me is set to lose more than &#163;7,500 of the state pension, something that she has worked hard for over many years. She is now required to work a further 74 weeks. She understandably feels let down by the Government. In her letter, she said that she has worked extremely hard all her life, yet her retirement age seems consistently to move further away. Frankly, the changes to her pension have left her feeling robbed. She is not in good health, and wonders whether she will be fit enough to work those extra years. She may have to go on to benefit, something that she has never wanted.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/6">The third of my constituents to write to me says that she had planned to work until she was 60. She began saving, and started contributing towards her pension when she was 18&#8212;38 years ago. She has worked hard and contributed to society; she paid her taxes and her national insurance contributions. At the age of 56, she was looking forward to a relaxed and financially secure retirement. The Government&#8217;s plans mean that she will now have to work until she is 66, six years longer than she expected. Her health is failing due to the stress of her job, and she is not financially prepared for the change. She wonders how she is meant to prepare for it at such short notice, and why the Government have let her down in this way. I am sure that she also wonders why the Government are going back on their promise in the coalition agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/7">A common theme runs through the letters that I have received from constituents. They do not disagree about the state pension age rising; they recognise that increasing life expectancy makes that logical. However, they say that moving the goalposts at such short notice is creating serious financial harm and causing real worries. As a result, some are considering working beyond their state pension age. However, that should be a choice; it should not be forced on them. Retirement, and especially the age at which people decide to retire, should be about choice, but choice has been stripped from those affected by these changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/8">In my constituency of Sunderland Central, 1,100 women aged between 56 and 57 are among the 33,000 women whose state pension will be delayed by two years. I wrote to the Minister, asking about his plans for the state pension age. In reply, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/9">&#8220;While overall there are some aspects of the change that will affect women more strongly than men, we consider the effect is not disproportionate&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/10">I disagree with him. No man will have to wait longer than a year, but 500,000 women will. If that is not disproportionate, what is?</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/11">When it comes to the state pension, women are already at a disadvantage. The median pension saving of a 56-year-old woman is almost six times lower than for a man of the same age. Women will have decided to have children and work part-time to raise families. That is a valid decision and one for which they should not be punished&#8212;indeed, they should be praised. However, under these proposals such women do not have enough time to adjust their financial plans for retirement. Many have already decreased their hours in preparation for retirement, and some will have done so because of ill health.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/12">Retirement is an opportunity for those who have contributed all that they can to society to rest with peace of mind, knowing that their contributions will be recognised and that they will be adequately provided for. However, I worry about the long-term costs for these women. I suspect that there will significant hardship, with anxiety and stress about financial matters. I also worry about the ill health that results from working to an older age.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/13">The Turner Commission recommended 15 years of preparation before such changes are implemented. I would be interested to know why the Minister disregarded that and opted for far fewer years. Current plans will result in very different outcomes for women of similar ages. I know that the line has to be drawn somewhere, but deciding a person&#8217;s pension eligibility by their birth date suggests that the entire reform is being introduced too swiftly. The Government should stick to the original timetable, with equalisation at 65 in 2020 and not increasing the state pension age to 66 until after that.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.1/14">Once again, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Erith and Thamesmead on securing such an important debate. I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response.</p>

	<p pid="b.439.0/1">The things that Turner recommended are not consistent with each other. We cannot, for example, have a consistent percentage of income during life in retirement and give 15 years&#8217; notice at the same time, because longevity is increasing much faster than that. Something somewhere has to give.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/2">One point that has been missing during this debate&#8212;the only time that it was mentioned was when an hon. Member quoted me from last week&#8217;s debate&#8212;is that if we delay till 2020, as the hon. Member for Leeds West proposed, we will have to find &#163;10 billion. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase> raised an important point, and he is analytically correct: that does not help us in the comprehensive spending review period or help the long-term structural deficit, because the age would have been 66 anyway. However, it does do one thing: it takes &#163;30 billion&#8212;or rather, &#163;10 billion; the whole change amounts to &#163;30 billion, but the difference between the two of us is &#163;10 billion&#8212;off the national debt. As he knows, servicing the national debt is one of the most crippling things that this Government must do. That is why such difficult decisions must be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/3">Our changes will take &#163;30 billion off the national debt. I do not know what the interest rate on the national debt is, but let us say 5% for the sake of round numbers. That is just to make the numbers add up; I do not suppose for a minute that it is 5%. That is &#163;1.5 billion extra every year to spend on services or whatever rather than on the national debt. I think that that would be the hon. Lady&#8217;s preferred solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.440.5/1">In a moment. The pace of improvement in longevity is breathtaking. Between 2004 and 2008&#8212;the longevity projections of 2004 are, I think, what the previous Government&#8217;s legislation was based on, and those of 2008 are what we have now&#8212;life expectancy at pension age increased by well over a year in just four years. It is almost like a runaway train. We can always</p>
	<p pid="b.440.5/2">say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s wait another decade,&#8221; but one of the problems is that there is a trade-off, because, as I have said, what has been missing from this debate is the people who have to pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.5/3">Delaying for 10 years, which is what I think the hon. Member for Leeds West is suggesting, does not mean a free lunch. It would mean a &#163;10 billion national insurance hit on today&#8217;s workers and today&#8217;s firms. If she was wearing another hat, the hon. Lady would be saying, &#8220;The recovery is fragile and we need to do more for jobs and to boost the economy,&#8221; but what she is saying is that we should levy another &#163;10 billion of national insurance on today&#8217;s workers, including low-paid women who do not have much pension, and today&#8217;s firms, which may have to lay off people who will not then be able to build up decent pensions. There will be no free lunch if we delay.</p>

	<p pid="b.442.0/1">I fear that, at this rate, the Minister will start sending pensioners back to work if they live too long.

	<p pid="b.442.0/2">The Minister says that Labour is saying that we have to find another &#163;10 billion or &#163;30 billion for these changes. This is about cutting spending&#8212;the Government are cutting &#163;30 billion of spending. I do not want additional spending. First, Labour wants to halve the budget deficit in this Parliament. Secondly, our proposals would cut &#163;20 billion-worth-of spending, so we are not asking for additional spending. I would like that put on the record.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.447.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="447"  time="011:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0001.htm#11051169000403">
	<p pid="b.447.1/1">I hear the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s comments. Obviously, he has looked into the matter in his area much more than we will have done at the Department for Transport. All I can do is repeat the comments that I have made. First, if he believes that there is collusion in the industry, he needs to draw that to the attention of the Competition Commission. Secondly, the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead&#8212;the relevant Minister for this area&#8212;will, I am sure, be interested in his comments and look at the issue of postcode charging. We would like to ensure that the motorist gets a fair deal and is not subject to improper procedures. We want, therefore, to ensure that motor insurance costs are kept reasonable, as far as it is possible for us to influence them.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/2">We recognise that the high cost of motor insurance can cause a number of policy problems and we are working with the industry to help address them. People are dependent on their cars to travel to work, leisure facilities and so on, so this is an important issue for a great number of people. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary is speaking with the insurance industry on a number of issues, particularly tackling uninsured driving, automatic access for insurers to check the driver&#8217;s record held by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, and addressing the problems of high premium costs faced by young drivers, to which the hon. Gentleman referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/3">One area of concern for us is that people may be tempted to drive uninsured. The insurance industry estimates that uninsured driving costs each motorist approximately &#163;30 on their premiums each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/4">The Government introduced the continuous insurance enforcement scheme to deal with uninsured drivers. A new offence has been introduced of keeping a vehicle without insurance unless it is kept off the road and a statutory off-road notice declaration has been made to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The new scheme regularly compares the DVLA vehicles database with the motor insurance database, which holds all motor insurance policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/5">From that comparison, we are able to detect a greater number of uninsured vehicles, rather than relying solely on the police spotting uninsured vehicles in use on the road. We anticipate that the scheme could reduce uninsured driving by 15% to 20%, by taking out the softer evaders and leaving the police to target on the road hard-core offenders who continue to drive uninsured. Obviously, getting uninsured drivers off the road would be of benefit not only to road safety generally, but to those who legitimately and properly pay their insurance and who quite rightly feel aggrieved about having to pay extra in their premiums to deal with the uninsured. I think that that agenda is shared throughout the country&#8212;except by uninsured drivers. I hope that it is shared, so that we can get some fairness into the premiums.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/6">The scheme is planned to commence in late June. Under it, keepers of vehicles that appear to be uninsured will be sent reminder letters by the Motor Insurers&#8217; Bureau. If keepers take no action, they will receive a fixed penalty notice and a fine of &#163;100, followed by enforcement action which, in extreme circumstances, might be wheel-clamping, impounding of the vehicle and, ultimately, prosecution. The DVLA will be responsible for enforcement action on behalf of the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/7">We are also concerned that significant rises in the cost of insurance might increase fraud, with some drivers prepared to make false statements about their driving record to obtain cheaper insurance, such as on how many penalty points they have, whether they have been disqualified and so on. The insurance industry estimates that 40,000 claims are declined already each year at the underwriting stage, on the grounds of non-disclosure or misrepresentation, and that 200,000 claims are adjusted.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.1/8">Others might be tempted to declare younger drivers as named secondary drivers on their parents&#8217; insurance when, in fact, they are the main driver of a vehicle. We are working with the insurance industry with a view to allowing it access to the driver details held by the DVLA. That will to help to tackle fraud and prevent situations in which drivers might give inaccurate information, consequently invalidating their insurance. The timetable for delivery is yet to be finalised with the insurance industry, but we expect a project of such a size to take between 18 and 24 months to complete all stages of the work, from specification and design to development, and through to a fully operational systems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.451.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" speakername="Julian Huppert" colnum="451"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0001.htm#11051169000406">
	<p pid="b.451.2/1">I hope that this debate on legal aid&#8212;a vitally important component of our legal system&#8212;will prove timely. It is opportune because although the Government consultation, which has received around 5,000 replies, has closed, the Government have not yet published their response. I hope, therefore, that the Government will have the chance to listen to concerns from both sides of the House before publishing their final recommendations. I am delighted to welcome the Minister to respond to the debate, and more particularly to listen to it. He and I spent some time debating in 2005, and although I did not always agree with his position, he showed that he would listen to an argument and I hope he will show the same character today.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/2">One of the basic pillars of our legal system is supposed to be that the law is accessible to all, not only to those who can afford it. Members of another Committee are seeking to reform the law of libel to ensure that success goes to those who have truth on their side, rather than to those with the most money. Legal aid is the manner in which we ensure that all have a fair chance to access the law and see justice done.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/3">The Government have been at pains to emphasise their commitment to access to justice. We would all, I hope, agree with their stated position that</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/4">&#8220;access to justice is the hallmark of a civil society.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/5">Indeed, many of us would go slightly further and say that it is the hallmark of a civilised society. The Green Paper that announced the proposals suggested that the Ministry of Justice believes that legal aid has expanded far beyond its original intentions. I recognise that there is often waste, and that unnecessary costs could be eliminated or reduced, but we should avoid simply caricaturing the current legal aid system.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/6">In my opinion, as it currently stands the legal aid system seems broadly to represent what Lord Rushcliffe intended in his 1945 report. He argued that public funding for legal aid should not be limited to those &#8220;normally classed as poor&#8221;, but should also include those of &#8220;small or moderate means.&#8221; According to the Ministry of Justice, under the current legal aid system 29% of us are eligible for publicly funded advice. One could ask whether that goes far enough. Given our unequal income distribution, even the median wage could well be described as &#8220;small or moderate means&#8221; in some parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/7">I accept that the wider fiscal situation and the rapidly growing nature of the legal aid budget allow room for consolidation through reductions in the budget, and there is a balance to strike between access and cost. This debate is largely an opportunity to discuss how such reductions can be achieved without harming the most vulnerable people in our society. A large portion of my speech will deal with the scope of the Government&#8217;s proposals, but I also hope to draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to the viable alternatives that have been proposed. Given the number of hon. Members from all parties present in the debate, I will try to be brief to allow others to speak. I am sure that one could easily fill 90 minutes with more detailed analyses of every issue that I cover.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/8">It is easy to forget the recent history of legal aid, and it is important to look at the context behind the debate this afternoon and remind ourselves that legal aid underwent substantial changes under the previous Government&#8212;Labour launched about 30 consultations and reviews to try to sort the system out. Since the formation of the coalition, we have had Sir Ian Magee&#8217;s &#8220;Review of legal aid delivery and governance&#8221;, and the family justice review chaired by David Norgrove, both of which are pertinent to the debate. I am glad that the Government delayed their response to the consultation on legal aid until after the interim report of the Norgrove review was published. It is always useful to get expert advice before making decisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/9">Hon. Members should be in no doubt that I appreciate much of what the Ministry of Justice has done since the formation of the coalition. In general, I admire the liberal proposals on sentencing that have stemmed from the Secretary of State and his team of Ministers&#8212;they may not thank me for that praise of their liberalism. It has been particularly good to see a renewed emphasis on evidence and reinvestment in justice, moving us away from an obsession with prisons and punishment, and renewing our desire to see criminals rehabilitated. We want less crime, not just to be harsh on criminals after the event.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/10">There are, however, problems with the Government&#8217;s proposals, many of which will be familiar to hon. Members following this debate. If they have not already done so, hon. Members might want to familiarise themselves with the excellent report from the Justice Committee&#8212;chaired by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>&#8212;the large majority of which I agree with. I want to focus on the effects of the proposals concerning access to advice on social welfare law, in particular with regard to immigration law, family law and children and young people. I will also highlight what I believe are the unintended consequences of the Government&#8217;s proposals for citizens advice bureaux and other organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/11">It is worth questioning the central decision at the heart of the Government&#8217;s proposals. From the off they considered it impossible to pare down any further expenditure on criminal legal aid. Like many others, I remain unconvinced that we should leave criminal legal aid entirely untouched when it accounts for more than half the total budget, even if it has previously come in for close attention. Obviously, we do not want to deny people access to justice in criminal trials, but I believe there may be further scope for savings in that area. I hope the Minister will heed that note of slight uncertainty and address it when he responds to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.451.2/12">In other areas, my uncertainty is more than slight. One such area is family law, and I have received many representations from organisations and individuals across the spectrum, from those who need legal aid to those who provide it and almost everyone in between. I cannot over-emphasise the concerns that people have about the possible effects of the Government proposals. Time and time again I have heard the same criticism: the Government have brought forward proposals without properly researching the effects of the current system, and without adequately justifying their stance. As a result, the unintended consequences of the proposals, if implemented, could be regressive and widespread.</p>

	<p pid="b.457.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his comments. He is right. I am not an expert on the position in London, but I know the Cambridge area and I realise that there is a shortage of good people. I see that with my constituents time and time again.</p>

	<p pid="b.457.3/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his comments. I am astonished at how many constituents I see who have been poorly advised. The most extreme example was a lady who applied for asylum through a lawyer and got leave to remain, but when she went to renew her passport she discovered that the whole thing was a forgery. We are still trying to resolve that case. We</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/2">need decent, good quality lawyers, not the rather shabby and disreputable people whom we sometimes see in their place.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/3">The main point that I want to make is about the approach taken by the UK Border Agency. Its attitude is a well-known sticking point. It rarely allows scope for negotiation or mediation. It seems to take the view that it will stick to its decision until a court tells it otherwise almost regardless of the evidence. In so many cases, applications for the right to work were ignored until the agency was ordered to deal with them by higher courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/4">Many applications for refugee reunion that are refused are then overturned on appeal, and it seems that the appeal system is being used by the agency as a safety net. Under the Government&#8217;s proposals, those cases would no longer be in scope for legal aid, and there will be no opportunity to fix the agency&#8217;s errors. I urge the Government to listen to practitioners and the representatives of asylum seekers and refugees. The Government should ensure that asylum support remains in scope as a high priority. They should also ensure that applications for family reunion are treated as extensions to a claim for asylum and thus be within scope for legal aid purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/5">There are certainly cases in which applicants with a poor case abuse the system, looking for appeal after appeal in a fruitless quest for victory. However, those with a strong case are also forced to jump repeated hurdles to get justice. The key solution is for the agency to get more decisions right first time, as was accepted by the Minister for Immigration, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" name="Damian Green">the hon. Member for Ashford (Damian Green)</phrase> when I raised the matter in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/6">I could say more about that, but I want to give a brief example of the impact that the Government&#8217;s proposals may have on service providers, and I shall then allow others to speak. I have spoken to service providers about the possible impact of the proposals on various vulnerable groups. I have received comments from a range of organisations and individuals that provide support. I wish that I could have talked to all of them, but I shall focus on the role of Citizens Advice, as I suspect that all Members will appreciate the vital role that it plays in our constituencies, not least in preventing the flood of case work that we all receive from becoming even more torrential.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/7">Citizens Advice has produced detailed briefings showing the unintended consequences of the Government&#8217;s proposals on social welfare law work. Its cost-benefit analysis makes a strong case for retaining and even strengthening its role. For instance, its research found that for every &#163;1 of legal aid spent on housing advice, the state potentially saves &#163;2.34; on debt advice, the state saves &#163;2.98; on benefits, it saves &#163;8.80; and on employment advice, it saves &#163;7.13. With impressive understatement, Citizens Advice suggests that the Ministry of Justice</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/8">&#8220;gets a good return from expenditure on legal help in these areas.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/9">It estimates that if funding were no longer available for these categories of law, at least &#163;172 million of additional costs would accrue for both state and society.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/10">What effect would the proposals have on the Citizens Advice service more widely? More than half of the bureaux surveyed in December last year said that the changes to legal aid scope and the reduction in fees</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/11">would pose a real risk to the continuation of their local advice service as a whole. Again, I do not need to remind Members of the havoc that that would wreak in our communities, or of the large amount of extra work that would almost certainly come our way as a result. In passing, I praise the excellent work done by Rachel Talbot and the staff of the Cambridge citizens advice bureau, who are always there to help me and my constituents. I also praise Cambridge city council, which last year provided it with a 25% increase in grant. I wish that all councils did that, rather than pulling resources from such a vital public service.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/12">Time is running short, but I wish to raise two brief points. The first, raised earlier by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>, is about the effect of combining the legal aid proposals with Lord Jackson&#8217;s proposals on clinical negligence cases. Lord Jackson was clear about it. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/13">&#8220;I stress the vital necessity of making no further cutbacks in legal aid availability or eligibility&#8230;the maintenance of legal aid at no less than the present levels makes sound economic sense and is in the public interest&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/14">Will the Government take account of that plea, and avoid a double whammy? Legal aid changes and the Jackson proposals together would mean that those who have suffered through error would not be able to continue with their cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/15">Secondly, I flag up a concern raised with me by Andy McGowan, the access and funding officer of Cambridge university students union. He is one of those rare people on free school meals who got to Oxbridge&#8212;the Government would like to see more of them&#8212;and he wants to practise as a criminal legal aid solicitor; he is driven by a motivation that I am sure we would all endorse to help the most vulnerable in society. He asks how he can fund the legal practice course in the absence of the training contract grant scheme, knowing that he will be unlikely to be as well paid as those lawyers for whom money is the principle motivation? If we lose people like Andy from the profession and from public service, we will create a less fair future for many years to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/16">It is not my intention to attack the Government&#8217;s proposals without offering an alternative. That is not a helpful or effective way of approaching such debates, and I am always disappointed when others do not say clearly what they would do differently. There is clearly much in the Government&#8217;s proposals that is sensible. I cannot claim to be an expert on legal aid, and I have relied heavily on the hard work of many other people in preparing this speech. I am grateful to them for all that they do to preserve what is good about the present system, and for their wider struggle to provide access to justice for all, especially for the most vulnerable. The case that I have attempted to build draws on the research and evidence of others. The same is true of the alternative that I offer the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/17">The Law Society, which for a long time was officially responsible for legal aid, has continued to play a major role in shaping the debate on this important subject. It has produced an alternative set of proposals that aim to go beyond the savings that the Government have set out. It projects savings of &#163;384 million, which could even reach slightly more, yet at the same time it claims</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/18">to be able to protect the vulnerable about whom I have said so much. The Government are duty bound to look seriously at those proposals and, if they are workable, to adopt them. If the Government are serious about access to justice, they must listen to those who know what is necessary to provide it.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.3/19">I look forward to hearing what other hon. Members have to say, and to the Minister&#8217;s response. I hope that he will signal a willingness to modify the proposals in the light of the concern that have been raised.</p>

	<p pid="b.465.4/1">I am sorry to say that that is exactly it. We are rapidly reaching that point, and one might argue that we are already there. Some people will get access and others will not, and that is abhorrent. We are all equal before the law, and are all entitled to equal access to the law and its procedures. It appears that these measures will definitely limit that scope. There will law for some and not for others. I urge the Government again to look once more at the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.4/2">I will not go beyond the changes in family law today, for obvious reasons. The National Association of Guardians Ad Litem and Reporting Officers&#8212;if it does not know what it is talking about, nobody does&#8212;says that the changes are premature, that they have no sound evidence base and that children have not been considered as stakeholders for the purposes of the impact assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.465.4/3">In conclusion, I merely refer to page 71 of the Justice Committee&#8217;s report, the main part of which the hon. Member for South Swindon mentioned, about domestic</p>
	<p pid="b.465.4/4">violence as a criterion. In fairness to the Minister, he said when he came before the Committee that he would look at the issue again. With respect, he has had time to look at it again. Will he tell us today whether he has a better definition that will not work against the best interests of the children we are here to protect?</p>

	<p pid="b.469.1/1">I was just talking to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40384" name="Yvonne Fovargue">the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue)</phrase> about the exploitative individuals&#8212;and, frankly, the chancers&#8212;who have now become involved in immigration law. Basically they are spivs, who charge very vulnerable people very large sums of money for writing letters. They do no more than that. Some of them are not even qualified.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> is absolutely right. For many years, we campaigned in this House for proper registration of immigration practitioners and for an end to immigration advisers, who in any case are often unqualified. The late Bernie Grant, the former MP for Tottenham, was extremely active on that issue and we basically got rid of most of those immigration advisers. However, they are all back now, big-time, and they are making a great deal of money out of extremely vulnerable people. I am sure that the Minister is aware of that problem. It has been reflected in many of the submissions made to him and I look forward to a response from him that recognises that.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/3">The final point that I want to make about children is about the removal of legal aid for education cases. I have a distressing number of immigration cases in my constituency involving education. I do not have a vast number of them, but they are often very distressing and the people involved need representation. That is because some children who are suspended or expelled from school then have to go to another school. Unfortunately their representation and their files often follow them around and they end up being almost totally excluded from the whole education system. That is not good for them and it is not good for anybody. Proper representation would often prevent that situation from happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/4">The number of cases that are dealt with by legal aid in this country at the moment is 934,000, apparently. Unless the Minister is going to give us some very good</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/5">news at the end of the month, or whenever the reply to the consultation comes, the cuts being proposed will mean that more than 600,000 people will not have access to legal aid. If we want a fair, decent and just society, everyone must have access to the law. We are not seeking a litigation society, but a justice society and I hope that the Minister will understand the strength of feeling expressed in the representations that he receives on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/6">The vast majority of solicitors and barristers acting on legal aid cases do not make much money out of that work. They make far more money on commercial cases, libel cases, media cases or &#8220;personality&#8221;-driven cases. The majority of solicitors I meet who deal with legal aid cases that are hard to sort out are paid very little. They work very hard and they are doing us a lot of good.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/7">Furthermore, the loss of training contracts means that many of the solicitors of tomorrow will not be around to represent people. Many young people are studying law in universities and colleges at present. We want them to use their skills and we want them to represent the hardest-hit and most vulnerable people in society. I ask the Minister to think carefully about the very thoughtful and very carefully prepared representations that I know he has received on this subject.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.470.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40295" speakername="Andy Slaughter" colnum="470"  time="015:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0002.htm#11051188000230">
	<p pid="b.470.0/1">May I start, Mr Weir, by saying what a pleasure it is to serve under your chairmanship? I also want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase>, not only on securing this debate but on making a very thorough and persuasive speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/2">It was in November last year&#8212;six months ago&#8212;that the Minister first produced his proposals to restrict the scope and availability of legal aid. A lot has happened since then. In fact, this is our third debate on the issue in this House and I know that the Minister has also debated it outside the House with others, including my noble Friend Lord Bach. The other place is debating the issue again next week. As a result, many of the arguments should be familiar to the Minister, but what we have not had so far is any effective response to those arguments.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/3">Several Members have already spoken in the debate. We have heard from Members from all parties who are committed to legal aid and understand its importance in our system. Among the many good points that the hon. Member for Cambridge made was one about viability; he asked whether the cuts will actually leave a viable legal aid service at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40384" name="Yvonne Fovargue">the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue)</phrase> drew on her own experience to make the point that telephone advice, however important it is, cannot be the only entry point to the system. She said that the alternative provisions that have been suggested are not adequate and that the alternative providers suggested by the Government are not equal to the task that has been set them; they have said so themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/5">In addition, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40555" name="Robert Buckland">the hon. Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland)</phrase> nailed the allegation that legal aid is hugely expensive in this country. As he said, spending on legal aid as a proportion of the costs of the legal system is not high. Clearly, it must be restrained but I</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/6">think that there have been false arguments that it is disproportionately higher than similar spending in other jurisdictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40218" name="Elfyn Llwyd">The right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd)</phrase>, who has, I think, more experience in this field than any other Member here, urged the Minister to think more slowly and carefully, and to make the decision not in the rushed way that has been portrayed so far, but in a way that takes account of all the views that have been expressed. That, perhaps, is the key point coming out of this debate. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> talked about housing&#8212;a subject very dear to my own heart as well&#8212;and the effect on our constituents in London, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" name="Tom Brake">the hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> talked about the false economies that there will be in making the cuts to legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/8">All those arguments might be familiar, but the Minister needs to respond to them today. He has had the benefit of the report from the Justice Committee, which took evidence from senior judges, the Minister himself and leaders in civil society, and criticised the lack of an evidential basis for the Minister&#8217;s proposals. On issue after issue, from the increase in litigants in person to the additional cost to the public purse and the inability of alternative providers to pick up the pieces should the proposals come into force, the Select Committee told the Minister to slow down, do some research and come back with revised proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/9">Other organisations, in particular practitioner organisations, have done the work that the Minister and his civil servants have not done, in providing evidence of the effect of the changes. I mention in particular the Legal Action Group, which took the original figure of 500,000&#8212;my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North said it was more than 600,000&#8212;and added in the most up-to-date figures for the past financial year and for the telephone advisory service. The resulting figure was nearer 725,000, which is almost 50% more than the Government initially said.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/10">The Legal Aid Practitioners Group has considered the point about viability. The fact that the entry point has to be through telephone advice has its disincentives. Many people will not be able to cope with the telephone system; they rely on face-to-face advice, and will simply not access the system at all. The figures by local authority area show that if we relied on such a system, the reduction in the service that could be provided face to face would bring the service down to something like 7% to 10% of existing levels, which would not be sustainable. Purely by way of example, in my own borough of Hammersmith and Fulham that would take us from the current 1,600 case starts to 155 under the new system, which would not be sufficient to pay one person&#8217;s salary for a year. If that situation was replicated across local authority areas, there would be no service at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/11">The Law Centres Federation has looked at the impact of cuts that have already taken place, including local authority cuts, which are at 53% in law centres&#8212;61% in London and 100% in my own borough. Those figures ought to be considered before any legal aid cuts are brought into effect this financial year. A Citizens Advice</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/12">survey has shown that more than 50% of its members do not believe they will be financially viable once the cuts take effect.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/13">I ask the Minister to listen to those hugely experienced and articulate voices. Labour Governments over the past 65 years have fielded a good record in this area, setting up the legal aid system, funding the first law centres and increasing spending on advisory services such as Citizens Advice, and on social welfare legal aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/14">But we also restricted the growth in legal aid funding from 2003 onwards, and would continue to do so if we were still in government.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/15">I am at a loss to understand why the Government have abandoned some of the plans that we had to restrict that growth further, particularly in the tendering process, and particularly in the criminal legal aid field. Social welfare legal aid is only 5% of the total legal aid budget, and I hope that the Minister is giving a lot of scrutiny to that area in deciding on the revisions to his plans. Removing social welfare legal aid from scope will, I believe, give the whip hand to large public and private corporations, and will allow an inequality of arms that is unacceptable in our civil and criminal justice systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/16">I would like briefly to deal with the issue of who is most affected. The Minister has said previously that it is inevitable that poorer people will be affected because it is they who are in receipt of legal aid&#8212;but that is a slightly glib answer, if I may say so. The excellent brief prepared for this debate by a young legal aid lawyer drills down into the figures and shows that, were the proposals introduced, 44% of people who received representation last year and 68% of those who got legal help would not now receive that assistance, and that more than 80% of people who would lose the assistance are in the poorest fifth of the population. Also, 80% of people who will be affected by the eligibility changes are in the poorest fifth of the population. Not a lot has been said about those changes, but they are highly significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/17">When one looks at the discriminatory effects of what the Minister proposes, one sees that 31% of those affected by the scope changes in housing are from the black and minority ethnic population, compared with 8% in the general population; some 63% of those affected by the scope changes to welfare benefit legal aid are disabled, compared with 18% in the general population. The Minister might say that that is a truism, but his Government should be ashamed that changes of that kind are being proposed, given the disbenefit that they will have. It is a myth that representation is not for legal purposes, but for general advice&#8212;people need it to understand complex legal issues and to make appeals to higher courts&#8212;and that the people who currently benefit are in a position to represent themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/18">The Minister has heard from both sides of the House today, including very eloquent speeches from Government Members who have many years&#8217; experience of this issue. I notice that Joanna Lumley has joined the growing campaign, which should provide the Minister with pause for thought, given her track record on such matters. I do not expect a full response today, but when the Minister finally comes to respond to the 5,000 responses&#8212;compared with the 50 received in the last consultation on legal aid by the previous Labour Government&#8212;I hope that, even if he has not read each response, he will</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/19">have considered the overwhelming weight of opinion on the effect that the measures will have, not only on very vulnerable people and on those of us who still try to provide an advice service with very limited means, but on the whole criminal and civil justice system. That will be in jeopardy if we take away access to justice, removing the right of anyone with a meritorious case to get the initial advice, representation and assistance that they need to bring the case to court.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.0/20">That is not, I hope, something that the Minister, given his background, would wish to see. I hope that he will give an indication in his response today, and a fuller indication in that formal response&#8212;the date of which he will no doubt provide now&#8212;that the Government have been listening to all those voices and will respond with a more sympathetic and pragmatic attitude to the continuation of legal aid.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.477.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40347" speakername="Chris Skidmore" colnum="477"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0002.htm#11051188000233">
	<p pid="b.477.1/1">The Avon ring road, or the A4174, runs through the Kingswood constituency like a spine, passing alongside Emersons Green, Kingswood, Warmley and Longwell Green before joining the A4 at Hicks Gate junction near Keynsham. It is, for many constituents, a vital transport network that allows quick and efficient access to most areas of the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/2">Recently, the local, Conservative-run South Gloucestershire council has invested heavily in improving congestion on the ring road, including the introduction of traffic light signalisation on two roundabouts in Warmley and Longwell Green, with the promise of further investment, with traffic lights to be added on Tower Lane roundabout at Barrs Court. Having doubled the road budget, which suffered for so long from chronic lack of investment under the previous administration, the local area is finally witnessing real change for the benefit of local residents and commuters alike.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/3">Many of my constituents in Kingswood will be familiar with the proposal for an M4 link to the Avon ring road. For many years, since the completion of the A4174, which runs within a few hundred metres of the M4 near the Westerleigh roundabout, local residents in the Kingswood constituency, particularly Emersons Green, have had to face lengthy morning commutes to get on to the M4, either by travelling on the Avon ring road to the M32 in Hambrook, which is about 3&#189; miles away, or by taking a 7-mile trip along minor roads through Pucklechurch to Tormarton. Not only does that add several miles to their journey, but the ring road in the morning is frequently heavily congested, with cars at a standstill.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/4">An M4 link to the Avon ring road&#8212;what was once proposed as junction 18A&#8212;would help to solve that problem by giving the local community and east Bristol easy access to our motorway network, which is already enjoyed by those living in north Bristol.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/5">Sadly, the proposal for a new link road and a new junction on the M4 is by no means a new idea. It was first put forward by the former Avon county council as far back as 1985. It was accepted in principle by the then Department for Transport, but it was never included in the Government&#8217;s trunk road programme. Responsibility for the scheme later passed to South Gloucestershire council following local government reorganisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/6">Mention of a possible junction 18A on the M4, linking the A4174, was last raised in Parliament in 2000, when the then Minister acknowledged:</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/7">&#8220;The Council subsequently carried out a review of a number of major road schemes in their area in the context of current Government transport policy and emerging development plan policies. As a result, they decided in 1999 not to pursue this particular scheme.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2000-11-13.496"><i>Official Report</i>, 13 November 2000; Vol. 356, c. 496W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/8">The decisions, or, rather, mistakes, made more than 10 years ago by a previous administration of South Gloucestershire council are now coming back to haunt local residents. Despite that, over the past decade, Conservative councillors have fought hard for an M4 link to the Avon ring road to be considered. In July</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/9">2005, an amendment was tabled in full council that, when considering the joint local transport plan for the west of England,</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/10">&#8220;the M4 Link should be specifically named as a potential JLTP Major Scheme Bid.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/11">Sadly, that amendment was voted down by the previous administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/12">In thanking those who have fought at a local level for the M4 link to remain a possibility, I pay tribute to local Emersons Green Councillors Colin Hunt, James Hunt and Dave Kearns, for their commitment to standing up for local Emersons Green residents, who know just how much easier their daily lives would be with an M4 link road in place. Another strong and vocal supporter of the M4 link was the late Ian Morris, who was a councillor for Emersons Green and who would have taken a keen interest in today&#8217;s debate. He was a passionate champion for Emersons Green who understood the community&#8217;s need for greater infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/13">The reason why I have called this debate today is to make the Minister aware that the need for transport infrastructure in my local area is greater than ever before. Not only has Emersons Green expanded in size to a population of nearly 9,000 residents, but the Emersons Green East development will start shortly and will provide an additional 3,000 homes to the region. As was made clear in the consultation response to South Gloucestershire council&#8217;s core strategy document:</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/14">&#8220;There is a need for a new M4 Junction to serve the increased population.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/15">There is also a strong economic case for the link road, which was considered by the &#8220;Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study&#8221; in 2006. Overall, it found that an M4 link road would have a net present value of &#163;247 million and a benefit to cost ratio of 12. In other words, the M4 link would pay for itself many times over.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/16">Since that study, the economic case for the M4 link to the Avon ring road has become even stronger. The reason for that is the exciting and vital prospect of the &#163;300 million Bristol and Bath science park, which is currently under construction in Emersons Green. The science park points to the future for our local area. Not only does it have the potential to create 6,000 new jobs in the local neighbourhood, but it will be at the cutting edge of manufacturing in the local area, housing test-bed facilities, laboratories, office space and semi-industrial workspace for a range of science and technology businesses. It is intended to provide a stepping stone for fast-growing, innovative new companies, particularly those emerging from the region&#8217;s universities.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/17">Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the excellent National Composites Centre at the site. It is one of the first buildings that will be operational, and it will act as the main hub for research and development into carbon fibre technology in the UK. It was recently named as one of the Government&#8217;s high-value manufacturing, technology and innovation centres. The Deputy Prime Minister has praised these centres&#8212;there are currently only seven&#8212;as</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/18">&#8220;a major early milestone in our ambition to rebalance the economy&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/19">and the Business Secretary also recently visited the National Composites Centre.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/20">Currently, corporate inward investors from across the globe are considering whether to invest in the Bristol and Bath science park. They are attracted to the science</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/21">park by a number of factors: access to educated and talented graduates; existing managerial talent at local corporations; the culture and lifestyle that the region offers; and the business eco-system of the science park itself, which will provide state of the art facilities, buildings and landscape.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/22">Science park representatives are currently speaking to a number of prospective international occupiers who would create centres of excellence in applied technology on the site and potentially fund early stage research at the universities. The majority of jobs at the site would be newly created and would require a high education and skill level. However, transport access is also a significant part of creating an attractive offer.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/23">For international companies, transport links to the science park are vital, particularly from Heathrow. They seek assurance that, upon arrival at Heathrow, their international senior executives will have easy and straightforward access to a local operation. Most prospective occupiers have undertaken due diligence and are fully aware of the long-standing need for an additional junction on the ring road from the M4 between junctions 18 and 19. Above all, they can see from visiting the science park themselves that the M4 is literally a stone&#8217;s throw away.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/24">A new junction 18A connecting the ring road to the M4 would ensure that the science park would be able to thrive in the international climate of corporate investment and become a world-class facility for the region, promoting growth and investment to the benefit of the local economy and, above all, generating local jobs. It is not just the science park that would benefit from an M4 link; the nearby Emerald park, the Harlequin business park and the Emersons Green treatment centre are also close by, and one of the main hubs for Avon and Somerset police will shortly be moving into Emersons Green.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/25">The Bristol and Bath region is rich with both leading businesses and academic research, but it is clear that the infrastructure&#8212;both transport and digital provision&#8212;has not kept pace with the potential now available. In addition to the science park, the university of the West of England, Airbus and BAE Systems, to name a few, are considering the development of new business parks on their sites in the west of the region. All those developments have the potential to create thousands of new, high- value jobs. The attractiveness of those developments to investors, employers, employees and residents could be in question if investment in new infrastructure were to be ruled out indefinitely.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/26">I thank the Minister for his correspondence with me over the possibility of an M4 link to the Avon ring road. I am a realist and am fully aware that, for the time being, in the current comprehensive spending review period, the funds are not available for a link road. However, all that I ask is that the proposal is not ruled out indefinitely, and that the Department seriously considers the prospect of a junction 18A and a link road to the Avon ring road from the M4. I also want to use this opportunity to launch a petition of local residents to join the campaign for an M4 link. I hope that, when the signatures are finally gathered, the Minister will kindly accept that petition.</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/27">This campaign is not merely about getting a road built. It is about encouraging economic growth and enterprise in the Kingswood area, which, as the local MP,</p>
	<p pid="b.477.1/28">I am absolutely determined to drive forward. We need the infrastructure in place to ensure that both business and the local community can grow. An M4 link to the Avon ring road would be a vital part of that infrastructure, and I hope that it can be considered for the future in due course.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.480.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" speakername="Norman Baker" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport"  colnum="480"  time="016:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0002.htm#11051188000234">
	<p pid="b.480.0/1">Congratulations, Mr Weir, on a marathon session in the Chair today. I also congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40347" name="Chris Skidmore">the Member for Kingswood (Chris Skidmore)</phrase> on securing this important debate and on representing his constituents so diligently in the matter. There are two strands to my response: first, the process for prioritising the funding of local major schemes in the spending review period up to 2015 and beyond; and secondly, the importance of local authorities considering a range of options for addressing transport problems in the short and longer terms and what short-term options he might consider to try to deal with the situation that he describes so eloquently.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/2">Of course, my hon. Friend will not need to be reminded of the economic situation that the Government have inherited and that the main priority is to reduce the deficit and promote sustainable economic growth. The emergency Budget last June and the October spending review were part of that strategy. However, in the spending review, the Government recognised the importance of transport infrastructure and its ability to help the economy to grow. There is a clear link and he is right to draw attention to that link in general and to the specifics of his constituency&#8217;s science park, to which he referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/3">We are committed to investing capital of &#163;6 billion over the next four years in local transport, including &#163;1.5 billion in local authority and major schemes. Nevertheless, over the next four years, we simply cannot afford to deliver every scheme that is being proposed. We inherited from the previous Administration a completely unrealistic pipeline of schemes that could not have been delivered, even if the economy were in its most buoyant form. We have therefore had to take tough decisions to prioritise schemes. My Department has set out a process for delivering a programme of local major schemes over the spending review period. The long lead time for developing major transport schemes means that we have only considered schemes that had already secured conditional approval or programme entry funding approval, or that had a bid for programme entry already lodged with the Department prior to the suspension of major scheme activity on <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-10">10 June 2010</phrase>. That is when the portcullis came down, if I can use an appropriate metaphor for the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/4">We have been keen to ensure that we get value for money and we have driven down the costs of schemes that we have been considering in the pool. That will enable us to proceed with more schemes than would have been the case if the previous Government had simply accepted the estimates available to them. We announced on <phrase class="date" code="2011-02-04">4 February</phrase> this year the schemes we were approving, those we were not going to take forward and those that are in the development pool. Promoters of schemes in the development pool have until September to come back with best and final offers and we shall announce in December which ones are approved.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/5">Despite what may have been said elsewhere, I must make it clear that the road that is the subject of this debate has, I am advised by officials, never been put forward officially to the Department for Transport for funding as a local authority major scheme. Indeed, South Gloucestershire council&#8217;s core strategy talks about the road only being a reality post-2026. So I hope that my hon. Friend would accept that it is unfair to consider funding it within the current spending review period given the process we have been through. For the record, again, despite what may have been said elsewhere, the scheme has certainly never been promised funding by the Department for Transport. I am not aware of the comments made by my ministerial predecessor some years ago, but I have asked officials to dig them out for me and let me have copies, so that I can see for the record what was said.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/6">The Department for Transport is working on the development of a policy for prioritising and funding local authority major schemes beyond 2015. We recognise that it is not possible to progress many schemes in this period that, nevertheless, have merit and ought to be considered properly post-2015. It is our intention to move to a more devolved funding framework for major schemes, with local enterprise partnerships and others being more relevant in the process. That framework will be developed further during 2011 and I have no doubt that the Secretary of State will make a further announcement in due course about exactly how that will operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/7">To answer my hon. Friend&#8217;s specific point, I can say that his proposal has not been ruled out indefinitely, but that it cannot proceed within the present time frame that I have identified up to 2015. It is certainly up to him and others to make further representations, collect local support directly from residents and also perhaps through local councils, the local enterprise partnership and others, so that when the next round of transport schemes are considered, the case has been well advanced. If he wants to do that, I encourage him to do so. In the meantime, if he wants to present a petition to me, I will certainly be happy to accept it from him and his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/8">Moving on to the second strand of my speech, I encourage promoters of schemes to consider a range of solutions for addressing transport problems. As part of the case that my hon. Friend wants to build up and may well be building up&#8212;I encourage him to do so&#8212;it is worth drawing attention to some of the comments made hitherto about the road, so that he is aware of them. The &#8220;Greater Bristol Strategic Transport Study&#8221;, which was produced in 2006, was commissioned by the Government office for the south-west to consider the case for building the link road. For the benefit of those who have not had a chance to read the document, let me read the concluding paragraph of the section that considers the link road:</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/9">&#8220;Although the new M4 to A4174 Link road scheme has a strong economic case, mainly derived from travel time savings for journeys from outside the study area, it is not being recommended by the study. The new link would alter flow patterns in the congested area between M4 J20 and M4 J19, M32 J1 and the northern stretch of the A4174 Avon Ring Road, putting additional strain on the A4174 and causing congestion problems on the M4 to the east of the new junction with the strong likelihood that the widening of the M4 between Junctions 18A and 18 would be necessary. The improved linkage to the M4 is likely to encourage</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/10">long-distance commuting to and from developments in Emersons Green and Pucklechurch, which would go against the principles of sustainable development.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/11">I stress that those were the comments of the Government office for the south-west in 2006. I read that out partly for the record, but also because if my hon. Friend is keen to promote his scheme, he will need to address the arguments that will be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/12">However, I want to be optimistic about the short term, as well as looking at the longer-term possibilities. My hon. Friend might be interested in looking at options that provide short-term benefits. In the development pool of major schemes, to which I have referred, one is being promoted by South Gloucestershire council in conjunction with the West of England Partnership and Bristol city council. If approved, that scheme may help to address some of the congestion issues to which he has referred.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/13">The scheme I am talking about is the North Fringe to Hengrove package, which includes a series of complementary projects that would facilitate the development of three new rapid transit routes linking the North Fringe, East Fringe and South Bristol areas via Bristol city centre. The promoters argue that the rapid transit network will provide a fast, frequent and reliable public transport service, where services run on a combination of segregated busways and bus lanes separate from car traffic. Services would be given priority over other road users at traffic signals.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/14">Promoters argue that the scheme would provide a high-quality passenger experience, with ticket machines at stops, user-friendly electronic information displays, high-quality stop design including CCTV and lighting, and safe and secure access to stops. The network would also provide improved pedestrian and cycling measures, including new footways and cycleways and appropriate modern and safe crossing points. A decision will be made on Government support or otherwise for that scheme in December. I am not clear about whether my hon. Friend believes that that is a useful scheme. If he does, it is on the table at an advanced stage and he may want to make representations in favour of it before we take a decision later this year. I referred to that today for background. I stress that no decision has been made for or against the scheme at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/15">The West of England Partnership has also submitted a bid to the Department for funding from the local sustainable transport fund, which I launched with the White Paper, &#8220;Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon,&#8221; earlier this year. The promoters argue that elements of that bid would help to ease congestion in the area we have been talking about by promoting an integrated package of low-carbon alternatives to single-occupancy car use. The full bid document can be found on the Travelplus website. The Department will make a decision on that bid at the end of June this year. I stress again that no decision for or against has been taken; it has not been evaluated properly. However, if that is something that my hon. Friend supports, he may want to make representations about that before we take a decision in June&#8212;not very far away.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/16">On a more general point, I would like to mention the local transport White Paper, &#8220;Creating Growth, Cutting Carbon&#8221;, which I launched in January. It shows how the Government are empowering local authorities, from streamlining transport funding from 26 to four grants&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/17">reducing all the unnecessary, bureaucratic streams that the previous Government had&#8212;to powers in the Localism Bill. The White Paper also sets out a number of sustainable transport choices that local authorities can make for their areas, from making public transport more attractive to car-sharing clubs; from improved cycle networks to bus partnerships; and from community transport to travel planning. Those are the sorts of things that allow people to travel freely without hindering economic growth or increasing their carbon footprints. I urge local authorities to consider those options in developing solutions to transport problems. There is a further tranche of money available after tranche one.</p>
	<p pid="b.480.0/18">To conclude, we have set out a process for prioritising local major transport schemes over the next four years. Consistent with our localism and decentralisation agenda, it is our intention to move towards a more devolved framework for prioritising and funding local major schemes beyond 2015. That suggests that local people&#8217;s views will perhaps be more important than they have been hitherto in deciding the priorities for local schemes. Garnering local opinion, therefore, may well be a useful exercise for my hon. Friend in the meantime. Beyond that, the local transport White Paper sets out the wide range of sustainable transport options for local authorities and others to consider to support economic growth and to reduce carbon emissions. Those two objectives are and remain the central objectives of the Department for Transport.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2011-05-11b.487.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" speakername="Madeleine Moon" colnum="487"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110511/halltext/110511h0002.htm#11051188000243">
	<p pid="b.487.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and what is so sad is that when they go to prison, some of those women have accommodation where they can look after their family and children. Instead, they lose that accommodation, and build up debt, which makes them unattractive to landlords in the future. Their children go into care, sometimes at a cost of up to &#163;30,000 a week per child. All that could be saved if, instead of a prison sentence, those women could stay in the community and tackle the issues that led them into crime.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.1/2">It can cost &#163;50,000 a year to keep a woman in prison. The cost to taxpayers and society through the criminal justice system, policing, social services and the benefits system of not addressing the problems that bring women into offending is enormous. Research has shown that intensive community order support costing &#163;15,000 can save the public purse up to &#163;264,000 over five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.1/3">What I am looking for today is a consistent source of funding, so that projects can be established and maintained with the confidence that they are sustainable. Funding for most existing centres for 2011-12 has been secured through the Ministry of Justice and the Corston independent funders coalition, and I am extremely grateful</p>
	<p pid="b.487.1/4">for that. The National Offender Management Service will be responsible for commissioning those services in 2012-13 if the centres are shown to be effective in diverting women from reoffending. But we do not have information about when and how decisions will be made, and what criteria will be used for assessment. The centres do excellent work, and the women who benefit from them need to know as soon as possible what measures they will be being judged against.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.1/5">Prisons are not an optional extra in the criminal justice system, and we do not expect them to have to fund themselves year on year to keep going. Women&#8217;s centres should not be considered to be optional extras, or be funded in that way. They need to be part of the bedrock of our criminal justice system, with continuous funding guaranteed for those centres that are working well. I am more than happy for them to be judged against criteria. They should be inspected, and they should demonstrate that they work, but their funding should be assured within those parameters.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.1/6">The recently announced national liaison and diversion service for mentally ill people in the criminal justice system should use women&#8217;s centres as a foothold to promote the agenda more widely, and not sideline them as an experiment. We have a fantastic joint commitment from the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health. Women&#8217;s centres should be used as a model to move forward, and they should be expanded so that we do not start from scratch in 2014, but have a bedrock and a base that we could be utilising now. The women&#8217;s justice task force, which was established by the Prison Reform Trust, is due to publish its findings shortly, and I hope that the Minister will read them carefully, and provide leadership, as my hon. Friends the Members for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) and for Garston and Halewood (Maria Eagle) did under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.1/7">The previous Government was quick to accept the findings of the review showing that intervention and support in the community is more effective than prison, but it was too slow in coming forward with sustainable, increased funding to put the policy into practice. The Justice Secretary bought a lot of good favour in the sector with his warm words last summer, but unless the Green Paper acts on those words he will have wasted a golden opportunity. Will he take the opportunity today to detail how the network of women&#8217;s centres will be put on a sustainable footing with funding secured for the future so that they can expand, how the Government will provide leadership, how the network of centres will be made accountable to the Ministry of Justice with a system of assessment and inspection, and how the courts will be provided with more information about women&#8217;s centres so that they can use community sentences with confidence, and so that we do not carry on with the waste of human lives which is represented by the number of women and their children who are damaged by involvement in the criminal justice system?</p>
