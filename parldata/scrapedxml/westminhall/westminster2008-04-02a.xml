	<p pid="a.242.2/1">My hon. Friend will recall that at a meeting held in the House a few years ago, the manufacturer of the main beneficial drug justified its price not according to the costs of production but according to the drug company's problems&mdash;I believe that some of its other major drugs had failed and, in order to stay solvent, it had to charge an extraordinarily high price for the drug. Is it not true that in many cases in which NICE must attempt to set a limit, the problem is not with the drugs' efficacy but with their excessive cost, which is intended to provide solvency to drug companies? Would it not be better if the patents were handed out to other companies so the drugs could be sold for a price closer to the cost of production?</p>

	<p pid="a.246.1/1">I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman is aware of the Raynaud's and Scleroderma Association, which was founded in my constituency and based there. Only a very small group of people suffers from those conditions&mdash;scleroderma in particular&mdash;and the drugs to which he refers are the only ones that can give any relief at all. The alternative is death. Will he ask the Minister to explain when she makes her winding-up speech why on that one and only occasion, NICE has denied patients a life-saving drug when it has not done so for any other condition?</p>

	<p pid="a.246.2/1">Indeed. I think that I have already made that point to the Minister. I have great sympathy with her in this case, however, because so far, it has nothing to do with the Department of Health; it is purely a preliminary recommendation by the NICE appraisal committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.2/2">The Minister must be aware that if the decision is confirmed, it may well&mdash;returning to the point that I made to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West&mdash;discourage the pharmaceutical industry from investing in research to find treatments for rare conditions such as PAH. If that is the climate in which orphan drugs are treated and NICE does not take account of the far higher costs of treating rare conditions such as PAH, what incentive is there for the industry? My hon. Friend the Minister should consider asking her officials to open negotiations with the two drug companies, GlaxoSmithKline and Bayer Schering Pharma, to see whether the price of the drugs can be reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.246.2/3">I became involved with the Pulmonary Hypertension Association because of a constituency case. One of my constituents, the father of a seven-year-old patient, wrote to me saying that he was very worried that the funding for epoprostenol, the drug that was keeping his son alive, would stop. That was in 1999, and he said in his letter that the drug cost &pound;120,000 a year. I wrote to my friend, Jon Owen Jones, who was the Wales Office Minister with responsibility for health, and I put a P.S. at the bottom, saying, &quot;I'm sure he's got it wrong. It must be only &pound;12,000.&quot; Jon Owen Jones wrote back to me, saying, &quot;No, the figure is correct, and with the likely increase in dosage, next year the price for the drug will be &pound;165,000.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.246.2/4">I took up the case and discovered, as I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West, that the price of that drug in north America was between one eighth and one tenth of its price in the United Kingdom. I made an arrangement with the pharmacist at Withybush hospital in my constituency, and we started to import drugs from north America at one eighth of the price that was quoted in this country. There is room for serious negotiation. I know that the price has come down; I do not dispute that. I know also that because they are ultra-orphan drugs, they are extremely expensive. However, the price that is quoted in the NICE appraisal must be examined to check that it is the actual price, because the appraisal committee's report refers to the fact that prices are negotiated locally. I cannot see why we should not have national negotiations for an ultra-orphan drug. We do not leave it up to individual pharmacists or hospitals to negotiate a separate deal, so surely, with only 400 patients, we should be able to negotiate a far lower price with those two companies, and perhaps compensate them by putting a penny on the price of aspirin or on something else.</p>

	<p pid="a.247.3/1">Circumstances have changed since 1999-2000. Nevertheless, there is no question but that at the time the arrangement saved the national health service about &pound;120,000 on that one patient, compared with the price that it would have paid the following year. The situation illustrates that throughout the world, different prices are charged for the same product. The irony was that we imported from the United States something that had been produced 250 miles away in Dartford, Kent.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.3/2">That was nonsense. It was obscene that a system could operate whereby in the United States, which is not a developing country by any stretch of the imagination, the cost was one eighth to one tenth of the price in this country, because of the arrangements that were made there. I also learned that, for individuals who are on Medicaid in the US, once their Medicaid ended, the deal was that the drug supplier would give the hospital the prostacyclins free of charge, which was a very generous arrangement. Perhaps that arrangement is indicative of the different deals that can be done with the drug companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.247.3/3">For 15 years, prostacyclins have significantly improved quality of life and extended the lives of PAH patients. If the drugs are withdrawn, patients will die unnecessarily. To withdraw prostacyclins on the basis of a flawed appraisal and prevent their future use is medically unsupportable and I trust that NICE will take on board all the submissions that are made today and reverse its preliminary recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.248.1/1">May I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1486" name="Nick Ainger">the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on the very balanced and reasonable way in which he has advanced his case? I attended the meeting to which he referred in his speech and I am a sponsoring signatory of the early-day motion that he has tabled.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/2">This is a very important debate. The Minister, with her nursing and medical experience, will take what is said today very seriously and I hope that she will ensure that NICE is made well aware of the strong feelings on this subject in the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/3">As the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire said, there is understandably great concern among the health community and the pulmonary arterial hypertension community in this country about future treatment in the United Kingdom for this rare&mdash;he was right to describe it as such&mdash;but deadly disease. Patient organisations are not only disappointed but extremely concerned for their members about NICE's preliminary recommendations on the treatment of PAH.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/4">To take up another point made by the hon. Gentleman, it would appear that there has been a complete lack of understanding of the implications for patients, particularly those with connective tissue disease-related PAH, such as Raynaud's and scleroderma, to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> drew attention in her intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/5">PAH is the greatest single cause of death in people with connective tissue diseases, of which scleroderma is perhaps the most deadly. It causes a most distressing form of death. Until approximately 10 years ago, the only standard treatment was parental prostanoids. As the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire said, intravenous prostacyclin still remains the accepted therapy for very advanced cases of PAH in all treatment centres, not only in the UK but in the United States of America, Canada and many European countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/6">Hope, in the form of oral therapies, has made a tremendous difference to a patient's quality of life. Therefore, endothelin receptor antagonists, or ERA, should be the first line of treatment for use in cases of connective tissue diseases associated with PAH, for which it is considered to be the best treatment option. When patients deteriorate despite oral therapy, they should have the choice of using intravenous prostanoids or possibly combinations of oral therapies, as evidence of their success increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/7">The hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire has already stated this, but let us be clear that we are only considering a very small number of patients&mdash;approximately 1,500&mdash;of which a third have connective tissue disease. Without the option of prostacyclin, patients will have no option other than palliative care when their condition deteriorates. They will then be condemned to six to 10 months of what one can only describe as a miserable existence: being breathless; suffering progressive right heart failure; and experiencing recurrent prolonged hospital admission, with all the costs that the hon. Gentleman outlined in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/8">That would not be the case if the treatments shown to be effective in other countries were standard in the United Kingdom in future. NICE has accepted that the therapies are effective; again, I take up a point made by the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire. The problems arise from the assertion that there is no difference between scleroderma and idiopathic PAH in terms of individual drug efficacy or modelling of cost-efficacy and that the appropriate cost comparator should be palliation. The standard therapy is intravenous prostanoids, which was proven more than 10 years ago to be effective, and which all guidelines accept is the gold standard therapy for the condition&mdash;I highlight that to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/9">As the hon. Gentleman also said, the model developed by NICE to determine cost-efficacy is not fit for purpose; I stress that to the Minister. The NICE appraisal acknowledged that the model failed to predict the actual outcome in the treated population. In fact, the national survey shows a 6 per cent. mortality rate every 12 weeks for patients with class 3 scleroderma-associated pulmonary hypertension on treatment. Surely it is totally irrational to choose to ignore real data and to determine the treatment of the condition on the basis of a model that is acknowledged to fail to accord with reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/10">The PAH centres in the UK are the envy of the world, as was stated at the well- attended and well-informed meeting organised recently by the hon. Gentleman. However, should the NICE recommendation be implemented, very sick people will continue to die unnecessarily. Surely the Minister must accept that message and take it to NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/11">How can NICE even consider taking away the only hope from this small group of patients, who, through no fault of their own, have developed a highly lethal condition? It is tantamount to condemning them to a death sentence. That is a very harsh thing to say, and I am sure that that outcome is not what NICE wants, but if its recommendation is acted on that is precisely what it will be doing; it will be condemning a small number of people to a death sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/12">With that small patient population, it is estimated that appropriate access to all available treatments would cost the NHS between &pound;20 million and &pound;25 million per year; again, I quote the figures given by the hon. Gentleman. Surely that is a very small sum. Moreover, patient outcomes are vital. The importance of getting people back to work, with their subsequent financial contribution to the economy as a whole and the reduced costs for the NHS, together with the patient's improved quality of life, are factors that do not appear to have been taken into account at all. That is an oversight, and a very sad one.</p>
	<p pid="a.248.1/13">NICE must be urged to review its provisional guidance to ensure that patients continue to receive life-saving treatments and to maintain the UK service record as the envy of the world in this area of health care; that status was highlighted at the meeting to which the hon. Gentleman referred in his speech. I trust that NICE will reconsider this unbelievable and extremely serious recommendation and make patients, not just money, its main priority in its considerations on this critical matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.253.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1486" name="Nick Ainger">the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger)</phrase> on leading this debate, and on his persistence in the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/2">I cannot rival the hon. Gentleman's knowledge, but I do know that pulmonary arterial hypertension, whether in the secondary or primary form, is dangerous, debilitating and difficult to treat. It is dangerous because it is often fatal. Life expectancy is not good: the death rate is high. It is debilitating because it destroys ordinary life. We heard some touching stories of heroic endurance. One wonders how people put up with the situation and do so with such apparent cheerfulness at times. The condition is also difficult to treat, because there is no cure, some of the treatment is invasive, and good treatment is hard to access. In my constituency, people have to travel as far as Newcastle to get specialist treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/3">It has been suggested that NICE has added to the woes of poor, suffering patients by recommending no further use of prostacyclins, intravenous epoprostenol or inhaled iloprost, which are regarded as gold standard treatments. It is suggested that that adversely affects 25 per cent. of sufferers, particularly those who are most severely or terminally ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/4">As has been said, all arguments about NICE tend to follow a familiar pattern. Incidentally, I must put on record the recent welcome change in NICE's decision about Lucentis. That shows that NICE does occasionally listen to arguments and have second thoughts. However, what usually happens is that a cheaper alternative is held up by NICE and set against an expensive proprietary drug. The reasons that the drug is expensive have been explored in some depth already.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/5">On one side, we have NICE and the primary care trusts, and, on the other side, we have patients, patient groups and the drug companies. NICE will normally claim that cheap alternatives are available&mdash;in this case, sildenafil&mdash;and that they are as efficacious as the more expensive alternatives. The drug companies and patient groups will argue, with some plausibility, that the more expensive alternatives have special benefits or&mdash;this is important&mdash;special benefits to particular patients, if not the whole patient group.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/6">No one per se is against NICE, which is a necessary evil. We all must acknowledge that health care is, if not rationed, at least finite, but people will argue with decisions if NICE has not followed its own guidelines and procedures sufficiently rigorously, or if guidelines have been inappropriately applied. That, I understand, is the argument proposed by the hon. Gentleman in favour of ultra-orphan drugs, notwithstanding the cost. In layman's terms, he suggests that the principles applicable to common complaints should be applied to this cruel and rare disease and its therapies, which is against NICE's guidelines. On the face of it, he appears to be correct, and his case was extraordinarily well made.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/7">However, I sound a general caution against assuming two things: first, NICE's infallibility; and, secondly, the total objectivity of its procedures. NICE assessments are undeniably rigorous, and its inspection of evidence is thorough. I have attended sessions at which it inspected drugs, and there was a huge amount of documentation; they were long sessions, during which patients groups were consulted. It seems to be an impressive procedure, but at the end of the day I would say that it is a judgment call. That call is based on the assessment of this strange unit called the QALY&mdash;the quality adjusted life year.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/8">The QALY reminds me of the great utilitarian 19th century philosopher Jeremy Bentham, who invented the hedon&mdash;a unit of happiness and pleasure. He suggested that all legislative and moral dilemmas could be solved by counting hedons, using what he called a hedonic calculus. One could work out units of happiness in order to discover whether proposed laws would increase or decrease the overall level of happiness. As a method, it has some advantages over parliamentary democracy. However, Bentham's method led to interminable debates about how to count hedons.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/9">Today, we have the same debate&mdash;how to assess the QALY. It is not simple arithmetic; indeed, it is not arithmetic at all. However, NICE and the QALY is the best that we have, provided always that NICE guidance is mediated and offset by patient experience, which is not always the case. Patient experience needs to be judged over time, and it needs to take account of proper clinical caution and casework experience. That is especially important for diseases that are rare and not understood, such as the one that we are debating today. We do not understand pulmonary arterial hypertension as well as we might. We know the symptoms, but we do not know its cause. Caution should be applied to removing therapies that are not obviously redundant or otiose in the light of patient experience and that of the clinicians who care for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.2/10">When we do not understand the cause of a disease, we often do not know why a drug works for some individuals, but not all&mdash;or not with a control group. That is why the voice of the patient group must be heard. Thanks to the hon. Gentleman, it will be heard even more loudly. In this case, cautious wisdom genuinely has a place.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02a.255.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" speakername="Anne Milton" colnum="255"  time="010:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/halltext/80402h0003.htm#08040262000554">
	<p pid="a.255.0/1">May I say what a pleasure it is, Mrs. Dean, to serve under your chairmanship?</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1486" name="Nick Ainger">the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger)</phrase>, as have many other hon. Members, on securing this debate. I was touched by the passion that he displayed on the subject and the enormous amount of work that he has done on it. The debate is not about a new drug, or another NICE problem&mdash;something that we often face&mdash;but about an existing and established treatment that has been available for about 15 years. As many hon. Members said, the treatment is considered to be the gold standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/3">Pulmonary arterial hypertension is one of five sub-types of pulmonary hypertension. It is rare; as the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire said, it is the result of an increase in pressure in the pulmonary artery. We have not focused much on the symptoms or how it might feel to be a patient with the disease, but it is characterised by fatigue, shortness of breath, chest pains, fainting, swollen ankles and legs and a swollen stomach. Patients often tell of extreme breathlessness and exhaustion.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/4">It is important to remember that rare diseases are often difficult to diagnose. Of particular note with this disease is the fact that people might have been attending their GPs for some time before a diagnosis is made. Before treatment starts, they may have suffered a year or more with symptoms not being affected by the treatments offered. They will see a diminution in their quality life; and, as with any complex and incurable disease, the poor survival rate will be associated with depression. The disease has a profound effect on the family, which is another subject that has not been touched on today.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/5">The debate is about whether NICE is operating within its guidelines. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1892" name="David Simpson">The hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase> spoke of the cost of drugs in the US&mdash;an interesting point&mdash;and highlighted the much higher price that we pay for prostacylins, and I hope that the Minister will address that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> mentioned another important group of patients&mdash;those who suffer similar disorders such as Raynaud's and scleroderma. She said that NICE appears to be ignoring its own rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">the Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> spoke with his usual clarity about the subject. I was, as always, flabbergasted by his expert medical knowledge on such matters, especially as I used to be a nurse. He raised concerns about the preliminary recommendation and emphasised that we are considering a very small number of patients for whom there is no alternative. If NICE's recommendation goes through, there will be no alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/8">My hon. Friend said that there is no argument about the efficacy of the drugs&mdash;NICE does not disagree&mdash;but he raised concerns about the modelling that is used by NICE. Although most hon. Members would support much of the work done by NICE, the debate has highlighted and drawn out concerns about the treatment of those with pulmonary hypertension. I hope that the Minister will take that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">The hon. Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> spoke about his tangle with the NHS over stents. I am pleased to hear that his stents appear to be serving him well, enabling him to contribute with clarity and some passion to today's debate. He reminded us&mdash;especially those on the Front Benches, who sometimes forget&mdash;that we are here to fight for individuals. He mentioned the case of one of his constituents, and we all appreciate it when Members quote from letters, as it brings home to us the fact that we are fighting for individuals. He said that epoprostenol and iloprost are part of a toolbox, which is a point that no other Member mentioned today. Clinicians have a range of drugs at their disposal, and if we remove some of those from their toolbox they will be less able to deal with symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1733" name="Paul Flynn">The hon. Member for Newport, West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> raised an extremely important issue, about which I feel strongly. It was good to hear someone speaking up for NICE, which does a good and difficult job. But he also raised the important question of the huge amount of money that drug companies put into marketing and selling their drugs. All Members have at some time been caught up with drug companies pushing particular treatments. Much more work needs to be done with drug companies, which often fund patient groups and work behind the scenes in ways that are not clear. I appreciate that they put a huge amount of money into research and development, but it is notable how much they put into marketing. To some extent, that is one of the challenges facing the NHS. Part of the money that, in fairness, the Government have put into the NHS has gone into drugs budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1830" name="John Pugh">The hon. Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> said that, ultimately, however much evidence NICE has, it must make a judgment, which must be offset against patient experience and clinical expertise. Although that patient experience should not overrule its judgment, it is important, especially in relation to rare conditions for which robust evidence of what works is difficult to find. Conservative Members respect NICE's independence, and it is important that calls on health service budgets are made by experts and not by politicians, who should not interfere. The criteria for assessing not only drugs, but treatments in the NHS, should be their clinical effectiveness and cost- effectiveness. It is also important that NICE conducts its work quickly, openly and transparently, and has the public's confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/12">The current use of QALYs, which has come up again today, has often been criticised as inflexible. The Conservative party is considering whether larger societal costs should be taken into account. I go back to where I started, and to the impact that such diseases can have on families. The hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire said that if alternative drugs are not available, withdrawal of a drug may incur considerable extra costs in hospital care, the patient losing their job and family members having to give up work to care for the person who is unwell.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/13">Pulmonary arterial hypertension is not the only illness or disease in relation to which effective treatment could save society considerable costs in the long term. Investment up front will sometimes produce a saving further down the line. Therefore, removing some of NICE's inflexibility is important. It is a shame that we do not always have the opportunity to consider the emotional and humane cost of treating diseases. Sadly, in this day and age we are fixed on budgets. They are important, but it is also important to put on record that we recognise the profound emotional cost for families who are battling this illness.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/14">We would like NICE's role to be extended. Although it is not the subject of the debate, it is important to mention that NICE has a wider role in producing evidence and setting guidelines on standards of care that encourage best practice and achieve outcome objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/15">On NICE's relationship with the drug companies, we want a better dialogue with the pharmaceutical industry, and the hon. Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire referred to that. NICE needs to be aware of what is being developed, what treatment regimes are available and what regimes are being trialled. It should work with drug companies to try to reduce prices. We must understand&mdash;I hope that the Minister will address this&mdash;why there are huge variations in the cost of drugs. That would help not only us in developing our ideas of where NICE should go, but clinicians and patient groups better to understand why its decisions are made.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/16">We cannot turn the clock back on NICE's preliminary report on PAH, but it will have caused considerable concern to those who are reliant on the drugs. Life is difficult enough for people who have a rare disease; it is difficult enough if they have an incurable disease; it is difficult enough if the symptoms interfere with daily activities, so that perhaps making a cup of tea is almost impossible. But this preliminary report is a huge added burden for them, given the concern about whether treatments will continue to be available, and, for clinicians, whether they will be available for new patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.0/17">I urge the Minister to keep an open mind about NICE. This has been a non-partisan debate, and I always welcome such debates, but I would like to hear what she is doing and what steps she will take to ensure that NICE remains flexible and is encouraged to work more closely with drugs companies. I would also like to hear her response to the more general concerns about how NICE operates, and to understand why it seems to have ignored the ultra-orphan status of the group of drugs involved. I hope that she will address those matters.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02a.257.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="257"  time="010:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/halltext/80402h0003.htm#08040262000555">
	<p pid="a.257.0/1">It is brilliant to be here under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1486" name="Nick Ainger">the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire (Nick Ainger)</phrase> on securing this debate. I know, as do all hon. Members, that for many years he has been a strong and persistent advocate of behalf of sufferers of pulmonary hypertension. He has actively engaged many of my predecessors, and rightly so, in helping to advance the case for improvements in treatment and to promote awareness of the disease throughout the United Kingdom, together with the Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK. I thank him, too, for sharing the transcript of the recent House of Commons stakeholder investigation, to which many patients, carers, professional staff and MPs contributed. Many of those MPs are present for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/3">I agree that this has been an emotional and educative debate. Hon. Members who have taken part are senior and experienced, with a track record of standing up not only for their constituents, but on health issues. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1699" name="Nicholas Winterton">The hon. Member for Macclesfield (Sir Nicholas Winterton)</phrase> has apologised for having to leave early to attend another meeting. Serious attention must be paid to what he, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the hon. Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase> and all hon. Members who have made a contribution said. One could not help but be moved by the contribution of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1839" name="Frank Cook">the Member for Stockton, North (Frank Cook)</phrase> about the little boy. I, too, have constituents with the disease. One little girl who had a transplant, sadly did not make it, but had often attended fund-raising events.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/4">Hon. Members have described the effects of pulmonary hypertension, which is a rare and potentially fatal condition that affects the heart and lungs. It requires expert care, expensive drug treatment and sometimes specialised surgery if life is to be prolonged. There has been considerable progress in treatment over the years, and I hope that hon. Members will allow me to explain current services: what we have achieved, how services are organised, how the commissioning of specialised services for the condition has developed and changed over the past few years, and the role of guidance on clinical care. I shall also address the issues concerning NICE.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/5">There are six centres for the treatment of adults with pulmonary hypertension in England, in Newcastle, Sheffield, Papworth, Hammersmith, and the Royal Free and Royal Brompton hospitals. Several of those centres run outreach clinics at other hospitals to ensure that patients do not have to travel too far. Those centres offer a high-quality service and are run by dedicated, highly professional clinicians. It is to their credit that more patients are being treated and that outcomes are improving.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/6">The six centres have been nationally designated by the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group, which became the National Commissioning Group in 2001, to ensure that highly specialised services are restricted to a small number of expert centres allowing the development and long-term maintenance of expertise in treating rare conditions. Commissioning responsibility has remained with local primary care trusts and specialised commissioning groups. The number of patients at the six centres has doubled over the past five years for two reasons. First, local hospitals are more aware of the condition and refer pulmonary hypertension patients to the centres at an earlier stage in the disease. The diagnosis is improving&mdash;I am aware that much more work must be done on that&mdash;and we should congratulate professionals and clinicians on the progress that has been made. The Pulmonary Hypertension Association can take great credit for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/7">Secondly, patients who are treated at PH centres are surviving longer. I understand the concerns of my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire about delays in recognising the signs of pulmonary hypertension and obtaining an initial diagnosis. However, as I have said, I encourage pulmonary hypertension clinicians and the association to continue their efforts in raising awareness across professional boundaries, perhaps through the royal colleges. If my hon. Friend believes that I, as Minister, and the Department can do more to raise awareness, it is our duty to do so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02a.259.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1448" speakername="Ann Keen" colnum="259"  time="010:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/halltext/80402h0004.htm#08040262000557">
	<p pid="a.259.1/1">Of course I will meet my hon. Friend and the people he would like to bring. The more I can learn about this subject, the better I can help.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/2">On the care and treatment of children with pulmonary hypertension, as my hon. Friend has just said, the national network is organised on a hub-and-spoke principle. The hub is Great Ormond Street hospital for children and the spokes for follow-up care are seven centres of paediatric cardiology at Leeds General infirmary, Bristol Royal hospital for children, Freeman hospital in Newcastle, Birmingham children's hospital, the Royal hospital for sick children in Yorkhill, Glasgow and the Royal Belfast hospital for sick children. I believe that Southampton has just joined that arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/3">Since April 2007, pulmonary hypertension services for children have been nationally commissioned, and performance has been managed by the National Commissioning Group on behalf on the NHS. The centre at Great Ormond Street has enjoyed considerable success. Published studies show that treatment through the children's pulmonary hypertension centre at Great Ormond Street has significantly improved survival rates for children with that serious condition. Studies have also reported improvements in psychosocial well-being and return to school. I pay tribute to that excellent service and the leadership of its outgoing lead clinician, Professor Haworth. Nearly all patients are investigated, diagnosed, receive treatment, and have their care package organised by a multi-disciplinary team on site. All the services essential to the care of pulmonary hypertensive children are consultant led and delivered at Great Ormond Street.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/4">The centre at Great Ormond Street expects to treat 80 new cases in 2007-08, compared with the 20 new cases that were treated in 2001-02. Its caseload in 2007-08 is forecast to be 418 patients, compared with 60 patients in 2001-02. The Great Ormond Street service reports survival as 96 per cent., 91 per cent., and 83 per cent. at one, two and three years respectively for children. Those results compare favourably with other studies. I do not have the time to discuss the Carter review because I want to spend time talking about NICE. However, hon. Members, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen, West and South Pembrokeshire, will be aware of Sir David Carter's report and the way in which it has changed commissioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/5">On the consensus of clinical guidance, with the encouragement of my hon. Friend and many of my predecessor Ministers for health, lead clinicians agreed to work together to produce a consensus statement for the management of pulmonary hypertension in clinical practice. That has taken longer than originally anticipated, and I am sure that that reflects the complex and difficult nature of weighing evidence and capturing and describing best practice. I was pleased to note that the consensus statement was launched three weeks ago at the House of Commons, and I welcome its publication as a significant step forward in raising standards of clinical practice and ensuring that the best available evidence is taken into account. All the clinicians involved are to be congratulated on their efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/6">Many hon. Members rightly raised the issue of NICE, and I thank my hon. Friends for their praise of NICE and for acknowledging the complexities of the organisation. Today, the main focus has been on NICE's appraisal of the cost and clinical effectiveness of drugs for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. The initial conclusions were recently issued with an appraisal consultation document, and stakeholders had until <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-20">20 March</phrase> to submit comments. I learned from my hon. Friend that today is yet another deciding day. The Pulmonary Hypertension Association and clinical colleagues have made submissions to NICE, which should be fully considered by NICE in the next stage of formulating final guidance. Some people welcome NICE guidance and some do not. As has been well highlighted today, we recognise that the institute's decisions have serious implications for patients and their carers. Such decisions are difficult, but they are made on the basis of the clinical evidence that has been submitted to NICE. Today's decision is critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/7">We ensured that NICE was independent, and it was right to do so. Health Ministers have always maintained that independence is important, and I would welcome Opposition Members' agreement that that should be the case. At the end of the day, I am in an awkward position, because if that independence is to be retained, with the best will in the world, I can only continue to urge hon. Members to do all that they can, and I will continue to do all that I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/8">My hon. Friend may not remember that one of our first conversations in the House was about a patient of mine who required the drug, and he told me about the purchase of drugs from the United States. I have an interest to declare because the headquarters of GlaxoSmithKline is in my constituency&mdash;I apologise for declaring that at the end, rather than the beginning, of my speech. I tried to undertake negotiations with GlaxoSmithKline, and with the help of my hon. Friend I was successful in looking at how such things could be negotiated. I do not come to this debate as a Minister who is simply reading a speech; I come to the debate as a former nurse and someone who is well aware of what quality of life is really about, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1603" name="Anne Milton">the hon. Member for Guildford (Anne Milton)</phrase> and others have described so well.</p>
	<p pid="a.259.1/9">This year, we are celebrating 60 years of the health service. In the Darzi review, we are looking at long-term and rare conditions, which have been included in the patient pathway. I give hon. Members my word that I will raise the issue of long-term conditions, particularly rare conditions, with Lord Darzi as part of his review. I hope that NICE brings us good news today.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on Carlett Park, which is one of three campuses under the auspices of Wirral Metropolitan college. That is a further education college offering both degree courses and higher-level qualifications. The college has announced that it is to pursue a two-site option, both in the north Wirral area, which would result in the closure of Carlett Park. I told the principal before the decision was taken that I believed that such a decision was flawed and did not take adequate account of the history of Carlett Park or the needs of the people of Eastham or south Wirral. People in Eastham and elsewhere share my disappointment that the site's future is again in question, and it is for those reasons that I wish to voice my concerns and to urge all those involved to reconsider the decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/2">Carlett Park, in one form or another, goes back a long way. The chapel, which is still on-site, was built in 1884 as a family chapel. It is the only remaining part of the original house and is listed in the diocese records as the Chapel of the Good Shepherd. A listed building, it was built originally for family worship by Canon Torr.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/3">The history of Carlett Park as an educational institution goes back to the 1940s and it has played a key role in south Wirral since then. In 1948, the county authority&mdash;we were then part of Cheshire&mdash;decided to buy Carlett Park to use it for a further education college serving Bebington, Ellesmere Port and Deeside. The college was known as West Cheshire central college of technology. Courses commenced in 1952, and in the 1950s and '60s, Carlett was one of the top six colleges training people to the level of graduateship of the Royal Institute of Chemistry, which is a professional qualification equivalent to a university degree.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/4">From October 1964, the college was known as the central college of further education, Carlett Park. Computing became a strong subject there, with lessons beginning in the 1970s. Its reputation for sciences was developed when state-of-the-art science and chemistry laboratories were built in 1978. At its peak in the '70s, Carlett Park offered a full range of courses, specialising in engineering and the sciences. From the 1960s onwards, a very large number of students came from overseas, from as far away as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait and elsewhere, to learn skills relevant to, among other things, the oil and aluminium industries. There is a considerable history and a considerable substance to Carlett Park.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/5">In 1982, the central college of further education at Carlett Park amalgamated with Birkenhead technical college and Wallasey college of further education to form Wirral Metropolitan college. By that time, our area had become part of Merseyside rather than part of Cheshire&mdash;the local government boundaries had altered&mdash;and the official title adopted for all the campuses was Wirral Metropolitan college.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/6">Over Carlett Park's long history, many Wirralians have been educated there. They include, for example, Ray Stubbs, who is a sports presenter, particularly on football but also on other things, and has been a crooner in his time; Paul O'Grady, another TV personality; and Brian Fleet, a senior vice-president of Airbus UK. Many others were also educated there. Christian Furr, an artist who studied at Carlett Park relatively recently, became, at 28, the youngest artist officially to paint the Queen.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/7">Despite its success over the years, Carlett Park has not secured a position of stability and permanence, to my regret. It was threatened with closure in 1999, as it was then thought by senior management that the relocation of programmes to other sites would overall increase the number of students. I campaigned against that and presented, among other things, a petition with 7,000 signatures calling on the then Further Education Funding Council to reconsider the decision by the board of the college. The campaign was long and hard. I think that the campaign was the catalyst for the departure of the then principal and the board of governors. I am not hoping or anticipating that the same will be true in this instance, but it does highlight how strongly people feel about the site. Subsequently, the college was given a fresh start with a new board of governors. I had a modest part in all that, and it is frustrating and disappointing to observe that Carlett Park's future is again in jeopardy. Surely the opposition to its closure both then and now suggests that the site should be allowed to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/8">The site is occupied by various buildings making up the present campus, but part of it was sold in 2001, with outline planning permission, as the location of a housing development to be built by Westbury Homes&mdash;an issue to which I shall return later. That helped to alleviate considerably the serious indebtedness of the college at the time, but the housing has, if anything, become a hindrance to development of the site, because once people move in, they tend to resist development next-door. That is the nature of the human condition and there is some suggestion that it has hindered development on the site. Obviously, the campus is now more compact than it was in the past. None the less, it is still a valuable part of Wirral Met, as we know it.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/9">As well as the housing side, the main administrative functions of the college are at Carlett Park. Various courses are also taught there, including leisure, tourism and travel, occupational studies, public services, sport, computing and IT, entry to employment, music and media, and some health and safety, science and teacher education courses. It is, in a sense, a shadow of its former self, but it is still substantial.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/10">In 2002, Carlett Park's 50th anniversary was celebrated. The celebrations included an exhibition at the site showing the contribution to education made by the college over the 50 years. Robin Cook came with me to see that exhibition and to visit the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/11">The campus has been upgraded relatively recently and money has been spent on refurbishment, with a view, it is said, to a new focus on equipping students with the skills to enter local business and industry. Again, I shall return to that. In January 2007, planning permission was granted for phase 1 of the construction of a purpose-built sports hall. I think that I am right in saying that construction commenced at the end of March 2007, but the project was shelved due to lack of funding. In its place, a temporary fitness studio was installed at the same location.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/12">In addition to the proposed sports hall, there has been the possibility of a long-term phased replacement of the current facilities with new buildings. Therefore, the potential for Carlett Park's continued development has recently been, and is currently, evident to senior management at Wirral Met. That makes the sudden closure decision all the more surprising. In my view, it is misguided. I should stress that this is the only campus in south Wirral. In the borough of Wirral, the next nearest is in Birkenhead. Carlett Park has, in that respect, what one might call a captive market, if it is allowed to be accessed. The reasons for the proposed closure are shrouded in a degree of unnecessary mystery. We have a press release on the plans to close Carlett Park, which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/13" class="indent">&quot;The Board of Governors had commissioned analysis on exploring the range of options and, following analysis of educational needs and demands, they agreed that the college should now proceed to explore a two-site option in the north Wirral area and develop a business case for maintaining a presence in the south Wirral area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/14">Words mean what they say. When the board says that it will develop a business case, it does not mean that it will make use of that case. The case will also only be developed with a view to maintaining a presence in the south Wirral area, and a presence is not necessarily a campus.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/15">The college says that the analysis cannot be made available either to me or to the general public for reasons of confidentiality. The only information that I have is from a recent meeting with senior management at the college at which I was told that other options included refurbishment of all the sites, a complete rebuild of Carlett Park, replacing Carlett Park with a new site&mdash;possibly in the south of the borough&mdash;and the building of a super-site college on a single site serving the whole of Wirral.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/16">The board decided to go for the two-site option. I maintain that the research commissioned by the board to inform its decision should have been made available so that we could understand and analyse the reasons behind the proposed closure. Understandably, the board is not keen to duplicate facilities between campuses, but Carlett Park is the only campus in the south. It cannot be right for the college to be based only in the north. In the press release it states that the college is</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/17" class="indent">&quot;aware of the educational needs and potential opportunities for those who live in the more deprived parts of Wirral.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/18">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/19" class="indent">&quot;We understand that the Government has made a significant amount of money available to help FE colleges improve their buildings.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/20">That is very welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/21" class="indent">&quot;To get a share of this money for Wirral, the college would have to show that it meets the needs of the whole Wirral community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/22">How can that be achieved if the south is left out?</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/23">I believe that there are numerous ways in which Carlett Park's resourcing facilities could be made to meet the needs of the whole Wirral community. More importantly, there are strong arguments regarding maintaining the current location of such resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/24">According to Wirral Met's Ofsted inspection report from May 2007, the college has been effective at reaching its goal of enrolling a high number of students who were previously not in education, employment or training, otherwise known as NEET learners. The college has also increased the percentage of learners from wards with high widening participation factors&mdash;from 27 per cent. in 1998 to 1999, to 48 per cent. in 2006 to 2007. In order to further those goals, the new principal&mdash;he took up position in 2006 with a proactive agenda to address local community learning needs&mdash;is working on those issues. To maintain such an increase in learning participation, it is imperative that Carlett Park remains open and available as an option to all those who wish to enter further education.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/25">We are now told that only some 2,300 students study at Carlett Park. That is a large number, but admittedly small in relation to those in the north. However, it has, to a large extent, become a self-fulfilling prophecy and there have been sins of commission as well as omission. Relatively few courses are now taught at Carlett Park. Opportunities to serve business needs have been tragically ignored. The science laboratories and engineering departments that once made Carlett Park a thriving college have long been taken away.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/26">According to Wirral, South's indices of mass deprivation 2004, in which Wirral's super output areas are ranked against each other, most of Eastham&mdash;the ward in which Carlett Park is located&mdash;and neighbouring Clatterbridge and Bromborough are ranked highly. That relative deprivation is not always identified on broader-scale deprivation rankings. The current opportunity to develop skills and employability that Carlett Park affords should not be taken away from the people of south Wirral, who generally feel that they are treated with scant attention compared with those in the north of the borough.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/27">Child poverty statistics for Wirral, South from 2007 also demonstrate that some children living in wards adjacent to that in which Carlett Park is based are ranked higher than average. It does not make sense that Carlett Park, which caters for local students who are evidently in need of opportunities to learn a variety of skills and optimise their chance of success in life, should close.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/28">On Carlett Park's doorstep is the centre of gravity of Wirral's industry and commerce. It houses the largest concentration of businesses and commerce in that part of Merseyside. Statistics show that 17 per cent. of employees in Wirral, South work in the manufacturing sector, compared with just 11 per cent. nationally. That is not surprising given that Wirral, South is home to organisations such as Unilever, which alone employs nearly 2,000 workers, and the Wirral international business park, which is seen as a strategic site by the Northwest Regional Development Agency. Many thousands of people are employed on that site. It houses, among other things, 15 major international companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/29">There is also a major retail site known as the Croft retail park. One employer, Asda, currently employs 540 people&mdash;that is not extraordinary for the site or the national picture&mdash;and, if it gets planning permission, could recruit a further 80. Vauxhall Motors is located close by. Such organisations and businesses should be considered as a catchment for Carlett Park. Its southern boundary falls into Wirral's employment corridor, which runs along the Mersey side of the peninsula. The location represents a major economic opportunity for Wirral as a whole, but also exhibits serious deprivation. The so-called employment corridor is identified as the location with the greatest potential for securing European funding. There is also enormous scope for training in skills relating to those areas of industry and commerce.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/30">The college has already capitalised on the construction industry of the north-west, but has failed to serve the needs of local industry to an adequate degree. With the Government's renewed emphasis on investment in apprenticeships, it seems that Carlett Park could facilitate the transition from a low-income, unskilled work force to one that masters and embraces the skills of contemporary and future industry, thanks to local work experience and partnership opportunities. I think it is shameful that Carlett Park's proximity to south Wirral's industrial and managerial sector has not been exploited. The board and management should hang their heads in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/31">I am taking up too much time, Mrs. Dean, and I will conclude shortly. On the issue of land and money, the size of Carlett Park previously made it a target for developers, and as I mentioned, some of it was sold off in 2001. Such short-term ways of acquiring money are often a driver in the wrong direction. Perhaps that feature of financing is behind the decision to close Carlett Park. It is good news that the Government, through the authorities, are making a large amount of money available. The college has an opportunity to secure a multi-million pound investment and, in order to do so, it has committed to create a world-class FE college, which does not include Carlett Park. That suggests that the long-term approach for Wirral Met college, in which the vision is to take into account the current and future needs of students across the peninsula, is not being adopted. To some extent, it appears that the college is hastening to pursue a policy of chasing the money that is available. I endorse the idea that the college should seek additional funds and grants, and that it should seek excellence, but it should not be at the cost of sacrificing such a valuable site to satisfy funding criteria. It is an upside-down approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/32">It has been recognised by the management that considerable sums of money are needed to refurbish the older buildings on the Carlett Park site. Yet surely that kind of investment should be preferred over knocking down valuable older sites and building new ones, which will eventually also need refurbishment and additional investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/33">Eastham is a nice and historic place in which to live. The village is in the Domesday Book, but it is not strong on facilities. Admittedly, it has a golf course, a rugby club and a country park, but it does not have a great deal of employment and facilities. We are in danger of tearing the heart out of it. There is overwhelming evidence that the campus is part of the fabric of Eastham and that it serves a crucial role in the local community; with the right direction, it could play a key role in south Wirral's future economic development. I urge the college and the Minister to reconsider the proposal. I know that a consultation will take place and I urge people to participate in it. The most effective way in which to cover the whole area and ensure easy access to further education would be to maintain Carlett Park.</p>

	<p pid="a.267.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1930" name="Ben Chapman">the Member for Wirral, South (Ben Chapman)</phrase> on securing the debate. He is a powerful advocate, both publicly and privately, for his constituents. Indeed, he raised this specific issue with me on the Floor of the House at oral questions last week. In the Wirral and throughout the country we need to face up to the skills challenge and we see our further education colleges as crucial drivers. That is critical.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/2">My hon. Friend referred to the fact that in the recent past, hundreds of thousands in communities throughout England have benefited from the Government's investment in the college infrastructure. Colleges such as Wirral Metropolitan have taken the opportunity given by our investment of more than &pound;2 billion in the past 10 years to develop world-class learning buildings and facilities. That is in stark contrast to the situation 11 years ago, when there was not one penny of capital funding in the mainstream FE capital budget. In the past 10 years, the Government's investment of more than &pound;2 billion has ensured that learners have access to the state-of-the-art buildings and facilities that are essential if we are to meet our skills ambitions and the needs of our local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/3">We have recently announced in our &quot;Building Colleges for the Future&quot; capital strategy that a further &pound;2.3 billion will be invested in the college estate in the next three years. I have seen examples up and down the country of the transformation of college buildings, facilities and opportunities. That gives the lie to those who claim that investment and money do not make a difference&mdash;manifestly, they do make a difference. That investment will benefit generations of learners to come, help to meet the skills needs of employers and act as a genuine catalyst for community regeneration. Capital investment plays a crucial role in the Government's implementation of our priorities for young people and adults as set out in the 14 to 19 reform programme and our response to the Leitch review.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/4">Modernisation of the FE estate is about not only bricks and mortar but creating the best possible learning environments that are accessible to all learners; ensuring that young people are excited by learning so that they stay on in education and training; creating greater specialisation, so that businesses have access to a wider range of industry-specific skills development opportunities for their current and future employees; and creating community-owned facilities that meet local needs and can provide the important kick start for local regeneration. Ensuring that such facilities are accessible to those who most need them is critical, as my hon. Friend said; it is absolutely necessary if we are to maximise the public benefit of our investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/5">Before talking about the specifics of the Wirral Metropolitan college, I should like to talk about the process for capital applications. It is crucial that any investment plans by colleges underpin their core mission of reflecting and responding to the diversity of their local communities, to provide high-quality learning opportunities for people in all parts of society who need to further their knowledge and improve their skills. That is a requirement for all the areas that a college covers, not just some of them. It means that a college must engage with all sections of the community when it is starting to plan any redevelopment project, to take into account the needs of the population that it serves. To be considered for public funding support, colleges are required by the Learning and Skills Council to demonstrate that their proposals will serve the educational needs of people in their local area. That is a genuine test through which local colleges must pass. Colleges must go through a robust, multi-stage process, whereby the educational and business cases are scrutinised. Public consultation is rightly an important part of that process and is required even before the plans can be approved in principle. Further widespread consultation will take place before planning permission can be granted.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/6">On the heart of the argument that my hon. Friend made, Wirral Metropolitan college has begun the journey&mdash;it is at the start and not the end of a process. It is a medium-sized general FE college which, currently, as he made clear, occupies three campuses: Conway Park and 12 Quays in Birkenhead, and Carlett Park in Eastham in the south of the borough. In January last year, the college was considering a new sports facility at Carlett Park. In the subsequent months, the thinking of the college management and board broadened, and the college board of governors agreed to defer any decisions until a full range of options for redeveloping the college estate has been considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/7">Following considerable research and analysis commissioned by the board of governors, a number of options have been investigated to ensure that there is an educational case to underpin them. As part of that process, the options were discussed with other interested parties such as the local authority director of children services, local councillors, and the principal of Birkenhead sixth form college. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-05">5 March</phrase>, the college governors reached their preferred option, which is to consolidate the colleges on the two sites in Birkenhead in north Wirral at the same time as developing the business case for maintaining a presence in south Wirral. The devil, as always, is in the detail, and I acknowledge that, as the consultation process goes forward, it is incumbent on the college and its governing body to explain clearly and precisely, locally, what is meant by &quot;a presence in south Wirral&quot;, which is the very point that my hon. Friend made.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/8">I should be clear that the college is at the earlier stage of the consultation process and no sites have been identified. The college's three recognised trade unions are supportive of the concentration option, which includes looking at the business case for &quot;a presence in south Wirral&quot;. Since that in-principle decision, the college has begun to consult with current students and stakeholders, contacted Wirral's MPs, including my hon. Friend, and conducted a meeting with local councillors for Eastham. That is the minimum that needs to happen and I urge that a fully comprehensive consultation process takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/9">The next stage is for the formal submission of the application in principle in June. It would be considered by the Learning and Skills Council's national property, local partnership, and regional finance teams. After that, it would require approval by the LSC north-west regional council and the LSC national capital committee. A full proposal is not anticipated until early 2009. I say that to communicate the point that an awful lot of water will flow under the bridge before a fully-fledged proposal comes forward. Within that, there must be genuine opportunities for the local community, local stakeholders and, importantly, local MPs to make their voices heard. The director of the LSC for Greater Merseyside recently said that to be considered for funding support, the college must demonstrate that its proposal provides further education opportunities that meet the needs and demands of the Wirral to support education and training for the next 30 to 40 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/10">A comprehensive prospectus for the whole of the Wirral community must be put forward. Clearly, the issue of access will need to be addressed. At the moment, 85 per cent. of learners at Carlett Park travel more than 3 miles in contrast to northern campuses, where more than half of learners live within 3 miles. The issue of access and transport must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.0/11">It is ultimately a matter for local decision and for the governing body of the college as an independent institution. It would be inappropriate for me to intervene directly&mdash;I am actually prohibited by legislation from doing so. Nevertheless, I strongly urge my hon. Friend to continue to engage on behalf of his constituents with the college governing body and the LSC to ensure that the college's plans meet the needs of all learners in the Wirral; in the whole of the community rather than just parts of it. Knowing my hon. Friend, I am sure that he will continue to make the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.2/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dean. I am sure that you have heard that these excursions into Scottish politics are usually cosy, consensual affairs, and I expect that we shall see some of that. I have been looking forward immensely to the debate, and cannot wait to hear some of the contributions of Labour Members. They did not have an opportunity to discuss this issue and their commission at their Aviemore conference, so I thought that I would helpfully oblige by supplying the debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.2/2">Is it not great that we are where we are now? Who would have believed that in one short year we would be where we are? Everyone agreed that devolution is a process, not an event. Everyone in this Chamber agreed that more powers are required for the Scottish Parliament. Who would have believed that the Conservative, Liberal, Scottish National and Labour parties would now demand more powers for the Scottish Parliament? It is remarkable, and we should take a moment to appreciate its full significance and importance. Of course, it was all started by the Scottish Government's national conversation. Now everyone is talking. We cannot shut them up any more.</p>
	<p pid="a.270.2/3">In the past few days we have had significant contributions to that national debate. Sir Tom Hunter, Scotland's top businessman and entrepreneur, said that a referendum is required immediately.</p>

	<p pid="a.273.4/1">As always, my hon. Friend makes a very powerful point and I can see blank faces on the Labour Benches in response to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.4/2">How did we have arrive at this very satisfactory situation? Has there been a Damascus-like conversion from Labour Members? Did they wake up one morning and, all of a sudden, think that the Scottish Parliament needs fiscal powers and autonomy to do its job properly, better to represent the people of Scotland? Alternatively, maybe&mdash;just maybe&mdash;it was something to do with a certain day in May when an SNP Government were elected and the Labour party lost power for the first time in a generation. Perhaps it had something to do with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.4/3">I have imagined the scene in the Scottish Parliament when the commission idea was first suggested and mooted. I can imagine the Labour Members of the Scottish Parliament sitting in their weekly meeting, despondent and depressed. They have been completely shattered by their Scottish leader getting involved and embroiled in the donations scandal; bruised by the continued popularity of an SNP Government riding high in opinion polls; and monstered on a weekly basis at First Minister's questions. I can see the former, sacked, disgraced, over-refreshed adviser going to the meeting and saying, &quot;I've got an idea to get one over on the Nats. Let's take the whole issue of the constitution to the SNP&quot;. One can imagine all the back-slapping following such a suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="a.273.4/4">However, Labour MSPs did not account for hon. Members here in Westminster. I can imagine the steam coming out of the ears of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1998" name="Jimmy Hood">the hon. Member for Lanark and Hamilton, East (Mr. Hood)</phrase> and others when they heard the plan for more powers for the Scottish Parliament. I can imagine mutterings of &quot;Over my dead body&quot; from the right hon. Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow and the state of apoplexy induced in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2020" name="Jim Devine">the hon. Member for Livingston (Mr. Devine)</phrase>. The call would have been met less than enthusiastically and I understand why those people are less than enthusiastic about powers being transferred from Holyrood to Westminster&mdash;Labour Members are not intervening to support the idea so I am looking forward to their speeches. They once ruled the roost and had powers absolute in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.277.1/1">Absolutely. Our preference is for a yes-no referendum, but if it is to be a multi-option referendum, that is what we shall have. A multi-option referendum has previously been supported by the Labour party. An early-day motion from 1992, signed by 12 Labour Members, said that a multi-option referendum was necessary to secure Scotland's constitutional future. The Prime Minister agrees that a multi-option referendum would be the most appropriate way to settle Scotland's constitutional future for ever. Donald Dewar believed that a multi-option would be required in order to settle the matter. If it was good enough for them, it should be good enough for Labour Members&mdash;and it should be good enough for the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.3/1">My hon. Friend makes extremely good sense and I think that the whole of Scotland wants to know what happened to that &pound;34 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/2">The Calman commission provides an opportunity to grasp all of the issues that I have paraded before the Chamber. It will explore the success of devolution and consider how the devolution settlement can be better developed to work for the people of Scotland within the UK. The chair of the commission stated clearly that he</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/3" class="indent">&quot;would not have accepted this if I felt this was something being driven from elsewhere&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/4">We have a real opportunity for Scottish progress, on a particularly Scottish matter, in a way that will include a wide range of expertise from Scottish business, law, public life and civic Scotland. Although it is fundamentally important not to prejudge the outcome of the commission&mdash;unlike what the SNP wants us to do&mdash;the flexibility that the Scotland Act gave us must be retained in any new agreement. Since 1999, the flexibility under the Act has delivered 164 orders with more to come later this year. That flexibility reflects good governance in the interests of the Scottish people.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/5">Where there has been a clear case for devolving further powers, the UK Government have agreed to do so. For the sake of clarity, no matter has ever moved the other way&mdash;from devolved back to reserved control. That balance must be a matter for consideration by the commission and for it to make recommendations on. How can it be independent, if we do not allow it to reach its own conclusions?</p>
	<p pid="a.284.3/6">The Calman commission allows for a review of the devolution settlement, which has been in place for 10 years, for the position approved by the democratically-elected Scottish Parliament to be considered and for cross-border and non-partisan discussion. Will the SNP abandon its late-night cyberspace conversations, see the light and embrace it?</p>

	<p pid="a.286.4/1">No, because I only have two minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.4/2">Secondly, the way in which the nationalist conversation is being conducted seems to encourage the posting of bigoted, racist comments on the Government website, which is funded totally by the taxpayer. The Scottish Administration needs to consider very carefully what they are encouraging. My third point concerns the issue about which the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar has been jumping up and down and chuntering away. He wants all powers devolved to Scotland and full independence. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1974" name="James McGovern">the Member for Dundee, West (Mr. McGovern)</phrase> mentioned defence. I was perusing the <i>Scotland on Sunday</i> and noticed a letter from a chap called Jeff Duncan who runs a campaign to reinstate all six former Scottish regiments, which I understand is also the SNP's policy&mdash;that demonstrates how little concern it has about defence. However, I also noticed that Mr. Duncan describes himself as the webmaster for the Black Watch. Among other things, he consistently criticises troops' commitment to the course in Afghanistan, which does profound damage to morale in the Black Watch. I am deeply depressed that this man, who describes himself as webmaster for the Black Watch website&mdash;indeed, he appears to be so&mdash;also describes himself as being close to Alex Salmond, by whom he is supposedly extremely well supported. I hope that SNP Members will take this opportunity to disassociate themselves from Jeff Duncan's disgraceful comments, if he is, as I believe he is, the Black Watch webmaster.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.1/1">Need we say more? Perhaps the hon.

Gentleman's question, I am entirely relaxed about an intelligent discussion on the powers of the Scottish Parliament.

	<p pid="a.290.7/1">The hon. Gentleman shows that he obviously does not believe in democracy. However, I must press on.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.7/2">The Liberal Democrats set up the Steel commission three years ago to make recommendations on constitutional changes. Chaired by Lord Steel, it reported in March 2006, and I certainly suggest to all hon. Members that they read its recommendations, because it made excellent recommendations about how we should take the debate forward. The commission found that, compared with many Parliaments that operate in a federal system, the Scottish Parliament has considerable legislative power, but very limited control over taxation. That situation certainly has to change. We need a written constitution that sets out the limits of power of the various partners within the Union; sets out the powers that are the exclusive domain of the UK Parliament; introduces a new category of formal partnership working in specific areas; and confirms that all other areas are within the competence of the Scottish Parliament. In particular, we tax-raising powers must be transferred to the Scottish Parliament, so that it raises the bulk of its own funds. I certainly look forward to the constitutional commission taking this debate forward and the Liberal Democrats, unlike the SNP, will enthusiastically participate in the coming debate on Scotland's future within the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.0/1">I welcome you to the Chair, Mrs. Dean, and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2009" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> on securing the debate. Having listened from the sidelines as a Member of Parliament who represents an English constituency, the debate has reminded me of what I have missed, having moved south. Now I know what the Conservatives missed while not on Renfrewshire council for all those years, in the days of Hugh Henry and the like.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/2">The debate is a missed opportunity. It could have been about the opportunities and challenges facing Scotland, but instead it has pretty much followed the line of the SNP since it was elected in May 2007, which is all about gloating. The party's justification for everything is, &quot;We got more votes than you; we got rid of a few Liberal Democrat MSPs,&quot; and that is about it. I went to the Scottish Parliament and saw First Minister's questions last week, and that was the only answer that the First Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1964" name="Alex Salmond">the right hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Mr. Salmond)</phrase>, gave to any of the questions asked by the Opposition. He was saying, &quot;Well, it doesn't matter, because we are more popular at the moment.&quot; However, we all know that popularity lasts only so long in grown-up politics. Real decisions have to come home to roost, and we have to stand by them.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/3">We could have taken this opportunity to address UK issues that affect Scotland, such as defence. However, I am not surprised that the SNP did not want to address such issues, because it has no coherent defence policy whatsoever. I have a long memory and, as an ex-member of the Scots Guards, I follow closely pledges to save regiments, as well as marches through Dundee. The Black Watch is going to be saved by the SNP, but for what purpose, as the party has no defence policy whatsoever? The Scottish nationalists rushed to save RAF Leuchars, and the base in Moray, but what are they going to fly in an independent Scotland? Who could forget Lieutenant-Colonel Crawford, the Scottish nationalist military adviser who said in a policy pamphlet for the SNP, in 1999, that we could replace Scotland's nuclear deterrent with chemical and biological weapon stocks? We cannot forget that. I am not sure what he is doing now, but no doubt he will make a surprise return to the SNP fold at some stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/4">Unsurprisingly, this debate is about peddling the myth that the SNP speaks for Scotland and that it is building momentum. It is vital that the party has momentum, because without it people will realise that smart Alec is just that and nothing else. The SNP is absolutely determined that this referendum&mdash;it is trying sneakily to divide us on the commission&mdash;is all about building momentum. However, the facts speak for themselves, and show that that is a myth: 17 per cent. of people who were eligible to vote in May 2007 voted for the SNP. That is hardly a ringing democratic endorsement of proposed independence. In every one of the past few polls, less than 30 per cent. of respondents wanted independence. Interestingly, 12 per cent. wanted to abolish the Scottish Parliament&mdash;a mere 5 per cent. less than the percentage of eligible voters who wanted independence. Let us not get carried away with the myth.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02a.297.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" speakername="Simon Burns" colnum="297"  time="016:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/halltext/80402h0010.htm#08040262000715">
	<p pid="a.297.3/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on the important subject of applications determining whether businesses can establish pharmacies. I start by thanking the Minister, who over the past few weeks has been extremely helpful in meetings and conversations and in looking into the problems that I have raised with her. I am grateful for her attitude and the co-operation and help that she has given me.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/2">There is a problem up and down the country. There is certainly a problem in my constituency and I do not think that it is unique. Constituencies up and down the country have a first-class network of pharmacies. They are mostly small pharmacies and many of them are family-owned and family-run businesses that have blended well with the larger contemporary high-street pharmacies such as Boots. My constituents and others know the pharmacist in their local area. They are familiar with the business, and the people serving in the pharmacy know their customers and can give them personal advice and help, not only when they go there to have their prescriptions fulfilled but when they are buying other medication over the counter. A pharmacy is a vital part of a local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/3">Until recently, if any business, be it large or small, wished to open another pharmacy in an area, the criteria that had to be considered before a decision was taken on an application included whether it was necessary and whether it was desirable. Unfortunately, the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005 changed that level playing field, regardless of whether a small or large operator was making the application.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/4">Let me refer to regulation 13. For obvious reasons, this will apply mostly to larger operators&mdash;supermarkets, Boots and so on. Under regulation 13, provided that applicants fill in the application form 100 per cent. accurately and completely and provided that they promise to open for 100 hours a week, the primary care trusts have no power other than to approve the application, regardless of whether that is necessary or desirable. The hands of the PCTs are tied.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/5">Ironically, when an application is submitted, there is a 45-day consultation process whereby members of the public and other interested parties can make their views on an application known. The downside is that the consultation process is utterly meaningless, because 100 per cent. of the responses could be against the granting of an application by, for example, a large supermarket, but the PCT would in no circumstances be able to refuse the application, provided that it met the criteria that the form had been accurately and completely filled in and the applicant was promising that the pharmacy would be open for 100 hours a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/6">That is unfair. It creates an unfair, unlevel playing field for considering applications. I do not want to distort a market. One should not automatically say on every occasion that pharmacy services should be provided only by a small outlet. In certain circumstances, there is a role for supermarkets to provide pharmacy services, but let the decision-making process for the applications take place on a level playing field where everyone has to compete in the same conditions without the system being loaded in favour of the big operators, which, for a variety of reasons, can promise 100-hour opening.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/7">The reason that I raise this issue is that there are two particular problems in my constituency. There is a problem involving the small family-run Waldman pharmacy in Chelmer village, next-door to Asda the supermarket&mdash;its front door is 50 ft away from the entrance to Asda. Ironically, Asda owns the property that the family run their business from and is their landlord. They have been providing the local Chelmer village community with pharmaceutical services for the past 25 years. They are well known and well liked in the local community and they provide a first-class service. They know their customers and they can give advice as well as fulfilling the prescriptions presented to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/8">In almost 21 years as a Member of Parliament, I have never had a single letter from anyone in my constituency complaining that they have not been able to obtain prescription drugs or non-prescription drugs in Chelmsford out of hours. That is because the pharmacies have a system in Chelmsford: they will be open on a Sunday and late in the evenings to meet the needs of the local population. No one has complained to me about the current situation, but Asda has made an application to open a pharmacy on its site, with 100 hours being promised. If that application is granted, it will almost certainly put out of business the family-run pharmacy next-door, for no other reason than that the application has been granted on an unlevel playing field and a small pharmacy cannot compete in the same way as a large supermarket. That is unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/9">If there were a series of complaints about the service that the pharmacy provided, it would be justifiable to say, &quot;Let's look at what's going on and see whether there's a way to improve the current system and the service being provided, or perhaps we will have to change the supplier,&quot; but there never has been a complaint. People are happy with the service that they receive. For that reason, what is happening seems unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/10">It now emerges that, further round the northern arch of my constituency, in the town of Chelmsford, the Pharmacy, in Clematis Tye in Springfield, faces a threat from Sainsbury's, which is located in that part of the town and is making its third application, under regulation 13, with a promise of 100 hours of pharmacy opening time. That small community pharmacy will be put out of business if the application is granted. Again, that is wrong. We are talking about ruining the livelihoods of individuals who are very dedicated and have worked extremely hard, in the public interest, to provide a first-class service that is welcomed by customers and the local community that they serve. They will be put out of business at a stroke simply because of the bulk-buying and market power of a large faceless supermarket.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/11">In addition, the supermarkets will not be able to build up the same relationship with their customers, because of the sheer nature of their business. Their business is determined by turnover and getting customers in and out swiftly while ensuring that they buy the maximum amount of goods. Why are they putting in a pharmacy service? I am not sure that their wanting to provide prescription and non-prescription drugs for their customers is totally altruistic&mdash;of course, supermarkets already provide a range of non-prescription drugs. The motive is to get more people into their premises so that when they come in to change their prescriptions they will almost certainly, on the law of averages, purchase foods and other goods, which will increase and enhance the supermarkets' ability to make a larger profit. My argument is that such a change is not necessary and not in the interests of the local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/12">I also have one or two problems with what happens when the applications are granted. I understand that Penny Beck of Tesco recently came to the House to address an all-party group. She said that many supermarkets were putting in applications for pharmacies on the basis of the 100-hour rule because they felt that it was a dead cert that they would be successful if they completed the forms accurately. However, once the supermarkets are successful in their application, they then seek to reduce the commitment that they have given to open for 100 hours and try to change the terms and conditions to 80 hours or 60 hours. I can see one of the Minister's officials looking rather sceptical. I do not want to cross swords with them because they are far more knowledgeable than I am. Perhaps I could give them some evidence of where this is happening to substantiate my case.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/13">I understand that Sainsbury's in Chafford Hundred in southern Essex has had a 100-hour application granted, and it has not delivered on those hours. It is not a question of seeking to get the terms changed; it has just not delivered the 100 hours even though the application was granted solely on that basis. Will the Minister tell me what action she, the Department of Health or the local PCT will take against those supermarkets or applicants that make an application on such a false pretence?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/14">In south Essex, another pharmacy has been granted an application for a 100-hour pharmacy, but it is trying to reduce the conditions to 40 hours. If applications based on 100 hours are granted in good faith, and small pharmacies in the immediate area have been put out of business, it is a bit rich for the applicant to try to reduce the hours they have to open to 40, which is what the small pharmacies were already doing. We cannot then bring back the small pharmacies that have gone out of business. Will the Minister tell us what action can be taken against pharmacies that have been granted an application based on 100 hours but are not keeping to those hours, and how we can stop larger applicants, which have been granted an application solely on the commitment of 100 hours, from reducing their hours?</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/15">At some point in the not-too-distant future, the Government will publish a White Paper on pharmacy services. I have heard on the grapevine that the publication date is tomorrow. I do not know whether that is true, and I do not know whether the Minister is in a position to confirm it. However, when that White Paper is published, I hope that it contains some recommendations on the system of applications for running a pharmacy service. I assume, as is normal with many White Papers, that the Government will have a view about the direction that they want to take, but they may want a consultation process to hear other people's ideas.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/16">If the Government accept my argument that there is something inherently unfair with the existing system and agree to change it and redress the imbalance between the larger and smaller providers, would the Minister be prepared to suspend the 2005 rules until she has made the necessary changes? That would save a number of pharmacies&mdash;not least the two in my constituency. They might be caught up in a situation in which the Government were minded to make the system fairer but were unable to make the changes for some time because of other parliamentary business&mdash;unless the Government used secondary legislation. It would be tragic if the smaller pharmacies then went out of business knowing that help was on the way, but time was not in their favour.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.3/17">For those reasons, I hope that the Government will accept that the situation is unfair, and that it is morally wrong to weight a system in such a way that it affects people's livelihoods and businesses. I hope that she will do something to help the smaller pharmacies that have played such a vital role within our local communities. In the majority of cases, they have provided a first-class service. Customers are, by and large, happy with the personal service that they receive and do not want it replaced by a highly impersonal service from a larger provider that, in other areas of the retail sector, is taking over more and more of our small shops and high streets.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.0/1">May I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1493" name="Simon Burns">the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns)</phrase> on securing this debate? I know that this is a matter that has caused him great concern and he has again highlighted the main issues that he seeks to bring to my attention and the attention of the House. I am also aware from the Department's postbag that other hon. Members from other parts of the country share his concerns. I will briefly outline the current position and respond to the points that the hon. Gentleman has raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/2">As I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree, pharmacies are businesses, and the Department of Health did not address the question of fairness of competition. To give some background, in 2003 a report from the Office of Fair Trading recommended total deregulation of the retail pharmacy services in the United Kingdom with the abolition of the regulatory restrictions on NHS pharmacy applications, known as the controlled entry. The Government responded to that substantial report, which called for total deregulation, with a cautious move in the directions recommended, but announced a balanced package of reforms for England in July 2003. They recognised many of the points that the hon. Gentleman has raised and stopped quite a long way short of the original recommendations. The measures were largely introduced from April 2005. The hon. Gentleman has again asked me&mdash;as he has in private&mdash;whether I have the power to suspend the 2005 regulations. I have to tell him that a simple suspension is beyond my powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/3">The reforms had a number of aims. They were designed to open up the NHS pharmacy market to greater contestability to improve patient choice and access to pharmacy-led services and to drive up the quality of the services in tandem with the new contractual framework for community pharmacy. The hon. Gentleman would accept all those principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/4">The reforms included four specific exemptions to the controlled entry system, one of which was for pharmacies prepared to open for at least 100 hours a week. When introducing those reforms, the Department made it clear that pharmacies that benefited from those new regulatory freedoms would also have to meet obligations and safeguards. The hon. Gentleman touched on that point, and I want to answer him.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/5">Pharmacies that commit themselves to opening more than 100 hours a week must stick to that commitment. They must also agree to provide the services that the PCTs require them to provide locally&mdash;for instance, helping people to stop smoking, or providing emergency hormonal contraception. We have also ensured that PCTs have the power to remove contractors from their pharmaceutical list that consistently fail to meet those terms with no good reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/6">The hon. Gentleman asked me for information about those pharmacies that, in his view, do not stick to their commitment. They will be monitored by the PCT, which will require regular returns on opening hours, monitor complaints and take action under the regulations to impose further conditions. Ultimately, notice of removal to a contractor can be given; if default occurs, it can be removed from the list.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.0/7">The hon. Gentleman also asked whether companies that committed themselves to 100 hours were automatically given agreement. It is not automatic; in the two years since March 2007 about one fifth of applications for 100-hour pharmacies have been refused by the PCT or withdrawn. I know that the hon. Gentleman's PCT will be considering the application that concerns him at its May meeting. He may want to make further representations on the issue. The PCTs have the necessary powers.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.3/1">I undertake to get that information to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/2">I know that the hon. Gentleman is committed to patient choice, so I remind him that the Department undertook a complete review, which was published in January 2007. It specifically considered patient choice. With respect, I say gently to the hon. Gentleman that if the pharmacy of the patient's choice was providing all the services, the patient could continue to use it regardless of whether a 100-hour service was provided nearby. That is certainly my personal practice when using a pharmacy; I use the local community pharmacy in return for services that I value.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/3">There was no evidence of a detrimental impact on access to pharmaceutical services. I remind the hon. Gentleman that we are talking about what is legitimate for businesses in competition. None the less, the service is valuable and it is important to take matters forward. The review of the 100-hour pharmacy contract showed that through their extended opening hours they can and do make an important contribution to expanding access to NHS services. They are certainly popular with patients, as is the community pharmacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/4">The national data produced by the NHS information centre shows that pharmacies exempt from the control of entry requirements provide proportionately more locally commissioned services, such as the minor ailment schemes, nicotine replacement therapy and emergency hormonal contraception, than existing pharmacies. I agree with the hon. Gentleman's focus on those issues with regard to pharmacies that are already flourishing, but such pharmacies should not need to worry.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/5">However, our report also drew attention to some drawbacks. The impact of the reforms was found to be uneven, with pockets of greatest activity in certain parts of the country. The NHS found the new system difficult to administer, and exempt applications sometimes hampered their efforts to plan strategically and to commission more clinical services. As the hon. Gentleman eloquently said, business reaction was mixed, with many being concerned about the operation of the exemptions and the 100-hour provision alongside community pharmacies.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/6">I said earlier and in previous weeks that the application that the hon. Gentleman raises today is to be decided by the PCT's pharmaceutical services committee at its May meeting. If the application were to be approved&mdash;it can be approved only if the PCT thinks that the specified services will be provided&mdash;there will be up to nine months before the pharmacy opens and the monitoring process starts.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.3/7">I assure the hon. Gentleman that we are continuing to keep the provision under scrutiny. It is popular, and it can increase access to services both generally and out of hours. Despite his eloquent arguments, there is insufficient evidence to support the withdrawal or amendment of the exemption. However, I have listened closely to what he had to say. Although I cannot tell him what is in the White Paper&mdash;it will be published tomorrow&mdash;I can say that the strength of feeling that he expressed today will be noted. The White Paper will touch on some of those issues, and the debate about the benefits and the drawbacks will continue, so that we can find a sensible solution. I hope, in time, to deal with the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman in relation to his local pharmacy.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean. I wish to present the case that my constituent Michael Burke and his family have been making since December about problems with his trial and imprisonment in Italy.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/2">Michael Burke, a Manchester United supporter, travelled to Italy to watch his team play Roma in the champions league on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-12">12 December 2007</phrase>. On that day, violent clashes involving fans and the Italian police occurred before the game. Mr. Burke and three other men&mdash;Kyle Dillon, Nicholas Lucas and Richard Wimmer&mdash;were arrested by the Italian police. After an abbreviated trial and court hearing, the four men were convicted of resisting arrest and assault, and all were handed custodial sentences. Michael Burke was sentenced to two years and four months in prison. Appeal on his conviction and those of the other three men will be heard on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/3">My hon. Friend the Minister will recall that I contacted him about the case on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-24">24 December</phrase>. He was helpful in obtaining some comment about the case from consular staff in Rome, but some of the information that he received appears not to match the statements made by my constituent and other men since then. At the time, there was a feeling in the UK that the violence in Rome should be condemned. English fans travelling abroad have earned a poor reputation over the years, and what happened with some Manchester United fans last December seemed to underline that.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/4">It was initially reported in the media that the Italian police officers who arrested the four were helped by spotters from the Greater Manchester police who identified the men as known troublemakers. That was not the case. I have it in writing from the late chief constable of Greater Manchester police, Michael Todd, that no GMP officers were involved in the arrest. The Greater Manchester police also confirmed that they have not provided any evidence to the Italian legal system, and that the Italian authorities never requested any. Michael Burke has said in a statement that he was actually at the receiving end of a violent attack rather than having caused one. It seems clear that Michael Burke and the other fans were in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.1/5">I turn to my concerns about legal representation and the trial of Mr. Burke. The right to a competent interpreter for anyone who does not understand the language of the court is considered a fundamental rule of justice, and one of my chief concerns about the trial is that Mr. Burke was not offered effective or competent interpreting or translation services. That also affected the quality of legal assistance. The court-allocated lawyer did not speak English, and Mr. Burke and the other fans do not speak or understand Italian. Mr. Burke and the other men met the court-appointed lawyer in the holding cell immediately before their first hearing, and no interpreter was present. Mr. Burke has commented that he had no idea what was happening or what he was being charged with.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.2/1">My hon. Friend is making a strong case on behalf of her constituent and of mine, Nicholas Lucas. I apologise that I will not be able to stay for the full debate. Will she raise with the Minister the conditions in which the four men were held in prison, particularly during the first two weeks after the events that she has described? They were denied access to towels, toiletries and a change of clothes, they were confined for 23 hours at a time without breaks and at no time during those two weeks were they given access in English to the information that she mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.0/1">Indeed I will. I thank my hon. Friend for making that point. I shall return to it later, although I know that he will not be able to be here.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/2">Article 6 of the European convention on human rights states:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/4" class="indent">(a) to be informed promptly, in a language which he or she understands and in detail, of the nature and cause of the accusation against him...(c) to defend himself in person or through legal assistance of his own choosing...(e) to have the free assistance of an interpreter if he cannot understand or speak the language used in court.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/5">Language translation and a court interpreter are clearly of the utmost importance to British citizens arrested abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/6">Further difficulties in the case relate to differences in the legal systems. The Italian legal system is inquisitorial and allows for abbreviated trials, which are unfamiliar to those here in the UK. My constituent and the other defendants accepted an abbreviated trial without understanding the consequences. Mr. Burke has written since then that the men were told only that an abbreviated trial represented their best chance of being released and that if they agreed to one, they would be home quickly. Given that it happened only a few days before Christmas, it was understandable that they accepted. Indeed, they do not appear to have been given another option. My constituent has learned since then that agreeing to an abbreviated trial implies a guilty plea, but he has never admitted guilt and says that he would not do so. I feel that he accepted an abbreviated trial only because its implications were not properly explained to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/7">My constituent and the other three men were first given access to an interpreter only when they entered the court for their first hearing. Mr. Burke has written that the interpreter did not communicate any of the exchanges between the judge and the prosecution. In fact, when Mr. Burke asked to be told what was happening, the interpreter told him to be quiet. Mr. Burke has also written that he had no confidence that his statement was represented fairly in court, and that the interpreter spoke in quite broken English that he and the other men found difficult to understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/8">Before the trial, Mr. Burke and his fellow defendants requested a more competent interpreter. Their lawyer apparently agreed to it, yet when they returned to court for the trial hearing, the original interpreter was again present. My constituent says that they again asked the interpreter to explain what was happening in court, and that the interpreter again refused to interpret the proceedings, saying, &quot;I'm not here to tell you about the trial, only to tell you whether you're going to prison or not.&quot; In fact, the next time the interpreter spoke to them was to tell Mr. Burke and Mr. Lucas that they had been sentenced to more than two years in prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/9">The trial process appears to contravene article 6 of the European convention on human rights. How can my constituent have received a fair trial if he did not understand a word of what was being said and if his interpreter refused to interpret the court proceedings for him? Case law of the European convention on human rights makes it clear that the obligation towards the defendant also extends to ensuring that he has translations of all the relevant documents in the proceedings in order for the trial to be fair within the meaning of article 6.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/10">In March 2003, Stephen Jakobi, a lawyer and the founder and former director of Fair Trials Abroad, told the European Scrutiny Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/11" class="indent">&quot;I am hoping that resources will be found in Europe to have an efficient, European level justice system that works. We have not got one in the European Court of Human Rights, I am afraid.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/12">Referring to a landmark judgment in Kamasinski <i>v</i>. Austria 1989, which is seen to have set the standard for court interpretation, Stephen Jakobi said that</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/13" class="indent">&quot;about three countries actually made the effort to get the standard of interpretation and translation right, including, I am glad to say, the United Kingdom. As for the rest, nobody is anywhere near it. It is no good having a court of last resort that supposedly is setting standards for the whole of Europe if nobody listens to it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/14">A duty is placed on the court to provide defendants with effective interpretation and translation, but Fair Trials Abroad feels that that duty is not being taken seriously in much of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/15">Of the first hearing, Michael Burke writes:</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/16" class="indent">&quot;The interpreter asked me to tell the court my account of what happened. I did this. It took me about five minutes or so. The interpreter then translated this in about 30 seconds.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/17">Even allowing for differences in language and speed of delivery, it seems unlikely that the interpreter provided the court with an accurate interpretation of Mr. Burke's words. Summarising Mr. Burke's statement to that extent must have resulted in the court hearing only a truncated version of what he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/18">The European convention on human rights also states that the accused has the right to full knowledge of the charges against him. As I have mentioned, my constituent writes that he did not know the charges against him until after the first court hearing. By that time, Mr. Burke had made a statement to the court about what happened without knowing the charges against which he was defending himself. Also, the four men did not meet their court-appointed lawyer until minutes before the first hearing, and the lawyer was unable to offer them competent legal assistance because of the language barrier. I understand that Mr. Dillon requested that the four men have the use of a private lawyer, but the request was refused, so the men were represented by a lawyer who did not provide them with sufficient information to understand that accepting the abbreviated form of trial meant effectively pleading guilty.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/19">Although the solution to the problems lies in the Italian justice system, I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will take any steps that he can to ensure that my constituent and the other men receive a fair hearing when their appeal comes to court on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>. We need to think about the problems created for the families of Michael Burke and the other fans arrested who will be missing their loved ones and suffering financially: the appeal lawyer is costing the families many thousands of pounds each; each visit to Italy costs many hundreds of pounds in flights and accommodation and the four men are not, of course, working or earning. Together, that causes great distress and worry to the families.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/20">I would like to thank my hon. Friend the Minister for his involvement in the case and for keeping in touch with me over it. To some extent, consular visits have helped to ensure that my constituent's welfare is adequate, although it is worth returning to the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase> about the fact that standards in Italian prisons are nothing like even those that people complain about in this country. Food, exercise and finding things to do are all issues. Straight after the trial and conviction, the four fans were together in one prison, but disturbingly they have now been dispersed across different prisons, some quite a distance from Rome, which again makes travelling for the families very difficult. Given that none of those fans speaks Italian, they are now stuck with nobody to talk to, which is a very difficult situation to be in. Standards in those prisons fall short of what we would expect to find in prisons in the UK. Michael Burke and the other three men are to be in Italian prisons for up to two and half years, because they got caught up in violence not of their own making.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/21">I ask the Minister whether he can take his involvement in the case further and make important interventions before the appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>. Will he write to the Italian authorities urging them to provide my constituent and the other defendants with translations of court documents and an effective court interpreter? They did not have those during their first case, but given everything that I have said today, there is no reason why they should not have them at their appeal hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/22">Mr. Burke's partner has booked flights and accommodation to visit him on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-01">1 May</phrase>&mdash;the day before the appeal hearing&mdash;but the families have just been told that <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-01">1 May</phrase> is a public national holiday in Italy and that, as a consequence, prisons are closed to visitors. It is a pity that they have made all their arrangements already, because clearly it is key for the families to visit before this vital appeal and it is, of course, very difficult to change those arrangements. Will the Minister urge the prison to allow Mr. Burke's partner to visit? I should add that when I ask him to make the case for Mr. Burke, I mean him to include the constituents of other hon. Members, including of my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.0/23">More broadly, will the Minister look into this case as a matter of urgency to see whether anything else can be done to ensure that my constituent and the other three British citizens get a fair hearing, particularly at the appeal? If the appeal fails&mdash;none of us wants to think that way, or hopes that we will need this solution&mdash;can anything be done to allow my constituent and the other fans to be repatriated to the UK so that they can be closer to their families? That would at least release them from some of the financial distress being experienced from travelling to Italy. We understand that that is done from time to time, but that very often there is a delay of something approaching 12 to 18 months. We realise that that could not be considered until after the appeal. However, it could be considered then&mdash;but not if it will take 12 to 18 months and involve all of that financial distress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02a.307.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" speakername="Jim Murphy" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="307"  time="017:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/halltext/80402h0011.htm#08040262000724">
	<p pid="a.307.0/1">I am delighted to have the opportunity to respond to this debate under your chairmanship, Mrs. Dean, and to say that I am pleased that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1943" name="Barbara Keeley">the Member for Worsley (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> was successful in securing this debate on such an important subject. Right from the beginning, she has taken a tenacious and personal interest in this matter. She wrote to the Foreign Secretary the very day that her constituent visited her to explain Mr. Burke's predicament. She has also contacted me personally on numerous occasions, here in the House, and on Christmas eve when I was pleased to have the opportunity to talk to her and to put additional energy into the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/2">My hon. Friend raised a wider point about the right of British, and all citizens, following football teams across the European Union, to do so safely, although that can never be guaranteed, and with the full protection of domestic law, and of European law as a residual protection. As somebody who has travelled as a football supporter&mdash;not a Minister&mdash;of Glasgow Celtic, I know that that is a live conversation among the many thousands of supporters who increasingly travel across the continent to support their football team. That includes the four gentlemen who are the subject of this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/3">I shall respond to some of the points raised by my hon. Friend who secured this debate and by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1637" name="Tom Levitt">the Member for High Peak (Tom Levitt)</phrase>, who made particular reference to Mr. Lucas. She raised a number of important issues and shared with the Chamber some details about the timeline of the case. As Minister, however, it is incumbent on me to put on public record those specifics, particularly in relation to Mr. Burke's case. As she said, Mr. Burke was arrested prior to the Roma versus Manchester United match in Rome on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-12">12 December 2007</phrase> and subsequently charged with assault and resisting arrest, along with three other Manchester United followers. Consular staff present at the match made contact with Mr. Burke to check on his welfare. He asked that we did not notify anyone of his arrest, but subsequently asked that we contact his partner in the UK, Ms Carmon Ducker, which we did on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-14">14 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/4">As my hon. Friend alluded to, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-14">14 December</phrase>, Mr. Burke appeared before the magistrate and at that hearing his court-appointed lawyer, avvocato Lupino, requested that the hearing be adjourned to allow more time to prepare for the case. The magistrate rescheduled the hearing for <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-21">21 December</phrase> and in the meantime remanded Mr. Burke at Regina Coeli prison. During this time, consular staff provided Mr. Burke with our prisoner's information pack, which included details of English-speaking private lawyers in the Rome area, should Mr. Burke not wish to be represented by the court-appointed lawyer.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/5">My hon. Friends both raised wider points about the welfare of all the gentlemen, but particularly about that of Mr. Burke and Mr. Lucas, during that first period. During those first days, the men raised a number of concerns identified by my hon. Friends, such as the lack of toiletries and reading material, the cold and some medical concerns. My understanding is that British authorities provided toiletries and reading materials to all four and a warm jumper to the one who only had a T-shirt. We raised the medical concerns with the Italian prison authorities, as is standard practice in such cases. If hon. Members representing any of the men in question have further welfare concerns, on top of the residual and continuing ones before the appeal, I invite them to bring them to my attention so that I can seek to ensure that they are addressed.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02a.308.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02b.308.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-02a.308.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" speakername="Jim Murphy" colnum="308"  time="017:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080402/halltext/80402h0011.htm#08040262000726">
	<p pid="a.308.1/1">If my hon. Friend wishes, I would be pleased to meet her later this evening, after she has gathered that information, to discuss those specific concerns. Ultimately, the families will be comforted only by the release of their loved ones, but in the meantime it would offer some small reassurance if the men could enjoy at least basic minimum welfare standards before the appeal. Happy is the wrong word, of course, but I am certainly very willing to meet her later this evening to discuss any specifics that the families might have raised with her and other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/2">To continue, on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-20">20 December</phrase> the court-appointed lawyer visited Mr. Burke in prison to discuss his case. With Mr Burke's agreement, the lawyer decided to opt for a short trial. At the hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-21">21 December</phrase>, as my hon. Friend has said, Mr. Burke was sentenced to two years and five months' imprisonment. On instruction from his client, the lawyer immediately appealed the sentence. At a hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-24">24 December</phrase>, the day that my hon. Friend contacted me, judges considering whether Mr. Burke could be released pending the appeal hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase> were unable to reach a decision and remanded him in custody again until <phrase class="date" code="2008-12-27">27 December</phrase>, when they rejected that request. At that time, Mr. Burke decided to appoint a private lawyer, avvocato Cesschini, to represent him.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/3">Since that time, consular staff have worked hard to assist Mr. Burke and his partner, Ms Ducker. We have raised specific concerns with the prison authorities about Mr. Burke's welfare. I understand that the prison authorities originally refused to allow Mr. Burke's partner permission to visit him, because they were not married; the fact that they were not married raises specific complications in terms of visits, under Italian rules and regulations. However, following our representations, the prison authorities granted Ms Ducker that access to visit. Assistance was also provided in respect of other details about the visits to Mr. Burke, including information about transportation from Rome and hotel accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/4">My hon. Friend asked a specific question about visiting rights on bank holidays. Because she raised that point, I will of course undertake to investigate to see if anything can be done. However, in advance of today's debate and in anticipation that my hon. Friend might raise this issue, I specifically asked the relevant officials about the details of prison visits on bank holidays in Italy. I was informed by those officials that a set of rules is in place not in respect of UK nationals but in respect of everyone who is currently imprisoned, awaiting appeal or sentence, in Italian prisons and it is because the prisons have a skeleton staff of prison officers on bank holidays. So I do not wish to give my hon. Friend and her constituents false hope, but I will undertake to see what more can be done, notwithstanding the fact that there will be a skeleton staff in that prison and every other prison in Italy at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/5">Following my hon. Friend's conversation with officials in London on <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-22">22 February</phrase>, when she raised specific concerns that her constituent was forced to sign a document under duress, consular staff in Rome visited Mr. Burke and asked him to provide a written account of events following his arrest. Mr. Burke did not refer to being forced to sign any documents, but, along with the other three gentlemen arrested at the same time, he raised other concerns about their representation at the time of the trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/6">I know that it will be frustrating for those who are following our proceedings closely when I say that it would be wrong for a UK Government Minister to seek, today or at any other time, to interfere in court proceedings in another country, in the same way that it would be entirely inappropriate for a Government Minister of another country to seek to interfere in court proceedings in the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, my hon. Friend asked about the appeal and argued with great care about some of the specific flaws that have been identified by her and relatives of the four men. Many of the points that she has raised today are, of course, the substantive points that form a large body of the argument in respect of the appeal that will take place on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>. So it would be unhelpful for me to seek to intervene in the specific details of the court case. However, we have considered how best to address those concerns with the Italian authorities and, with the agreement of avvocato Cesschini and the men's families, we have decided to wait until after <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>, when, of course, we will know the outcome of the appeal hearing.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/7">My hon. Friend also speculated about what more could be done in the event of the worst outcome on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>. I say to her that, if the worst should occur, there would be a need for us to have a conversation about what more could be done. She has identified a substantial list of concerns that she and the families have and I understand that many of those concerns are shared by Mr. Burke's new private lawyer. Therefore, without wishing to second-guess that appeal process, there is great hope that the outcome on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase> will be much more favourable than the outcome of the proceedings in December.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/8">More generally, my hon. Friend asked about what more could be done now and in the longer term. As she is aware, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's primary role in assisting British nationals detained or arrested overseas is to support them and to consider their welfare. We can take up any justified complaint about an individual not being treated in line with internationally accepted standards or if they have been ill-treated or discriminated against. Of course, as my hon. Friend knows and will fairly acknowledge, as will all those campaigning on behalf of the four gentlemen, we cannot seek preferential treatment on the basis of nationality; I think that that is generally accepted and nobody is arguing that case. That is not the business that we are in; we are in the business of ensuring the guaranteeing of minimum standards of protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/9">I would like to reassure my hon. Friend that we have monitored Mr. Burke's case since his arrest in December and will continue to do so right up until his appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>. Consular staff in Rome and London have provided assistance, and I would like to put on record the Government's appreciation of the work that they have provided in regard to this case. They have provided full consular assistance to Mr. Burke and his family. Staff have visited him on three separate occasions; provided information on Italian prison procedures; assisted in arranging family visits, and taken up welfare concerns, as I have already mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/10">Again, my hon. Friend fairly asked about access to translation services, including immediate verbal translation and the translation of court documents. I must tell her that the practice of the UK Government in all such matters is not to translate documents on behalf of UK citizens. I realise that that may disappoint her, but it is not the practice of the UK Government to fund or organise the translation of court documents, in a court in Rome or in any other city across the world, on behalf of UK citizens. What is offered is access to information about translation services that may be available in the city where the proceedings are taking place. If such a service would be helpful or is required, of course it can be offered, if it has not already been offered.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/11">We will continue to seek ways to provide Mr. Burke and his family with all appropriate consular assistance until such time as he returns to the United Kingdom, which may be as early as May, as we all hope, depending on the outcome of the appeal hearing on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/12">In the same determined way that she has carried out the campaign in Parliament, my hon. Friend entirely reasonably asked what would happen if the appeal on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase> is unsuccessful, including the potential transfer of the four gentlemen back to the United Kingdom to serve any outstanding sentence. Of course, none of us wants that scenario to happen and we are all hoping for the most positive outcome possible. However, if that were to be the case and the appeal were unsuccessful&mdash;again, it would be wrong for me to second-guess the appeal today&mdash;my offer to her is for us to meet again to specifically discuss what the options would then be. By that time, my hon. Friend and other hon. Members would have had the opportunity to reflect with the four gentlemen and their families, support networks and lawyers. As I say, I would certainly be willing to meet my hon. Friend again to discuss what would happen next in the proceedings. However, I think that we all hope that we do not get to that situation and that, without wishing to second-guess the court proceedings, the appeals are successful on <phrase class="date" code="2008-05-02">2 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/13">Finally, I would like to congratulate my hon. Friend once again on the remarkably determined way in which, from the day that this case was brought to her attention, she has campaigned on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/14" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.1/15" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at nineteen minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
