	<p pid="a.335.4/1">It gives me great pleasure to introduce the 27th annual report of the House of Commons Commission for the financial year 2004&ndash;05. I welcome the opportunity to debate it and the work of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.4/2">I pay tribute to my predecessor, Archy Kirkwood, who served on the Commission and was its spokesman from 1997 to 2005. I am delighted that he has been returned to Westminster and to his political work as a Member in the other place. I now have a clearer idea of how much work the role involved for him&mdash;answering oral and written questions, and dealing with various press inquiries, which I recently found myself doing on cleaners, smoking, MPs' expenses and so on. Archy Kirkwood's predecessor was my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1404" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith)</phrase>. It seems to be the lot of the Liberal Democrat Member to serve in this capacity, and I am sure that we are pleased to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.4/3">Some things have changed since the report was published in the summer. We record our thanks to the former Leader of the House, now the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and to the former shadow Leader of the House, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the hon. Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase>. We also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase>, who, after serving on the Commission for some time, was replaced this Tuesday by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1758" name="David Maclean">the right hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean)</phrase>, to whom we are grateful for taking on the work.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.4/4">Since the report was published, there has also been a significant change in the way in which the House operates. The creation of a single domestic Administration Committee brings together the work of five bodies and is chaired by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1955" name="Frank Doran">the hon. Member for Aberdeen, North (Mr. Doran)</phrase>. It got off to a very energetic start, not least in its determination to communicate more effectively with Members. I am sure that many Members will have seen a good number of missives issued by the Administration Committee, seeking their views on various issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.4/5">Members will have had the opportunity to read the report and learn something about the work of the Commission. A considerable part of my job is to listen to what Members have to say, and to respond orally at the end the sitting and in writing to anyone who makes points that need to be investigated further. The Commission is due to meet again in 10 days, when it will be possible to report back to the Commission from today's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.4/6">The Braithwaite report created the structure within which the House and its Officers work. I remind right hon. and hon. Members of some of the history. In May 1990, the Commission invited a team led by Sir Robin Ibbs to review management and decision-making for services in the House. Its report, issued in November 1990, sought a more active and strategic role for the Commission, and replacement of the single Services Committee by four or five committees, which was done but was then reversed by the Commission, as I said. It also sought an enhanced corporate role for the Board of Management and for the Clerk of the House as its Chairman, with improved financial management information, a new Department of Finance and Administration headed by a qualified director and a director of works, and gradual assumption by the House of responsibility for all House of Commons expenditure&mdash;principally, adding works and HMSO, but excluding the Members' estimate. It took some two or three years to implement the changes that were proposed in the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.4/7">Eight years later, in October 1998, the Commission invited a team led by Mr. Michael Braithwaite to undertake a review of the system of management and decision- making for services to the House. That was set up following the work of the Ibbs inquiry. The Braithwaite report was published in June 1999. Broadly, it endorsed, at some length, the Ibbs report and its implementations and called for better corporate information and for the adoption by the Commission of a strategic plan and more performance management. It proposed the creation of an Office of the Clerk&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-03a.338.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" speakername="Nick Harvey" colnum="338"  time="015:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051103/halltext/51103h01.htm#51103h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.338.1/1">I am not familiar with the programmes that the Parliamentary Education Unit has worked up, but I will certainly obtain more detail about it for the hon. Gentleman. What I want to emphasise is that with more resources at their disposal, the unit's staff have the potential and capacity to do a great deal more than they have been able to in the past. I hope the hon. Gentleman will welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.1/2">The House's media effort, referred to at paragraph 122, is growing. The Select Committees have media officers, who are already creating a significant impact in obtaining more coverage of the work of the Committees. Lord Puttnam's report made several additional suggestions&mdash;in particular, for more pro-active briefing of the press on forthcoming and/or recently completed Commons business. It might be interesting to know what hon. Members think of the prospect of House Officials briefing the press on what interesting business is coming up. I do not know whether we shall invite them to brief on what business will not be so interesting, but I wonder whether hon. Members will feel comfortable with the idea of Officers performing that role. Hon. Members should be aware that today the Lords have been debating the Puttnam report.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.1/3"><i>Hansard</i> has for several weeks now been available on line when it is sent to the printers, which means it is available only a matter of hours behind real time, rather than the following day. Good progress is also being made with a new voters' guide, to send to new voters as they become eligible to vote. We hope that that will begin to be sent out in the course of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.1/4">Estate management entails many different issues, which come to the Commission. Those have recently included smoking, and earlier in the year the Commission took a significant further step to make the estate more smoke-free, not least out of awareness of the secondary smoking threat to its employees, the staff who work here. That is referred to at paragraph 210. The Health Bill that has been presented does not directly apply to the estate, but of course we shall rethink what, if anything, we should do to remain broadly in line with what will be the new English statutory regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.1/5">I cannot add anything to what I said in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-18">18 October</phrase> about the dispute of the contract cleaners employed in the House by Mitie. It is a matter of concern to Members, but there is no more money available to put into the contract. We hope that a settlement can be reached soon and that both sides will be able to sit down and negotiate.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.1/6">The question of the number of Members' staff on the estate still causes some concern, in particular because of the view held by some Members who used to have a limited allowance to provide office accommodation for staff in their constituencies that colleagues whose equivalent staff occupy space in the estate are getting some sort of a free ride. The more we can do to make life easier for staff in constituencies, including a swift postal service between the two sites, the better it is for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.1/7">I am often questioned about the environmental impact of the estate by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, who recently produced a 75-page report entitled &quot;How Green is Your Parliament?&quot; The Commission has asked me to reply in writing to the report in due course, but I want to say now that I welcome the work that went into it and am grateful to the Parliamentary Estates Directorate, which laboured to answer a hundred or so parliamentary questions on which, I think, my hon. Friend based some of his recommendations. The report contains some useful ideas, which can be taken further.</p>
	<p pid="a.338.1/8">I am sorry that my hon. Friend's statement about rising energy costs paid no attention to the growing size of the estate. The energy usage per square metre is actually going down, despite the endlessly growing demand for, for example, electrical office equipment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-03a.344.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1575" speakername="Chris Grayling" colnum="344"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051103/halltext/51103h01.htm#51103h01_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.344.1/1">Thank you, Sir Nicholas. We entirely accept the Leader of the House's excuse. We may see him later or we may not, but we are grateful to him for his participation in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/2">I wish to follow on from the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> and the Leader of the House. We all serve on the Commission together. Party politics are set aside and we are part of a team working together in the interests of the House. I therefore do not want to spend a lot of time repeating remarks that they have already made. They articulated very eloquently many of the key features of the report, many of which have been very positive about the work of the House and all those who have worked within it over the past 12 months. However, I am sure that you, Sir Nicholas, will allow me to echo their words of thanks to many of those who have been involved with the Commission, the House and the smooth workings of the environment in which we all work and seek to perform our democratic duties.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/3">I should like to single out a small number of individuals. Lord Kirkwood, served as a distinguished member of the Commission and was the predecessor of the hon. Member for North Devon. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2015" name="Patrick Cormack">the Member for South Staffordshire (Sir Patrick Cormack)</phrase> stood down from the Commission in the past week, to be replaced by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1758" name="David Maclean">the Member for Penrith and The Border (David Maclean)</phrase>. My hon. Friend the Member for South Staffordshire will be much missed on the Commission. He has been a distinguished servant of this House. I know that he is moving to a new role on a different Committee where I am sure he will perform with equal distinction. None the less, the Commission will be a poorer place without him. My predecessor, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1632" name="Oliver Heald">the Member for North-East Hertfordshire (Mr. Heald)</phrase>, not only served on the Commission but also served in the role that I now fill as Chairman of the Administration Estimate Audit Committee. He continues to perform an excellent role within the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/4">That is enough of the politicians. The most important part of this occasion for Members is to pay tribute to those who make it possible for us to work here. A huge number of people work in all different levels and functions. Well over 1,000 people make the House of Commons tick. Together with their counterparts in the House of Lords, they ensure the smooth running of the Palace of Westminster. They work enormously hard. They deliver smooth services to us at all hours of the day and night, because this remains, despite the changes of hours in recent years, a very unpredictable place.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/5">We saw that back in March when we suddenly found ourselves seemingly sitting endlessly through night after night. It was a bit of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu for those who arrived in this place before 2001. For those of us who arrived in 2001, it was a new experience. The point about that is that the staff simply slotted in and did their jobs, without demur and without complaint. That is the level of professionalism that we all experience day in, day out&mdash;whether it is in the Refreshment Department cafeterias, from the doormen who stand outside the Chamber, from the administrative staff who ensure that the services we need behind the scenes take place or the people who work in our postal service.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/6">There is one group I should like to pick out: the security staff who work around the Commons, both those who are dedicated to the Palace and those who come to us from the Metropolitan police. Not only do they do an excellent job; this is a high-risk location. We are in constant danger from those who would seek to do damage to our democratic processes. Every day we walk past those people, standing there on guard. They are willing to put their own lives in danger to protect our democracy. Of all the people who work in the House, we owe them, in particular, a debt of gratitude.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/7">There is another area to which I should like to pay brief tribute. It has been an area of the activity of the House that has made my job much easier, and it has changed the way that hon. Members do their jobs. I refer to the support provided to us by the Parliamentary Communications Directorate. The changes that it has brought about since I became a Member four years ago&mdash;networking; improvements to equipment; the arrival of the virtual private network&mdash;have made it possible for all of us to do our jobs more effectively and efficiently. That has allowed us to spend more time in our constituencies, but still deliver a high-quality service to our constituents away from the parliamentary infrastructure. The work that that team has done, and the strategic vision of the Commission in the last few years, have made a huge difference. There is much still to be done on that front, and there are many more projects in the pipeline, but that work is a significant part of making the House a more effective place.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/8">I warmly welcome moves to integrate the work of the Commons in that respect with that of the House of Lords. That is an area where it makes no sense to have duplication. We wish to have the most up-to-date and efficient systems, but those should be available with consistent quality and with similar support to Members of both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/9">The hon. Member for North Devon referred to the Ibbs report and the Braithwaite report. He knows that there is much outside pressure for us to continue that process and to have a &quot;son of Braithwaite&quot; in the near future. The Commission must consider that in the next few weeks and months. If one examines those two reports and the more recent report from the Puttnam commission, one sees a genuine desire&mdash;as has been the case over a number of years&mdash;to make this place more effective and approachable. I pay particular tribute to Lord Puttnam and the work that he and his team did in producing that report. They have provided a number of ideas and thoughts about how we can tackle the issue of disengagement from the political process of people who often do not understand its relevance to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.344.1/10">There is only a certain amount that we can do directly as a House, rather than as a Government, a political party or a political institution. We should, none the less, seek to do everything that we can to build awareness, understanding and interest in our work. Yesterday provided a good example of how we can do that. Thousands of people gathered for a trade justice lobby, looking for answers. Some of the ideas in the Puttnam report relate to providing better information about what goes on in Parliament. The website is a good example; we can and should ensure that that is the place to go to find out how political issues have been debated. People such as those who gathered yesterday, who have a burning passion on an issue that is of fundamental importance to the country and to our race, have questions and they want to know what is happening in Parliament. They came yesterday in their thousands, got soaked, and spoke to their MPs. Of course, each of us will go back to our constituents and update them on the work that we are doing, but it is our duty to ensure that they have easy access to information about what is going on in Parliament, what questions are being tabled, what debates are happening, and what responses are being given by Ministers so that they can see what is happening much more clearly. Sometimes, people suspect that there are no discussions or debates about those matters. Of course, there are, and the more that we can illustrate those and give people easy access to them, the better.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-03a.353.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" speakername="Martin Linton" colnum="353"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051103/halltext/51103h01.htm#51103h01_spnew15">
	<p pid="a.353.1/1">I accept entirely what the hon. Gentleman says. Parliament is not a corporate entity in the sense that it cannot have its own mission statement and its own unified aims. However, it already has corporate management. Braithwaite I recommended that, and it is what we officially do at present, in the sense that all the Departments should work together through the House of Commons Commission with a single purpose. However, we do not yet have a corporate spirit among the management. Anyone who has served on one of the domestic Committees will know that if one suggests something, the officers&mdash;who are a joy to work with&mdash;will often say, &quot;Well, we will try to persuade the Library of that&quot; or &quot;Yes, I will try to persuade the director of finance&quot;, whereas if they were part of a corporate management they would persuade the chief executive and the chief executive would do it. That is not the way of the House of Commons, but we need it to be more like that.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.1/2">This is an organisation with a huge budget&mdash;&pound;320 million&mdash;and a huge staff. It has 1,500 of its own staff plus a further 2,500 working for MPs, most of whom are in this building. An organisation that size deserves to have a corporate management that is aware of what it is there for, and a communications department that can oversee all the connections between the House and the public in all their various guises.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.1/3">We are in danger of being overtaken&mdash;indeed, we have already been overtaken&mdash;in many areas by our daughter Parliaments in Scotland and Wales. That is because they have had the discipline of knowing that they must justify their existence to the people of Scotland and Wales, and that they therefore have to reach out. They know that they have to do that, and they have outreach, education and press workers. One only has to look at the turnout in elections and the attitude of people to Parliament to see that we, too, should do that. We must focus our minds on justifying our existence, and to do that we must have a completely different attitude to the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.1/4">All of us come here, not to decide how the House of Commons is run, but to play our&mdash;no doubt very small&mdash;part in deciding how the country is run. I do not want any more than anyone else to spend all my time here on the intricacies of House of Commons administration. However, the only way in which we can avoid having to spend so much time on that and on having to come up with all those small suggestions that sometimes get carried out is if we have a corporate management system and an executive system which we can be confident will do the work that needs to be done.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-03a.354.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="354"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051103/halltext/51103h01.htm#51103h01_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.354.1/1">May I first apologise on behalf of the Liberal Democrat shadow Leader of the House, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1824" name="David Heath">the Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr. Heath)</phrase>, who has been speaking in the House but would otherwise have liked to have been present?</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/2">I welcome today's debate and the report, and thank the staff who work for us, year in year out, often at unsocial hours, and who on the whole provide us with a superb service. There are 1,700 employees of the House and, as has been mentioned, plenty of others who work here as contractors or who provide support services. This year it is right to single out the security staff, who have had to deal with some of the more extreme circumstances that we might face. Although the process is sometimes frustrating for Members of Parliament, it is a vital function, in which staff members' alertness and good sense is put to good use.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/3">Perhaps the central issue for us is what the Commission should do next&mdash;or what we should do next with the Commission. The Braithwaite report in 1999 proposed some very important changes. It introduced the idea that we should have in the House one officer who was in charge, for want of a better term. That led to the creation of a Board of Management and a political process, through the Finance and Services Committee, on which I have been privileged to serve since 2001, which could, so to speak, serve as a first filter for ideas and thoughts forwarded to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/4">There have been improvements since then. An organisational improvement of fundamental significance is the fact that there is now a parliamentary security commissioner, with responsibilities at both ends of the building. Although that was controversial, it was a necessary and important step forward. I wonder whether there may be scope for joint appointments of other board members in future. Politically, all the domestic Committees have been brought together in a new Administration Committee. That is also a worthwhile step forward, which will, I hope, lead to improved scrutiny, accountability and delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/5">All of that is all very well, but it is nothing like enough. I am in favour of Braithwaite II, if that is what we are to call it, and I shall probably say things that will be the equivalent of spitting in church. We have been a little self-laudatory in the debate so far. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">The hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> stuck a few pins in, but I am not sure that we have appreciated the gap between the story told in the report and the reality. A couple of examples may show that all is not well with our management, control and political decision-taking in the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/6">The first thing to which I want to draw attention is the new security screen in the House of Commons. I remind hon. Members that a decision was taken that a temporary screen was necessary. There was some dispute about it, but we had strong advice that a security screen was needed. A temporary screen was erected, to give time for proper consideration of a permanent screen and how to install it. A permanent screen was designed and displayed to hon. Members. There was a good deal of consultation and a vote in the House on the erection of the screen. As it happened, I voted against it, but there was a clear majority for installing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/7">The astonishing thing was that when we returned after the recess we discovered that the screen that was installed was not the design that we had approved. No one seems to care. We now have a screen that is not where it was intended to be. We must be the only Parliament in western Europe that, when it takes action to improve public accessibility, produces an outcome that excludes them from seeing half the parliamentary Chamber. We have a &pound;1.5 million blunder. We have put up a screen that we might as well have whitewashed, for all the use it is for seeing hon. Members in one half of the Chamber. The hon. Member for Battersea said that we have not yet implemented a viewing gallery. Too right! We have implemented a screen that is literally that&mdash;it screens the House from members of the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/8">My second illustration relates to the catering operation and, in particular, to the Members' Dining Room. First, I very much welcome the setting up of the Administration Committee. Perhaps this new combined services Committee will mean that we can break away from the club culture that determines how we take decisions in the House. Those who served on the domestic Committees were, in effect, a trade union group of users, and it is right that we should put things on a more businesslike base.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/9">Secondly, I welcome the cap on the catering subsidy, to which the report refers. I give credit to Sue Harrison and her team for delivering the savings that she was asked to achieve. I also note that the Administration Committee has decided to appoint an external adviser to deal with catering, which is another good step. The fact remains, however, that the catering subsidy for the parliamentary estate is running at &pound;6 million a year. That is without adding the cost of power, light, and heating for the whole catering operation.</p>

	<p pid="a.362.1/1">I prefer the personal touch with the Table Office. I am happy to discuss my carbon footprint with the hon. Gentleman at a later date.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/2">I thank the Library staff, who do a fantastic job. I suggest that, if any Department of the House is understaffed, it is the House of Commons Library. I am grateful for its help, and for the good work done by the Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/3">I welcome the exhibition on the gunpowder plot. It is of particular importance to my constituency of Lewes, which celebrates bonfire night in style. I am happy to say that one member of the bonfire society from Lewes has visited the exhibition and sang bonfire prayers in Westminster Hall&mdash;with the consent of the Serjeant-at-Arms, I might add.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/4">I endorse the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> on the need for Braithwaite II, and what he said about the House sometimes being run in a less than efficient manner. I shall not repeat those comments, but they are entirely valid and I endorse them without reservation.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> suggested that I might give my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> a easy time because he is not a Minister and is a member of my party. I shall be doing no such thing: I shall be pursuing these matters with vigour. I welcome my hon. Friend's comments on my environment report, and I intend to hold him to them. Before turning to the environment report, I want to make an observation about the money that is sometimes spent on the House of Commons and the parliamentary estate in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/6">We do not always get good value for money from the work that is done here, irrespective of whether it is needed. For example, the covered walkway being constructed next to the Post Office turntable&mdash;several poles are now coming out from the walls&mdash;is to cost &pound;422,000. If the figure is true, it is astonishing. It has not been rebutted by the House authorities, so I assume that it is right. If so, it is about &pound;400,000 in excess of what it should cost. I recommend that the House authorities buy something from B &amp; Q for about &pound;2,000 and upgrade it slightly. It would probably perform the necessary function, if it needs to be performed&mdash;although why we need a covered walkway at that location is beyond me. There is an alternative route if Members are frightened of getting wet. I sometimes think that we are looking for excuses to spend money; it is disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/7">I refer my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon to an answer given in the previous Parliament about the cost of refurbishing the lifts in Norman Shaw North, which I use to go to my office&mdash;not the cost of maintaining them to ensure that they work, which is perfectly fair, but of the oak panelling inside them. An extraordinary amount of money is spent in a way that would not be spent if it were our own money or if we were personally accountable for it. Nor would the public spend money on such things. We have to be careful that we do not regard spending as having as a blank cheque. More needs to be done about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/8">I want to spend the rest of my contribution to the debate on the environmental performance of the House of Commons. I would have preferred to have focused on the performance of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, but each House is still dealt with separately. Although some progress has been made to bring matters concerning the two Houses together, it has not happened in respect of environmental matters. It would be nice&mdash;if perhaps revolutionary&mdash;if we could ask a parliamentary question about the environmental impact of both Houses and for it to be answered in the House of Commons. That might be one step too far for some people, but it would be useful. It seems absurd that we at this end have to ask about waste collection in the Commons and they at the other end have to ask about waste collection in the Lords. However, that is how things are at present. There is a need for more co-ordination with the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/9">I hope that environmental performance will be of interest to hon. Members who are present. In fact, three hon. Members here have an extremely good track record on the environment: two of the Labour Members present and my hon. Friend the Member for Hazel Grove. I hope that the House of Commons Commission will take the issue seriously. Its report runs to 88 pages and has but half a page on the environment, at page 59. Even that half a page exudes complacency about the House's performance. For a start, it refers only to two issues: energy and waste. They are important and I shall return to them, but they are by no means the only issues that are linked to the environmental performance of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/10">Even the paragraphs on the environment are misleading in their complacency. For example, under the heading &quot;Waste recycling&quot;, paragraph 234 states:</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/11" class="indent">&quot;In 2004/05 the proportion of waste recycled increased by two per cent to 29 per cent,&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/12">an admirable increase, we might think. However, if we examine the figures on page 74, we see that in the year previous to that the figure was 39 per cent. Therefore, a fair way to describe what has happened is to say that the amount of recycled waste has decreased by 10 per cent. over the past two years. A spin has been put on the figure to suggest that things are improving when, by and large, they are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/13">If we are to make progress, we must recognise first that there is a problem and not be in denial about such matters. We have a significant carbon footprint in the House. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon said, given the number of people who work here, we are equivalent to a small town. We must send out a message to the public that we are taking the environment seriously; that we are putting our own house&mdash;this House and our own house&mdash;in order and showing how others can respond similarly. The general public take it ill when they hear us in the House telling them that they should save energy, save water and use sustainable transport, if we do not seem to be doing so ourselves. We have an important example to set to others, and we are not setting it at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/14">It was absolutely fair of my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon to say that I should be considering energy use per square metre. It is also fair to say that my report, of which he now has a copy, states that only in the last year has energy consumption per square metre declined below the 1997 level. Until 2004, it was well above that level and there has been a fall-back this year, which I very much welcome. However, no real progress has been made over the period. I am afraid to say that examples of energy waste abound, so rather than the Commission saying complacently, &quot;We have a decrease this year, so let us settle for that&quot;, it should be considering what it should be doing to save energy elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.1/15">The number of rooms, toilets, kitchens and corridors in which lights are left on all day and night is enormous. If hon. Members do not believe me, I suggest that they take a photograph of Portcullis House at two o'clock in the morning. I have not done so, but I have taken a photograph at 11 o'clock at night and the place is lit up like Crystal Palace. Televisions on stand-by amount to significant carbon usage. Televisions are on all over the place even when the House is not sitting. They switch on automatically in the morning, whether or not someone is in the office, and they stay on after people have left the offices.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-03a.364.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="364"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051103/halltext/51103h01.htm#51103h01_spnew36">
	<p pid="a.364.3/1">Exactly. Energy efficiency works in reverse in the House: the policy appears to be to waste it rather than save it. For example, the lifts in Norman Shaw insist on returning to the ground, irrespective of whether anyone is in them. Why it is thought to be useful for them to move nobody is in them is somewhat beyond me. When I queried it with the Serjeant at Arms, I was told that they had to return to the ground for fire reasons. I am not sure that I understand that; other lifts in the Palace do not return to the ground, so I am not clear why those in Norman Shaw should have special treatment. It seems sometimes that reasons are brought forth to push away an inquiry rather than address it properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.3/2">Returning to the point about energy per sq m, the figure was 328 kilowatts per sq m in 1997&ndash;98 and by 2003&ndash;04 it had gone up to 357, an increase of about 10 per cent. It is true that last year it dropped to just below 328, but that means that there have been no energy efficient savings of any sort over the entire time I have been in Parliament. That is pretty indefensible.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.3/3">It is also the case that the energy saving budget, according to figures from the House of Commons Commission, has been cut by 40 per cent. since 1997 from &pound;50,000 in 1997&ndash;98 to &pound;30,000 in 2004&ndash;05. What possible explanation or justification can there be for spending &pound;422,000 on a walkway that nobody wants, and spending less than in 1997&mdash;only &pound;30,000&mdash;on the energy saving budget? Furthermore, that budget has to compete with other measures such as water conservation, so it is not even entirely an energy saving budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.3/4">There is clear evidence of waste all around. Another example are motion-sensitive escalators. When they were introduced, I said, &quot;Hooray!&quot; for the one in Portcullis House, which was motion-sensitive, so did not run when nobody was using it. I though that that was an innovation that we could bring in elsewhere. What happened? The motion sensitivity has been turned off so that the escalator runs all the time, whether or not someone is on it. When I asked why, I was told that a Member or a member of staff had caught her high heel in it and it was thought unsafe, and hon. Members could not cope with the idea of a motion-activated escalator. We can do better than that. An escalator should not be running when it is not required if there is a facility to allow it not to.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.3/5">On water, the figure is the same. I appreciate that there has been an increase in the number of people in the House&mdash;that is a relevant factor&mdash;but the amount of water used on the parliamentary estate has increased by more than 50 per cent. since 1997. There is no separate budget for water conservation measures, which compete with energy saving investments for the annual conservation budget. As far as I can tell, there is no real commitment to do anything about that in future. I hope that that will change as a consequence of this debate and other representations from other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.3/6">There is also the question of waste generation and disposal. We have at last, unlike when I started in this place, two bins in our offices&mdash;both the same colour, incidentally, just to make things complicated. One has a label saying &quot;For recycling&quot;, and one does not. Many of us naively thought that that meant material put into the bin marked &quot;Recycling&quot; was actually recycled. However, evidence that I have accrued and which has not been denied&mdash;I brought it to the attention of the predecessor of the hon. Member for North Devon, who accepted that it was happening&mdash;is that, in a curious arrangement, the office waste is separated and, at least some of the time, the cleaners take it outside and put it all in the same bag, in which it is taken for incineration. That might make us feel better, but it does not help recycling.</p>

	<p pid="a.366.3/1">No, Sir Nicholas. I shall not go further down that route, although I am tempted.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/2">Even the existing system for dealing with waste does not work and is not adhered to, which is a scandal. There is a dearth of recycling points around the place. There is no co-ordination between the Lords and Commons. Where, for example, can someone recycle material in Portcullis House? It is a brand-new building, and is supposed to be state of the art. Where are the recycling points there? I cannot find them.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/3">I have dutifully collected laser printer cartridges and tried to recycle them. There is, apparently, a facility that one can ring up to have the cartridges collected. My office rang every month for six months to get the laser printer cartridges collected, without success. Finally we found an external contractor to take them away and deal with them properly. The performance on the environment is pitiful and we need to get a grip on it. I hope that we shall.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/4">There are other problems. There is no plastic recycling to speak of in the House. No attempts are being made, as far as I can tell, at waste minimisation, which is, after all, at the top of the waste hierarchy. We heard, properly, from the hon. Member for Southampton, Test about the number of Order Papers or early-day motion booklets that are produced. He is right. People pick them up to see what question 4 is; they go into the Chamber and see it. That is their use for the order paper. There must be a better way of going about it. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">The hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase>, when he was here, referred to the possibility of information being available in the Chamber. We should think about that, as the present use of Order Papers is wasteful.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/5">Transport is not irrelevant to what we do in the House. I shall perhaps part company with some of my colleagues here. I think it is wrong that Members of Parliament should have free car parking. The Government rightly advocate workplace charging, and we encourage local authorities to go along that road. However, there is a deathly silence about the possibility of workplace charging in this place. Yet in the Abingdon street public car park across the road one will pay about &pound;20 to park for half a day. We should have workplace charging and encourage MPs and staff to come to work by public transport, which serves Westminster very well, both by tube and bus. There are plenty of alternatives. There is no reason for people to come to Westminster by car, as, sadly, they still do in large numbers. We need to tackle that.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/6">We need to deal with the lack of a travel plan for the House of Commons. When I raised that, I was told that hon. Members make their own arrangements. They may do, and I hope that they can be encouraged to make more sustainable arrangements, but what about all the people who work here, who, after all, outnumber hon. Members? We should be making it easier for them to come by public transport as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/7">It is not good enough to push the problem onto someone else and say, &quot;It's not our business, guv; someone else can deal with it.&quot; I have been encouraged to see the number of people coming to the House by bicycle these days. The bicycle racks seem to be chock-a-block. In fact, we seem to need more. I do not know when they will be coming. Some investment in them, instead of spending of &pound;422,000 on a walkway, might be a good idea.</p>

	<p pid="a.367.2/1">Thank you, Sir Nicholas. I shall confine my remarks to how people arrive at the House of Commons. I think that that was the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> was making. It is true to say that hon. Members should examine the carbon footprint of the means of travel that they choose.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.2/2">I shall not go on too long, because others want to speak, and I have made my point, but I shall make one last point about procurement&mdash;we have a role in that&mdash;and water. Over the years, there has been a tendency to use bottled water more and more. Indeed, we are all benefiting from that here in the Chamber this afternoon. It is 461 times more expensive to use bottled water than tap water, which costs about 1p per 10 litres, compared to &pound;25 for the same amount of bottled water. There is nothing wrong with tap water&mdash;even from Thames Water. Indeed, my analysis suggests that there are higher legislative standards for the quality of tap water than for bottled, so why do we continually traipse huge numbers of bottles at cost to the environment&mdash;through transport&mdash;so that Members can have bottles of water in front of them when tap water would be perfectly adequate? We should examine all aspects of our behaviour, but we have not done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.2/3">I welcome my hon. Friend the Member for North Devon to his post. I was asked whether I would treat him as a Minister, and I may say I regard him absolutely as a Minister; he is very ministerial in his approach. I shall accord him that accolade, and treat him as such when asking my questions. I hope that the Commission will reflect on the debate, especially on the important points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> about the Braithwaite review, the well made comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">the Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase>, and on the environmental angle. There needs to be a gear change and a change of behaviour from the Commission on the way in which this place is run.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-03a.368.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="368"  time="017:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051103/halltext/51103h01.htm#51103h01_spnew44">
	<p pid="a.368.0/1">I am delighted that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase> did not give his party colleague a soft time in his comments, but I must say that it was a pretty bad advert for six years of Liberal Democrat rule. The Lib Dems have had an iron grip on the Commission for the past few years, but, hopefully, things will change.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/2">I am glad that the debate seems to have become an annual debate, but I hope that it does not become a traditional one, in which the same speakers put forward the same points each year and not much happens in between.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/3">Today, I shall concentrate on some areas in which we have not made as much progress as we should have since the last report. I shall inevitably not deal with the areas in which progress has been made, but I recognise that there has been progress. Obviously, the current security pressures mean that there are many pressures on staff and Members. In picking up on failings, I do not wish to minimise what has been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/4">I am mainly interested in the issue of engaging with the public, and the &quot;Connecting Parliament with the Public&quot; report. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> made an excellent and eloquent speech, making a lot of good points, many of which I endorse; indeed, I would make them myself. Some people would probably consider them to be as revolutionary in their way as Guy Fawkes's attempt to change this place, and would probably want my hon. Friend to receive the same penalty, too. However, I want to put on record my support for practically everything he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/5">I want to concentrate on issues of particular relevance to those of us who represent constituencies further afield than London and the south-east. That is why I am particularly interested in outreach and how we put into practice the commitment that has been made to develop our outreach work in the education unit and in other ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/6">Outreach work is not only an issue for those of us who represent constituencies that are further afield. If we were successful, we would have problems in finding room for the number of people&mdash;children or young people, for instance&mdash;who want to come to see how Parliament works. Therefore, outreach is in many ways as relevant for schools and communities just down the road from Westminster as it is for those of us whose schools and constituencies are further away, although there are clearly different issues for those of us from further afield.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/7">The Modernisation Committee, whose work is considered by the House of Commons Commission, produced a report almost two years ago that suggested a number of steps be taken to develop the House's outreach work. One recommendation was for the appointment of staff in the education unit, and I welcome that, but there were others. For example, it was suggested that we might want to set up a parliamentary roadshow that could go around the country and give an opportunity for a bit of Parliament to be seen in parts of the country where the public, including children and young people, cannot easily visit Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/8">However, in the Committee's report, the suggestion that there should be a parliamentary roadshow was qualified with the following comment:</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/9" class="indent">&quot;We recommend that before any further consideration is given to establishing an educational roadshow, the House should examine the scope for a Parliamentary partnering scheme with, for example, local authorities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/10">That is a good idea in itself, and Members may be aware that the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and, to an extent, even the European Commission, have partner libraries and outlets where the public can find information about the work of such institutions. However, it is my understanding that we have not even begun to think of how we might do something like that. If we have not even begun to develop a partnering scheme, we appear to be even further from developing a parliamentary roadshow, which was only to happen if we tried a partnering scheme first.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/11">I am disappointed that we have not gone further down that road. There are, of course, resource implications, but leaving aside the fact that it is important to spend money on ensuring that we connect with the public, it is possible to do some of this type of work in a cheap and cost-effective way, and then to build on that in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/12">For example, the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly have their own information centres that provide information about not only their buildings, which are quite expensive in the case of the Scottish Parliament, but about the political process. At present, precious little in those institutions relates those bodies to the UK parliamentary process, just as it precious little here relays what we do in the devolved process. A possibility surely exists for us to have an arrangement whereby those centres and similar facilities provide some information about the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and we provide similar information about their institutions. I do not know whether they would welcome such an approach, but we could think about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/13">The question of what we do with the outreach staff we appoint is also important. There would clearly not be much point in members of staff trying to visit every single school in the country, but I hope that we will ensure we are as active in reaching schools and other educational and community organisations that are a long way from Westminster as we are in reaching those that are nearer. That is why I will be interested to read what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1539" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Nick Harvey)</phrase> writes to me about what we are doing in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/14">We could do much better in other areas of contact with the public. I had some difficulty last year in getting materials and information from the education unit in some of the main ethnic minority languages. That has improved recently, but the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly of Wales have a range of information in various ethnic minority languages, and we do not seem to have that here, and certainly not in as easily accessible form as in those other institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/15">Outreach workers are important to get to those parts of the country where it is not easy for people to visit Parliament. It is quite easy to get to London from many parts of the United Kingdom, and not particularly expensive, but we should try to facilitate visits to the House of Commons. Despite the advantages of virtual contact with the House of Commons, people can find out some things only by experiencing this place and making the most of a visit. We should try to make it more possible for school groups and other community groups to visit.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/16">The National Assembly of Wales has a travel subsidy scheme, which pays a small amount to subsidise travel for people visiting the Assembly from north or central Wales. Perhaps we should have such a scheme here. If we are not willing to expend our own resources, perhaps we could find a travel company prepared to sponsor a scheme to encourage direct, physical access to the House of Commons by groups of people who may not otherwise be able to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/17">It is important to ensure that we stay connected to the public and that we engage them in our work. Hon. Members do that in various ways, but it should not be down just to the initiative of individual Members: it should be integral to the work of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/18">There is a difference in the information and education work relating to the 20 per cent. of the United Kingdom that has some form of devolution. The material provided for education outlets in those areas should reflect the fact that they have a devolved system. I think that some mention of that is made in the material produced by educational and information sources in the House, but there is not much that tries to bring the two systems together and explain the different forms of parliamentary democracy under devolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/19">That is especially important for the new voters guide. If the guide that goes to new voters in my constituency describes itself as a guide to Parliament and refers only to the House of Commons and the House of Lords and there is no mention of the work of the Scottish Parliament and the day-to-day discussions in Scotland, it will cause some confusion. Separate material may have to be produced for the voters guides that go out to people in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. A better solution, however, might be to ensure that the guide sent to everyone in the United Kingdom properly reflects the devolved arrangements, so that people outside Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland understand more about the new political settlement. The Commission must take that issue on board, and I hope that it will do so in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/20">I agree with much of what the hon. Member for Lewes said about the environmental impact of our work in the House of Commons, and about how little we are doing to minimise the damage to the environment that Parliament, like any large institution, inevitably does unless it makes real efforts to minimise environmental damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/21">The hon. Gentleman said much with which I agree. I shall not repeat his points but wish to say something about encouraging the most sustainable form of travel for people who work in this place, in whatever capacity. It is always dangerous to refer to personal experience, but sometimes our experiences can highlight defects in the arrangements. I noticed something in the report that highlighted how it sometimes tends to spend a great deal of time emphasising what are quite minimal achievements. Cycling has become more and more popular as a form of transport in London. The section on cycling states:</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/22" class="indent">&quot;The needs of cyclists continue to have priority and a redesign of cycle racks is planned, to maximise parking spaces.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/23">I hope that means cycle parking spaces. In any event, as someone who cycles regularly to the House of Commons, I have not noticed much sign that the interests of cyclists are a priority in this place. Indeed, the recent redesign of part of the surroundings to facilitate understandable security concerns could have been used as an opportunity to facilitate cycle access to the building. Instead, in many ways it is now much harder to get to the building on a bike than it was previously. I can tell those Members who do not cycle that one of the most dangerous parts of my journey is trying to get to the House of Commons from some of the roads in the area. I do not want to dwell on that personal experience, except to use it to illustrate the fact that we do not carry out in practice some of the commitments that we make in theory.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/24">Finally, I want to say something about the cleaning staff in the House of Commons and the dispute that has been going on for some time. As I mentioned, the Commission has been in the grip of the Liberal Democrats for several years. I can envisage the leaflets slamming the Lib-Dem poverty pay scandal that would be printed if we were to follow the suggestion made by the Puttnam commission to elect the House of Commons Commission by secret ballot.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/25">Leaving that aside, we are in a dispute with some of the most low-paid people in the House of Commons. The fact that we are unable to come to an agreement on what seems to be a reasonable pay claim is a scandal and reflects badly on the entire House. I happen to be a member of the same trade union as the cleaners, the Transport and General Workers Union. That does not mean that I have an interest in the formal sense, but, like all those in the House who are concerned about employees, I am concerned that we cannot get a satisfactory resolution to the dispute.</p>

	<p pid="a.373.1/1">I hope my hon. Friend will forgive me if I move on quickly. I want to cover points made by hon. Members who spoke in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1828" name="Alan Whitehead">the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr. Whitehead)</phrase> tested us among other things on our knowledge of early-day motions. I know we will want to consider what is done. I think that if it was the view of Members that this should be a proper subject for deliberations the Procedure Committee would consider it. The Administration Committee itself will want to consider some of the other points made.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/3">I take to heart the recycling points made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1979" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz)</phrase> and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1680" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, who made a particularly thoughtful contribution. The Commission will have noted his comments and will want to respond. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1625" name="Andrew Stunell">The hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Andrew Stunell)</phrase> raised the issue of the catering subsidy. I speak with some experience on this. When I was first elected as a councillor in Edinburgh, there was a free waiter/waitress service for councillors. I boycotted it. Over time, with the help of colleagues, that got abolished. There is no such free service here, but it is open to those Members who feel that there should not be a subsidy to bring their own sandwiches and not benefit from that subsidy. Indeed, in the month leading up to Remembrance Sunday, they might perhaps put in the poppy boxes an additional contribution reflecting their view of the amount by which their meal, tea or coffee is subsidised.</p>
	<p pid="a.373.1/4">However, I caution Members against raising these issues in an inflammatory way, although I am not saying that the hon. Member for Hazel Grove did so. It brings us all into disrepute if the subject is not handled with the sensitivity and complexity that it merits. There are 641 Members presently in the House, and 3,000 staff members and others who benefit from the catering facilities. They need to deal with unsocial hours and a lack of alternatives, as security dictates how people can come in and out.</p>

	<p pid="a.373.3/1">I know that this has been a matter for consideration in the past, and it is right that it should be given proper attention. I have informed the hon. Gentleman about it, because I realise that the wheels of change in this place tend to turn slowly, and we tend to deliberate for long periods. I have given a way for hon. Members who do not want to wait for change to set a lead, given that they think that the subsidy is wrong. I do not find it as invidious as was so starkly made out to be, because many staff benefit from it, and I think that that is right. However, his points have been noted by the Commission, and this is, of course, a matter for that body. Like other hon. Members, I look forward to hearing the contribution of the spokesperson for the Commission, the hon. Member for North Devon.</p>
