	<p>I am grateful to have secured this debate. I see that a number of hon. Members who represent various constituencies along the east coast are present; doubtless they wish to speak about their particular interest in the subject. I shall try to be reasonably succinct, so that they have a chance to take part.</p>
	<p>I start by declaring my interest in the subject, not in a formal or financial sense, but as a regular user of the rail services on the east coast main line. I share that interest with many of my constituents, who use the line south to London and north to Aberdeen, Inverness and Glasgow. Like many of those constituents who have recently contacted me by email or letter, I am generally impressed by the quality of service offered by GNER, the current franchise operator. That fact certainly forms part of the background to a debate about the future of the franchise for the east coast main line.</p>
	<p>Obviously, as with any operator, things can go wrong from time to time, and my experience of the line has not always been of the highest, but I have generally experienced a good service under the present operator. My starting point is therefore to say that I hope that the Strategic Rail Authority and the Department for Transport, in their respective roles in awarding a new franchise, will allow GNER to continue to operate it. I know that that view is shared by the nearly 50 hon. Members who signed the early-day motion on the subject tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley). It is pretty unusual for MPs to support the continuation of a franchise in such a way. We normally see people demanding that franchises are removed. That is a reflection of the quality of the service provided by GNER.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend makes a valid point about the SRA's involvement in awarding the franchise for the east coast main line. Does he accept that, with the SRA's involvement in reducing the strategic value of the line from Edinburgh to Aberdeen, the franchise should be framed so as to ensure that the good service that we seek serves all the communities on the east coast, from Aberdeen, through Dundee, to Edinburgh and the south?</p>

	<p>I know that my hon. Friend has been a consistent champion of the rail service north of Edinburgh to Dundee, including the long-distance mainline services. He makes a valid point, and I agree with him.</p>
	<p>There has been speculation in the press that, in the process leading to the awarding of a new franchise, the Treasury is trying to extract the maximum return to the    taxpayer from whatever arrangements are eventually made. It is clearly the Treasury's job to extract the maximum return for the taxpayer; and one would expect such thinking to be going on in government, but I hope that today's debate will make it clear that it would be unacceptable for the Treasury's interests to override the importance of maintaining a high-quality service on the line. The message that must come out of the debate is that we do not want the quality of the service offered to the customer to be reduced; it would certainly be a seriously retrograde step if the current GNER service were replaced by a poorer service offered by another operator or, indeed, if the existing operator were forced to run a poorer service as a result of the eventual franchise arrangements.</p>

	<p>My hon. Friend makes a valid point about the integrity of the service. I know that he reads <i>The Scotsman</i> intently because it is produced in his home town, and he will have been upset by a report on 8 October&mdash;my birthday&mdash;that some of the proposed options include the possibility of longer journey times, unregulated non-core fares and replacement bus services. Many people along the line in the north-east of Scotland will see that as a clear threat to their direct services to London. Does my hon. Friend accept that such things should play no part in the final decision on who gets the franchise?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.350.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="350"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew4">
	<p>I certainly accept my hon. Friend's point; indeed, I hope to deal in a second with some of the specific service issues to which he referred.</p>
	<p>There is also concern about the possible effect of a change in operator on the passengers who use the existing services. Where there has been a change of operator elsewhere, there have sometimes been difficulties in the changeover period, and there is a worry that the service could be disrupted in the transition to a new operator. That in itself would drive passengers away, and they might not return in the long term, whatever services then prevailed.</p>
	<p>There is also concern about the position of the staff who currently work for GNER; the issue has a particular constituency interest for me and for other hon. Members with constituencies along the east coast line. Almost 400 staff, many of whom live in my constituency, are employed in various operations in the Edinburgh area, and they are concerned about what a change of operator will mean for the future of their jobs.</p>
	<p>I accept that it is in the nature of a franchising process that the Government have to consider all the proposals made by the various bidders. If another operator suggested a wonderful alternative, it would certainly not be right to rule it out, and any such proposal will no doubt be given proper consideration. However, given what we know of the various options unveiled so far, there is no reason to change the operator on the east coast main line.</p>
	<p>The right way forward is to build on the strengths of the existing operator, enhance the services offered to the passengers who use the route at the moment and attract more customers from the airlines and the roads. If we are to ensure effective competition, particularly with air travel, there must be a high-quality service, which is another reason why any moves that would result in a poorer service should be resisted.</p>
	<p>I want briefly to highlight the improvements that I would like to see on the agenda, particularly to meet my constituents' interests. First, we need to consider the timings for the duration of journeys from Edinburgh to destinations further south. It is technically possible for trains to make the journey to London in four hours, but those of us who have used the service in recent decades notice that journey times have not been reduced; in fact, with one early morning exception, they have actually increased in recent years. That trend must be reversed if we are to provide an attractive alternative, particularly to air services.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.351.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="351"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew5">
	<p>I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would want his constituents to be able to reach Aberdeen as well. However, in terms of journey times, Edinburgh is almost halfway between London and Aberdeen, so it is important that the operator of the east coast franchise recognises that the line goes all the way to Aberdeen, especially when it tries to improve journey times.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.351.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="351"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew6">
	<p>Indeed. The franchising process must see how maximum advantage can be gained from the franchise operator working with the Scottish Executive in the exercise of their responsibility for rail infrastructure north of Edinburgh, following additional powers being given to them recently by the Secretary of State for Transport. Journey times, particularly for trains going south from Edinburgh, certainly need to be shorter, but I fully accept the point about services northwards and westwards.</p>
	<p>Secondly, there needs to be greater integration between the mainline services and local rail and bus services. Integration is not as good as it could be, and work needs to be done to make the most of proper integrated transport services so that passengers can transfer from mainline express services to local services and make bus connections.</p>
	<p>There also needs to be more imaginative use of the timetable to provide links and direct services, not only along the main line from Aberdeen and Edinburgh southwards to London, but to other cities that can be served by the line. Services to Leeds could certainly be improved, and connections to cities such as Nottingham and Sheffield could be better integrated with the mainline services.</p>
	<p>Several constituents raised the issue of smoking carriages on the east coast service, which they do not believe to be conducive to their health. As has been pointed out, presumably the possibility of separate legislation in Scotland on smoking in public places will have to be considered, or there will be difficulties when the trains reach a spot 400 yds north of Berwick.</p>
	<p>It is essential that the franchise is for a long period, whichever company wins it. We cannot have the sort of two-year extension of the franchise that we had in the previous round, which would clearly create uncertainty for any operator. I understand that a franchise of up to 10 years is suggested. That is the sort of period that should be covered in the current round.</p>
	<p>Certain associated improvements to the infrastructure could be linked to any bid. During the previous franchise round, some major upgrades to the network were suggested as part of the bid. Obviously, upgrades to the network or anything else that is done in the right place in the right way would be very attractive to us all, but I would be concerned if part of the price of the final successful bid was to link the franchise to excessively complicated changes to the infrastructure. We have learnt from the experience of the west coast main line, and we should be wary of major improvements to the infrastructure on lines on which services are operating.</p>
	<p>It would be far better to return to the agenda the possibility of a north-south high-speed line. That is the way forward for the UK as a whole, and we need to pursue it. We need a 20-year vision for direct high-speed links from London to the north of England and to Scotland&mdash;the vision, and the links, that exist elsewhere in Europe. Such a network might make possible a three-hour journey from London to Edinburgh, and needs to be constructed in a way that does not cause disruption to existing services for an extensive period.</p>
	<p>I am pleased that the Secretary of State for Transport indicated in a speech last week at a conference that the issue of a north-south high-speed line is back on the agenda. I hope that he will take that idea forward, as such development is needed if there are to be real alternatives to air travel to Edinburgh and Glasgow, not to mention between Aberdeen, Dundee and London.</p>
	<p>If the Treasury is to harvest more return from the new franchise, whichever operator it is granted to, what better way to recycle that extra income in its coffers than to use it to develop the first phases of a north-south high-speed line of the type that I have described?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.352.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="352"  time="09:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew7">
	<p>I welcome the debate on this subject, because, as our interventions may have shown, it gives us the chance to get assurances from the Minister that the Government see the east coast main line as one that connects Aberdeen to London, not just Edinburgh to London. There is a long history of concern that the Aberdeen to Edinburgh line is beginning to be seen as a branch line. At times, companies have not helped, especially with their advertising: they have failed to produce correct maps of the services that they provide to the whole of Scotland, and failed to recognise that Inverness services also go to Glasgow. The east coast main line should be seen as one that runs throughout the United Kingdom, not just one that connects Scotland to the rest of the UK.</p>
	<p>I echo the comments of the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) about the quality of service to date. Obviously, a franchising process is about competitive bidding and recognising who has made the best bid, but I am pleased that a franchisee's record can now be taken into account. Unusually, there has been a write-in campaign in support of GNER by users of the service&mdash;I am sure that other Members will have received letters. When users of the service recognise its quality, that should be taken on board. If someone else says that they can provide a better service, that must be recognised as being important for our constituents, but they must also be seen to deliver.</p>
	<p>The east coast main line was a jewel in the crown of British Rail even before privatisation, and the operators had the chance to work with that. As the hon. Gentleman said, when things have gone wrong, there has been support to assist customers with any problems that crop up, and the company has often been able to put things right.</p>
	<p>The Campaign for Rail Electrification from Aberdeen to Edinburgh, CREATE, was established by local government and economic development organisations in the north-east of Scotland down to Edinburgh, including Fife and Dundee, because when the electrification of the east coast main line was planned, it was to go only as far as Edinburgh. That rang alarm bells in people's minds about the economy further north, and caused concern that it would create a two-tier service because investment would go into new stock that could use the electrification, and investments in line speed and improvements would go to the electrified route. There was also a practical recognition that it is far easier to carry on electrification with the system up and running than to have a stop-start process. The campaign was established with that in mind.</p>
	<p>There has been a lot of professional and technical advice, and history, since the campaign began. Obviously, electrification stopped at Edinburgh. The campaign still exists, and it has stuck to the original issue: preventing Aberdeen from being seen as simply at the end of a branch line from Edinburgh. There are improvements to be made to the line north, so that whoever gets the franchise can provide a better connection from Aberdeen to London. Such improvements will help with people's journeys from north of Edinburgh to London.</p>

	<p>Does the hon. Gentleman accept that in an earlier debate on the matter&mdash;I think it was on 26 June 2002&mdash;the Minister who responded made it clear that electrification was no longer an option for the line north of Edinburgh, and that the way forward was for improvements through Fife, north of Dundee and up to Aberdeen, to ensure that the speed that we had hoped for could be reached and that the time of a journey between London and Aberdeen could be cut significantly? Although electrification was a goal of CREATE&mdash;I have attended many CREATE meetings&mdash;it is no longer on the table.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.353.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="353"  time="09:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew9">
	<p>As a former member of CREATE, I recognise the transition to a campaign for achievable improvements on the line north of Aberdeen, the point having been established that Aberdeen to London is a mainline service. We want the Minister to say that the Government still recognise that the main line runs all the way to Aberdeen. I hope that that recognition not only exists on a piece of paper, but has practical consequences, so that the line will be managed as a main line north to Aberdeen and the line improvements will be delivered, making it possible for the franchisee to offer an improved service. No matter how good the service is or how much less burdensome the journey, if trains are trundling around on old, inefficient and crowded lines, the competitiveness of the railway will not increase.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith was right, too, to say that we have to be more ambitious in this country if rail is truly to deal with the problems caused by unnecessary air travel. Establishing a new north-south route must be the long-term goal. Incremental improvements south of Edinburgh which disrupt journeys will only drive people away from the railways and will not achieve the substantial achievements that we want.</p>
	<p>Rail has a lot to offer. I should also like to hear from the Minister that the franchising process will not disrupt other developments on the line. In my constituency, the reopening of Laurencekirk station is closer than it has been for many years, with the Scottish transport appraisal guidance analysis showing that it is a financially practical proposition. I would like to be reassured that the franchise will not in any way disrupt either the reopening of stations on the route or the proposed Crossrail service in Aberdeen to create a commuter rail link from the north and south of Aberdeen, which would make use of existing infrastructure. Can the Minister also assure us that freight will not become a Cinderella service as the franchise is established?</p>
	<p>I reiterate the fundamental point, which is that the east coast main line goes north to Aberdeen and should be managed to deliver services north to Aberdeen, meaning improved speeds, times and infrastructure to make that possible. None of the welcome developments, such as the reopening of Laurencekirk station and the establishment of the Crossrail commuter service for Aberdeen, should be undermined.</p>

	<p>Does the hon. Gentleman accept that with the devolution of railway powers there is a challenge for the Scottish Executive to deliver on the projects that he mentions? We are concerned that the Scottish Executive have not been properly resourced to pursue such projects; we have calculated a &pound;70 million shortfall. I do not know whether he has concerns about that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.354.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" speakername="Robert Smith" colnum="354"  time="09:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew11">
	<p>Obviously, the Minister must make clear that in transferring powers to the Scottish Executive the Government should also transfer the resources that make those powers deliverable.</p>
	<p>On a practical level, regardless of resources, I should like also to ensure that nothing in the franchising process undermines projects. The franchise regulations could establish standards for the service which, because of technical specifications, disrupt the ability to reopen stations. I would like some recognition that the reopening of Laurencekirk station is being encouraged and that nothing in the franchise will undermine that encouragement or the development of Crossrail.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.354.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" speakername="Hugh Bayley" colnum="354"  time="09:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew12">
	<p>I start by congratulating my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) on securing this important debate. I also thank him and many hon. Members in all parts of the House for supporting my early-day motion urging the Government to award the new franchise to GNER.</p>
	<p>I should declare an interest. Like other hon. Members who live along the east coast main line, I am provided by GNER with a car parking pass&mdash;mine is for use at York station&mdash;which saves the House of Commons authorities a tidy sum in parking charges that I would otherwise claim. That is of course the same concession that GNER's predecessor British Rail provided to MPs along the line.</p>
	<p>The east coast mainline service, run by GNER, is without doubt the best railway in the country, but I want it to be better still. My hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke) and the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) have argued persuasively for improvements to the service north of Edinburgh. I would say to them that GNER has a good track record&mdash;the best of any train operating company in the country&mdash;for improving services by putting on more trains and improving track layout, not just in Scotland but in England. For instance, it has greatly improved the access and services to Leeds, which is off the main London to Scotland line.</p>
	<p>GNER's east coast main line is more than a railway; it is an artery pumping the lifeblood of prosperity into all the regions through which it passes. Yorkshire Forward, my local regional development agency, estimates that the main line contributes some &pound;100 million a year to the region's economy and sustains 11,000 jobs in Yorkshire, mainly in transport and tourism. Of course, a great number of those tourism-related jobs are in my constituency. We receive some 4 million tourists a year, of whom 24 per cent. arrive in York by rail, a number that has been increasing in recent years. However, the economic impact is not just on transport and tourism. The east coast mainline service run by GNER acts as a magnet. It has drawn investment to my constituency from a wide range of businesses&mdash;largely high-technology firms in computing and biotechnology&mdash;that need quick access to markets and customers in London and the south-east, and at other points on the east coast main line. Next to York station is the York Central site, which is about two thirds of the size of the area within York city walls, York's heart. It is ripe for redevelopment, and it will be developed only because of business brought into the city by the railway line.</p>
	<p>Jobs in York, in Yorkshire and elsewhere along the line depend not on the mere existence of the railway but on the provision of a good railway service. I was not in favour of rail privatisation, as the right hon. Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight) will recall, but I am firmly in favour of GNER. It has won me over for a number of reasons. First, it has improved the quality of the service on the east coast main line: it has increased the number of staff on trains and in stations; it has improved on-board catering and train information for passengers; and it has trained its staff, which has contributed to the quality of service. I believe that it is the only railway company in the country that has won Investors in People recognition for the whole of its business not just once but twice.</p>
	<p>I back GNER, secondly, because of the reliability of the service and, thirdly, because it has increased the frequency of trains, the number of services that it runs and the number of passengers that it carries. As my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith points out, there are important environmental advantages to drawing traffic off the roads and on to the railways.</p>
	<p>Fourthly, GNER has controlled ticket costs better than have some other rail companies; some of the fares that it offers now are lower than those charged by British Rail before privatisation. Its fares have risen overall, but not as fast as those of its key competitors. According to an article in <i>The Independent</i> yesterday, the cost of standard-class single fares on GNER services has risen by 48 per cent. in the past nine years. During the same period, the cost of standard-class single fares has increased by 70 per cent. on First Great Western and by 80 per cent. on Virgin Trains, so GNER has a better record on controlling the costs that face its customers than have its main competitors in this franchise competition.</p>
	<p>Fifthly, GNER's industrial relations record is good. It has established partnership agreements with the trade unions that represent its staff. I believe that that is important because it enables GNER to continue to modernise and improve the service to its customers and its working practices to keep the service competitive and profitable. The single most attractive thing about GNER is that it has delivered what it has promised. One cannot say that for all its competitors.</p>
	<p>There have been reports in the press in the past week or so that one of the bidders for the franchise, Danish state railways, intends to buy new Japanese trains. Investment in rolling stock is always attractive, but I should remind the Minister that GNER is in the middle of rebuilding its entire fleet of trains. If she has not already ridden on one of the new Mallard trains, I advise her to do so. They provide an absolutely splendid service. The difficulty with the offer to build entirely new trains is that if that were actually fulfilled it would not come into effect for six years at the earliest, and the new Mallard rebuild, which GNER is in the middle of, would stop dead. The new Japanese trains would be shorter and would carry fewer passengers than the Intercity 225 trains. The GNER rebuild is taking place in this country, supporting our rail engineering industry, but the building of Japanese trains would not.</p>
	<p>The importance of GNER to my constituency ought to be underlined. When rail privatisation happened, York lost thousands of railway jobs. Since then, we have been clawing our way back. We now have about 3,000 railway jobs in the city, in engineering, design, track maintenance and renewals, as well as train operations. However, the magnet for all those jobs has been GNER's decision to base the headquarters of its operations in York. No competitor for the franchise offers to have its headquarters in York. If any of them were to win the franchise, the 409 GNER headquarters jobs in York would be at risk. Other jobs in the supplier industries, such as in Corus Rail Consultancy, which must employ 300 or 400 civil and mechanical engineers, could also move elsewhere.</p>
	<p>If one reads the trade press or talks to businesses or chambers of commerce up and down the line, to the Institute of Directors, which wrote to me recently, or to budget travellers, pensioners or students, one finds that they are all backing GNER. As the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine said, some 20,000 pledges of support to GNER have come from its passengers. Many Members of Parliament from all parties have supported my early-day motion backing GNER's bid.</p>
	<p>I accept that GNER has to win the franchise on merit and has to offer the taxpayer value for money. However, the Government must also take into account its track record in providing an improving service. It would be quite perverse if the train operating company that by common consent has performed the best since privatisation were to lose its franchise. It would send entirely the wrong message to other train operating companies; it would say that quality and reliability are not valued and rewarded. It would create a hiatus and economic uncertainty in the regions through which GNER services pass, when continuity and certainty are required. I urge the Government to make an early decision on the franchise and to award a new franchise to GNER.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr.   Lazarowicz) on securing this debate. It is an important one and has been very informative so far.</p>
	<p>I, too, declare an interest in that I regularly travel with GNER on the east coast main line. Like my hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley), I have a car parking pass card given to me by GNER. I want to say something about my experience of travelling on GNER before focusing on two or three issues relating to the high-return option bid that all potential tenderers have been asked to include in their submission. I also want to discuss the issue mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith, of how returns to the Treasury from the successful franchisee should be invested, as well as talking about direct services between London and Teesside.</p>
	<p>My experience has been similar to that of my hon. Friend the Member for City of York. GNER provides an excellent service and generally I have found its staff very helpful and supportive. I hope that the franchise will go back to GNER; I feel strongly about that. I recognise that the case should be based on merit: the company's service to me and my constituents is outstanding and a credit to those who provide it.</p>
	<p>Sometimes I have experienced delays or cancellations for one reason or another, but I do not blame GNER. Problems have been more to do with the track, signalling or power supply, so I lay the blame at the doorstep of Railtrack, now Network Rail. That, historically, is the real culprit, not GNER. The rail company is led by an excellent chief executive, and it has gone from strength to strength in all the years that I have been travelling on it.</p>
	<p>On the matter of bidding, I want to focus on the high-return option, which is a device to test how a financial return from a franchisee to the Treasury can be maximised. I appreciate that that is seen as a way of securing a rail network with the least possible call on the taxpayer, but there is a danger that the duty will produce bid options that slash costs, and, in doing so, devalue standards. I should be concerned if potential franchisees presented bids that would mean fare rises, or cuts either in train crew or in staff at the stations that they control, such as those in my area of Darlington.</p>
	<p>I hope that the franchise will be approached in the spirit of ensuring that we have a high-quality railway, rather than one that is run just to be cheap and cheerful. I agree that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Strategic Rail Authority have a duty to examine the high-return option, but I argue that they also have a duty to consider the quality and level of services as well.</p>
	<p>As to investment in service, the Minister will recall that the east coast main line is unique in this country, as other hon. Members have said, in that it is the only one not to need a subsidy from the taxpayer. In those circumstances a crucial factor in the franchise process will be the amount of return to the SRA. That raises the issue of where the return will be invested.</p>
	<p>The east coast main line has several feeder branch lines such as the one in my constituency, which runs from Saltburn, through Redcar and Middlesbrough, and connects with the main line at Darlington. Unlike the main line, it needs investment and subsidy from the SRA and the taxpayer, but it is a vital link to the main line for the communities that it serves. In that sense it also directly underwrites the profitability of the east coast main line. A logical approach would be to invest the cash returns to the SRA and the Treasury in that line and, indeed, the other, similar, lines that serve the east coast mainline stations and services.</p>
	<p>I want to mention services between London and Teesside. Teesside is unique in being probably the biggest conurbation in the UK with no direct rail link to London. There is a population of nearly 500,000 in the area covered by the boroughs of Stockton, Middlesbrough, Hartlepool&mdash;I notice that my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Iain Wright) is in the Chamber&mdash;Redcar and Cleveland. For decades, those people have had to travel to Darlington to connect with a London service. I do not know what is in the detailed plan submitted to the SRA by the prospective franchisees. However, given the shape of the demands made on them by the bid, I should be very surprised if there were any mention of new links from London to Teesside. Given that, the Minister should examine closely the forthcoming bid for approval from the rail regulator from a new rail company, Grand Central Railway.</p>

	<p>I am grateful to my hon. Friend and fellow Teesside MP for giving way, and I fully support his comments. As the newest Member of the House, my experience is that the rail service from King's Cross to Darlington is extremely effective; the journey can be done in two and a half hours. My only problem is that if I use the rail network, it can take another two and a half hours to go from Darlington to Hartlepool, as I am sure my hon. Friend is aware. I fully endorse his comments. We should be investing in Teesside to ensure that there is a vibrant and effective link between the Tees valley and London. That would enable the commercial potential of the area to be realised.</p>

	<p>I hope that the Minister has noted the comments made.</p>
	<p>As I was saying, Grand Central Railway has put forward a proposal to run a service from Sunderland to King's Cross. That service would call at Hartlepool, Stockton and Eaglescliffe, which are all in Teesside. I understand that there is also the potential for a further service from Middlesbrough. It is envisaged that the journeys would be made by completely refurbished high-speed diesel trains with a high degree of passenger comfort. The company would also offer remarkably cheap fares, with an option of a Teesside-London return ticket of &pound;50. If approval is given, the company will seek to start operations this December.</p>
	<p>Grand Central Railway will probably be what is called an open access operator in that it will make no demand for subsidy from the SRA or payments to it. The financial arrangements would be similar to those that underpin the operations of Hull Trains. As the Minister will be aware, that company has been very successful in providing fast and convenient services to a similarly large conurbation, which, until the company's arrival, had found itself largely isolated from the east coast mainline network.</p>
	<p>Since the inception of the service, passenger numbers travelling to London from Hull and its surrounding areas have grown hugely. Crucially, those passengers were not stolen from GNER. The success of Hull Trains shows graphically that the same approach could work for my area in Teesside. It is clear that Grand Central's prospectus offers the easiest opportunity for Teesside to have a dedicated London rail link. The provision of such a link would aid tremendously the regeneration efforts going on in Teesside.</p>

	<p>Some Members from north of Edinburgh pointed out that the line runs northwards as well as southwards from that city. Does my hon. Friend agree that the franchise should also address the issue of how better links can be provided for all passengers, from whatever point on the east coast main line they travel, so that they have good connections to important towns and cities near the line?</p>
	<p>Given that people read debates such as these for references to car parking passes, I should like to make it clear that, as I am fortunate enough to live within walking distance of my station, I do not have a GNER car parking pass.</p>

	<p>I agree with my hon. Friend that links are very important. We have all had bitter experiences. If those concerns could be better addressed, we would all be in favour of that.</p>
	<p>I hope that I have put into focus the importance of the Teesside-London railway link. We have thriving universities, university teaching hospitals and emerging state-of-the-art teaching hospitals. Tremendous regeneration programmes are going on in Middlesbrough and Stockton as a result of the Government's efforts. I hope that the Minister takes note of all those things when she makes a decision.</p>

	<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I will be very brief.</p>
	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) on securing the debate. He will know that I am passionate about this issue.</p>
	<p>Many people have said that the options on offer are rail, car or air. Travelling from my constituency to London by car is a horrendous journey, and although we have an air service, which we value, it is not as frequent as we would like, so obviously rail still forms a major connection to the east coast of Scotland.</p>
	<p>I secured two earlier debates on this subject. On 26 June 2002 there was a debate on the electrification of the line north of Edinburgh. On 16 September 2003 we had an Adjournment debate on investment in the east coast line. The awarding of the franchise is a vital issue in the service delivery that all constituents on the east coast deserve and want.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley), who is very knowledgeable on the issue, made a vital comment about the current deliverer, which has kept its promise. That is reassuring. The touchstone for the successful franchisee must be a commitment to ensuring that the service is not reduced; indeed, I hope that it will be improved.</p>
	<p>Some comments have been made about the bidders for the east coast line and the determinants of the franchise; applicants have to put forward what they would call a high-return option. Many people believe that that would include fare rises and the replacement of poorly used services from stations up and down that line by buses. That is a prospect that fills many people, myself included, with horror.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith) properly outlined the rail travel problems faced by communities in the north-east of Scotland. They can be resolved only by significant investment in the line north of Edinburgh. He, I, and others have pursued that through the Scottish Executive and Ministers here in Westminster. Since the SRA decided for investment purposes to downgrade the line north of Edinburgh it has been a major battle. However, it is one of the vital issues that must be addressed by the Government and the franchisee to ensure the provision of the services that should exist to serve the north-east of Scotland.</p>
	<p>I hope that the Government take on board the need to keep services to the east coast of Scotland at their highest level. Hopefully, the successful bidder will also be committed to that.</p>
	<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to say those few words. I hope that there will be a successful conclusion to the franchise bid which will serve the people up and down the main line well and give them the service that they deserve.</p>

	<p>My hon.

	<p>I hope that you will have a moment to get there before too long, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend is a regular user of the service from his constituency, and he has impressed on me the massive local support for GNER. That is rare; it is hard to think of a rail franchise or service that has enjoyed such support from its users. Exceptions might include Chiltern Railways or the Gatwick Express. It is an important point, and it must be taken into consideration. The early-day motion tabled by the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley) is evidence that it has support not only from the public and passengers but from Members. I am unsure whether there has ever been an early-day motion in support of a franchise holder before, so that is rather special.</p>
	<p>My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed has intimated to me the considerable concern, particularly in the north-east but also in other areas served by the line, that the result of the current franchise letting will be a downgrading of the service, an increase in fares and a much worse service for the passengers. There are two key issues. The first is the franchise system and how it is applied with regard to this franchise. The second, customer satisfaction and the need to ensure that the product delivered to the customer is of value and quality, too often gets forgotten when we debate the railways.</p>
	<p>Let me start by setting out some of the things that GNER has achieved, because it might be considered a role model for other franchisees. Its first achievement is financial. It began with a Government subsidy of &pound;62 million a year. Not only has that been reduced to zero, but I understand that over the last three years it has paid some &pound;78 million back to the Government, and last year that sum was about &pound;22.5 million or &pound;25 million. The SRA's own survey reports that 85 per cent. of passengers are happy with the service, which is the highest satisfaction rate for any long distance operator.</p>
	<p>One of the things that impressed me most was that GNER has made investments of &pound;100 million in rebuilding trains, improving car parks, modernising stations and improving information for passengers. Too often the money that the passengers pay becomes profit or goes in rebates to the Government, and not much comes back in investment. A company that has invested is to be commended. That, possibly allied to the fact that there are some 22 per cent. more services, is why the passenger numbers have increased by 32 per cent.</p>
	<p>Another fact struck me. Many people say that GNER has a wonderful restaurant car, but it is simply a service for business men at the front end and takes no account of the ordinary traveller. However, GNER has standard-class tickets available that are cheaper than the standard off-peak fares that used to be offered by the BR Apex ticket. This is a provider that understands that a high-class service can be operated at one end of a vehicle and a cost-efficient or cheaper option at the other end.</p>
	<p>All in all, a great deal to do with this franchise is to be commended. If GNER can persuade the hon. Member for City of York to move from being against privatisation in principle to being a supporter of its securing the franchise, that is evidence of the good work that it has done. That is recognised by the petition and the early-day motion.</p>
	<p>I turn to the franchising system. We have just finished our consideration of the Railways Bill. In Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh) and I tabled an amendment nicknamed &quot;the GNER amendment&quot;. That was slightly unkind because it was designed specifically not to help GNER, but to place an obligation on the new franchise system whereby passenger satisfaction and the quality of service delivered by an existing franchise holder must be taken into account when awarding a new franchise. Surprisingly and sadly, the Government chose not to accept the amendment, but I hope that, when they consider how the new system will work, such an important ingredient will be taken into account.</p>
	<p>Part of our problem is that, at the moment, the franchising system is in limbo because we are in the dog days of the SRA. It knows that it will go soon, but the new system is not yet set up and running in the Department, so we are betwixt and between. A franchising system must clearly be about competition; otherwise there is no point in it. If all we had to do to achieve a new franchise was to deliver a good service, and that was automatically achieved, the system would not be working. It must be about competition not only for a particular franchise, but between different franchises.</p>
	<p>We then come to the matter of determining value, not cost. It is important to make known the difference between the cost of something and its value. As someone who has spent his life in the hospitality industry, I know that it is always easy to cut costs. We can slash the marketing budget or, the most common method, cut the training budget. Services can be reduced. In the case under discussion, a few people could be removed from stations and from the trains themselves. There comes a moment when however low the costs and however high the corresponding possibility of reducing fares or, as is more likely, giving more money to the Treasury, we will have destroyed the product that delivered the revenue in the first place. The Government or the SRA must therefore be careful; they must understand the difference between cost and value. They should not give in to the short-term desire to receive the maximum return, but know that nursing a customer base is about value and the long term.</p>
	<p>One of the hon. Gentleman who spoke mentioned the wider value not only to the travelling public, but to the economy itself, especially tourism. I declare an interest in that I am still the president of the Tourism Society. When there are good transport links the value of tourism increases considerably; academic data supports that. I do not know whether other hon. Members with regular involvement in transport matters received the same email as I did from a gentleman in America a few days ago. He said that he had tried everything to find out how our railways worked and how he could book a train ticket. He said that the telephones were not answered and the website was down, and if someone somewhere did not answer his call he would go to France. I sent him an email to ask what trains he wanted and say that I would do my best for him, but I have not received an answer.</p>

	<p>Probably.</p>
	<p>The franchising system must acknowledge value and customer satisfaction. As for competition, one of the other bidders runs the west coast franchise. If one company runs both the west coast and the east cost lines, competition will clearly be reduced. The customer service that GNER produces comes from its Investors in People qualification. It is the only rail company in such a position and surely it must be congratulated on that.</p>
	<p>At our conference last year, my party committed itself in principle to the north-south high-speed rail link. That will mean that many of the options that are currently open for a six-track railway or a bypass will conflict with that, an important point that the Secretary of State has now come round to understanding and which should be taken into account.</p>
	<p>A powerful case has been made for GNER, not simply because it is the existing franchisee, but because of all that it has delivered for the customer. It is time that the customer was put front and centre in dealing with the railways, and I hope that the Minister and her team will respond to that.</p>

	<p>Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p>I join other hon. Members in congratulating the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr.   Lazarowicz) on securing this important debate, and I congratulate all hon. Members who have taken part or intervened.</p>
	<p>The east coast rail franchise has been one of the biggest success stories of railway privatisation, and I join all hon. Members who have taken part in the debate in paying tribute to the way that GNER has operated the route. Even some of its critics have conceded that it provides a pretty good service. Today we are witnessing a unique occasion, because I cannot remember any other debate either here or in the main Chamber in which Members of all parties with little or nothing in common have spoken with one voice in praising a rail operating company.</p>
	<p>GNER has proved that the railways can operate successfully. It has combined the provision of a customer-focused, reliable and efficient service with profitability, as the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) said. In the past three years it has contributed &pound;78.2 million in revenue to the Government and turned a &pound;61.6 million subsidy in its first year into &pound;22.5 million of premium payments back to the Government in 2003&ndash;04, which, as the GNER press office is only too happy to tell us, represents the largest swing from subsidy to premium payments of any UK train operator since the railways were privatised. The fact that nearly 50 Members of the House from all parties signed early-day motion 536, which has been referred to, speaks for itself.</p>
	<p>Many people feel that there is a case for saying that in some circumstances there should be automatic franchise renewal for the most successful train operating companies. The Government should reflect on that, particularly where there is overwhelming public support and the train operator concerned has exceeded all expectations.</p>
	<p>A number of hon. Members referred to the SRA. The east coast main line is, perhaps, one of the last franchises to be re-awarded by the SRA. The abolition of the SRA is one of the few parts of the Railways Bill with which my party agrees, because over the four or so years that it has existed it has demonstrated itself to be rather a waste of time and money. When the SRA took over, the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising cost &pound;13 million and employed 187 people. The SRA costs &pound;102 million and employs 454 people. The cost and the number of people that it uses have grown and it has become less and less effective, so we are delighted to see it go.</p>
	<p>I am also delighted to see the SRA go because it has not, in the main, improved services. It has failed to give the railways adequate leadership and direction. Indeed, the reason the Government have given for getting rid of it is that they want to see more strategic leadership in someone else's hands. We welcome the fact that they have at last come round to the official Opposition's way of thinking on this issue.</p>
	<p>One difficulty for our railways is that franchisees lack the confidence to invest. How will the confidence of operating companies be improved, however, if power is merely passed upwards to the Secretary of State?</p>
	<p>The refranchising process is certainly causing concern among passenger groups and communities served by the route. The leader of Edinburgh city council, Councillor Donald Anderson, has raised concerns that the new franchise may lead to a reduction in services. He said recently:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Although the SRA has argued that the new East Coast Mainline franchise will maintain the number of trains between Edinburgh and London as operated at the start of the last franchise in 1996, our calculations indicate otherwise. The new franchise will reduce service levels during Monday to Friday to 18 trains per day.&quot;</p>
	<p>I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the people of Edinburgh, and indeed Aberdeen and the other communities served by the east coast main line, that their services will not be reduced, but actually improved.</p>
	<p>I also have concerns about journey times, a point touched on by the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith). If the Government are serious about wanting people to travel to places in the north by rail, rather than by air or road, journey times must be as short as possible. Before the Hatfield disaster, the fastest service from King's Cross to Edinburgh was, I think, three hours and 50 minutes. Under the new franchise, it appears that the average journey time will be significantly longer, at four hours and 42 minutes. For those who travel on business, that makes a big difference, and I hope that the Minister can tell us what the Government intend to do to bring journey times back down to pre-Hatfield levels.</p>
	<p>For the railways to be successful, the train operating companies need to be encouraged to invest more in their routes. It is common business sense that they will do that only if they are confident that their investment is commercially justified. The best way to ensure that is to offer longer franchises. Graham Morton of the CBI agrees. Recently, he said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Franchises have been more successful where the operating company has had the scope to be entrepreneurial&mdash;Chiltern is probably the best example&mdash;and the franchise is sufficiently long for a reasonable payback on investment.&quot;</p>
	<p>He has expressed concern that when the SRA's powers are transferred to the Department for Transport, the Government may not give companies enough freedom. He rightly questions whether the Department possesses the skills to design and deliver future franchises.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith expressed his support for longer franchises, and I am pleased that he is joining the ranks of the Conservative party, if only on this narrow issue. Longer franchises will mean that the best train operating companies receive steady and predictable revenues.</p>
	<p>It is important to rid the network of political interference so that it can run itself without facing constant changes, as it has done since 1997; for example, the train operating companies should be given greater freedom over timetabling so that they can run extra services if they believe that there is demand. The network also needs investment directed at driving passenger growth where it is most needed, with an industry structure that is most able to respond to customer demand.</p>
	<p>Hon. Members may be aware of the submission that the Rail Passengers Council made to the SRA when the authority published the invitation to tender for the   franchise. Chief among the council's concerns was the poor quality of the stations on the line. The Conservative party has recently made a commitment to improve and develop railway stations so that more of them meet customer expectations. I hope that the Minister will respond on this issue, because passengers are increasingly concerned about the poor facilities, particularly at some stations. Will passengers concerns in that regard be taken into consideration when franchises are awarded? What extra effort will the Government make to ensure that our railway stations are improved?</p>
	<p>It will not have escaped the Minister's attention that the east coast main line passes through the constituencies of some of the most influential Labour Members. I know that some very influential Members are here today, but the line passes also through the constituencies of the right hon. Members for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) and for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers). I hope that they are not going to exert a sub rosa influence on the awarding of the franchise. It should be completely free of any behind-the-scenes party political interference. It would be wrong for the franchise to be awarded to a company because the head of that company liked to be seen hob-nobbing with new Labour Ministers. If the voice of the public carries any weight, as it should, the firm view, as expressed throughout this debate, is that GNER should be re-awarded the franchise.</p>
	<p>This is an important debate. The line is vital to the economy, not only for much of the north of England but for Scotland. Whichever bidder takes over the franchise&mdash;I am not aware of any reason why the   present incumbent should not continue&mdash;I hope that the line continues to provide a high standard of service for passengers and to show others that our railways can operate in a way that is financially successful. We all look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

	<p>I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz) on securing this debate and for providing us with the opportunity to discuss the east coast rail franchise. It has been an excellent debate, with hon. Members drawing on their own experiences of GNER and the east coast main line, as well as those of their constituents.</p>
	<p>I start with a quick word on the north-south high-speed line. The Government want to draw on the useful work already done by the Strategic Rail Authority, and particularly to consider international experience. We are looking at the case for investing in high-speed lines, as compared with upgrading existing lines. That is something important for the future.</p>
	<p>The east coast franchise provides fast, high-quality services that link London with Yorkshire, the north-east of England and Scotland. The competition for the new franchise is progressing well, and the SRA will announce the future operator in the spring. Hon. Members will appreciate that I cannot comment on the content of individual bids, but I can outline the objectives of the refranchising process and the specification on which bids for the east coast franchise were based.</p>
	<p>First, however, I must comment on the tremendous support that has been expressed for the incumbent operator retaining the franchise&mdash;by hon. Members today and by the many passengers who have lobbied the Department for Transport and the SRA. It is appreciated that, in the main, passengers are satisfied with the present standard of service on the east coast route. However, the competition to refranchise the services will not jeopardise standards. On the contrary, by its nature it should spur improvements.</p>

	<p>The Minister must recognise that passengers are satisfied with the standards of the operator which are within its control, but they are quite concerned about the infrastructure that the operator has to use, and about the importance of improving it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.367.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/703" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="367"  time="10:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew30">
	<p>I appreciate that, which is why the Government have invested hugely in the infrastructure, and why we are investing in the rail industry to the tune of about &pound;73 million a week.</p>
	<p>I am delighted that hon. Members expressed not only their confidence in GNER but their real ambitions for future improvements to the east coast main line. It is essential that the franchise is operated by the company offering the very best service to the public, within the parameters of the franchise. We therefore have a duty to put the intercity east coast franchise out to tender. To do otherwise would remove the competitive pressure that helps to determine which company is best suited to providing services on the east coast main line. Competitive tendering is also necessary to ensure best value for taxpayers' money in the operation of the franchise.</p>
	<p>Four parties have submitted bids for the east coast franchise. They are GNER; DSB, a consortium of Danish railways and EWS Railway; First London, Scottish and North-East Railways; and a consortium of Stagecoach Group plc and Virgin Group Investments Ltd. These parties have been chosen having pre-qualified under the SRA's set procedure. Bids for the operation of the franchise will be judged not only on price, but on commitments to performance, improving train and crew reliability, and operational viability. Contracts will also include clearly defined penalties should operators fail to fulfil their commitments. Each company's bid will be evaluated on its merits, and we will award the franchise to the bidder whom we feel best meets the criteria.</p>
	<p>I should add that the new franchising system will take into account the relevant past performance of the company. That is part of the pre-qualification process. The franchise is being let in line with the franchising policy announced by the SRA in November 2002. That aims to deliver four broad objectives: to provide a safe and more reliable service of consistently high quality for the benefit of the passengers; to provide clarity of service specification so that the industry partners work together for passengers; to deliver a value-for-money service for passengers and taxpayers; and to secure accountable, viable operators who are passionate about delivering their service. I can assure hon. Members that the franchising process will not disrupt other developments on the line.</p>
	<p>The model has passenger interests at its heart. The selection process is far more robust than in the past. We will focus in particular on how bidders deliver against their promises. Costs will be scrutinised, and franchise agreements will not be entered into unless the SRA is certain that the bid is viable.</p>
	<p>The specification for the east coast franchise has been drawn up following consultation with statutory and non-statutory consultees. It protects services to Aberdeen and provides for a term of seven years, with a three-year extension if performance is consistent with contractual commitments. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith is reassured by that potential 10-year term, which he mentioned earlier. It provides a clear specification, including timetables, against which the bidders have been asked to base their proposals. To this end, base specification for the franchise sets out some clearly defined goals: to ensure that services continue to be operated safely; to demonstrate passion about the delivery of commitments; and to improve significantly the punctuality and reliability of services over the whole route. On journey times, the franchise includes a base case timetable, but the operator can add extra services and stops, so the journey time will largely be down to the successful bidder. Other goals are to provide services that are significantly more affordable to taxpayers and passengers alike by improving productivity and efficiency, or through innovation in operational or managerial practices; to improve integration with other modes of transport and other services; and to ensure the quality of the station and on-train environment, including improved accessibility.</p>
	<p>The high&ndash;return option is designed to obtain ideas from experienced train operators about ways of improving returns from the franchise. It is not simply about cutting standards, but includes other options that would generate increased income by attracting more passengers to what will be a better service.</p>

	<p>Does the Minister accept that one of the great successes of GNER has been the very high-class business class that it provides, with its restaurant car? That has had the effect of taking passengers, particularly from Newcastle, away from air travel and on to the railways, a modal shift that is to be welcomed. Will that continue to be taken into account?</p>
</speech>

	<p>Certainly, competition with air is a vital part of the whole process. Shifting passengers from air to rail will tap into a completely new market and improve take-up of the service.</p>
	<p>The Strategic Rail Authority will pay particular attention to proposals aimed at the affordable improvement of station, rolling stock and customer service standards. The successful bidder will have to possess the financial strength and innovative capability to improve existing operations and to make the route one of Europe's leading railways. In developing their proposals, the bidders have been encouraged to consult local stakeholders directly and to provide a summary of the consultation and a statement of how stakeholders' opinions have been taken into account.</p>
	<p>Improving the punctuality and reliability of services will be a key feature of the new franchise. The SRA intends overall performance to reach 90 per cent. by the end of 2009. Furthermore, the franchise should be performing consistently in excess of 90 per cent. by the end of 2012. The bidders for the franchise are required to include a performance model that indicates how those targets will be achieved.</p>
	<p>A base service specification will also be incorporated in the new franchise. The franchisee will be required to operate the existing timetable from the commencement of the franchise until the timetable change date in December 2005.</p>

	<p>The Minister has rightly pointed out that the specification includes a base service, but if an operator suggests improvements to the base service, will that be taken into account in the franchising process?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.369.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/703" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="369"  time="10:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew34">
	<p>Certainly, it is important to consider what the bidder can bring to the overall service when deciding whether that operator will be successful. After a bid succeeds, several timetable alterations are assumed, which are aimed at enhancing performance and improving the match of capacity and demand.</p>
	<p>Bidders were free to suggest enhancements to the base timetable which they believed deliverable and desirable. They were also asked to set out how they will plan services and resources to minimise overcrowding on platforms and on trains. A strong emphasis has been placed on service quality. The successful franchisee is expected to provide a service quality appropriate for long-distance rail travel. The franchise will include a series of key performance indicators that will incentivise the delivery of consistent standards for information provision, ticket retailing and customer service.</p>
	<p>The successful franchisee is expected to provide stations with an accessible, welcoming and comfortable environment that offers passenger information and amenities appropriate for long-distance passengers, including luggage assistance. As hon. Members have said, stations should also facilitate easy interchange with the services of other train operators and other modes of transport. The bidders were also required to provide proposals for rolling stock which set new standards of performance, liability and presentation. As a minimum, the rolling stock fleet must be able to provide seating capacity equivalent to, or in excess of, that of the current fleet. It must also operate at up to 125 mph and have a better reliability rate.</p>
	<p>Infrastructure enhancements are being made outside the scope of the franchise. To date, no business case has been made for electrification beyond Edinburgh, but the franchise operator is required to consider improvements to the entire route.</p>

	<p>The Minister makes the point that, as yet, no business case has been made for electrification north of Edinburgh. Will the successor to the SRA undertake to ensure that we can have a proper debate about whether the service will be worth while?</p>

	<p>Electrification is continually being considered, but its advantages over other innovations are not as great as they were. That issue is, however, constantly kept under review.</p>
	<p>The SRA is sponsoring the delivery of the new double track chord at Allington, scheduled for completion by the end of the year, which will help to improve the performance of the line. Other infrastructure enhancements are being considered through the east coast strategy that is being developed by the SRA. The strategy is currently under review, awaiting the outcomes of the rail White Paper. The document will also have to be reviewed following the selection of the successful applicant for the new intercity east coast franchise to ensure that it is consistent with the detail of the successful bid.</p>
	<p>In conclusion, I hope that I have provided some assurance that the refranchising process is a positive one aimed at building on and improving the current service. The east coast main line is a vital route for the millions of passengers that it carries each year. Those passengers can look forward to a reliable and high-quality service for many years to come.</p>

	Health Services (Hartlepool)
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.371.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1362" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="371"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h02.htm#50208h02_spnew0">
	<p>I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate. I see the future of health in Hartlepool, alongside the town's economy fulfilling its potential and the putting in place of measures to eradicate crime and antisocial behaviour from our streets as the main improvements that I hope to achieve as the town's MP.</p>
	<p>Although the debate is about the future of health services in Hartlepool, I should like to spend a few moments outlining the broad historical trends in health in the town. I am a huge believer in the concept that we do not know where we are going unless we know where we are coming from. Hartlepool suffers greatly from its legacy as a centre for heavy manufacturing industry and from decades of economic decline. Industries such as the steelworks and the docks have left their mark with diseases such as asbestosis and respiratory illness. We, as a town, have suffered from decades of economic decline as the traditional industries have died. Unemployment has savaged the local population, which is only now beginning to recover.</p>
	<p>Although the past decade has real improvements in Hartlepool's economy, we are starting our renaissance from a very low base. Car ownership, a key barometer of economic prosperity, is low&mdash;40 per cent. of households in the town do not own a car, compared to 27 per cent. nationally. That should have, as I will show, a real bearing on where health services in the town are located. Despite recent improvements, we still have to contend with the health consequences of years of economic decline, poverty and social exclusion. This legacy means that Hartlepool people suffer more ill health and disability and higher death rates from cancer, heart disease and respiratory illness, and live shorter lives than people in most other parts of the country.</p>
	<p>The facts are stark: I received these figures only yesterday, in response to a written parliamentary question. Life expectancy for Hartlepool men is 73.4   years, against a national figure of 75.9 years, while Hartlepool women are expected to live 78.4 years, against a national average of 80.5 years. We also lead unhealthy lives. Forty per cent. of people in the town smoke, and we have more than the national average number of cases of obesity caused by poor diet and excessive drinking.</p>
	<p>The national health service is, arguably, the Labour party's greatest creation, and it has undoubtedly improved the health of people in Hartlepool. However, it is not improving as fast as that of people in other parts of the country, and health inequalities within the town remain profound. Half the people live in wards that are in the 5 per cent. most health deprived in the country. Stranton ward is 51st out of some 8,400 wards in the country for health deprivation and disability, while Elwick ward, the most affluent ward in the town, is still in the top 3,000 for poor health.</p>
	<p>We should also take into account demographic changes. The population of the town is ageing: the number of people aged over 75 is expected to increase by 25 per cent. in the next 15 years. That is aggravated by a sharp fall in the birth rate in Hartlepool. The number of births has dropped by almost a fifth in a decade, which has exacerbated the decline that was particularly pronounced between the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
	<p>This is the challenge for those who shape the future of health services in Hartlepool: a legacy of industrial decline and associated poverty; unhealthy lifestyles; high incidence of ill health; pronounced health inequalities; an ageing population and low birth rates, all of which result in profound pressure on health resources.</p>
	<p>Our health has not been helped by a chronic lack of investment for decades in primary health care in Hartlepool. The unwillingness or reluctance of successive Governments to invest in this crucial first call when somebody is ill or in the prevention of illness has led to an undeveloped primary care sector, which has to contend with the most difficult problems. The possibility of attracting more money elsewhere, and the generally poor quality of surgery buildings has meant that we suffer from an acute shortage of general practitioners. Hartlepool is in the bottom 10 areas of the country for numbers of GPs&mdash;we need about 12 more to reach the national average, and a similar increase in the number of community nurses. Meanwhile, GPs' average list size is 2,100, the highest in any PCT area in County Durham and the Tees valley.</p>
	<p>The problem exacerbates itself. High patient numbers lead to extra work and more stress for GPs, which accelerates their wish to retire early or to leave the town. An estate's audit in the town found that five of the 17 GP premises in Hartlepool are in poor condition, with only six meeting the criterion for satisfactory. There is an acute shortage of space in those surgeries, and that hinders their development and potential to offer a wider range of services. Most do not comply with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p>The acute shortage of community doctors over the years has led to an over-reliance on the local hospital. Hospitalisation rates far exceed the national average, and the hospital's accident and emergency service is stretched to its very limits as people use accident and emergency because they cannot get access to a local GP or community nurse. The number of accident and emergency attendances at Hartlepool hospital has increased by more than 9 per cent. in the past year alone.</p>
	<p>I have painted a dark picture, and I am not exaggerating. However, amid the gloom, there is real success. This Government have recognised the health problems caused by deprivation and invested heavily in the NHS. Funding year on year in cash terms for the NHS in Hartlepool since 1997 has been close to 10 per cent. The Government's commitment to providing health services as locally as possible strengthens the case that primary care in Hartlepool needs to be developed.</p>
	<p>Despite the massive resources invested in our health service by this Government, there is a strong case to say that we in Hartlepool remain underfunded. The primary care trust has a shortfall of some &pound;2 million a year from its targeted allocation; the NHS trust has a projected deficit of some &pound;6.5 million to overcome. I am grateful to this Government, and sincerely believe that no other Administration would have invested so heavily. However, I am in Parliament to stand up for the people of Hartlepool, and I believe that the Government need to provide substantial additional funding to both primary and acute care to tackle the decades of neglect in Hartlepool. Health professionals would not squander this money; there has been real success in recent years, as I shall mention shortly. Just think what could be achieved with appropriate funding.</p>
	<p>Foremost among the successes are the achievements of the local hospital. For the third year in succession, the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust has been given a three-star rating. That means that over a long period, it has consistently been one of the best performing trusts. Only 12 trusts in the country have received that accolade for three years.</p>
	<p>The University hospital of Hartlepool has been named among the top 40 hospitals in the country, and its clean-hospitals policy has meant that, unlike hospitals in other parts of the country, it does not suffer from accusations of being unclean or of suffering from germs. In fact, it is among the top 10 cleanest hospitals in the country. The &quot;general&quot;, as it is known locally, is genuinely thought of with pride and affection in the town.</p>
	<p>I know from personal experience what a marvellous asset it is. All my four children were born there. My eldest son's life was saved there when he was treated quickly for meningitis, and my youngest&mdash;only two months old at the time&mdash;was admitted last Boxing day, suffering from pneumonia and bronchiolitis. All that success is due to the tremendous commitment of staff of all grades at the hospital, which is ably led by Bryan Hanson, the trust's chairman. Their loyalty and commitment to health care for the town is arguably unchallenged throughout the entire country. That is why I think it understandable that the proposals led by the strategic health authority to downgrade or close the hospital have led to concern and alarm in the town.</p>
	<p>A dedicated campaign to save the hospital has been organised by John Bloom. John stood against me in the by-election, and I disagree with many of his policies. However, I do not doubt his sincerity and integrity on this matter. He, and others such as Peter Wolfe, have put this issue on the agenda and have not hijacked it, as others did, for short-term political gain.</p>
	<p>Let me make my position absolutely clear: I am adamantly opposed to the closure or downgrading of the hospital. In my vision for future health care for Hartlepool, I see the hospital as the major site for acute services between Sunderland and Middlesbrough. I see the hospital going from strength to strength and improving its capacity to provide all the services it provides today such as accident and emergency services, general medicine, surgery and neurology, orthopaedics, rheumatology, obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics.</p>
	<p>I have been greatly reassured by comments from the Secretary of State for Health and the Prime Minister that the hospital will be improved, not downgraded, and I see Professor Sir Ara Darzi's review as an opportunity to ensure that Hartlepool can realise its potential as a major health hub between the River Wear and the River Tees.</p>
	<p>I do not believe that the co-location of the Hartlepool and North Tees hospitals on to a greenfield site between the two towns will be conducive to effective health care. That would go against the Government's policy of ensuring that health care should be as local as possible, and would hinder the effective recovery of patients.</p>
	<p>As I mentioned earlier, my son Billy was ill during Christmas, and my wife and I took turns to stay with him. He was visited by his grandparents and by other relatives. We are fortunate that we have a car. Further anguish could have been caused to us, over and above the fact that our two-month-old son was seriously ill, had we relied on public transport to an out-of-town hospital over Christmas, while ensuring that our other three children were being appropriately cared for. As I said earlier, car ownership is low in Hartlepool. The ease with which family and friends can visit has an important bearing on the recovery of a patient. That ease can be achieved only by having the hospital firmly secured in the town.</p>
	<p>It is madness that where a town has an underdeveloped and relatively under-resourced primary care sector and a subsequent over-reliance on the three-star acute hospital, some senior bureaucrats wish to remove or to limit what the hospital does, against the wishes of the people. That is akin to a person having one healthy, muscular leg and the other one in plaster, and opting to amputate the healthy leg before the other one has healed&mdash;the person would soon fall over.</p>
	<p>That is not so say that I want the hospital, and everything that it does to be preserved in aspic&mdash;never to change. Clinical improvements mean that procedures that previously required a major operation and recuperation in hospital for many weeks can be done as day surgery. Developments such as triage in accident and emergency treatment have meant that more people are seen more quickly and with suitable prioritisation. I want that trend to continue, so that fewer people stay in hospital and that they do so for shorter periods and recuperate in the familiar, comfortable surroundings of their homes. That will mean that a faster turnover of patients can take place at the hospital, which will help to produce shorter waiting lists and greater capacity for acute care.</p>
	<p>I also want to mention the successes of Hartlepool primary care trust, because its objectives are a major vehicle with which to achieve my vision for health care in the future. It was formed only in 2001 and had initial managerial difficulties, but it has come a long way in a short period to reverse the lack of investment in primary care over the decades. The chairman, Professor Gerald Wistow, and the chief executive, Angela Hawkes, are putting in place the vision where people are treated as locally as possible, ill health is tackled and, as far as is possible, prevented, and state-of-the-art health buildings are located in all our estates and neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p>The success of the PCT in a few years of existence is astonishing. In terms of smoking cessation, Hartlepool PCT's clinics have helped to produce a doubling in the number of successful quitters. Thanks to the PCT and its work in implementing its teenage pregnancy strategy, Hartlepool has enjoyed the biggest decrease in the under-18s conception rate in the north-east. Work is progressing to bring more GPs to the town, often from the international doctor market. Crucially, the PCT is investing, through the development of local improvement finance trust schemes, in new medical buildings in the heart of our estates in Owton, Rossmere, the town centre and on the headland.</p>
	<p>Those schemes are the foundation of the future of health in Hartlepool: 21st century neighbourhood health centres on each estate providing high-quality primary care and health advice to the local population, undertaking minor surgical procedures and being the first point of call for urgent cases, thereby relieving the pressure on the local hospital. For example, people in Owton go to their neighbourhood health centre for treatment rather than the accident and emergency department of the local hospital.</p>
	<p>I am a passionate believer in the Government's policy of ensuring that health care is as local as possible. Given our historical health legacy, the PCT, in conjunction with the local strategic partnership, which I chair, understands Hartlepool's needs and is able to commission services to meet them. That is why I find it odd, and somewhat against Government thinking, that the local strategic health authority is pushing PCTs in its area to commit quickly to strategic commissioning, where commissioning for all Tees valley PCTs will be pooled under a Middlesbrough PCT. I am all for making savings and efficiencies through joint procurement of services, but there is a massive difference between procurement and commissioning. I cannot understand what possible benefit the people of Hartlepool will receive from allowing decisions about their health to be taken in Middlesbrough as opposed to in their own town.</p>
	<p>One of the true success stories in Hartlepool in recent years has been the ability of different organisations to put aside institutional jealousy and place the needs of Hartlepool residents first. We are lucky in that the geographical boundaries of the PCT are coterminous with those of the local authority. More important is the desire to work together to improve the town's health. Joint commissioning has taken place, with joint appointments such as that of Peter Price as director of public health. Pooled budgets between the council and the PCT are already in place and, from next April, those organisations will jointly commission children's and older people's services.</p>
	<p>That is the future of health care in Hartlepool: teams of doctors, nurses, social workers and home carers from a variety of agencies sharing information and using the same systems and procedures to tailor health care to residents' individual needs and requirements.It seems a shame that years of painful negotiation and hard work to secure partnership by those local agencies could be threatened by a blunt diktat issued on Christmas eve by the strategic health authority.</p>
	<p>I want the partnering approach to be extended throughout the health network in Hartlepool. I want Housing Hartlepool to be part of that network to ensure that housing does not contribute to health problems. I want schools to teach children the benefits of healthy eating and I want supermarkets in the town to play a role in promoting fruit and vegetables and the benefits of a balanced diet.</p>
	<p>In this demanding age, a one-size-fits-all approach is wrong, particularly for health care. The agencies in the town need suitable flexibility, and shared systems and procedures, to enable them to offer a personalised service as close to the home of the person concerned as possible, with the minimum of duplication from organisation to organisation.</p>
	<p>The future of health services in Hartlepool is the realisation of our town's vision of care; it is services that are as local as possible, with an emphasis on a service to patients based on their individual needs; it is a multi-agency approach with a massively sophisticated health network; it is an adequately funded primary care sector, in conjunction with a responsive and fully funded acute sector, which allows community based health to be at the centre of the health service in Hartlepool while freeing the acute trust to undertake its valuable role. Only by realising that vision will we truly reverse decades of ill health in Hartlepool.</p>

	<p>It is with pleasure that I respond to my hon. Friend's debate and congratulate him on securing it; I know that the subject is a matter of huge importance to him and his constituents.</p>
	<p>I want to say a few words in response to his remarks about public health. Although I shall not say a lot on those topics, because I need to focus on the specific issues that my hon. Friend raised about hospitals and primary care trusts, that should not suggest&mdash;and I can tell that this goes for him too&mdash;that we give a low priority to public health, prevention and the Government agenda, which makes health care, and health itself, a top priority.</p>
	<p>I concur with my hon. Friend's remarks about the importance of tackling health inequalities and obesity, and about the need to avoid over-reliance on hospital services by securing good services in a community setting. I am, in addition, pleased to congratulate the PCT, and others involved, on the drop in smoking brought about through the quitting smoking services, as well as on the teenage pregnancy figures that he mentioned. All those things are terribly important and we need to tackle them if we are to crack the issue of health care and health in the longer term.</p>
	<p>To deal with some of the more specific issues, Hartlepool PCT, as my hon. Friend acknowledged, has received large allocations of &pound;93.6 million in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;102.5 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;112 million in 2005&ndash;06. Those amount to a cash increase of &pound;26 million, or 30   per cent., over three years. That compares closely to the overall national average. It is slightly less, but by only a small amount&mdash;the figure is 30.27 per cent. compared to the national figure of 30.83 per cent.</p>
	<p>The next round of allocations will be announced imminently, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will take a keen interest in that. That is in the context of record increases throughout the country, which means that there has been a big cash injection to enable many of the issues that he raised to be addressed.</p>
	<p>I turn to the Tees service review and then the work of the PCT. To respond to my hon. Friend's point about where decisions are made, at the end of the day 75 per cent. or more of the money is received by the PCT. It is up to the PCT to commission the services locally that it feels are most appropriate for the people of Hartlepool. In that setting, responsibility has also been given to the strategic health authorities for running the NHS and running health in their areas, alongside the PCTs. In that context, my hon. Friend will remember the remarks that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health made last summer:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Hartlepool will still have a full and proper hospital service after the review has taken place.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 8 June 2004; Vol. 422, c. 312.]</p>
	<p>I should like to assure my hon. Friend that there is no going back on that commitment.</p>
	<p>In looking at how the services are developed for the future, the Department and all the strategic health authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the NHS not only provides high-quality care today, but will be able to provide it in 10 years' time. The service is not static; developments occur all the time, and possibilities for new treatments and new ways of doing things evolve, which is to the benefit of patients. We must ensure that our health service generally, and in Hartlepool specifically, continues to evolve in such a way that, as patients, we all get the best service possible.</p>
	<p>The current review of services in the area north of the Tees is designed to ensure that. There are three elements to any possible change. First, primary care is the key to the future of the NHS, as I said. It is now possible to provide a wider range of care, including minor surgery, X-ray and other tests. I note my hon. Friend's remarks about high-quality facilities in all the communities around Hartlepool and the importance of providing services away from acute hospitals, which I have seen elsewhere and which are more convenient and often much more effective in a community setting.</p>
	<p>The reason for the change is that providing services in primary care makes services more local for local people, who will be able to receive treatment and care in local surgeries and other facilities close to their homes. There are a number of benefits to that. I note my hon. Friend's remarks about car ownership levels and the importance of travelling. The changes can mean a lot less travelling and less pressure on the hospitals, and therefore shorter waiting times for those who genuinely need a hospital service that cannot be provided in a community setting. In line with recent announcements, it is also important that the care of those with long-term conditions be managed closer to home too. There will be better prevention of ill health by targeting people at risk, which is an aspiration that he and I share.</p>
	<p>The second element is the need for all emergency services to work together more effectively. At present, there is often confusion about the best thing to do. People end up in an accident and emergency department just because they know that it is there and that it is open, but it may not be the best place for them in all circumstances. The right service may be advice from NHS Direct, or out-of-hours service in primary care or a minor injuries clinic. People need rapid access to the emergency service best able to meet their need. In that connection, I am pleased to report that the out-of-hours service in the Tees valley area has been operating smoothly since April 2004.</p>
	<p>The third element is ensuring that local hospitals are strong and modern, and can give the best possible services available to all people north and south of   the   Tees. I acknowledge that change is always uncomfortable to contemplate and not always popular. People sometimes like to keep things as they are, which is most true of well loved local services such as local hospitals. It is absolutely understandable that the Hartlepool &quot;save the hospital&quot; petition was signed by some 30,000 people.</p>
	<p>The job of the SHA&mdash;working with all its partners in health and social care&mdash;is to look ahead and put forward changes that will save tomorrow's hospitals by making sensible changes today. The hospital services have been changing for some time and they are still changing. As I have already said, some services that used to be provided in a hospital can now be provided in primary care. Other services need to be provided in fewer places so that specialist staff and facilities can be available to provide the best possible care. Some examples of such services are those for cancer treatment, emergency surgery and the most serious accidents. I am not talking about average attendance at accident and emergency, but really serious road traffic accidents and other dramatic accidents.</p>
	<p>The decisions to create strong, modern hospitals have already been taken in other parts of County Durham and the Tees valley area. For instance, people living south of the Tees are already served by the James Cook university hospital, which opened in 2003. The purpose of the Tees review is to establish arrangements in the area north of the Tees that will provide the best and most sustainable services for the 21st century. The Department of Health invited Professor Sir Ara Darzi to work with the SHA on the review to ensure the highest quality outcome. The professor was asked to consider how the fullest possible range of services can be maintained at Hartlepool hospital in light of the work that has already been undertaken during the Tees services review and the wider context of the proposed provision of primary and secondary care services, both north and south of the Tees.</p>
	<p>Two additional areas were identified relatively recently as needing examination, which is why we have agreed to look at the work of the Hambleton and Richmondshire PCT and the South Tees hospital trust in relation to the Friarage hospital, and consider the impact of the centralisation of specialist services at, and the capacity of, the James Cook university hospital on other hospitals in the area.</p>
	<p>The original time scales were not realistic, so the review has been extended and it must be allowed to be carried out thoroughly and should report when it is ready. It is important that we provide people with safe, sustainable services that are local, where that is possible. I know that my hon. Friend will share that ambition. The local health service, with the assistance of Professor Darzi's review, is looking at how best we can do that. The professor is visiting Teesside in March and I understand that my hon. Friend is likely to meet him again then. Professor Darzi is likely to submit his final report in the following months and, as he is still reviewing the situation, I am sure that hon. Members will understand that I cannot make any commitments that pre-empt the outcome of the work that he is doing.</p>
	<p>In the remaining minutes, may I turn to GP recruiting and the work that has been done on that? The good news is that, in September 2001, there were 49 GPs in the PCT area and the latest figure is 52, which is a 6 per cent. increase. I am aware that there are still seven vacancies and the PCT has employed eight salaried GPs to provide capacity where it has not been possible to attract principal GPs to practices. The PCT has been working with the strategic health authority to develop the international recruitment of GPs. Under the national initiatives, new GPs in Hartlepool will receive the higher rate golden hello payment, which can be up to &pound;12,000. The PCT is also looking to develop modern primary care centres providing access to integrated health and social care teams, including all the specialist workers that my hon. Friend mentioned. It is also planning to use a range of other primary care skills to help deliver that. In addition, the PCT has recruited two GPs from Spain and one from Austria.</p>
	<p>Nationally, there are more GPs in the NHS than ever before, which reflects the Government's record investment in primary care and commitment to expanding the GP workforce. In June 2004, there were 31,215 GPs working for the NHS, which is an increase of 11.3 per cent. since October 1997. There are a range of initiatives to secure ongoing, positive developments in that direction.</p>
	<p>We know that people are concerned about health in Hartlepool and I reassure my hon. Friend that the Department of Health is, too. The strategic health authority and the local NHS organisations are also concerned. That is why so much has been invested in health and why we will keep on investing in health in Hartlepool, which we want to be modern and sustainable for the future.</p>

	<p>It is an enormous privilege to have secured this debate, and I am delighted to see the Minister in his place. He will know from my dealings with him that I have no hesitation in supporting the Government when they are right and no hesitation in telling them when they have got something wrong.</p>
	<p>I welcome the tremendous sums that the Government are putting into the health service and many of the reforms that they are introducing to ensure that that money has an impact. Those reforms include better services for cancer patients and cardiac surgery, the instituting of overview and scrutiny committees, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and the Healthcare Commission, and the publication of &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&quot;, which I welcome. However, I have no hesitation in saying where some of the proposals have gone wrong.</p>
	<p>Today, I shall give my views as an ex-NHS consultant and one who is acutely aware of the patient's voice. Indeed, now that I am an MP, I am hearing the patient's voice as much as I did when I was a practising doctor. First, however, it is necessary to give a short history lesson to those who have not been around the NHS for as long as I have.</p>
	<p>During the campaign that brought me into the House, I had to endure several nicknames. I was called a militant activist, as well as King Canute, although that is actually a great compliment, because King Canute was essentially a humble chap; he did not believe that he could prevent the sea from coming in, and sought to demonstrate that he could not do so. I was also called a medical dinosaur, and at the risk of justifying that title, I want to take hon. Members back a few years.</p>
	<p>Right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have implied that the choice initiative will give people choice for the first time. In his speech to the New Local Government Network, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;And for the first time, meaningful choice in the NHS is becoming a reality&quot;.</p>
	<p>That is just not right. Before the period from the late 1980s to 1990, when the internal market came in, patients had absolute choice over where they were referred, and doctors had absolute choice over where to refer them. I always remember treating a patient with an extremely difficult muscular condition. At the time, the expert in muscle diseases&mdash;he is now a member of the House of Lords&mdash;worked in Newcastle upon Tyne, which was rather a long way from Kidderminster. Yet, I was able to get that lady to see that expert in Newcastle without any problem, either with contracts or red tape. So, that sort of choice is not new, although, unfortunately, the internal market put an end to it.</p>
	<p>My views are reinforced by those of another chap who probably would not mind being called a medical dinosaur. Dr. Peter Fisher, the president of the National Health Service Consultants Association, writing in <i>Hospital Doctor</i> this week, says that in the</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;days of carefree simplicity (pre-1990), the relationship between GP and consultant was a straightforward one, untrammelled by concern over contracts.&quot;</p>
	<p>I would add that the relationship between the patient and the GP was also untrammelled by concerns over contracts, in whatever sense one uses the word &quot;contract&quot;. Dr. Fisher asks the crucial question:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Where is the evidence that this&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>the choice initiative&mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;is value for money or what patients want?&quot;</p>
	<p>What does the patient really want? As we all know, patients are very aware of cleanliness in hospitals and the risks of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. They desperately want clean hospitals and local hospital services&mdash;I know that as well as anybody&mdash;and for them to be well resourced. They are prepared to travel if there are long waits, particularly for elective treatment. It is unlikely that anybody ever has real choice on emergency admissions in any case, because they are taken to the nearest available place that can cope with them. The choice for patients would be to have that local service as close as is possible.</p>
	<p>In this week's <i>British Medical Journal</i> there are references to a MORI poll that showed that 25 per cent. of people would be willing to travel anywhere in the United Kingdom for treatment by the NHS when there were long waits locally. The snag is that the survey was talking only about people with means of transport&mdash;people with their own cars.</p>
	<p>To try to get a glimpse of what ordinary people want by way of choice, I turn to the letters page in <i>The Guardian</i> yesterday. A writer from Preston, who I checked is not a doctor and is not in the medical directory, describes choice as</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;the most absurd and obvious red herring . . . used in political debate . . . Surely what everyone should have access to is a universal health service that is equally good in all areas.&quot;</p>
	<p>On the same page there was a medical opinion, with which I rather naturally tend to agree. A doctor wrote:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Before we can start talking about choice, we should work on meeting some basic standards&mdash;high and rigorously applied&quot;.</p>
	<p>There was an article in <i>The Independent on Sunday </i>written by the noble Lord Haskins, who used to be an adviser to the Prime Minister. He describes his own illness and his reasons for first choosing private health care, but later moving to the NHS when the service he needed was available on it. He pointed out that he had the ability to choose and that choice helped him a great deal.</p>
	<p>I wish that Lord Haskins was still an adviser to the Prime Minister because he wrote:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The person who is best placed to exercise choice on behalf of the patient is the GP, who, when practicable, does that at present. There is a strong case for strengthening the GP-patient relationship&quot;.</p>
	<p>He condemned the Government's</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;new, flawed consumerist policies for public health&quot;.</p>
	<p>Lord Haskins wisely suggests that the Government</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;should concentrate on what it has been doing successfully in the past few years&mdash;providing more staff, and better technology and improved facilities which are available to everyone, without undue delay.&quot;</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman makes the serious point that choice will, in many circumstances, effectively be one that is taken on the advice of the GP. Is it not the case that more than two thirds of patients, including elderly people and those with mental health problems, will find themselves at an information disadvantage and will be unable to make an intelligent choice?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.382.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1275" speakername="Richard Taylor" colnum="382"  time="14:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h03.htm#50208h03_spnew2">
	<p>I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I shall return to that point towards the end of my speech; he has obviously been reading the study showing that 65 per cent. of people do not have the advantage of choice.</p>
	<p>I turn to the limitations on choice in the existing system. First, targets are centrally imposed; in the past, those targets had to be met in order to decide on star ratings. Such central diktats take away local choice, but that is in direct competition with the Government's laudable aim of devolution. Overemphasising targets is leading to problems for patients and reducing their choice. I shall give two examples&mdash;one general, and one local.</p>
	<p>The general example is of NHS treatment centres. The centres were designed with a large capacity because it was recognised that separating emergency and routine work would offer hospitals better control of waiting lists and help fulfil the aim of delivering routine care more rapidly. Probably for the right motives, the Government arranged huge contracts with treatment centres in the independent sector; the problem is that those contracts have to be fulfilled before patients can be allowed real choice about where to go, and people are worried that they will not improve quality. Primary care trusts are under pressure to use the independent centres; they thus have relatively limited resources available for use on the NHS treatment centres. I am sure that the Minister is aware of worries about the independent sector treatment centres&mdash;worries about standards of care, loss of training on routine matters for junior NHS staff, follow-up and the treatment of complications.</p>
	<p>The local example shows how choice has been taken away by overemphasising the targets for cardiac surgery. Because the major centre for cardiac surgery in Birmingham could not meet the targets, the local strategic health authority ruled in its wisdom that patients from my part of the world, from the Wyre forest and south Worcestershire, should go to Coventry cardiac surgical centre rather than Birmingham. That would be all right if patients were given the choice of going either 50 miles or 20 miles. I can honestly say that both probably provide services of an equally good standard, but that ruling has been interpreted in such a way that patients and the local cardiologists are left with no choice.</p>
	<p>I have to declare an interest; I know of that problem because a good friend of mine is involved. The distance to Coventry by the most convenient route is 51 miles, and to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham it is 18 miles. In emergencies, the ambulance journey for my friend was 51 miles of agony. The only ambulance that could take his heart machinery was an old ambulance with archaic springing, and he had to lie upon an unsprung canvas stretcher. That is one example of choice being taken away from both clinicians and patients.</p>
	<p>I turn to a second limitation on choice, the availability of services. The Health Committee has recently reported on allergies, palliative care and sexual health. Those reports all show limitations in the services provided&mdash;understandably so&mdash;but those limitations also reduce patients' choice. Even the choice of whether to die at home, which many people would like to be able to make, is limited by the amount of support available.</p>
	<p>Another local issue is maternity care. The Health Committee produced a report in 2002&ndash;03 on &quot;Choice in Maternity Services&quot;. The services that should be available are, obviously, home birth services, midwife-led birth centres, and a consultant unit. A recommendation in the report was that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;given that pregnant women are not able to travel long journeys to give birth, if midwife led units are not available local choice is severely constrained.&quot;</p>
	<p>The Government response accepted that, but rather hid behind devolution, stating:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;It is for local service developers to design services to meet the needs of their local population taking fully into account their views.&quot;</p>
	<p>My feeling is that the Government will hide behind devolution when it suits, but impose targets that may cut across those local priorities.</p>
	<p>Our birth centre was rightly closed after some unexplained and totally unacceptable baby deaths. The inquiry that looked into it exposed faults in that stand-alone birth centre that dated back to the loss of the acute district general hospital that previously supported it. Despite questions of safety at the time, the health service managers did not put the safety measures into place, with the consequences that have ensued. Stand-alone birth centres are safe and viable with the right protocols, as is demonstrated in &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&quot;, which I have mentioned before.</p>
	<p>Another factor that limits choice is the availability of staff. The Government are to be commended for their efforts to increase staff, and their success in some other fields of activity, but there are still huge gaps. I shall give two local examples. In the county of Worcestershire there is only one specialist available for a particular complicated but relatively commonly needed procedure. That specialist was called away on jury duty. Doctors used to be exempt from jury duty and I have no brief to recommend that for doctors as a group, but where a service depends on a single high-powered specialist it does not seem right that he or she should be called away to jury duty. There can be no choice in that case, because there will be no service.</p>
	<p>Similarly, in my area we have only one specialist for essential biopsies of the prostate. When that specialist is off sick there is no service. That instance resulted purely from lack of co-operation and lack of a true partnership across the county, which I believe has been sorted out.</p>
	<p>The last factor that I want to mention as limiting choice is another that I lay at the door of the Government; it involves magnetic resonance imaging scanners. There is spare capacity in MRI scanners in the NHS, but the Government have signed a huge contract with a private supplier and therefore the choice of the GP to use the local NHS scanner is eroded, as is the choice of the patient. The motive is bulk buying for cheapness, and that is certainly a consideration. I tabled a written question to try to find out what the savings would be, but, surprise, surprise, the answer that came back stated:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The exact costs of the scanning and reporting procedure is a matter of commercial confidence.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> 13 January 2005; Vol. 429, c. 611W.]</p>

	<p>Does the hon.

	<p>Payment by results has not yet been introduced, and I am not going to talk about it because it is something for the future, but it does carry immense threats to viability.</p>
	<p>The fact that MRI scans are being contracted out to the private sector in large numbers again points to the Government's lack of awareness of some aspects of what goes on in the real world. MRI scan reporting is not as simple as reporting a pathology blood test. It is always an opinion, and it cannot be a one-way process. There must be input from the clinician, and he or she needs to know the radiologist to know to what extent they can rely on the report. Discussion often helps. Throughout my professional life, one of the most useful aspects of my ward rounds were visits to the X-ray department with juniors to meet the radiologist and discuss the scans. Obtaining a balanced view and a correct opinion were of immense benefit, to say nothing of the teaching opportunities.</p>
	<p>I fear that the wholesale use of private sector MRI scanners is a false economy. It certainly removes choice. There are reports that University hospital, Lewisham has stopped referring patients to the private scanner services because of inaccurate reports and delays in reporting.</p>

	<p>I am listening carefully to what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Does he know the name of the private company supplying the MRI scanners, and whether it has any connection with the Government, who have contracted it in secret for a figure that we do not know because it is shrouded by commercial confidentiality? <i>[Interruption.]</i> I see that the Minister is sensitive about the subject.</p>

	<p>The name of the firm&mdash;Alliance Medical&mdash;is well known, but I do not know of any connections with the Government.</p>
	<p>Much has been written recently about the low uptake of the choose-and-book system, about the doubts over what the necessary integrated IT system will achieve, and about GPs' doubts that they will have the time to operate it. I hope that the Minister will understand that I am trying to be helpful when I say that it is pretty impracticable to give people a choice of four to five providers. The GP is, and must be, the one who decides where a patient should be referred to. That is one of the crucial aspects of the GP-patient relationship.</p>
	<p>I referred earlier to the King's Fund and Bristol university study, which was published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. The study showed that 92 per cent. of the population have two hospitals within 60 minutes' travel time. Other members of the Health Committee and I saw a demonstration of this really complicated choose-and-book system at the Department of Health. It reminded me of an intensive care unit monitoring system that I demonstrated to the public before the local hospital's league of friends bought it some 20 years ago. The model worked beautifully, but it did not work when we put it into the ICU and we had to sue the provider to get the money back. What we need instead is a simple system that would be readily available.</p>
	<p>With two clicks of his computer keyboard or mouse, a GP could easily pull up on a single screen, updated every day, the specialty at the two hospitals within an hour's journey, the consultants in the field in which he was interested and the waiting times for those consultants. He could decide with the patient, which is his job, which of those the patient would like to go to. The appointment could then be made not by the GP, which takes time, but by the receptionist outside.</p>
	<p>I move on to the way forward, because I am desperately trying not only to be critical. I cannot say that it is a real ambition because I do not think that I will ever become Secretary of State for Health, but if I were I would be tempted to investigate ways to abolish the market. People might say that that was going back years and it would not work, but, as I will not get into that position, at least it is unlikely that I will have the chance to suggest that. So, on to practical steps.</p>
	<p>First, we need to recognise that virtually all clinical staff, nurses and doctors in the health service are absolutely dedicated to the NHS and to its patients and that there are some extremely good managers. If the managers are responsive to the people who work for them and to the patient groups who now have a voice, the health service could improve tremendously without the Government's interference. When we produced the Health Committee report on foundation trusts, we were staggered to find a list of major governmental reorganisations of the health service since 1982. Between 1982 and 2003, there have been 18 major reorganisations. We should leave the competent, capable, dedicated staff and their managers a bit of freedom to get on with things.</p>
	<p>Secondly, I would remove targets. I welcome the Healthcare Commission's approach to assessing hospitals on standards to aspire to rather than on actual targets. I hope that they will continue to work for real ways of measuring health outcomes. Thirdly, I would sort out the potential conflict between the implementation of NICE guidance and of national service frameworks and local priorities.</p>
	<p>Last week there were some dramatic headlines in the papers. On 3 February, <i>The Times</i> headline read &quot;Patient power may close failing hospitals&quot;. What was meant by failing? To my mind, it meant failing financially rather than clinically, largely because patients are not allowed to choose the hospital that they would like. The money is channelled away by Government pressure on PCTs so that some of the work is done in the private sector. Contracts with the private sector have to be taken up.</p>
	<p>On the same day, the headline in <i>The Independent </i>said that the Secretary of State was &quot;ready to close NHS hospitals that prove unpopular.&quot; <i>The Guardian</i> had a similar headline, but reported comments from a Department of Heath spokesman that were very revealing. The spokesman said that the Secretary of State's</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;warning that hospitals might close referred to non-emergency treatment.&quot;</p>
	<p>To me, that betrayed a fatal lack of understanding of the situation in the NHS by the Department of Health. If we take away entirely non-emergency treatment from an acute hospital, that hospital system will collapse. We can separate NHS elective care into treatment centres as long as they are integrated with the acute hospital, as a result of which the orthopaedic surgeons are kept in place. However, if we close down emergency services and lose them entirely, the hospital will not be viable.</p>
	<p>I want the Department of Health to go out into the real world and talk to practising GPs, hospital doctors, managers at the coal face and patients' representatives. At present, there are some effective patient forums and patient organisations, such as HealthLink, which has carried out a study into the aspect of choice. I want the Department to talk to people with mental health problems, with long-term conditions, the elderly and the vulnerable because they are pretty much excluded from that choice, to which reference has already been made.</p>

	<p>A moment or two ago, the hon. Gentleman was careful to distinguish between the concepts of clinical failure and financial failure. Does he   agree that the real risk of the Gadarene rush into market mechanisms and therefore into the hands of the private sector could leave the NHS facing the fact that financial failure and clinical failure will be seen to   be interchangeable and indistinguishable by the Government?</p>

	<p>That is exactly what the headlines in the newspapers are doing: confusing one thing with the other. It is a real risk.</p>
	<p>Was there really a threatened revolt by chief executives at strategic health authorities against the second wave of independent sector treatment centres last autumn? Choice is certainly a laudable aim in the long term, but it is not the correct, immediate aim. To repeat the words of Dr. Peter Fisher in the leader of <i>Hospital Doctor</i>:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;where is the evidence that patient choice will deliver better health care?&quot;</p>
	<p>Patients want local hospitals that are clean and well resourced. The Government have actually put in the money to achieve that, if clinical staff, managers and patients' representatives were allowed to direct the money to where it is most needed, according to local priorities. If patients are to be given real choice, in the words of Dostoevsky, &quot;What man wants is simply independent choice&quot;.</p>

	<p>It is a pleasure to take part in the debate. It reminds me of old times when I was on the Front Bench. There is a Liberal Democrat Opposition day debate and other activities in the House today, so I kindly offered to help out on the Front Bench. I am pleased to see the Minister looking as cheerful as ever&mdash;yes, no smile.</p>
	<p>We should thank the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) for obtaining the debate and giving us the chance to discuss many of the most topical issues in health care. He carried out a wide-ranging survey of some health care issues and placed particular emphasis on choice. I agreed with much of what he said, especially the need for all of us, across party, to identify how to ensure that there are mechanisms that give more choice, or give more control, as I prefer to describe it, to the patient that will improve quality, access and equity. Those are our three most important aims.</p>
	<p>Choice or control is best viewed as a means to the end of obtaining a more equitable, higher quality, and more accessible health care system, with access leading to fairness and quality, too. There is too much rhetoric about choice and some of the mechanisms that are designed to demonstrate that the Government are seeking to maximise choice undermine the other end points of fairness, quality and improved access, particularly for the sickest patients who ought to have the fastest access. There is also a significant opportunity in setting up mechanisms that can be seen to raise the profile of choice as an end in itself, rather than as a means to an end. The hon. Gentleman spoke about choose and book, which is one of those expensive and time consuming mechanisms that have yet to demonstrate any advantage in terms of access, quality and fairness.</p>
	<p>I do not believe that the Government are opposed to recognising that the key issues are improved access, a fairer health care system and a fairer burden of ill health&mdash;if that is the right term&mdash;and ensuring that there is good quality, but they are distracted by an obsession with trying to outflank the Conservative party to the right in respect of worshipping the mantra of choice. I should like to give a few examples of where their promotion of choice as an end in itself is damaging to what really needs to happen and to what we can say, given that we are in Westminster Hall and still some distance from an election, are ideals shared by all parties in terms of trying to obtain those three outcomes.</p>
	<p>It is probably wise to start with choose and book, because that focuses the question on the opportunity cost. We should not be too critical of the NHS programme for IT. Clearly, there is scepticism about Government IT programmes, but if scepticism prevented us from doing things, we would never make any progress. The head of the IT project made it clear that he was aware of the record of failure on delivering big IT projects and was keen to ensure that the programme about which we are talking delivered the hardware and software. I recognise that big steps have been made. The flip side to that, which is perhaps inevitable, is that there has not been as much engagement with the health care professionals&mdash;not just doctors and GPs&mdash;that there might otherwise have been. That conscious decision was taken by the head of the NHS IT programme, because he thought that it was most important to get credibility by delivery, but it is not easy to say in retrospect whether that was wise, given that there is now a big need to engage with the medical profession.</p>
	<p>The NHS programme for IT is seeking to do things as rapidly as possible in a catch-up way. The Minister will recognise that the remarks that I am making on this matter are not designed to be over-critical. However, the problem with choose and book is that GPs do not understand why the Government chose the numbers in terms of the range of choices, regardless of whether there was a question of access, or whether it was appropriate to provide choice.</p>
	<p>I spoke to a GP in Bristol recently who could not understand why the other choice for cardiac care for his patients was in Winchester. It is not realistic that patients in Bristol will want to go to Winchester, especially those with the greatest health needs who will find it most difficult to operate that choice. Such people want to be near their families and treated near their homes. That GP was also of the view that there was a significant time requirement to use choose and book, which meant that he could not see as many patients as he needed and wanted to see and who needed seeing. He thought that the Government had not costed properly&mdash;had not even started to cost&mdash;the time impact of forcing people to use such a system in the surgery and were hoping that they would engage with it.</p>
	<p>Clearly, there will be slowness during the pilot phase, if the system is to be piloted. I shall rephrase that; &quot;pilot&quot; implies that there will be an evaluation and a reconsideration. Do the Government think that, when people are proficient and the system is fully online, there will be a time cost? How will that be factored into GP work loads? The Government have done a huge amount to try to address concerns about GP work loads with the GP contract. It would be a pity to lose what has been reasonably successful, as far as these things go, in giving GPs the recognition that they wanted of their time-pressure issues. It would be a pity if the good will that emerged from that were put at risk by the imposition of a system that took a lot of time.</p>
	<p>I should like to probe the Government on whether within this choice arrangement they will still provide the freedom of choice that GPs, and through them their patients, have for referral to a consultant or specialist of their choosing. I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks on that issue. He was explaining that when he worked in the health service prior to the internal market&mdash;that was a little before I started working there&mdash;there was effectively freedom to refer to any specialist in the country through the GP. That was lost during round one of the internal market, which was introduced by the Conservatives in the late 1980s. The question is whether that still applies now. Will GPs and patients be able, outside of contracts, to go to consultants of their choice? It is worth exploring how the Government's new tariff-based system and payment by results affects how we judge whether there is an internal market at the moment. It is fair to say that the Government have created an internal market, and a better, more effective one than the Conservatives did, for reasons that are clear.</p>
	<p>Under the Government's system, money will follow individual patients; that is the way it is set up. Under the Conservatives' system, whether by design or because of a problem with the system, patients followed contracts and there was very little in the way of incentives to get extra patients; the incentive was not to lose the contract. However, it is difficult to take huge contracts away from a hospital without that hospital going bust. We were rightly critical of the old internal market, and I do not understand why the Government refuse to call what they are doing a better, more effective market version of the Conservatives' internal market, a version in which the money&mdash;I have heard Ministers use the expression&mdash;will follow patients as hospitals try to attract extra work.</p>
	<p>That must be a good thing for people who see the health service in that way. I am not sure that that is how I would like to see the health service in its entirety, but one can recognise that a system in which good work and attracting more patients gets more resources is an effective market. I cannot understand why the Government are not proud of the fact that they have improved on what the Conservatives tried to do. With practice-based commissioning, there has clearly been a return to GP fundholding, which the Government were proud to say they had abolished, even though they made large multifunds when they created primary care groups.</p>
	<p>I ask whether there will still be patient choice because in my Oxfordshire constituency we have been told that the mechanisms for choice, in reference to the large contract that has been awarded to an independent-sector treatment centre for cataract operations, will be called managed choice. I do not know whether that will be managed choice, massaged choice or pretend choice, but the patient referrals will go to a central PCT-run hub and be allocated to the treatment centre without the patients or their GPs having any say-so in the default situation. Patients will not be asked, &quot;For your cataract operation, do you want to go to a car park near you in the next three months, or to the Oxford eye hospital?&quot;, but be allocated to one or the other&mdash;most likely the treatment centre. I cannot understand how the Government dare to define that as choice, but I can understand why they are doing it.</p>
	<p>The reason, as the hon. Gentleman said, is that those private sector treatment centres, and perhaps even the NHS ones, have an agreed amount of work sent their way. No money will follow the patient, but the Government have set up huge contracts, five years in advance, when the money has already gone, at exactly the same time as saying that they want the money to follow the patients. It is possible that no patients will be referred to the centres, but the centres will still be paid. They have to find the patients to follow the money.</p>
	<p>I do not see how that gets over the problems of the Conservatives' flawed internal market, which the Government are rightly keen to criticise, for that and other reasons. I would therefore like the Minister to explain how he sees five-year contracts in advance of guaranteed work going to those treatment centres when he says that the issue is about the money following the patient and rewarding units for attracting more patients, rather than giving them a huge dollop at the outset.</p>
	<p>I think that the Minister recognises that GPs do not have much faith in some treatment centres, particularly where there is a good quality NHS service. I would be the first to accept that, in my area, not all the NHS services are good. However, there have not been complaints about either the quality of the service offered on the NHS for cataracts or failing to meet the three- month maximum waiting time target by the end of last year, flawed though that target is, as the NHS has indeed met it.</p>
	<p>It is hard to understand why the system was imposed in the way that it was&mdash;it certainly was not a choice for the local population. In order to get the PCTs to sign the legal agreement, the Government had to guarantee that they would fund through the SHA the extra costs involved in patients not going to the private provider and sticking with the high-quality, easily accessible and fair service offered by the Oxford eye hospital.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman hit on another issue, which is that quality is not just about the here and now. We must find ways to ensure quality for the future. One of the key questions is how the Government see training being provided in independent treatment centres, which is done, I guess, to pass muster with the district auditor or the National Audit Office, at a rock bottom rate. The centres cream off the easiest cases and do not have to do any training. Everyone knows that training slows down the process. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that from having medical students to train who slowed him down, even though they were probably not as bad as I was.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. As more and more surgery is done at a day case level and in treatment centres, the integration of treatment centres with the acute hospital is vital, otherwise juniors will not receive the training that they need for the work in day case centres that they will do when they become consultants.</p>

	<p>That is quite right. Independent providers in my area now say that they are renegotiating and increasing their prices, now that they do not have the contract, to take trainees. It is certainly important that trainees are trained, but we are talking about a rush job, where the long-term situation was not considered. If the Minister can correct me on that, I will be interested to hear his comments. If he persuades me, I will revise my views, but I am describing what I have heard from people involved in training on the ground.</p>
	<p>The rush to the private sector also seems reckless as to the unintended consequences. For example, I understand that a system called evercare has been introduced to the community system, again in the Avon area, which has involved the provision of community matrons. The system is operating on a pilot basis, although I understand that it has been rolled out before evaluation and that is not a pilot to me, but an early starter. Under evercare, a private health care company called UnitedHealthcare&mdash;perhaps the hon. Gentleman is aware of the company&mdash;will employ community matrons to assess patients, in particular regular attenders at hospital with more than two recent admissions, to see whether there is a way of keeping them at home. That is a laudable aim, but two negative points can be made. First, there is no evidence that it is cost-effective. That is why evaluation of these schemes is so important; Britain is not California for all sorts of reasons, even if the Minister wishes it was. Secondly, GPs say that all their H and G grade district nurses have been stripped out of the system in order to fill these posts funded by the NHS through this contract with a private company. Is that a sensible use of resources, and are the Government taking account of that?</p>
	<p>These are genuine issues and questions to do with choice, and we come back to the fundamental question of what choice is for. If it is for improved quality, better access and fairness, it seems reasonable to try to use choice as a means of increasing access where there is a problem to do with waiting times or access to treatments&mdash;in isolated areas, for example. I have no ideological objection to choice being used in that way. However, in order to try to realise the mantra of patient choice in the NHS, the Government too often take control away from patients and GPs, and pick areas where there are not as large access or fairness problems as in some other areas. Even if one accepts that the Government's motives are right, it seems that they are operating the system in a way that enables them to say, &quot;We are maximising choice, and we do not really care about evaluating how that has been achieved.&quot;</p>
	<p>We need to be a little more rational and sophisticated in how we use choice to increase the control patients have over their treatment. We must recognise that that is not simply about a choice of hospitals. If it is about a choice of treatment, that is integral to the doctor-patient relationship; doctors have a duty to explain the treatment choices to patients. If the Government are saying that that is a problem at present because doctors are not giving patients an adequate choice of different treatments, they should say so. If they think that time is a factor, they should provide adequate time and space for clinicians. However, I do not think that the Government are saying that. They are using a geographical choice as a proxy for talking about a choice that already exists&mdash;the choice that patients and their doctors make together about what is the best treatment, regardless of where it takes place. There are far too many mixed messages on choice, and that confuses the issue.</p>
	<p>In the run-up to the election, I would like the Government to talk more about fairness and quality, and to ditch some of the rhetoric around targets and choice. That often simply stigmatises parts of the NHS&mdash;often those parts with the highest work load or, because of the way the cake is divided, inadequate resources. Morale is already low in those areas, and it is driven lower by criticism on the basis that they are not meeting some of these central targets.</p>
	<p>I hope we get some answers on what the Government's real position is on this, and I thank the   hon. Gentleman for taking us through some of the situations that concern him in this important area of health care.</p>

	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) on securing a debate on this subject. I think that I can say on a non-partisan basis that it is a pity that we have not been better supported by our Back Benchers on this occasion. This is a crucial issue and I am sure that it will form a central element of what the parties talk about in the run-up to the general election.</p>
	<p>I will be a little more charitable than the hon. Gentleman has been because, broadly speaking, the choice agenda is the official Opposition's agenda. It is our agenda because we believe it to be right in principle, and because we feel that, mechanistically, choice will drive up quality. On both counts, we support the general thrust of the Government in promoting choice in the national health service.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman, no doubt unintentionally, revealed in some of his remarks what one might call the patrician strand of NHS doctoring. I say that with the greatest respect, and I hope that he will not take offence. However, people now expect to be more closely involved in the decisions relating to their medical care and are, perhaps, less willing than they once were to be directed by &quot;the system&quot;. The choice agenda is all to do with encouraging the patient empowerment that, going by his contribution, concerns the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris).</p>
	<p>Mr. Harry Cayton has said, very eloquently, that patient choice is no gimmick. It changes people's lives, gives them control and improves the responsiveness of the NHS. With those words, I could rest my case and sit down. However, I shall not do that because I should like to ask the Minister about some aspects of choice. I agree with Mr. Cayton's sentiments; they are put extremely well in very few words. Choice drives up standards and responsiveness. I commend the Social Market Foundation report of September 2004, &quot;Choice: the evidence&quot;, which poses a number of questions. Let me paraphrase three of them. It asks whether, when it has been offered, choice has been taken up&mdash;the answer is yes, but a support package is required in order for that choice, where offered, to be taken up; it asks whether the population that takes up the choice is socio-economically skewed, and it concludes that it is not; and it asks whether choice has helped to improve quality and efficiency and, crucially, answers yes.</p>
	<p>The report bears close scrutiny, and I am probably doing it a gross injustice by summarising it. However, that is, essentially, what it says. It does not ask&mdash;I think that it should have done&mdash;whether health care professionals feel threatened by choice. The answer to that is probably yes. I would also say that the Government have not helped matters by, until recently, choosing to ignore health care professionals in going forward with the cornerstone of choice, the national programme for IT in the NHS. I shall deal with that in a few moments. I entirely endorse the comments that have been made about choice not being just between hospitals. It is between treatments and between specialists. As the MP for a rural constituency, I would say that people would, in effect, be choosing between, at most, two hospitals. However, they would also be choosing from a raft of specialists and, I hope, from different forms of treatment. For rural areas, the choice agenda will mean a great deal more than choices between hospitals. It will mean choices between specialists and between different sorts of treatment.</p>
	<p>Mental health has been mentioned, but only once, in passing. That is a great pity. If I were to pick out an area of health care in which I felt that choice could be particularly useful, it would be mental health. Empowerment and choice are therapeutic. Lack of choice and lack of control are anti-therapeutic for many patients. That is probably why those who concern themselves with mental health issues, as well as patients, respond positively to the Government's choice agenda, and agree that it is right for the official Opposition to have at the heart of their agenda the notion of choice.</p>
	<p>I encourage the Minister to say a little more about mental health in the context of choice. I say that in all candour. It has not been spoken of enough, and it should be. I fear that the right hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends do not appreciate that the NHS means considerably more than elective surgery. He might wish to take the opportunity to say a few words about how he thinks that his choice agenda will help those with mental health problems. I should also be grateful if he would clarify where we are with choose and book. Last month, the National Audit Office reported that only 63 patients had used it, although more than 200,000 had been expected to do so. Is the Secretary of State's expectation of 100 per cent. usage by the end of the year as ambitious as his plans for NHS dentistry were? Clearly, those have collapsed, with the result that my constituents have considerably less choice than they had eight years ago.</p>
	<p>Will the Minister share some of the difficulties that the national programme for IT in the NHS is experiencing? We know that there are a great deal of problems, but, sadly, we have to learn about most of them from the redoubtable <i>Computer Weekly</i>, which has done a good job in keeping us up to date, despite the Government's attempts to bar its reporters from briefings. Why has it proved necessary, at this late stage, to throw bucket-loads of cash at primary care trusts in an attempt to bring GPs online and on message?</p>
	<p>Last week, in a written answer to a question put by my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley), the Minister said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;On 19 January 2005, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced a &pound;95 million incentive scheme to recognise and reward the key role that PCTs will need to play in engaging primary care stakeholders and encouraging and supporting general practitioners to use choose and book.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>; 2 February 2005; Vol. 430, c. 995W.]</p>
	<p>That seems sinister. How does the Minister anticipate that PCTs will use the &pound;300,000 per trust to bend GPs to his will? We understand that NPfIT will deliver two things: the vestigial national spine, and choose and book, yet each choice booking so far has cost &pound;52,000. The Minister should know that GPs are thoroughly fed up at having invested in kit and training that they are now told will be redundant. Crossing their palms with silver at this late stage is a poor substitute for carrying them along from the start. The slow and clumsy choose and book is becoming something of a laughing stock among GPs. The Minister is fighting a rearguard action.</p>
	<p>Will the Minister clarify the Secretary of State's announcement last week that his choice agenda will cause some hospitals to close? I am sure that he will be keen to do that. The press are full of speculation, and a great deal of confusion has been caused. I have my own thoughts on what the Secretary of State meant, but it would be extremely useful if the Minister could clarify those remarks so that we are left in no doubt as to what he meant.</p>
	<p>The NHS Confederation points out that patients may well vote with their feet, but from specific departments and on elective procedures only. That is right. As others have pointed out, if elective hip surgery goes, trauma will quickly follow, which will, in turn, be followed by accident and emergency; that would spell doom for an acute hospital. What has not been pointed out as much is that critical mass is needed in an acute hospital for training and accreditation. If one little bit of that is lost, the whole edifice is lost. Insufficient thought has been given to that. Indeed, there is no evidence that any thought has been given to it in any Minister's utterance that I have heard. Perhaps the Minister can correct me.</p>
	<p>I have no doubt that patients will vote with their feet. By and large, that will be a wake-up call to hospitals. I suspect that that is what the Secretary of State should have said&mdash;and that it would rarely result in the closure of an institution. Surely to goodness that is what he meant.</p>
	<p>There has been mention of the way in which money follows patients, or patients follow money. I share some of the concerns raised, for example that the targets set by the Government to bring down waiting lists have resulted in contractual arrangements that will end up hampering rather than improving patient choice. Labour has set a target that 10 per cent. of operations should be carried out by independent treatment centres. That target is arbitrary, distorts patient choice and prevents NHS hospitals from attracting patients on a level playing field. Again, it would be useful to have the Minister's comments on that.</p>
	<p>James Johnson of the British Medical Association is not a great fan of independent treatment centres. He claims that they are destabilising the entire hospital system. He blames the inability of the NHS to withstand surplus capacity, and claims that it is leading to a failure in plurality of provision. I shall press the Minister separately on that issue, but if he voices his thoughts at this stage, we might avoid correspondence of the protracted sort that we are currently having on NPfIT.</p>
	<p>I finish, Mr. Deputy Chairman, with a few quick questions, and I would be grateful if the Minister could address them. NHS trusts are facing substantial deficits because of the sheer number of demands placed on them by the Government. Given his recent remarks about closure, would the Secretary of State consider hospitals in those trusts to be failing? Many of them are clinically excellent, and I offer the example of my very own Royal United hospital, Bath.</p>
	<p>References to the choice agenda readily fall from the Ministers' lips, but that agenda is not appreciated by a sizeable portion of their own party, including ex-Health Secretaries. How will the Secretary of State deal with such people? That is not really any of my business; I am just interested to know.</p>
	<p>Finally, the Government's idea of choice is restricted to a list of four or five hospitals, chosen by PCTs. Why will they not give that choice directly to patients and their GPs? Why is it restricted to bricks and mortar, and not extended to individual specialists and options for the range of treatment?</p>

	<p>I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor) on allowing us to have this important debate about choice and what it means. I congratulate all hon. Members who have made a contribution, because they have all raised perfectly fair and reasonable points.</p>
	<p>As I listened to the debate, I was struck by the fact that, with one or two exceptions, most comments were confined to the issue of choice over routine operations or elective procedures. In recent years, the Government have rightly taken an important step forward on the issue by giving patients more choice over routine operations, and I shall obviously want to speak extensively about that.</p>
	<p>However, the concept of patient choice goes much wider than simply access to routine operations. One should remember that 90 per cent. of all patient journeys in the NHS begin and end in a GP's surgery and that, fortunately, only a small minority of NHS patients need the services of a surgeon or specialist in an acute set-up. When we talk about choice, therefore, it is important that we try not to confine ourselves to the choice of hospitals, and the Government have certainly done that. Hospitals are only the tip of the iceberg, and we need a concept that goes beyond simply providing more choice about operations.</p>
	<p>For example, it is important for primary care patients to have more choice, and we can deal with the issue in several ways. NHS Direct has been an important additional service for NHS patients; it is widely used, it is making a significant difference and it is saving patients' lives. Of course, there are people who criticise it, and I understand that. Most NHS services are criticised at the beginning for a variety of reasons: people do not like them and are not familiar with them. However, NHS Direct has proven its worth day after day because of the outstanding work that the nurses do in providing medical advice to patients who ring up. As we approach the elections&mdash;I am sure that we are all looking forward to them&mdash;we shall all want to look carefully at what the parties are saying about the future of NHS Direct. The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr.   Murrison) said, quite fairly, that he had some questions for me, and we shall be asking him and his parliamentary colleagues about some of these issues.</p>
	<p>On primary care, the walk-in centres have proved to be very useful. My daughter recently used one, and I have nothing but praise and tributes for the staff who run them, because they do a very good job. We shall shortly be expanding walk-in centres into new territory. There will be several GP-led commuter walk-in centres at some of England's largest transport hubs, bringing our services closer to where patients are. Commuters, in particular, are bound to experience serious issues in trying to access the services of their family doctor, because many of them get up early and come home late, and most of the surgeries will, sadly, be shut by the time they return home. So, we have to find a better way of taking our services to where the patients are, and commuter walk-in centres will be one way of doing that.</p>
	<p>Another area in which we need greater choice is patient access to medication, and that could be at several different levels. For example, there is the issue of getting repeat prescriptions. By common consent, the process has been far too bureaucratic, and we have found some important ways through that bureaucracy. Improvements could, for example, also mean access to medications over the counter, on which we are making progress. We are the only country in the European Union in which patients obtain access to some of the new anti-cholesterol drugs, the so-called statin group, over the counter. That, too, is important. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton), has been making progress with proposals for freeing up some of the restrictions on the location of new pharmacies.</p>
	<p>Those are two important spheres of activity in which a flourishing debate about choice is needed, and there are others that hon. Members have raised today. One of those is maternity services, which the hon. Member for Wyre Forest raised in connection with his constituency, and another is mental health, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Westbury.</p>
	<p>I agree that mental health is an area in which it is important for us to take a critical look at ways of expanding patient choice. The hon. Gentleman will probably know that the National Institute for Mental Health in England is considering, with patient organisations and groups, ways of expanding patient choice in mental health. Certainly, patients have been telling us that they want a greater range of choices about the services to which they gain access during times of illness and recovery. That is right and proper and I understand that the Department will, later in the year, publish a mental health discussion document on how we implement choice in local communities. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House will look forward to that publication.</p>
	<p>The focus of our discussion today has been choice over routine operations, and it has been quite an interesting debate. I am sorry that my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor) is not here, because I received a strong sense from him that he was not an advocate of patient choice or any of the reforms that the Labour Government have implemented, even though they were all in our manifesto. However, that is a debate for another occasion.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Wyre Forest began his remarks by describing a golden age in the NHS. There are only one or two people who can ever remember things happening in the manner of such descriptions; it has certainly not been my experience in 50 years of using the NHS that there was ever a golden age when I could see my GP and be bundled off on a train to see a specialist in Cheltenham, Birmingham, Manchester or somewhere else. On the occasions when I have needed to see a specialist I do not remember being given any choice.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman finished his remarks by saying that we should not be attending to that matter now&mdash;that there were other things to get on with and that choice was a longer-term aspiration rather than a short-term priority. I take issue with him about that fundamentally; he is wrong to say that we must make a choice between developing minimum standards and the higher quality care that he argues&mdash;and I agree&mdash;is essential, and providing greater patient choice. I consider the latter an equal priority. To think that we can achieve only one, at the expense of the other, is to make a false dichotomy.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris) made a characteristic good cop-bad cop speech, but seemed, on balance, to be in favour of choice, although I think that he wanted to reserve his position on the matter as far as possible. I do not have the energy today to make any cheap, below-the-belt remarks about the Liberal Democrats. However, it is striking that although one would expect that party, of all the political parties on the British political scene, to be in favour of choice, the hon. Gentleman has, in much of health policy, allowed it to be captured by a group of vested interests who are not in favour of reform at all. In the House of Commons in particular there has been a series of flip-flops from the Liberal Democrats about whether they are in favour of or against treatment centres, payment by results, or choice. There will come a time when they have to make up their mind about where they stand on the issues.</p>

	<p>I do not want to make cheap political points either, but does the Minister recall the famous remarks of the hon. Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton) in which she appeared to condemn foundation hospitals in this place while praising them to the skies in her constituency?</p>

	<p>I am used to the Minister attacking me in my presence or absence, but when it comes to attacking my hon. Friend the Member for Cheadle (Mrs. Calton) in her absence, I should explain, if only to the hon. Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison), that the problem that faces him and us in this place&mdash;it is the same in local government with the private finance initiative&mdash;is that you can disagree with the policy nationally, but once it goes through the House and is the only game in town locally, there is the question of whether you support your local community or local council in seeking to achieve the best for people locally, even through the perverted scheme that has been imposed by the Government. That is simply realistic. The hon. Gentleman can live in an ideological bubble rather than in the real world, and can imagine that there is no Labour Government doing these things, but practical politicians must recognise that Government policy imposes choices on us.</p>

	<p>I do not want to be involved either, Mr.   Deputy Speaker. Both hon. Gentlemen should conduct their exchange properly outside the Chamber.</p>
	<p>The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made several observations about some of the reforms.   At one point, he described practice-based commissioning as GP fundholding. It is certainly not that for three essential reasons: no price negotiation is involved in practice-based commissioning because we have a single national tariff; no additional bureaucracy or transactional costs are associated with it, because the primary care trusts will be responsible for the contracting process; and, most importantly, practices that take on the responsibility of practice-based commissioning will not have the additional top-up resources that GP fundholding had. GP fundholding was a genuine two-tier system in which some practices gained at the expense of others. No one will do that under practice-based commissioning. To set the record straight on practice-based commissioning, the Government committed themselves to it back in 1998, under the wise leadership of my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson), in our very first White Paper.</p>
	<p>On the subject of community matrons, UnitedHealthcare does not employ any community nurses; they are all employed by the national health service. The hon. Gentleman also referred to suggestions on how we should conduct our general election campaign, but I am sure that he will not want me to take any of them up.</p>
	<p>We talked extensively about the ideology of choice. For me, choice is not so much an ideology as the right thing to do in principle, so I agree with the hon. Member for Westbury on that point. Many of us may have been struck by the words of Terence Leahy, who spoke at last weekend's debate, which was sponsored by <i>The Guardian</i>, on the future of public services. He said:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;The ability to make a choice gives you power in your life. They may be small choices but they can add up to a sense of control and purpose. People draw tremendous self-esteem from being asked to choose&mdash;from being trusted.&quot;</p>
	<p>That is absolutely right, and puts the essential argument very effectively for choice in the public services. Choice puts patients in the driving seat, and it requires providers to respond to the preferences of patients or public services users. It can also help to drive up quality and equity in access as well as the overall efficiency of the service. Those are very important objectives for the Labour Government. We do believe that choice can support equity in access and outcomes, and not destabilise them. I shall return to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p>A point that may have escaped the hon. Members who expressed their concerns about choice is that we know that it is what patients want. Many right hon. and hon. Members often say that patients do not want choice, but the best way of finding out whether patients want choice is to ask them. That is precisely what we have done, but the hon. Members for Wyre Forest and for Oxford, West and Abingdon seem to have no recollection of the two years of experience of the coronary heart disease pilot on choice, the London pilot on choice and the work that we have done in the area of cataracts.</p>
	<p>The number of patients who exercised the right to move to a different provider was very high. The figures are available on the record, so I shall not go into them today. We know from MORI poll surveys, the work of the Picker institute and many other respectable, bona fide organisations that patients want choice. Why should they not want choice? It is a defining characteristic of citizenship in a modern society. We have often characterised choice in this place as the ability to elect the Government. Well, fine. That is obviously a crucial plank of an effective democracy.</p>
	<p>However, matters go much wider and deeper than that. In every other sphere of our life, we, as informed consumers and citizens, expect to be provided with choice. Why therefore, when it comes to the public services, is there a desperate poverty of ambition that leads us to say, &quot;No, we cannot have choice. It is too complicated. The patients will be confused. The services might be destabilised. Let us do what we have done for 50 years and tell people where to go to get their treatment.&quot;</p>
	<p>As a social democrat&mdash;someone who believes in the value of public services&mdash;I do not accept that we can possibly build and sustain support in this country for public services if we believe that we must direct patients to certain types of providers, give them no choice about what they can receive and give them no control over what happens to them. We must challenge that system and giving patients choice does precisely that.</p>
	<p>Another matter has been completely missing from the debate. We have talked about choice as though it were something new in health care in the United Kingdom. It is not. Leaving aside the argument about whether it has been in the NHS before, we know that, since the beginning of the NHS, some patients have had choice and they are the people who can afford to go private. Yet, here we are&mdash;a group of Members of Parliament who claim to support the public services and the NHS&mdash;saying that there should not be choice in the public sector, but that it is all right to have choice if people can afford to have better quality care or faster treatment in the private sector. It is impossible to imagine anything less equitable than tolerating that gulf in which personal wealth determines personal health. That is completely unacceptable. I say without hesitation that it is right in principle and right in practice for us to look at how we can extend choice to the national health service.</p>
	<p>Choice should not be confined to the few who have money. That is how things used to be. It should in future be extended to those who have need. That is a powerful message of reform. If we leave aside the argument about choice&mdash;there is an argument to be had about whether it is a good or a bad thing&mdash;we must understand choice in the operational sense.</p>
	<p>What are the crucial elements in the debate about extending choice in the national health service? There are three essential pillars to expanding choice. First and most obviously, additional investment must be put into the health service because the second crucial element is extended capacity, so that we can allow real contestabililty between providers and give patients the real option of going elsewhere if their local provider cannot accommodate their requirements. Finally, as the hon. Member for Westbury drew attention to, we must give powerful, effective and timely information to patients and clinicians so that they can make informed choices about precisely where to go to receive treatment.</p>
	<p>It is important that the three essential pillars of capacity, information and investment are all in place and lined up to support choice, which is why I take issue with the proposals of the hon. Gentleman and the Conservative party that we can have unlimited choice by the end of the year. We cannot do that because the necessary capacity will not be in place to make those choices effective. We could do that if we wanted to extend waiting times. I do not think that that is quite what the hon. Gentleman had in mind, but there is no short cut. We need capacity to exercise unlimited choice and the capacity will not be there if we want waiting times to be kept to a minimum.</p>
	<p>The other problem with the hon. Gentleman's policies is investment. I do not want to argue about the James report and associated aspects. There will be a time and a place for that during the next few weeks. However, one aspect of the hon. Gentleman's policies is inescapable: if he wants to take &pound;1.2 billion away from the NHS and use it as a subsidy for patients who can afford private medical treatment and want to go outside the NHS commissioning arrangements with the private sector so that they are willing to pay any price for operations in the private sector, that would take &pound;4 million a year from every primary care trust in the country to use as an effective subsidy for private medical insurance. It would be the equivalent of taking &pound;20 million from NHS patients in the hon. Gentleman's constituency to subsidise the cost of private operations for the rich. It is impossible to imagine how capacity plans, which are essential to allowing choice for the NHS&mdash;in other words, for the many&mdash;are to be met if money is taken away to subsidise the private medical insurance schemes of the well-off. That is a subject for future debate, and I look forward to it, but the hon. Gentleman has not a cat in hell's chance of winning it.</p>
	<p>I looked at the Conservative party's website today&mdash;I look at it whenever I want to cheer myself up&mdash;and it shows the party's five priorities for the NHS. Strangely, there is not a single mention of the patient's passport. I wonder why. It is the Tory health policy that dare not speak its name. However, others are prepared to do it for them. We will certainly be talking about the patient's passport and how it comprehensively undermines the Tory party's bogus rhetoric on its commitment to the national health service.</p>

	<p>That was great rhetoric from the Minister. I look at the Labour party website, if only to see the latest iteration of the various posters. It is fascinating, and it seems to change daily.</p>
	<p>I take the Minister back a couple of moments to choose and book. Does he share the view of the National Audit Office that, to use his words, there is not a cat in hell's chance of choose and book being up and running by the end of this year, as previously envisaged by the Secretary of State?</p>

	<p>That certainly was not the view of the National Audit Office, but I shall speak about the NAO report and choose and book in a moment.</p>
	<p>Capacity, information and investment are the three essential pillars needed to construct a policy of choice for routine operations for NHS patients. They would all be compromised by the hon. Gentleman's proposals.</p>
	<p>A number of essential operational mechanisms are also important. One is payment by results, which we have discussed extensively today. To those who follow the history of such things, it is interesting to discover, as I did recently, that back in 1950s Aneurin Bevan advocated payment by results as the right way to fund the NHS. It has taken us 55 years to get round to doing it. We shall start this year for routine operations and elective procedures. It is the right place to start, because that is when choice in the context that we have been using the word today is most likely to have an impact.</p>
	<p>We have only touched the surface of the matter today, but choice needs to be supported. The hon. Member for Wyre Forest was right to raise the risk of overcapacity in the NHS. Incidentally, it is equally likely that all the extra capacity in the NHS will be used, which will pose a threat to NHS budgets. There are two risks&mdash;overcapacity and the overuse of capacity. That is why it is essential that we have effective practice-based commissioning alongside payment by results as an effective way for GPs in primary care to influence how resources are used.</p>
	<p>Secondly, we need to use IT to the best of our ability to support patient choice. The choices that we are talking about are incapable of being properly activated or used unless GPs and patients have access to waiting times data, clinical quality data and so on. That is the information database that choose and book will eventually support.</p>

	<p>I did not mention my concern that choice has to be informed. Does the Minister think that the quality of data on outcomes available now is adequate&mdash;it is reproduced by Dr. Foster in his league tables of death rates, without patient stratification&mdash;or does he regret the fact that some of the better units and the better surgeons are often at the bottom because they treat sicker patients? Is that good information, or is it worthless?</p>

	<p>It confirms how difficult it is to portray the information sensibly. We have a large amount of data in the NHS. Every day, we collect information by the barrel load&mdash;about the clinical outcomes for surgical teams, surgeons and hospitals. It is often difficult to balance that raw data with the point rightly made by the hon. Gentleman. He referred earlier to concerns about access to specialist care; it is certainly true that in some of our specialist hospitals, which is where the more complex work inevitably tends to gravitate, surgeons often have to deal with the hardest cases. It is therefore not unreasonable to assume, on a like-for-like basis compared with surgeons doing less complex work, that their outcomes might look poorer. That would be a travesty of the real facts. That is why we are continuing to work with many medical organisations&mdash;the Society of Cardiothoracic Surgeons, for example, has led the way and I am grateful for what it has done&mdash;to enable us to present the information in a sensible, patient-friendly way.</p>

	Frenchay Hospital

	<p>To some extent, I sympathise with the Minister. I notice that she responded to another half hour Adjournment debate earlier on health services in Hartlepool. She has to be an authority on all these matters. However, as she was brought up in south Gloucestershire for at least part of her childhood&mdash;I think that I am right in saying that&mdash;Frenchay hospital will be if not of greater interest then at least of considerable interest to her.</p>
	<p>Frenchay hospital faces D-day on 14 March. On that day, the chairs and chief executives of the four primary care trusts serving Bristol, south Gloucestershire and north Somerset will gather, as will those of the two acute hospital trusts. Between them, they will decide where to go with the Bristol health services plan and, in particular, they will decide whether there will be a major acute hospital on the Frenchay site or on the Southmead site, perhaps with a community hospital on both sites.</p>
	<p>In preparation for the debate, I rang the chief executive of North Bristol NHS Trust last night and asked her what I could say about the stage that the trust's decision making had reached. She said that no decision had been made, that the trust board would meet later in the month and that it would have a special meeting at which the decision would be made. I respect what she told me, but the worst kept secret in Bristol and south Gloucestershire is that North Bristol NHS Trust wants to site the acute hospital at Southmead rather than at Frenchay.</p>
	<p>Thousands of my constituents and those of other hon. Members who represent south Gloucestershire are concerned that Frenchay hospital, a centre of excellence with a proud history, may be about to be &quot;downgraded&quot;, to use the jargon. I will not say that it will be closed, because in the most likely scenario there will still be a community hospital on that site. However, it looks as though 24-hour accident and emergency and specialist advanced acute services will go.</p>
	<p>I stress that it is not a question of the people of south Gloucestershire against the people of Bristol, because not only is North Bristol NHS Trust deciding what it wants to be its major site, but the Greater Bristol health community&mdash;to use those awful phrases&mdash;is deciding about provision over the whole area and has already decided that the Bristol Royal infirmary is a given. It is not a question of choosing between Frenchay or Southmead, but it is a matter of having the BRI plus one other.</p>
	<p>The concerns of the people of south Gloucestershire will not be adequately addressed if the answer to the question of where the two major acute hospitals would be is that both would be in Bristol and none in south Gloucestershire, when the needs of the people of Bristol will be properly met by a high-quality acute hospital in the centre of Bristol. The needs of the people of south Gloucestershire would be properly met by a high-quality acute hospital in south Gloucestershire on the Frenchay site.</p>
	<p>Although I disagree profoundly with the trust board and chief executive about their preference against the Frenchay site, I offer them some sympathy. The new chief executive has inherited a very large deficit, is in the process of trying to recover the organisation from a very messy financial situation and is dealing with payment by results, which is difficult for a relatively high-cost trust. It feels almost like permanent revolution in the health service so, to some extent, I sympathise with the pressures that the trust board and chief executive face.</p>

	<p>The hon. Gentleman knows that I agree that Frenchay should be the site of the new so-called super-hospital serving south Gloucestershire and north Bristol. However, does he accept the view of clinicians in the Bristol area, which is that it is right to concentrate specialist acute services on fewer major hospital sites, while community services are expanded at the same time?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.403.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1311" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="403"  time="15:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h04.htm#50208h04_spnew2">
	<p>The hon. Gentleman, who is my constituency neighbour, will be trying later to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. He makes an important point: the advice from clinicians is that the three major acute sites within the Greater Bristol and south Gloucestershire areas are proving difficult to sustain. One symptom of that has been the pulling back of the 24-hour accident and emergency service at Southmead; operating three full-time 24-hour accident and emergency sites with proper back-up was proving unsustainable. Although I am not convinced that the wider public fully accept that argument, it is clear that we are getting that message from the clinicians.</p>
	<p>I accept that many of these decisions are devolved to some extent. However, the money comes from central Government, the process will be signed up by central Government and central Government certainly has an interest in the consultation process.</p>
	<p>The background to D-day on 14 March is an almost endless round of engagements, public consultations, public meetings and so on. The public do not necessarily discern the difference between an engagement and a consultation, but they are different from each other, and have happened at different points in time. Last month, the Bristol health services plan published a consultation report on the help-us-to-decide process, running to no fewer than 153 pages. One could not say that there had not been a lot of public debate. However, interestingly and rather startlingly, I read in the report that just 351 written replies had been received. I have to say that that number is pathetic for a big local political issue.</p>
	<p>Public meetings were held that were attended by a total of 1,600 people, so the report is based on fewer than 2,000 responses. As those in the Chamber will know, just over a year ago, I delivered my own survey to every household in my constituency, to which I obtained more than 8,000 replies. It worries me that there were just 350 or so written replies to the Bristol health services plan consultation. On the basis of the 8,000 replies that I received, I have some authority to say what my constituents think. Very clearly, although they welcome the promise of additional community facilities, they do not think that that should be the quid pro quo for losing Frenchay; they are not in two minds about that.</p>
	<p>What is the answer to the following question? I am thinking of people in the outer reaches of my constituency, Chipping Sodbury and the Cotswold villages beyond. If serious and acute accident and emergency services are to go from Frenchay, how long would it take an ambulance in the rush hour to get from Hawkesbury Upton to Southmead? I am not convinced that the times are credible, although they would be if the ambulance were going to Frenchay. However, the people of Southmead, who obviously and understandably want an emergency unit near them, will still be far more accessible to the Bristol Royal infirmary. If we want to cover the whole area with high-quality accident and emergency access, I am not convinced that two in Bristol and none in south Gloucestershire is the answer.</p>
	<p>The primary care trust of south Gloucestershire did its own survey. Professional pollsters rang more than 650 people in south Gloucestershire, Bristol and north Somerset. What was astonishing was not that the people of south Gloucestershire overwhelmingly wanted Frenchay&mdash;I could have told the trust that for nothing; perhaps I shall take a cut next time&mdash;but that, on balance, the people of Bristol whom it rang wanted Frenchay as well, even though Southmead is in Bristol and Frenchay is not. This issue is not about Bristol against south Gloucestershire, but about how we can serve the needs of the whole area with what looks like being two acute hospitals, one of which is in Bristol in the middle. That is the question. Only the people of north Somerset marginally backed Southmead over Frenchay, although I assume that most of them would go into the centre of Bristol anyway so they would probably not care a huge amount.</p>
	<p>In researching this debate, I came across something that shocked me. The North Bristol NHS Trust population projection is that by 2020, which is only seven years into the life of the new hospital, the Bristol population of pensioners, who are the people who will mainly demand access to the services, will rise by 2.5 per cent. and the south Gloucestershire population of pensioners will rise by 50 per cent. In terms of the provision of acute, high-tech, full accident and emergency services, how can it possibly make sense to shut south Gloucestershire's only hospital when the vast majority of the growth in population pressures will be in south Gloucestershire?</p>
	<p>People advance many other arguments for the Frenchay site. The heliport is mentioned. It is not used often, but it is used. I do not know how people who need to be helicoptered in would cope with getting to Southmead, but I do not think that that would be practical. Many people feel that the environment of the Frenchay campus is more pleasant than Southmead. I should say that my children were born at Southmead and that my wife used to work there, so this is not about being anti-Southmead. I am simply saying that if there needs to be a major acute site to complement the BRI, there is much going for Frenchay.</p>
	<p>The accident and emergency department at Frenchay is currently being upgraded, because the Southmead department is being used less. How many millions of pounds is that costing, and is it just for a few years before it gets shut again? What is going on there?</p>
	<p>The North Bristol NHS Trust assumes that it will get permission to build thousands of houses at Frenchay; it will need to do that to make the sums add up. Will it get that permission? Bizarrely, it has merely taken a figure from the district auditor, but the council has not yet said for sure that the trust will get permission to build those houses. If that is what is needed to make the sums add up, and then the council comes back and says, &quot;Well, actually, no, you can only build half that number,&quot; will the decision have to be revisited? Should that not have been sorted out before the decision was taken, rather than afterwards?</p>
	<p>A second facet of this issue is the capacity of the new hospital, wherever it is. North Bristol NHS Trust, which covers Frenchay and Southmead, is struggling to cope. In 2002&ndash;03, 460 operations were cancelled; in 2003&ndash;04, more than 400 were cancelled; and, in the first half of this year, there have been nearly 400 cancellations. Since then, the Norwalk virus has hit both sites, and has caused considerable problems. They are stretched to the limit. I am sure that all hon. Members receive letters about operations being cancelled. I received one recently, in which a lady wrote that her husband's operation was cancelled ostensibly because a space was needed for an urgent case, but she subsequently discovered that the real reason was a shortage of beds. She said that the consultants and theatres were free, but there were no beds.</p>
	<p>I am concerned about what the capacity is now, but the grand plan for this acute hospital is not for more beds, but for fewer beds. The argument is that the demographics mean that another 100 beds would be needed, which seems low, but that length-of-stay improvements&mdash;getting people out quicker&mdash;will save 336 beds. If that can be delivered without prejudicing patient experiences, it sounds great. However, premising new hospital build on the assumption of such vast improvements greatly worries me, because what happens if they are not delivered? Therefore, I wonder whether this is credible.</p>
	<p>I will keep my remarks brief, as I want to leave a moment for my constituency neighbour, the hon. Member for Kingswood (Mr. Berry), to try to catch your eye, Mr. Deputy Speaker. People will lose faith in these consultation processes if they express overwhelming opinions and are ignored. The report of   the Bristol health services plan consultation for January 2005 stated that the views of the public, staff and other stakeholders count and will be taken into account. The people of south Gloucestershire have spoken loud and clear. If they are not listened to, that will make a sham of the entire consultation process. I hope that the Minister is able to ensure that they are listened to.</p>

	<p>Yes, but I shall be extremely brief.</p>
	<p>My constituents in Kingswood use all three of the acute hospitals in the Bristol area. They use Frenchay, which is the closest, and they also use Southmead and the BRI. The reason for that is that none of those hospitals covers the full range of acute services. Unfortunately, some of my constituents occasionally start at the BRI, then go to Southmead and end up at Frenchay.</p>
	<p>There is a powerful clinical argument for reducing the number of acute hospitals in Bristol. The hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb)&mdash;I almost called him my hon. Friend, and he is a friend&mdash;made that point. Far too much money has gone into buildings, and not enough has gone into direct provision of health care. I support that part of the Bristol health services plan that is committed to moving to two specialist acute hospitals with improved community facilities. I am completely unhappy about the Cossham proposal, but this is not the time to talk about that.</p>
	<p>The hon. Gentleman referred to the consultation exercise and the expressions of public opinion. The polling evidence suggests that 74 per cent. of people support the principle of having two acute hospitals in the area and improved community facilities. So three quarters of people support that principle, which means that one of the existing acute hospitals will become a community hospital and that we will be left with two acute hospitals.</p>
	<p>I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a majority of people have expressed support for Frenchay. I will say no more than I support strongly the arguments for Frenchay that he has expressed, but the last thing that I want is inaction on this plan. We must make progress, and the basic principle that was put forward in the Bristol health services plan in relation to acute hospitals is absolutely right. I am glad that all three hon. Members in the Chamber with a direct interest in this matter agree on that.</p>

	<p>I was brought up in south Avon for about 10 years, so I am certainly not bemused by it.</p>
	<p>I congratulate the hon. Member for Northavon (Mr. Webb) on securing this debate on the future of Frenchay hospital. I have listened to and appreciated the comments he has made today and I know how important the issue is to him and to my hon. Friends the Members for Kingswood (Mr. Berry) and for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith), who are both present. I had the opportunity to respond on this issue in March 2004 in an earlier debate. I should like briefly to pay tribute to all the staff in the local health economy, and I am sure hon. Members who are committed to the improvement of the NHS will join me in that.</p>
	<p>Some important questions are raised by this debate and they will, no doubt, be raised by the consultation exercise. There are also some important issues for the local communities to address. We need to look at what we are doing for the future and think about how the services can best be configured to meet the health needs of the population&mdash;not just now, but in future, too. That is difficult. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman agrees and that we all recognise that hospital and community services need to change if they are to continue to fulfil patients' needs and improve access. Services cannot remain static for ever; they need to be responsive to needs, and if they remain static they do not serve the future needs of the population, which means patients. Let us be clear that we are talking about patients and the services that they receive.</p>
	<p>This Government are committed to investment. There has been a large-scale investment in the South Gloucestershire primary care trust area, increasing from 6.6 per cent. to 7.2 per cent. between 2002&ndash;03 and 2005&ndash;06. That is a real-terms cash increase, leading to some &pound;50 million extra going into the health economy. We also believe in modernising things and personalising the offering of services by getting closer to patients. However, we also need to consider how the specialist services are delivered, because that is important. It is worthwhile saying that for some services people want to go only to a specialised centre. If someone were the victim of a terrible road traffic accident, for example, they would want to go to a place where all the specialised work could be done.</p>
	<p>I shall talk about local issues in a moment, and Frenchay hospital in particular, but we need to acknowledge the pressures and the fact that we have to increase the capacity and raise clinical standards, and that we need this radical re-examination. As I said when we debated the matter in March last year, the quality of the building stock at both the hospitals in north Bristol&mdash;Frenchay and Southmead&mdash;needs to be addressed. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will agree with that.</p>
	<p>There are two major hospitals, both with accident and emergency services, plus the Bristol Royal infirmary in the centre of Bristol. Those hospitals are between four and seven miles apart. I do not want to enter into the debate about distances, because that is something for the local health economy to weigh up, but even going from Hawkesbury Upton to Frenchay is quite a long stretch, if my memory serves me right. The distances for people in rural areas are always going to be further and the truth is that these hospitals are clustered in the Bristol area, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman agrees. The services are duplicated and fragmented across the two sites in the north Bristol trust and across Bristol as a whole. That hampers clinical excellence and hinders close working with primary and social care services. There is a debate to be had about what the hon. Gentleman did not mention, which is how we get services closer to people. Not all those services will be provided through hospitals; indeed, some are better provided not in a hospital, but more locally.</p>
	<p>The current situation means that there are difficulties, some of which the hon. Gentleman has mentioned, in complying with national standards for clinical services, particularly for emergency patients. I was interested to hear the remarks that my hon. Friend the Member for Kingswood made about patients being transferred, even for A and E, between the sites, including children, cancer patients, cardiac patients and those requiring specialist care.</p>
	<p>I trust that all hon. Members present agree that the status quo cannot remain and that more needs to be done. We have an opportunity to improve services, not spoil them. That way, the health and community services in the area can move forward into the 21st century, as we go to hospital only when we need to, rather than automatically in many instances, and the system is less focused on hospitals than in the past.</p>
	<p>I realise that some of those in the public debate, including patients, have not caught up with some of the changes where they have occurred. I know that from talking to people where a service that was previously provided in a district general hospital is now provided in a community setting. I saw an instance of that on a visit to Luton not very long ago. People are enormously welcoming of the fact that they now have a service for which they previously had to cross town, to go to the Luton and Dunstable hospital, but which is now provided in a walk-in centre in their neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p>Those are the sorts of things that offer scope for modernisation and change. Biggest is not always best. We need to recognise that patients want more, not fewer, local services. We need to focus on redesign, not only relocation. We are talking about a complex series of changes that can and do improve services for the patients. That is the only reason for the change: to get a better offering.</p>
	<p>Of course, centralising some services in larger hospitals works, but equally it is not always the answer, which depends on the service. The NHS needs to make innovative changes to open up access and widen patient choice. It needs to be able to deliver the care that patients need throughout communities when they need it. That opens up new roles and duties for staff and more options for change being discussed with patients.</p>
	<p>I noted the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the consultation with patients. I also note that he was not a formal respondee, unlike a number of hon. Members in the area, but he obviously conducted the survey. I also note that six different options are still being considered, so it is not the case that there is one simple preferred model or even a couple of preferred models. Rather, a range of options is being considered.</p>
	<p>As I mentioned, our policy is for PCTs to make such decisions with the local NHS trust and the strategic health authority. They must decide the NHS locally. I happen to be blessed with a limited amount of historical knowledge about the area in question. That is unusual, as Ministers do not always know and certainly Whitehall and Westminster are not where decisions about the configuration of such matters are best taken.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.408.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1311" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="408"  time="15:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h04.htm#50208h04_spnew7">
	<p>The Minister is very gracious to give way. I quite agree that the decision should be made locally. The Minister talked about patient choice, but does she not understand why, if large amounts of public money are spent on consultation and the patients in south Gloucestershire loudly shout one thing but the outcome is entirely different, they should be rather embittered and feel that they were never going to be listened to in the first place?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.408.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1000" speakername="Melanie Johnson" colnum="408"  time="15:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h04.htm#50208h04_spnew8">
	<p>If people are shouting for particular answers, as it were, not everybody is going to get what they want. There is bound to be an answer whereby some people are not satisfied with the outcome initially. Whether they would be dissatisfied with it in the longer term is another matter. I am sure that those who close to Frenchay are supporting Frenchay and those who are close to Southmead are supporting Southmead. That might mean that people in Filton are keener to go into Southmead and those in Yate or Thornbury are keen to support Frenchay. Obviously, those who are closer to the hospitals will want to support them in particular, and will feel a close identity with them.</p>
	<p>We need to step beyond that. That is why local knowledge and expertise is drawn in. The primary decision making is not at the centre, because it is not appropriate for Ministers to decide on the direction of travel in relation to how services should be configured, for the reasons I mentioned. We have made that very clear. It is right that the local NHS should do it. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will continue to work with the local NHS to build a better future for residents in his area.</p>
	<p>Whatever decisions are reached locally after full and public consultation will have been made after much consideration and open debate. The fact that a large number of members of the public have engaged in the formal consultation and in the hon. Gentleman's consultation indicates that people are alive to the issues, they are engaged with them and they want to have the debate.</p>
	<p>We do not always do ourselves the best service by simply making it an argument about individual sites, rather than considering the broad needs of the population and how responses to them are best configured. We do not always necessarily take the argument about the advantages of more community provision to people as powerfully as we might. Where I have seen that delivered on the ground, it has brought huge improvements. Patients are probably its strongest advocates. No matter who advocated it in the first place, patients are strong advocates when it happens on the ground.</p>
	<p>I hope hon. Members appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this case; there is to be a local process and I could pre-empt any future ministerial decision that might be necessary. I would like to assure hon. Members that the Department and Ministers will continue to work with the local NHS to review the progress of the local economy and to ensure that the difficulties that are faced continue to be managed.</p>
	<p>I want to emphasise that this is an opportunity for positive change. It is a time of huge investment in services. There are major advantages for everybody in the Bristol area in getting this right. There is a major opportunity for better hospital and community sectors to emerge from the process and for securing the services for the future.</p>

	<p>I would not want the Minister to think that it is simply a case of saying, &quot;I want the local hospital because it is nearest to me.&quot; Obviously, as she says, everyone will say that. I have tried to bring to the debate the demographic pressures on south Gloucestershire, to which she has not responded, and the complementarity with the one that has to be in Bristol anyway. Are those not substantive arguments and not merely a case of, &quot;I would like it in my back garden, please&quot;?</p>

	<p>Those arguments have been made and are being heard in the debate that is going on locally in the local health economy. I am sure that they are being registered. I am sure that there are other arguments, which the hon. Gentleman has not mentioned, that might cut in other directions. As I said, where change is being argued for, there will seldom be a result that everyone is happy with. However, we are clear about why this needs to happen and I think hon. Members are clear about the advantages of its proceeding.</p>
	<p>All of those involved in the local decision making and in the consultation need to work together to ensure that the outcome for patients in Bristol is an NHS that is fit for the 21st century. It must be geared up to respond to all the improvements and changes that the NHS is already experiencing. We will see more of them in the years to come.

	BBC Charter Renewal

	<p>I rise to raise some extremely important issues, both on a personal note and on behalf of constituents who have contacted me and many other MPs following the controversial screening of &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;The Opera&quot; on BBC 2 on Saturday 8 January. For me, the issue is programming and standards at the BBC. We should debate the matter now, prior to publication of the Government's Green Paper, which will set the context for the next, and most important, stage of the renewal of the BBC charter later this year. I do not want to knock the BBC or to compromise its integrity, but I wish to put on record concerns that have been expressed by my constituents, and by other people around the country, who have been offended or upset by BBC2 management's decision to allow that programme to be televised.</p>

	<p>Accepting that the hon. Gentleman will probably give specific examples, can I raise at this early stage a principle on which I should be grateful for his perspective? Surely the BBC, as a public service broadcaster, has a duty to challenge&mdash;at least occasionally&mdash;what has traditionally been broadcast on television, especially given that nobody was forced to watch the Jerry Springer programme. Would he accept the school of thought that holds that such challenging programming is useful, not least because it prompts the kind of debate that we are having?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.411.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1059" speakername="Iain Luke" colnum="411"  time="15:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h05.htm#50208h05_spnew2">
	<p>I understand the hon. Gentleman's concerns, but we must address the issue. Everybody who watches television pays a licence fee, and those who have been upset have as much right to have their views aired in Parliament as those who are not offended. I am raising the matter for debate because the Green Paper, which will be available next month, will set the context for the debate, and the issues will come into sharper focus as that debate progresses.</p>
	<p>Those who have contacted me have a simple point: given that we are all licence payers, should not the views of the majority, common good taste and religious beliefs be considered when decisions are taken to screen such a show? Following the screening, on 13 January, I put a question to the Leader of the House, asking him to make the standard of programming at the BBC part of the charter renewal programme. His response was dismissive. He indicated that it was solely a matter for the BBC and that Ministers should not be interested or involved in the content of programmes. That response disappointed me. It also disappointed my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor), who, in a subsequent question that day, asked an additional question about further debate or discussion of the matter.</p>
	<p>Let me say straight away that I am a strong supporter of public sector broadcasting, and an active member of the all-party BBC group. Last night, we attended a reception held by BBC Northern Ireland. I am also a member of the Select Committee on Northern Ireland Affairs. I am very interested in the variety of attitudes to programming that can be found across the United Kingdom. I continue to believe that licence fees are the best way of funding the BBC.</p>
	<p>It would be wrong, indeed dishonest, of me not to indicate that the screening of the show has raised doubts in my mind, and in the minds of constituents who have contacted me. They have raised the point, which was reiterated by my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, that they hope that it is not a trend under a new chairman of adopting the lowest common approach to improving ratings. I raise the issue in that context, in the belief that parliamentarians have a responsibility to make their views known, especially on issues as important as public service broadcasting at the time of the 10-year charter renewal of the BBC.</p>
	<p>I hope that, in responding to the debate, the Minister&mdash;whose responsibility is for sport rather than for the media&mdash;will make clear the Government's commitment to ensuring that standards at the BBC are maintained and not debased. In tandem with the debate, I have written to the controller of BBC2, Mr Roly Keating, making clear the views of all who have contacted me. They strongly object to their licence fees being used to give airtime to a programme that mocks their strongly held religious beliefs and is seen by many as an affront to good taste. In the letter, I also make the point that</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;as a public service broadcasting organisation, more attention and respect should be shown to these strongly held views, especially when the Corporation and BBC2 as in this instance take such divisive decisions that offend so many.&quot;</p>
	<p>The issue rumbles on. It is the subject of numerous official complaints&mdash;the largest number ever: something like 40,000&mdash;and a court action.</p>
	<p>I felt strongly enough to write in those terms, because I believe that the BBC got it badly wrong and blemished its aims to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot; and</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;to serve everyone and enrich people's lives&quot;</p>
	<p>and</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;to be the most creative, trusted organisation in the world&quot;.</p>
	<p>That is why we must take time, as we progress through this year of charter renewal, to reflect on how those laudable aims can be safeguarded and promoted.</p>
	<p>I believe that those points were acknowledged by Mr. Grade, the BBC's chairman, when he addressed a media conference in Oxford on 20 January. He highlighted the problems that I have raised today and pointed out that one of licence fee payers' strongest concerns is whether their money is being well spent. The response that I have had on this matter shows that many feel that it is not being well spent and that the BBC's core principles would be met by greatly increasing accountability to licence fee payers. In that context, unhappiness would be more strongly dealt with by a greater increase in accountability.</p>
	<p>In his speech, Mr. Grade outlined the core principles &mdash;</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;effective stewardship of public money; greatly increased accountability to licence fee payers; much sharper clarity of roles&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p>and balanced them against the need to retain editorial independence, which he says is a &quot;non-negotiable&quot; commodity. That puts the BBC board of governors in the highly sensitive position of having the ultimate say on what is acceptable and fit to be screened, whatever the licence fee payer feels. Such arbitrary decisions should be considered more closely. There should be more discussion on that in the Green Paper and, perhaps, more criteria against which the BBC should operate its programming.</p>
	<p>The real litmus test that should be applied when taking screening decisions are those set out in the December report of the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, &quot;A Public BBC&quot;. At page 48, paragraph 197, it states that the BBC's annual report should</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;include a clear statement of what it needs to do to fulfil its public service remit, providing added value compared to other broadcasters.&quot;</p>
	<p>That theme was developed by the BBC in its contribution to the charter renewal process debate, which is entitled, &quot;Building public value&quot;, which was published in June, in which it defines its key role as aiming to &quot;maximise public value&quot; to broadcasting, and voices its hopes that that will become the touchstone for all its services and activities. My constituents' view would be that &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;The Opera&quot; fails to fulfil either of those criteria: it neither provides added value in comparison to other broadcasters, nor maximises public values.</p>
	<p>I agree with the recommendations in the Select Committee report, which looks forward to the charter renewal process. Recommendation 37 is that the improvement of accountability will be a crucial test for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in its detailed proposals for its prospective Green Paper. It may also be a vital question for the future of public service broadcasting and the BBC's monopoly over the licence fee.</p>
	<p>As I said, I was yesterday at the presentation of research put on by BBC Northern Ireland. It contains an article by Raymond Snoddy, the media editor of <i>The Times</i>, in which he sets out his perspective:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Over the next two years the main debate will centre on how big the BBC should be in future and how much money it should receive from the licence fee. It is, however, extremely unlikely that the present funding mechanism will survive in exactly its present form.&quot;</p>
	<p>If the BBC decides to promote such programmes more regularly, more and more people will question the need for monopoly of the licence fee by the BBC.</p>
	<p>I have made it clear that I do not support that argument. The BBC should be funded solely by the licence fee, but it is an issue that must be addressed. We have talked about the goals of the BBC, about an inclusive attitude towards the programmes that it produces and about being creative and trusted. We must remember that if such programmes continue to be screened, the trusted and valued position that the BBC has in our society may be questioned.</p>
	<p>As I was reading through the publication, I came across a small quotation on the back page&mdash;a final statement by BBC Northern Ireland about how it sees the role of the BBC. It is a small extract from one of Philip Larkin's poems:</p>
	<p class="indent">&quot;Reaching for the world, as our lives do,</p>
	<p class="indent">As all lives do, reaching that we may give</p>
	<p class="indent">The best of what we are and hold as true:</p>
	<p class="indent">Always it is by bridges that we live.&quot;</p>
	<p>If we are reaching the best of what we are, many people would think that &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;The Opera&quot; perhaps did not reach that ideal.</p>
	<p>I shall be glad to hear what the Minister has to say. I am not here to knock the BBC; I am very supportive of it. However, there is a need for a debate on this particular issue.</p>

	<p>I apologise to the hon. Gentleman and to the Minister for not giving notice, and I am grateful for their willingness to let me speak.</p>
	<p>I wanted to make a few observations that require no response today. It would be inappropriate for me to ask that much under the circumstances. I am one of those people who has taken a great interest in the transmission of &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;The Opera&quot;, of which I admit I watched only a part. The hon. Gentleman has eloquently and clearly described the concern of many thousands of people. My perspective is in line with my view about public service broadcasting and the BBC itself. I agree that many people found the opera offensive, and others felt it inappropriate for the BBC to broadcast something of that nature. I take a different view. First, it is indeed appropriate for the BBC sometimes to push the envelope of what is broadcast. If it had not, I am not clear about who would have taken the initiative.</p>
	<p>Secondly, it is important to allow the BBC what the hon. Gentleman alluded to: editorial freedom to make judgments about what is and is not acceptable for broadcast. One must be careful about binding decisions to the criterion of taste. If the programme had caused harm, or incited racial hatred or something of that nature, there would have been a powerful case to prevent its transmission. In my view, the broadcast did not do that.</p>
	<p>Thirdly, even accepting and respecting the hon. Gentleman's sincere concerns&mdash;I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to them&mdash;we must be careful to protect the freedom and liberty of the BBC to make such editorial judgments on its own initiative. One could argue that people fiercely opposed to religion may find some religious programming offensive, but it would be unreasonable to use that as a basis to ban such broadcasts.</p>
	<p>This is an important consideration. To the BBC's credit, its broadcasting of the programme has caused us to revisit the extent to which the BBC should be at liberty to broadcast such programmes. I support its right to broadcast such items as long as it does so with deep consideration of the potential consequences. I look forward to hearing the Minister's perspective on this valid and important subject.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.414.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/774" speakername="Richard Caborn" speakeroffice="The Minister for Sport and Tourism"  colnum="414"  time="16:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h05.htm#50208h05_spmin0">
	<p>May I first congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke) on securing this debate and on the objective and fair way that he presented a case that he passionately believes in and which represents the views of many of his constituents? I also congratulate him on the way that he defended the BBC, even though he might disagree with it over this particular show. The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik) had a different opinion and put forward his case well.</p>
	<p>The debate comes at an opportune time. As my hon. Friend said, we will shortly be publishing the Green Paper on the review of the BBC's royal charter. It will be the result of an extensive round of public and industry consultation. More than ever before, licence fee payers have had a say in the review of the BBC's charter and in the future of the corporation&mdash;the keystone of public service broadcasting in this country. The review process has been conducted openly and has benefited from our transparent and constructive relationship with the BBC. The Green Paper is not the end of the story. We want to hear what the public and industry will have to say about the issues raised in it, and there will be opportunities for wider debate, including in both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p>Since the start of the charter review process, we have been guided by three key objectives, which I hope will reassure my hon. Friend that we consider the interests of licence fee payers to be the absolute top priority. Those objectives are: a strong BBC committed to the highest quality programming and independent of Government and commercial pressures; a BBC with an unprecedented clarity of purpose; and a genuine sense that the BBC is owned by and accountable to the people who pay for it.</p>
	<p>Our research has shown that the BBC is not only trusted, but much loved by the general public, who consider it to be the cornerstone of public service broadcasting. The BBC should be stable and strong, but flexible enough to adapt to the post-digital switchover world. It should continue to be the main player in public service broadcasting, but it must also face competition. The Burns panel showed that there is no credible alternative to the licence fee immediately available to us, but we will keep that under review.</p>
	<p>All those demands place a considerable burden on the BBC's system of governance and regulation, and it is clear that the old structure is not adequate for the demands of a rapidly changing broadcasting environment. Indeed, I agree with the Secretary of State that the present system is unsustainable. For that reason, we welcome the recent publication of the final advice of the independent panel led by Terry Burns, which emphasises the importance of the separation of the governors' oversight and delivery functions. We also welcome the BBC's moves to reform governance from within, and its commitment to a more transparent, accountable and open system.</p>
	<p>Our task is to take the advice, along with the many public and industry opinions offered during consultation, and to ensure that, by the end of the charter review process, we have a governance system that is founded unequivocally in the public interest. That system will be based on the principles set out by the Secretary of State, building on the work done by Lord Burns.</p>
	<p>The BBC should consider a number of points. The system should be appropriate for an organisation built on creativity, and it should protect the independence of the BBC from Government but not from the licence-fee-paying shareholders. It should be genuinely open, transparent and objective, ensure appropriate accountability for public money, command public confidence and involve the public adequately in decision making, and provide adequate protection for those outside the corporation who might be affected by the BBC's activity&mdash;principally, although not exclusively, its private sector competitors.</p>
	<p>In conducting assessments of impact, the BBC should use criteria that would allow direct comparisons with the rest of the broadcasting market. It should be clear about the distinction between governance and regulation, and include arrangements that would support both. It should be clear about the respective roles of the executive and non-executive, and embody such clarity in ways of working. It should incorporate effective mechanisms for audit and complaint handling and be flexible enough to adapt to change in the wider broadcasting market. I suppose one could put that down to future-proofing.</p>
	<p>I assure my hon. Friend that the Green Paper will cover other issues that directly affect licence fee payers. In many cases, those issues were raised in the consultation and through our research as areas where the public would like the BBC to improve its performance. The first issue is spreading the benefits of the licence fee more fairly across the United Kingdom. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend will agree with that, coming, as he does, from one of the more northern parts of the UK. I do, as far as Yorkshire is concerned. Another issue is the provision of a structure to ensure that licence fee payers get maximum value for money, and to improve the BBC's ability to achieve high benchmarks in the service that it provides and ensure distinctiveness and innovation.</p>
	<p>Securing appropriate programme standards is a key part of the achievement of the high benchmarks that I mentioned in the BBC service. That brings me inevitably to the argument over the screening of &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;the Opera&quot;, in which I know my hon. Friend is particularly interested. The reaction from some viewers to the programme, which was broadcast on 8 January, highlighted the importance of a robust and transparent BBC system to ensure that programme standards are upheld. The Government believe that the system should sit within a framework that protects free speech and freedom of artistic expression.</p>
	<p>My hon. Friend may be aware that the Government received several complaints about the programme, many suggesting varying types of censorship. My response to those complaints is the same as that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and, indeed, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts. Some people have been offended by the programme, but that is what happens when we have free speech. I, and the Department collectively, believe that it is better to have free speech than to try to legislate against offending people.</p>
	<p>The broadcasting organisations that regulate broadcasting are responsible for programme content. The Office of Communications, the Welsh fourth channel authority, S4C, and the governors of the BBC all have regulatory roles and are independent of Government. In addition, the BBC's governing instrument, the royal charter and the agreement, place broad obligations on the corporation, including some on programme content and standards.</p>
	<p>Within that framework, the details of decisions on programme content and scheduling are matters entirely for the BBC, reflecting its editorial independence. As I have already said, the Government are committed to securing a strong BBC, independent of Government. I think that I have also shown that we believe it to be important that the BBC should be aware of the concerns of its viewers and listeners. It is the responsibility of the BBC governors to ensure that the corporation meets is obligations in the charter and agreements of 1996. Anyone who does not agree with the governors about programme standards can write to Michael Grade, its chairman. Licence fee payers can also complain to Ofcom on matters of taste and decency. I therefore assure my hon. Friend that the complaints procedure, and the mechanisms for upholding programme standards, will be considered as part of the charter review.</p>
	<p>As I have said, the Green Paper will be published soon. We welcome as much feedback as possible. This has so far been the most constructive charter review ever conducted, and we shall ensure that that continues.</p>
	<p class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-four minutes past Four o'clock.</p>
