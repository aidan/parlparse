	<p pid=".349.3/1">I am grateful to have secured this debate. I see that a number of hon. Members who represent various constituencies along the east coast are present; doubtless they wish to speak about their particular interest in the subject. I shall try to be reasonably succinct, so that they have a chance to take part.</p>
	<p pid=".349.3/2">I start by declaring my interest in the subject, not in a formal or financial sense, but as a regular user of the rail services on the east coast main line. I share that interest with many of my constituents, who use the line south to London and north to Aberdeen, Inverness and Glasgow. Like many of those constituents who have recently contacted me by email or letter, I am generally impressed by the quality of service offered by GNER, the current franchise operator. That fact certainly forms part of the background to a debate about the future of the franchise for the east coast main line.</p>
	<p pid=".349.3/3">Obviously, as with any operator, things can go wrong from time to time, and my experience of the line has not always been of the highest, but I have generally experienced a good service under the present operator. My starting point is therefore to say that I hope that the Strategic Rail Authority and the Department for Transport, in their respective roles in awarding a new franchise, will allow GNER to continue to operate it. I know that that view is shared by the nearly 50 hon. Members who signed the early-day motion on the subject tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase>. It is pretty unusual for MPs to support the continuation of a franchise in such a way. We normally see people demanding that franchises are removed. That is a reflection of the quality of the service provided by GNER.</p>

	<p pid=".350.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point about the integrity of the service. I know that he reads <i>The Scotsman</i> intently because it is produced in his home town, and he will have been upset by a report on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-08">8 October</phrase>&mdash;my birthday&mdash;that some of the proposed options include the possibility of longer journey times, unregulated non-core fares and replacement bus services. Many people along the line in the north-east of Scotland will see that as a clear threat to their direct services to London. Does my hon. Friend accept that such things should play no part in the final decision on who gets the franchise?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.351.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" speakername="Mark Lazarowicz" colnum="351"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew6">
	<p pid=".351.1/1">Indeed. The franchising process must see how maximum advantage can be gained from the franchise operator working with the Scottish Executive in the exercise of their responsibility for rail infrastructure north of Edinburgh, following additional powers being given to them recently by the Secretary of State for Transport. Journey times, particularly for trains going south from Edinburgh, certainly need to be shorter, but I fully accept the point about services northwards and westwards.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/2">Secondly, there needs to be greater integration between the mainline services and local rail and bus services. Integration is not as good as it could be, and work needs to be done to make the most of proper integrated transport services so that passengers can transfer from mainline express services to local services and make bus connections.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/3">There also needs to be more imaginative use of the timetable to provide links and direct services, not only along the main line from Aberdeen and Edinburgh southwards to London, but to other cities that can be served by the line. Services to Leeds could certainly be improved, and connections to cities such as Nottingham and Sheffield could be better integrated with the mainline services.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/4">Several constituents raised the issue of smoking carriages on the east coast service, which they do not believe to be conducive to their health. As has been pointed out, presumably the possibility of separate legislation in Scotland on smoking in public places will have to be considered, or there will be difficulties when the trains reach a spot 400 yds north of Berwick.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/5">It is essential that the franchise is for a long period, whichever company wins it. We cannot have the sort of two-year extension of the franchise that we had in the previous round, which would clearly create uncertainty for any operator. I understand that a franchise of up to 10 years is suggested. That is the sort of period that should be covered in the current round.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/6">Certain associated improvements to the infrastructure could be linked to any bid. During the previous franchise round, some major upgrades to the network were suggested as part of the bid. Obviously, upgrades to the network or anything else that is done in the right place in the right way would be very attractive to us all, but I would be concerned if part of the price of the final successful bid was to link the franchise to excessively complicated changes to the infrastructure. We have learnt from the experience of the west coast main line, and we should be wary of major improvements to the infrastructure on lines on which services are operating.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/7">It would be far better to return to the agenda the possibility of a north-south high-speed line. That is the way forward for the UK as a whole, and we need to pursue it. We need a 20-year vision for direct high-speed links from London to the north of England and to Scotland&mdash;the vision, and the links, that exist elsewhere in Europe. Such a network might make possible a three-hour journey from London to Edinburgh, and needs to be constructed in a way that does not cause disruption to existing services for an extensive period.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/8">I am pleased that the Secretary of State for Transport indicated in a speech last week at a conference that the issue of a north-south high-speed line is back on the agenda. I hope that he will take that idea forward, as such development is needed if there are to be real alternatives to air travel to Edinburgh and Glasgow, not to mention between Aberdeen, Dundee and London.</p>
	<p pid=".351.1/9">If the Treasury is to harvest more return from the new franchise, whichever operator it is granted to, what better way to recycle that extra income in its coffers than to use it to develop the first phases of a north-south high-speed line of the type that I have described?</p>

	<p pid=".354.1/1">Obviously, the Minister must make clear that in transferring powers to the Scottish Executive the Government should also transfer the resources that make those powers deliverable.</p>
	<p pid=".354.1/2">On a practical level, regardless of resources, I should like also to ensure that nothing in the franchising process undermines projects. The franchise regulations could establish standards for the service which, because of technical specifications, disrupt the ability to reopen stations. I would like some recognition that the reopening of Laurencekirk station is being encouraged and that nothing in the franchise will undermine that encouragement or the development of Crossrail.</p>

	<p pid=".359.3/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker. I will be very brief.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr. Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing the debate. He will know that I am passionate about this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/3">Many people have said that the options on offer are rail, car or air. Travelling from my constituency to London by car is a horrendous journey, and although we have an air service, which we value, it is not as frequent as we would like, so obviously rail still forms a major connection to the east coast of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/4">I secured two earlier debates on this subject. On 26 June 2002 there was a debate on the electrification of the line north of Edinburgh. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-09-16">16 September 2003</phrase> we had an Adjournment debate on investment in the east coast line. The awarding of the franchise is a vital issue in the service delivery that all constituents on the east coast deserve and want.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase>, who is very knowledgeable on the issue, made a vital comment about the current deliverer, which has kept its promise. That is reassuring. The touchstone for the successful franchisee must be a commitment to ensuring that the service is not reduced; indeed, I hope that it will be improved.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/6">Some comments have been made about the bidders for the east coast line and the determinants of the franchise; applicants have to put forward what they would call a high-return option. Many people believe that that would include fare rises and the replacement of poorly used services from stations up and down that line by buses. That is a prospect that fills many people, myself included, with horror.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" name="Robert Smith">The hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase> properly outlined the rail travel problems faced by communities in the north-east of Scotland. They can be resolved only by significant investment in the line north of Edinburgh. He, I, and others have pursued that through the Scottish Executive and Ministers here in Westminster. Since the SRA decided for investment purposes to downgrade the line north of Edinburgh it has been a major battle. However, it is one of the vital issues that must be addressed by the Government and the franchisee to ensure the provision of the services that should exist to serve the north-east of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/8">I hope that the Government take on board the need to keep services to the east coast of Scotland at their highest level. Hopefully, the successful bidder will also be committed to that.</p>
	<p pid=".359.3/9">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to say those few words. I hope that there will be a successful conclusion to the franchise bid which will serve the people up and down the main line well and give them the service that they deserve.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.361.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1280" speakername="John Thurso" colnum="361"  time="010:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew22">
	<p pid=".361.1/1">I hope that you will have a moment to get there before too long, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/2">My right hon. Friend is a regular user of the service from his constituency, and he has impressed on me the massive local support for GNER. That is rare; it is hard to think of a rail franchise or service that has enjoyed such support from its users. Exceptions might include Chiltern Railways or the Gatwick Express. It is an important point, and it must be taken into consideration. The early-day motion tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/719" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for City of York (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> is evidence that it has support not only from the public and passengers but from Members. I am unsure whether there has ever been an early-day motion in support of a franchise holder before, so that is rather special.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/3">My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed has intimated to me the considerable concern, particularly in the north-east but also in other areas served by the line, that the result of the current franchise letting will be a downgrading of the service, an increase in fares and a much worse service for the passengers. There are two key issues. The first is the franchise system and how it is applied with regard to this franchise. The second, customer satisfaction and the need to ensure that the product delivered to the customer is of value and quality, too often gets forgotten when we debate the railways.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/4">Let me start by setting out some of the things that GNER has achieved, because it might be considered a role model for other franchisees. Its first achievement is financial. It began with a Government subsidy of &pound;62 million a year. Not only has that been reduced to zero, but I understand that over the last three years it has paid some &pound;78 million back to the Government, and last year that sum was about &pound;22.5 million or &pound;25 million. The SRA's own survey reports that 85 per cent. of passengers are happy with the service, which is the highest satisfaction rate for any long distance operator.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/5">One of the things that impressed me most was that GNER has made investments of &pound;100 million in rebuilding trains, improving car parks, modernising stations and improving information for passengers. Too often the money that the passengers pay becomes profit or goes in rebates to the Government, and not much comes back in investment. A company that has invested is to be commended. That, possibly allied to the fact that there are some 22 per cent. more services, is why the passenger numbers have increased by 32 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/6">Another fact struck me. Many people say that GNER has a wonderful restaurant car, but it is simply a service for business men at the front end and takes no account of the ordinary traveller. However, GNER has standard-class tickets available that are cheaper than the standard off-peak fares that used to be offered by the BR Apex ticket. This is a provider that understands that a high-class service can be operated at one end of a vehicle and a cost-efficient or cheaper option at the other end.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/7">All in all, a great deal to do with this franchise is to be commended. If GNER can persuade the hon. Member for City of York to move from being against privatisation in principle to being a supporter of its securing the franchise, that is evidence of the good work that it has done. That is recognised by the petition and the early-day motion.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/8">I turn to the franchising system. We have just finished our consideration of the Railways Bill. In Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1174" name="John Pugh">the Member for Southport (Dr. Pugh)</phrase> and I tabled an amendment nicknamed &quot;the GNER amendment&quot;. That was slightly unkind because it was designed specifically not to help GNER, but to place an obligation on the new franchise system whereby passenger satisfaction and the quality of service delivered by an existing franchise holder must be taken into account when awarding a new franchise. Surprisingly and sadly, the Government chose not to accept the amendment, but I hope that, when they consider how the new system will work, such an important ingredient will be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/9">Part of our problem is that, at the moment, the franchising system is in limbo because we are in the dog days of the SRA. It knows that it will go soon, but the new system is not yet set up and running in the Department, so we are betwixt and between. A franchising system must clearly be about competition; otherwise there is no point in it. If all we had to do to achieve a new franchise was to deliver a good service, and that was automatically achieved, the system would not be working. It must be about competition not only for a particular franchise, but between different franchises.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/10">We then come to the matter of determining value, not cost. It is important to make known the difference between the cost of something and its value. As someone who has spent his life in the hospitality industry, I know that it is always easy to cut costs. We can slash the marketing budget or, the most common method, cut the training budget. Services can be reduced. In the case under discussion, a few people could be removed from stations and from the trains themselves. There comes a moment when however low the costs and however high the corresponding possibility of reducing fares or, as is more likely, giving more money to the Treasury, we will have destroyed the product that delivered the revenue in the first place. The Government or the SRA must therefore be careful; they must understand the difference between cost and value. They should not give in to the short-term desire to receive the maximum return, but know that nursing a customer base is about value and the long term.</p>
	<p pid=".361.1/11">One of the hon. Gentleman who spoke mentioned the wider value not only to the travelling public, but to the economy itself, especially tourism. I declare an interest in that I am still the president of the Tourism Society. When there are good transport links the value of tourism increases considerably; academic data supports that. I do not know whether other hon. Members with regular involvement in transport matters received the same email as I did from a gentleman in America a few days ago. He said that he had tried everything to find out how our railways worked and how he could book a train ticket. He said that the telephones were not answered and the website was down, and if someone somewhere did not answer his call he would go to France. I sent him an email to ask what trains he wanted and say that I would do my best for him, but I have not received an answer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.363.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1026" speakername="Greg Knight" colnum="363"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew27">
	<p pid=".363.4/1">Thank you, Mr. Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/2">I join other hon. Members in congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1038" name="Mark Lazarowicz">the hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith (Mr.   Lazarowicz)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and I congratulate all hon. Members who have taken part or intervened.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/3">The east coast rail franchise has been one of the biggest success stories of railway privatisation, and I join all hon. Members who have taken part in the debate in paying tribute to the way that GNER has operated the route. Even some of its critics have conceded that it provides a pretty good service. Today we are witnessing a unique occasion, because I cannot remember any other debate either here or in the main Chamber in which Members of all parties with little or nothing in common have spoken with one voice in praising a rail operating company.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/4">GNER has proved that the railways can operate successfully. It has combined the provision of a customer-focused, reliable and efficient service with profitability, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1280" name="John Thurso">the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase> said. In the past three years it has contributed &pound;78.2 million in revenue to the Government and turned a &pound;61.6 million subsidy in its first year into &pound;22.5 million of premium payments back to the Government in 2003&ndash;04, which, as the GNER press office is only too happy to tell us, represents the largest swing from subsidy to premium payments of any UK train operator since the railways were privatised. The fact that nearly 50 Members of the House from all parties signed early-day motion 536, which has been referred to, speaks for itself.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/5">Many people feel that there is a case for saying that in some circumstances there should be automatic franchise renewal for the most successful train operating companies. The Government should reflect on that, particularly where there is overwhelming public support and the train operator concerned has exceeded all expectations.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/6">A number of hon. Members referred to the SRA. The east coast main line is, perhaps, one of the last franchises to be re-awarded by the SRA. The abolition of the SRA is one of the few parts of the Railways Bill with which my party agrees, because over the four or so years that it has existed it has demonstrated itself to be rather a waste of time and money. When the SRA took over, the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising cost &pound;13 million and employed 187 people. The SRA costs &pound;102 million and employs 454 people. The cost and the number of people that it uses have grown and it has become less and less effective, so we are delighted to see it go.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/7">I am also delighted to see the SRA go because it has not, in the main, improved services. It has failed to give the railways adequate leadership and direction. Indeed, the reason the Government have given for getting rid of it is that they want to see more strategic leadership in someone else's hands. We welcome the fact that they have at last come round to the official Opposition's way of thinking on this issue.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/8">One difficulty for our railways is that franchisees lack the confidence to invest. How will the confidence of operating companies be improved, however, if power is merely passed upwards to the Secretary of State?</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/9">The refranchising process is certainly causing concern among passenger groups and communities served by the route. The leader of Edinburgh city council, Councillor Donald Anderson, has raised concerns that the new franchise may lead to a reduction in services. He said recently:</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/10" class="indent">&quot;Although the SRA has argued that the new East Coast Mainline franchise will maintain the number of trains between Edinburgh and London as operated at the start of the last franchise in 1996, our calculations indicate otherwise. The new franchise will reduce service levels during Monday to Friday to 18 trains per day.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/11">I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure the people of Edinburgh, and indeed Aberdeen and the other communities served by the east coast main line, that their services will not be reduced, but actually improved.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/12">I also have concerns about journey times, a point touched on by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1237" name="Robert Smith">the hon. Member for West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Sir Robert Smith)</phrase>. If the Government are serious about wanting people to travel to places in the north by rail, rather than by air or road, journey times must be as short as possible. Before the Hatfield disaster, the fastest service from King's Cross to Edinburgh was, I think, three hours and 50 minutes. Under the new franchise, it appears that the average journey time will be significantly longer, at four hours and 42 minutes. For those who travel on business, that makes a big difference, and I hope that the Minister can tell us what the Government intend to do to bring journey times back down to pre-Hatfield levels.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/13">For the railways to be successful, the train operating companies need to be encouraged to invest more in their routes. It is common business sense that they will do that only if they are confident that their investment is commercially justified. The best way to ensure that is to offer longer franchises. Graham Morton of the CBI agrees. Recently, he said:</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/14" class="indent">&quot;Franchises have been more successful where the operating company has had the scope to be entrepreneurial&mdash;Chiltern is probably the best example&mdash;and the franchise is sufficiently long for a reasonable payback on investment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/15">He has expressed concern that when the SRA's powers are transferred to the Department for Transport, the Government may not give companies enough freedom. He rightly questions whether the Department possesses the skills to design and deliver future franchises.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/16">The hon. Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith expressed his support for longer franchises, and I am pleased that he is joining the ranks of the Conservative party, if only on this narrow issue. Longer franchises will mean that the best train operating companies receive steady and predictable revenues.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/17">It is important to rid the network of political interference so that it can run itself without facing constant changes, as it has done since 1997; for example, the train operating companies should be given greater freedom over timetabling so that they can run extra services if they believe that there is demand. The network also needs investment directed at driving passenger growth where it is most needed, with an industry structure that is most able to respond to customer demand.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/18">Hon. Members may be aware of the submission that the Rail Passengers Council made to the SRA when the authority published the invitation to tender for the   franchise. Chief among the council's concerns was the poor quality of the stations on the line. The Conservative party has recently made a commitment to improve and develop railway stations so that more of them meet customer expectations. I hope that the Minister will respond on this issue, because passengers are increasingly concerned about the poor facilities, particularly at some stations. Will passengers concerns in that regard be taken into consideration when franchises are awarded? What extra effort will the Government make to ensure that our railway stations are improved?</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/19">It will not have escaped the Minister's attention that the east coast main line passes through the constituencies of some of the most influential Labour Members. I know that some very influential Members are here today, but the line passes also through the constituencies of the right hon. Members for Sedgefield (Mr. Blair), for Darlington (Mr. Milburn) and for Tyneside, North (Mr. Byers). I hope that they are not going to exert a sub rosa influence on the awarding of the franchise. It should be completely free of any behind-the-scenes party political interference. It would be wrong for the franchise to be awarded to a company because the head of that company liked to be seen hob-nobbing with new Labour Ministers. If the voice of the public carries any weight, as it should, the firm view, as expressed throughout this debate, is that GNER should be re-awarded the franchise.</p>
	<p pid=".363.4/20">This is an important debate. The line is vital to the economy, not only for much of the north of England but for Scotland. Whichever bidder takes over the franchise&mdash;I am not aware of any reason why the   present incumbent should not continue&mdash;I hope that the line continues to provide a high standard of service for passengers and to show others that our railways can operate in a way that is financially successful. We all look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.367.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/703" speakername="Charlotte Atkins" colnum="367"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h01.htm#50208h01_spnew30">
	<p pid=".367.0/1">I appreciate that, which is why the Government have invested hugely in the infrastructure, and why we are investing in the rail industry to the tune of about &pound;73 million a week.</p>
	<p pid=".367.0/2">I am delighted that hon. Members expressed not only their confidence in GNER but their real ambitions for future improvements to the east coast main line. It is essential that the franchise is operated by the company offering the very best service to the public, within the parameters of the franchise. We therefore have a duty to put the intercity east coast franchise out to tender. To do otherwise would remove the competitive pressure that helps to determine which company is best suited to providing services on the east coast main line. Competitive tendering is also necessary to ensure best value for taxpayers' money in the operation of the franchise.</p>
	<p pid=".367.0/3">Four parties have submitted bids for the east coast franchise. They are GNER; DSB, a consortium of Danish railways and EWS Railway; First London, Scottish and North-East Railways; and a consortium of Stagecoach Group plc and Virgin Group Investments Ltd. These parties have been chosen having pre-qualified under the SRA's set procedure. Bids for the operation of the franchise will be judged not only on price, but on commitments to performance, improving train and crew reliability, and operational viability. Contracts will also include clearly defined penalties should operators fail to fulfil their commitments. Each company's bid will be evaluated on its merits, and we will award the franchise to the bidder whom we feel best meets the criteria.</p>
	<p pid=".367.0/4">I should add that the new franchising system will take into account the relevant past performance of the company. That is part of the pre-qualification process. The franchise is being let in line with the franchising policy announced by the SRA in November 2002. That aims to deliver four broad objectives: to provide a safe and more reliable service of consistently high quality for the benefit of the passengers; to provide clarity of service specification so that the industry partners work together for passengers; to deliver a value-for-money service for passengers and taxpayers; and to secure accountable, viable operators who are passionate about delivering their service. I can assure hon. Members that the franchising process will not disrupt other developments on the line.</p>
	<p pid=".367.0/5">The model has passenger interests at its heart. The selection process is far more robust than in the past. We will focus in particular on how bidders deliver against their promises. Costs will be scrutinised, and franchise agreements will not be entered into unless the SRA is certain that the bid is viable.</p>
	<p pid=".367.0/6">The specification for the east coast franchise has been drawn up following consultation with statutory and non-statutory consultees. It protects services to Aberdeen and provides for a term of seven years, with a three-year extension if performance is consistent with contractual commitments. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh, North and Leith is reassured by that potential 10-year term, which he mentioned earlier. It provides a clear specification, including timetables, against which the bidders have been asked to base their proposals. To this end, base specification for the franchise sets out some clearly defined goals: to ensure that services continue to be operated safely; to demonstrate passion about the delivery of commitments; and to improve significantly the punctuality and reliability of services over the whole route. On journey times, the franchise includes a base case timetable, but the operator can add extra services and stops, so the journey time will largely be down to the successful bidder. Other goals are to provide services that are significantly more affordable to taxpayers and passengers alike by improving productivity and efficiency, or through innovation in operational or managerial practices; to improve integration with other modes of transport and other services; and to ensure the quality of the station and on-train environment, including improved accessibility.</p>
	<p pid=".367.0/7">The high&ndash;return option is designed to obtain ideas from experienced train operators about ways of improving returns from the franchise. It is not simply about cutting standards, but includes other options that would generate increased income by attracting more passengers to what will be a better service.</p>

	<p pid=".370.1/1">Electrification is continually being considered, but its advantages over other innovations are not as great as they were. That issue is, however, constantly kept under review.</p>
	<p pid=".370.1/2">The SRA is sponsoring the delivery of the new double track chord at Allington, scheduled for completion by the end of the year, which will help to improve the performance of the line. Other infrastructure enhancements are being considered through the east coast strategy that is being developed by the SRA. The strategy is currently under review, awaiting the outcomes of the rail White Paper. The document will also have to be reviewed following the selection of the successful applicant for the new intercity east coast franchise to ensure that it is consistent with the detail of the successful bid.</p>
	<p pid=".370.1/3">In conclusion, I hope that I have provided some assurance that the refranchising process is a positive one aimed at building on and improving the current service. The east coast main line is a vital route for the millions of passengers that it carries each year. Those passengers can look forward to a reliable and high-quality service for many years to come.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.371.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1362" speakername="Iain Wright" colnum="371"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h02.htm#50208h02_spnew0">
	<p pid=".371.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this Adjournment debate. I see the future of health in Hartlepool, alongside the town's economy fulfilling its potential and the putting in place of measures to eradicate crime and antisocial behaviour from our streets as the main improvements that I hope to achieve as the town's MP.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/2">Although the debate is about the future of health services in Hartlepool, I should like to spend a few moments outlining the broad historical trends in health in the town. I am a huge believer in the concept that we do not know where we are going unless we know where we are coming from. Hartlepool suffers greatly from its legacy as a centre for heavy manufacturing industry and from decades of economic decline. Industries such as the steelworks and the docks have left their mark with diseases such as asbestosis and respiratory illness. We, as a town, have suffered from decades of economic decline as the traditional industries have died. Unemployment has savaged the local population, which is only now beginning to recover.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/3">Although the past decade has real improvements in Hartlepool's economy, we are starting our renaissance from a very low base. Car ownership, a key barometer of economic prosperity, is low&mdash;40 per cent. of households in the town do not own a car, compared to 27 per cent. nationally. That should have, as I will show, a real bearing on where health services in the town are located. Despite recent improvements, we still have to contend with the health consequences of years of economic decline, poverty and social exclusion. This legacy means that Hartlepool people suffer more ill health and disability and higher death rates from cancer, heart disease and respiratory illness, and live shorter lives than people in most other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/4">The facts are stark: I received these figures only yesterday, in response to a written parliamentary question. Life expectancy for Hartlepool men is 73.4   years, against a national figure of 75.9 years, while Hartlepool women are expected to live 78.4 years, against a national average of 80.5 years. We also lead unhealthy lives. Forty per cent. of people in the town smoke, and we have more than the national average number of cases of obesity caused by poor diet and excessive drinking.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/5">The national health service is, arguably, the Labour party's greatest creation, and it has undoubtedly improved the health of people in Hartlepool. However, it is not improving as fast as that of people in other parts of the country, and health inequalities within the town remain profound. Half the people live in wards that are in the 5 per cent. most health deprived in the country. Stranton ward is 51st out of some 8,400 wards in the country for health deprivation and disability, while Elwick ward, the most affluent ward in the town, is still in the top 3,000 for poor health.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/6">We should also take into account demographic changes. The population of the town is ageing: the number of people aged over 75 is expected to increase by 25 per cent. in the next 15 years. That is aggravated by a sharp fall in the birth rate in Hartlepool. The number of births has dropped by almost a fifth in a decade, which has exacerbated the decline that was particularly pronounced between the late 1970s and early 1980s.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/7">This is the challenge for those who shape the future of health services in Hartlepool: a legacy of industrial decline and associated poverty; unhealthy lifestyles; high incidence of ill health; pronounced health inequalities; an ageing population and low birth rates, all of which result in profound pressure on health resources.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/8">Our health has not been helped by a chronic lack of investment for decades in primary health care in Hartlepool. The unwillingness or reluctance of successive Governments to invest in this crucial first call when somebody is ill or in the prevention of illness has led to an undeveloped primary care sector, which has to contend with the most difficult problems. The possibility of attracting more money elsewhere, and the generally poor quality of surgery buildings has meant that we suffer from an acute shortage of general practitioners. Hartlepool is in the bottom 10 areas of the country for numbers of GPs&mdash;we need about 12 more to reach the national average, and a similar increase in the number of community nurses. Meanwhile, GPs' average list size is 2,100, the highest in any PCT area in County Durham and the Tees valley.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/9">The problem exacerbates itself. High patient numbers lead to extra work and more stress for GPs, which accelerates their wish to retire early or to leave the town. An estate's audit in the town found that five of the 17 GP premises in Hartlepool are in poor condition, with only six meeting the criterion for satisfactory. There is an acute shortage of space in those surgeries, and that hinders their development and potential to offer a wider range of services. Most do not comply with the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/10">The acute shortage of community doctors over the years has led to an over-reliance on the local hospital. Hospitalisation rates far exceed the national average, and the hospital's accident and emergency service is stretched to its very limits as people use accident and emergency because they cannot get access to a local GP or community nurse. The number of accident and emergency attendances at Hartlepool hospital has increased by more than 9 per cent. in the past year alone.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/11">I have painted a dark picture, and I am not exaggerating. However, amid the gloom, there is real success. This Government have recognised the health problems caused by deprivation and invested heavily in the NHS. Funding year on year in cash terms for the NHS in Hartlepool since 1997 has been close to 10 per cent. The Government's commitment to providing health services as locally as possible strengthens the case that primary care in Hartlepool needs to be developed.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/12">Despite the massive resources invested in our health service by this Government, there is a strong case to say that we in Hartlepool remain underfunded. The primary care trust has a shortfall of some &pound;2 million a year from its targeted allocation; the NHS trust has a projected deficit of some &pound;6.5 million to overcome. I am grateful to this Government, and sincerely believe that no other Administration would have invested so heavily. However, I am in Parliament to stand up for the people of Hartlepool, and I believe that the Government need to provide substantial additional funding to both primary and acute care to tackle the decades of neglect in Hartlepool. Health professionals would not squander this money; there has been real success in recent years, as I shall mention shortly. Just think what could be achieved with appropriate funding.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/13">Foremost among the successes are the achievements of the local hospital. For the third year in succession, the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust has been given a three-star rating. That means that over a long period, it has consistently been one of the best performing trusts. Only 12 trusts in the country have received that accolade for three years.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/14">The University hospital of Hartlepool has been named among the top 40 hospitals in the country, and its clean-hospitals policy has meant that, unlike hospitals in other parts of the country, it does not suffer from accusations of being unclean or of suffering from germs. In fact, it is among the top 10 cleanest hospitals in the country. The &quot;general&quot;, as it is known locally, is genuinely thought of with pride and affection in the town.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/15">I know from personal experience what a marvellous asset it is. All my four children were born there. My eldest son's life was saved there when he was treated quickly for meningitis, and my youngest&mdash;only two months old at the time&mdash;was admitted last Boxing day, suffering from pneumonia and bronchiolitis. All that success is due to the tremendous commitment of staff of all grades at the hospital, which is ably led by Bryan Hanson, the trust's chairman. Their loyalty and commitment to health care for the town is arguably unchallenged throughout the entire country. That is why I think it understandable that the proposals led by the strategic health authority to downgrade or close the hospital have led to concern and alarm in the town.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/16">A dedicated campaign to save the hospital has been organised by John Bloom. John stood against me in the by-election, and I disagree with many of his policies. However, I do not doubt his sincerity and integrity on this matter. He, and others such as Peter Wolfe, have put this issue on the agenda and have not hijacked it, as others did, for short-term political gain.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/17">Let me make my position absolutely clear: I am adamantly opposed to the closure or downgrading of the hospital. In my vision for future health care for Hartlepool, I see the hospital as the major site for acute services between Sunderland and Middlesbrough. I see the hospital going from strength to strength and improving its capacity to provide all the services it provides today such as accident and emergency services, general medicine, surgery and neurology, orthopaedics, rheumatology, obstetrics, gynaecology and paediatrics.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/18">I have been greatly reassured by comments from the Secretary of State for Health and the Prime Minister that the hospital will be improved, not downgraded, and I see Professor Sir Ara Darzi's review as an opportunity to ensure that Hartlepool can realise its potential as a major health hub between the River Wear and the River Tees.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/19">I do not believe that the co-location of the Hartlepool and North Tees hospitals on to a greenfield site between the two towns will be conducive to effective health care. That would go against the Government's policy of ensuring that health care should be as local as possible, and would hinder the effective recovery of patients.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/20">As I mentioned earlier, my son Billy was ill during Christmas, and my wife and I took turns to stay with him. He was visited by his grandparents and by other relatives. We are fortunate that we have a car. Further anguish could have been caused to us, over and above the fact that our two-month-old son was seriously ill, had we relied on public transport to an out-of-town hospital over Christmas, while ensuring that our other three children were being appropriately cared for. As I said earlier, car ownership is low in Hartlepool. The ease with which family and friends can visit has an important bearing on the recovery of a patient. That ease can be achieved only by having the hospital firmly secured in the town.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/21">It is madness that where a town has an underdeveloped and relatively under-resourced primary care sector and a subsequent over-reliance on the three-star acute hospital, some senior bureaucrats wish to remove or to limit what the hospital does, against the wishes of the people. That is akin to a person having one healthy, muscular leg and the other one in plaster, and opting to amputate the healthy leg before the other one has healed&mdash;the person would soon fall over.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/22">That is not so say that I want the hospital, and everything that it does to be preserved in aspic&mdash;never to change. Clinical improvements mean that procedures that previously required a major operation and recuperation in hospital for many weeks can be done as day surgery. Developments such as triage in accident and emergency treatment have meant that more people are seen more quickly and with suitable prioritisation. I want that trend to continue, so that fewer people stay in hospital and that they do so for shorter periods and recuperate in the familiar, comfortable surroundings of their homes. That will mean that a faster turnover of patients can take place at the hospital, which will help to produce shorter waiting lists and greater capacity for acute care.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/23">I also want to mention the successes of Hartlepool primary care trust, because its objectives are a major vehicle with which to achieve my vision for health care in the future. It was formed only in 2001 and had initial managerial difficulties, but it has come a long way in a short period to reverse the lack of investment in primary care over the decades. The chairman, Professor Gerald Wistow, and the chief executive, Angela Hawkes, are putting in place the vision where people are treated as locally as possible, ill health is tackled and, as far as is possible, prevented, and state-of-the-art health buildings are located in all our estates and neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/24">The success of the PCT in a few years of existence is astonishing. In terms of smoking cessation, Hartlepool PCT's clinics have helped to produce a doubling in the number of successful quitters. Thanks to the PCT and its work in implementing its teenage pregnancy strategy, Hartlepool has enjoyed the biggest decrease in the under-18s conception rate in the north-east. Work is progressing to bring more GPs to the town, often from the international doctor market. Crucially, the PCT is investing, through the development of local improvement finance trust schemes, in new medical buildings in the heart of our estates in Owton, Rossmere, the town centre and on the headland.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/25">Those schemes are the foundation of the future of health in Hartlepool: 21st century neighbourhood health centres on each estate providing high-quality primary care and health advice to the local population, undertaking minor surgical procedures and being the first point of call for urgent cases, thereby relieving the pressure on the local hospital. For example, people in Owton go to their neighbourhood health centre for treatment rather than the accident and emergency department of the local hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/26">I am a passionate believer in the Government's policy of ensuring that health care is as local as possible. Given our historical health legacy, the PCT, in conjunction with the local strategic partnership, which I chair, understands Hartlepool's needs and is able to commission services to meet them. That is why I find it odd, and somewhat against Government thinking, that the local strategic health authority is pushing PCTs in its area to commit quickly to strategic commissioning, where commissioning for all Tees valley PCTs will be pooled under a Middlesbrough PCT. I am all for making savings and efficiencies through joint procurement of services, but there is a massive difference between procurement and commissioning. I cannot understand what possible benefit the people of Hartlepool will receive from allowing decisions about their health to be taken in Middlesbrough as opposed to in their own town.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/27">One of the true success stories in Hartlepool in recent years has been the ability of different organisations to put aside institutional jealousy and place the needs of Hartlepool residents first. We are lucky in that the geographical boundaries of the PCT are coterminous with those of the local authority. More important is the desire to work together to improve the town's health. Joint commissioning has taken place, with joint appointments such as that of Peter Price as director of public health. Pooled budgets between the council and the PCT are already in place and, from next April, those organisations will jointly commission children's and older people's services.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/28">That is the future of health care in Hartlepool: teams of doctors, nurses, social workers and home carers from a variety of agencies sharing information and using the same systems and procedures to tailor health care to residents' individual needs and requirements.It seems a shame that years of painful negotiation and hard work to secure partnership by those local agencies could be threatened by a blunt diktat issued on Christmas eve by the strategic health authority.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/29">I want the partnering approach to be extended throughout the health network in Hartlepool. I want Housing Hartlepool to be part of that network to ensure that housing does not contribute to health problems. I want schools to teach children the benefits of healthy eating and I want supermarkets in the town to play a role in promoting fruit and vegetables and the benefits of a balanced diet.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/30">In this demanding age, a one-size-fits-all approach is wrong, particularly for health care. The agencies in the town need suitable flexibility, and shared systems and procedures, to enable them to offer a personalised service as close to the home of the person concerned as possible, with the minimum of duplication from organisation to organisation.</p>
	<p pid=".371.1/31">The future of health services in Hartlepool is the realisation of our town's vision of care; it is services that are as local as possible, with an emphasis on a service to patients based on their individual needs; it is a multi-agency approach with a massively sophisticated health network; it is an adequately funded primary care sector, in conjunction with a responsive and fully funded acute sector, which allows community based health to be at the centre of the health service in Hartlepool while freeing the acute trust to undertake its valuable role. Only by realising that vision will we truly reverse decades of ill health in Hartlepool.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.376.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1000" speakername="Melanie Johnson" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="376"  time="011:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h02.htm#50208h02_spmin0">
	<p pid=".376.0/1">It is with pleasure that I respond to my hon. Friend's debate and congratulate him on securing it; I know that the subject is a matter of huge importance to him and his constituents.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/2">I want to say a few words in response to his remarks about public health. Although I shall not say a lot on those topics, because I need to focus on the specific issues that my hon. Friend raised about hospitals and primary care trusts, that should not suggest&mdash;and I can tell that this goes for him too&mdash;that we give a low priority to public health, prevention and the Government agenda, which makes health care, and health itself, a top priority.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/3">I concur with my hon. Friend's remarks about the importance of tackling health inequalities and obesity, and about the need to avoid over-reliance on hospital services by securing good services in a community setting. I am, in addition, pleased to congratulate the PCT, and others involved, on the drop in smoking brought about through the quitting smoking services, as well as on the teenage pregnancy figures that he mentioned. All those things are terribly important and we need to tackle them if we are to crack the issue of health care and health in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/4">To deal with some of the more specific issues, Hartlepool PCT, as my hon. Friend acknowledged, has received large allocations of &pound;93.6 million in 2003&ndash;04, &pound;102.5 million in 2004&ndash;05 and &pound;112 million in 2005&ndash;06. Those amount to a cash increase of &pound;26 million, or 30   per cent., over three years. That compares closely to the overall national average. It is slightly less, but by only a small amount&mdash;the figure is 30.27 per cent. compared to the national figure of 30.83 per cent.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/5">The next round of allocations will be announced imminently, and I am sure that my hon. Friend will take a keen interest in that. That is in the context of record increases throughout the country, which means that there has been a big cash injection to enable many of the issues that he raised to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/6">I turn to the Tees service review and then the work of the PCT. To respond to my hon. Friend's point about where decisions are made, at the end of the day 75 per cent. or more of the money is received by the PCT. It is up to the PCT to commission the services locally that it feels are most appropriate for the people of Hartlepool. In that setting, responsibility has also been given to the strategic health authorities for running the NHS and running health in their areas, alongside the PCTs. In that context, my hon. Friend will remember the remarks that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health made last summer:</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Hartlepool will still have a full and proper hospital service after the review has taken place.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-06-08.312"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 June 2004; Vol. 422, c. 312</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/8">I should like to assure my hon. Friend that there is no going back on that commitment.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/9">In looking at how the services are developed for the future, the Department and all the strategic health authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the NHS not only provides high-quality care today, but will be able to provide it in 10 years' time. The service is not static; developments occur all the time, and possibilities for new treatments and new ways of doing things evolve, which is to the benefit of patients. We must ensure that our health service generally, and in Hartlepool specifically, continues to evolve in such a way that, as patients, we all get the best service possible.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/10">The current review of services in the area north of the Tees is designed to ensure that. There are three elements to any possible change. First, primary care is the key to the future of the NHS, as I said. It is now possible to provide a wider range of care, including minor surgery, X-ray and other tests. I note my hon. Friend's remarks about high-quality facilities in all the communities around Hartlepool and the importance of providing services away from acute hospitals, which I have seen elsewhere and which are more convenient and often much more effective in a community setting.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/11">The reason for the change is that providing services in primary care makes services more local for local people, who will be able to receive treatment and care in local surgeries and other facilities close to their homes. There are a number of benefits to that. I note my hon. Friend's remarks about car ownership levels and the importance of travelling. The changes can mean a lot less travelling and less pressure on the hospitals, and therefore shorter waiting times for those who genuinely need a hospital service that cannot be provided in a community setting. In line with recent announcements, it is also important that the care of those with long-term conditions be managed closer to home too. There will be better prevention of ill health by targeting people at risk, which is an aspiration that he and I share.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/12">The second element is the need for all emergency services to work together more effectively. At present, there is often confusion about the best thing to do. People end up in an accident and emergency department just because they know that it is there and that it is open, but it may not be the best place for them in all circumstances. The right service may be advice from NHS Direct, or out-of-hours service in primary care or a minor injuries clinic. People need rapid access to the emergency service best able to meet their need. In that connection, I am pleased to report that the out-of-hours service in the Tees valley area has been operating smoothly since April 2004.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/13">The third element is ensuring that local hospitals are strong and modern, and can give the best possible services available to all people north and south of   the   Tees. I acknowledge that change is always uncomfortable to contemplate and not always popular. People sometimes like to keep things as they are, which is most true of well loved local services such as local hospitals. It is absolutely understandable that the Hartlepool &quot;save the hospital&quot; petition was signed by some 30,000 people.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/14">The job of the SHA&mdash;working with all its partners in health and social care&mdash;is to look ahead and put forward changes that will save tomorrow's hospitals by making sensible changes today. The hospital services have been changing for some time and they are still changing. As I have already said, some services that used to be provided in a hospital can now be provided in primary care. Other services need to be provided in fewer places so that specialist staff and facilities can be available to provide the best possible care. Some examples of such services are those for cancer treatment, emergency surgery and the most serious accidents. I am not talking about average attendance at accident and emergency, but really serious road traffic accidents and other dramatic accidents.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/15">The decisions to create strong, modern hospitals have already been taken in other parts of County Durham and the Tees valley area. For instance, people living south of the Tees are already served by the James Cook university hospital, which opened in 2003. The purpose of the Tees review is to establish arrangements in the area north of the Tees that will provide the best and most sustainable services for the 21st century. The Department of Health invited Professor Sir Ara Darzi to work with the SHA on the review to ensure the highest quality outcome. The professor was asked to consider how the fullest possible range of services can be maintained at Hartlepool hospital in light of the work that has already been undertaken during the Tees services review and the wider context of the proposed provision of primary and secondary care services, both north and south of the Tees.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/16">Two additional areas were identified relatively recently as needing examination, which is why we have agreed to look at the work of the Hambleton and Richmondshire PCT and the South Tees hospital trust in relation to the Friarage hospital, and consider the impact of the centralisation of specialist services at, and the capacity of, the James Cook university hospital on other hospitals in the area.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/17">The original time scales were not realistic, so the review has been extended and it must be allowed to be carried out thoroughly and should report when it is ready. It is important that we provide people with safe, sustainable services that are local, where that is possible. I know that my hon. Friend will share that ambition. The local health service, with the assistance of Professor Darzi's review, is looking at how best we can do that. The professor is visiting Teesside in March and I understand that my hon. Friend is likely to meet him again then. Professor Darzi is likely to submit his final report in the following months and, as he is still reviewing the situation, I am sure that hon. Members will understand that I cannot make any commitments that pre-empt the outcome of the work that he is doing.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/18">In the remaining minutes, may I turn to GP recruiting and the work that has been done on that? The good news is that, in September 2001, there were 49 GPs in the PCT area and the latest figure is 52, which is a 6 per cent. increase. I am aware that there are still seven vacancies and the PCT has employed eight salaried GPs to provide capacity where it has not been possible to attract principal GPs to practices. The PCT has been working with the strategic health authority to develop the international recruitment of GPs. Under the national initiatives, new GPs in Hartlepool will receive the higher rate golden hello payment, which can be up to &pound;12,000. The PCT is also looking to develop modern primary care centres providing access to integrated health and social care teams, including all the specialist workers that my hon. Friend mentioned. It is also planning to use a range of other primary care skills to help deliver that. In addition, the PCT has recruited two GPs from Spain and one from Austria.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/19">Nationally, there are more GPs in the NHS than ever before, which reflects the Government's record investment in primary care and commitment to expanding the GP workforce. In June 2004, there were 31,215 GPs working for the NHS, which is an increase of 11.3 per cent. since October 1997. There are a range of initiatives to secure ongoing, positive developments in that direction.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/20">We know that people are concerned about health in Hartlepool and I reassure my hon. Friend that the Department of Health is, too. The strategic health authority and the local NHS organisations are also concerned. That is why so much has been invested in health and why we will keep on investing in health in Hartlepool, which we want to be modern and sustainable for the future.</p>
	<p pid=".376.0/21">Sitting suspended until Two o'clock.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.382.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="382"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h03.htm#50208h03_spnew2">
	<p pid=".382.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. I shall return to that point towards the end of my speech; he has obviously been reading the study showing that 65 per cent. of people do not have the advantage of choice.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/2">I turn to the limitations on choice in the existing system. First, targets are centrally imposed; in the past, those targets had to be met in order to decide on star ratings. Such central diktats take away local choice, but that is in direct competition with the Government's laudable aim of devolution. Overemphasising targets is leading to problems for patients and reducing their choice. I shall give two examples&mdash;one general, and one local.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/3">The general example is of NHS treatment centres. The centres were designed with a large capacity because it was recognised that separating emergency and routine work would offer hospitals better control of waiting lists and help fulfil the aim of delivering routine care more rapidly. Probably for the right motives, the Government arranged huge contracts with treatment centres in the independent sector; the problem is that those contracts have to be fulfilled before patients can be allowed real choice about where to go, and people are worried that they will not improve quality. Primary care trusts are under pressure to use the independent centres; they thus have relatively limited resources available for use on the NHS treatment centres. I am sure that the Minister is aware of worries about the independent sector treatment centres&mdash;worries about standards of care, loss of training on routine matters for junior NHS staff, follow-up and the treatment of complications.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/4">The local example shows how choice has been taken away by overemphasising the targets for cardiac surgery. Because the major centre for cardiac surgery in Birmingham could not meet the targets, the local strategic health authority ruled in its wisdom that patients from my part of the world, from the Wyre forest and south Worcestershire, should go to Coventry cardiac surgical centre rather than Birmingham. That would be all right if patients were given the choice of going either 50 miles or 20 miles. I can honestly say that both probably provide services of an equally good standard, but that ruling has been interpreted in such a way that patients and the local cardiologists are left with no choice.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/5">I have to declare an interest; I know of that problem because a good friend of mine is involved. The distance to Coventry by the most convenient route is 51 miles, and to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham it is 18 miles. In emergencies, the ambulance journey for my friend was 51 miles of agony. The only ambulance that could take his heart machinery was an old ambulance with archaic springing, and he had to lie upon an unsprung canvas stretcher. That is one example of choice being taken away from both clinicians and patients.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/6">I turn to a second limitation on choice, the availability of services. The Health Committee has recently reported on allergies, palliative care and sexual health. Those reports all show limitations in the services provided&mdash;understandably so&mdash;but those limitations also reduce patients' choice. Even the choice of whether to die at home, which many people would like to be able to make, is limited by the amount of support available.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/7">Another local issue is maternity care. The Health Committee produced a report in 2002&ndash;03 on &quot;Choice in Maternity Services&quot;. The services that should be available are, obviously, home birth services, midwife-led birth centres, and a consultant unit. A recommendation in the report was that</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/8" class="indent">&quot;given that pregnant women are not able to travel long journeys to give birth, if midwife led units are not available local choice is severely constrained.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/9">The Government response accepted that, but rather hid behind devolution, stating:</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/10" class="indent">&quot;It is for local service developers to design services to meet the needs of their local population taking fully into account their views.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/11">My feeling is that the Government will hide behind devolution when it suits, but impose targets that may cut across those local priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/12">Our birth centre was rightly closed after some unexplained and totally unacceptable baby deaths. The inquiry that looked into it exposed faults in that stand-alone birth centre that dated back to the loss of the acute district general hospital that previously supported it. Despite questions of safety at the time, the health service managers did not put the safety measures into place, with the consequences that have ensued. Stand-alone birth centres are safe and viable with the right protocols, as is demonstrated in &quot;Keeping the NHS Local&quot;, which I have mentioned before.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/13">Another factor that limits choice is the availability of staff. The Government are to be commended for their efforts to increase staff, and their success in some other fields of activity, but there are still huge gaps. I shall give two local examples. In the county of Worcestershire there is only one specialist available for a particular complicated but relatively commonly needed procedure. That specialist was called away on jury duty. Doctors used to be exempt from jury duty and I have no brief to recommend that for doctors as a group, but where a service depends on a single high-powered specialist it does not seem right that he or she should be called away to jury duty. There can be no choice in that case, because there will be no service.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/14">Similarly, in my area we have only one specialist for essential biopsies of the prostate. When that specialist is off sick there is no service. That instance resulted purely from lack of co-operation and lack of a true partnership across the county, which I believe has been sorted out.</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/15">The last factor that I want to mention as limiting choice is another that I lay at the door of the Government; it involves magnetic resonance imaging scanners. There is spare capacity in MRI scanners in the NHS, but the Government have signed a huge contract with a private supplier and therefore the choice of the GP to use the local NHS scanner is eroded, as is the choice of the patient. The motive is bulk buying for cheapness, and that is certainly a consideration. I tabled a written question to try to find out what the savings would be, but, surprise, surprise, the answer that came back stated:</p>
	<p pid=".382.0/16" class="indent">&quot;The exact costs of the scanning and reporting procedure is a matter of commercial confidence.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-01-13.611"><i>Official Report, House of Commons,</i> 13 January 2005; Vol. 429, c. 611W</phrase>.]</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.386.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" speakername="Evan Harris" colnum="386"  time="014:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h03.htm#50208h03_spnew9">
	<p pid=".386.2/1">It is a pleasure to take part in the debate. It reminds me of old times when I was on the Front Bench. There is a Liberal Democrat Opposition day debate and other activities in the House today, so I kindly offered to help out on the Front Bench. I am pleased to see the Minister looking as cheerful as ever&mdash;yes, no smile.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/2">We should thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1275" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> for obtaining the debate and giving us the chance to discuss many of the most topical issues in health care. He carried out a wide-ranging survey of some health care issues and placed particular emphasis on choice. I agreed with much of what he said, especially the need for all of us, across party, to identify how to ensure that there are mechanisms that give more choice, or give more control, as I prefer to describe it, to the patient that will improve quality, access and equity. Those are our three most important aims.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/3">Choice or control is best viewed as a means to the end of obtaining a more equitable, higher quality, and more accessible health care system, with access leading to fairness and quality, too. There is too much rhetoric about choice and some of the mechanisms that are designed to demonstrate that the Government are seeking to maximise choice undermine the other end points of fairness, quality and improved access, particularly for the sickest patients who ought to have the fastest access. There is also a significant opportunity in setting up mechanisms that can be seen to raise the profile of choice as an end in itself, rather than as a means to an end. The hon. Gentleman spoke about choose and book, which is one of those expensive and time consuming mechanisms that have yet to demonstrate any advantage in terms of access, quality and fairness.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/4">I do not believe that the Government are opposed to recognising that the key issues are improved access, a fairer health care system and a fairer burden of ill health&mdash;if that is the right term&mdash;and ensuring that there is good quality, but they are distracted by an obsession with trying to outflank the Conservative party to the right in respect of worshipping the mantra of choice. I should like to give a few examples of where their promotion of choice as an end in itself is damaging to what really needs to happen and to what we can say, given that we are in Westminster Hall and still some distance from an election, are ideals shared by all parties in terms of trying to obtain those three outcomes.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/5">It is probably wise to start with choose and book, because that focuses the question on the opportunity cost. We should not be too critical of the NHS programme for IT. Clearly, there is scepticism about Government IT programmes, but if scepticism prevented us from doing things, we would never make any progress. The head of the IT project made it clear that he was aware of the record of failure on delivering big IT projects and was keen to ensure that the programme about which we are talking delivered the hardware and software. I recognise that big steps have been made. The flip side to that, which is perhaps inevitable, is that there has not been as much engagement with the health care professionals&mdash;not just doctors and GPs&mdash;that there might otherwise have been. That conscious decision was taken by the head of the NHS IT programme, because he thought that it was most important to get credibility by delivery, but it is not easy to say in retrospect whether that was wise, given that there is now a big need to engage with the medical profession.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/6">The NHS programme for IT is seeking to do things as rapidly as possible in a catch-up way. The Minister will recognise that the remarks that I am making on this matter are not designed to be over-critical. However, the problem with choose and book is that GPs do not understand why the Government chose the numbers in terms of the range of choices, regardless of whether there was a question of access, or whether it was appropriate to provide choice.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/7">I spoke to a GP in Bristol recently who could not understand why the other choice for cardiac care for his patients was in Winchester. It is not realistic that patients in Bristol will want to go to Winchester, especially those with the greatest health needs who will find it most difficult to operate that choice. Such people want to be near their families and treated near their homes. That GP was also of the view that there was a significant time requirement to use choose and book, which meant that he could not see as many patients as he needed and wanted to see and who needed seeing. He thought that the Government had not costed properly&mdash;had not even started to cost&mdash;the time impact of forcing people to use such a system in the surgery and were hoping that they would engage with it.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/8">Clearly, there will be slowness during the pilot phase, if the system is to be piloted. I shall rephrase that; &quot;pilot&quot; implies that there will be an evaluation and a reconsideration. Do the Government think that, when people are proficient and the system is fully online, there will be a time cost? How will that be factored into GP work loads? The Government have done a huge amount to try to address concerns about GP work loads with the GP contract. It would be a pity to lose what has been reasonably successful, as far as these things go, in giving GPs the recognition that they wanted of their time-pressure issues. It would be a pity if the good will that emerged from that were put at risk by the imposition of a system that took a lot of time.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/9">I should like to probe the Government on whether within this choice arrangement they will still provide the freedom of choice that GPs, and through them their patients, have for referral to a consultant or specialist of their choosing. I was interested in the hon. Gentleman's remarks on that issue. He was explaining that when he worked in the health service prior to the internal market&mdash;that was a little before I started working there&mdash;there was effectively freedom to refer to any specialist in the country through the GP. That was lost during round one of the internal market, which was introduced by the Conservatives in the late 1980s. The question is whether that still applies now. Will GPs and patients be able, outside of contracts, to go to consultants of their choice? It is worth exploring how the Government's new tariff-based system and payment by results affects how we judge whether there is an internal market at the moment. It is fair to say that the Government have created an internal market, and a better, more effective one than the Conservatives did, for reasons that are clear.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/10">Under the Government's system, money will follow individual patients; that is the way it is set up. Under the Conservatives' system, whether by design or because of a problem with the system, patients followed contracts and there was very little in the way of incentives to get extra patients; the incentive was not to lose the contract. However, it is difficult to take huge contracts away from a hospital without that hospital going bust. We were rightly critical of the old internal market, and I do not understand why the Government refuse to call what they are doing a better, more effective market version of the Conservatives' internal market, a version in which the money&mdash;I have heard Ministers use the expression&mdash;will follow patients as hospitals try to attract extra work.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/11">That must be a good thing for people who see the health service in that way. I am not sure that that is how I would like to see the health service in its entirety, but one can recognise that a system in which good work and attracting more patients gets more resources is an effective market. I cannot understand why the Government are not proud of the fact that they have improved on what the Conservatives tried to do. With practice-based commissioning, there has clearly been a return to GP fundholding, which the Government were proud to say they had abolished, even though they made large multifunds when they created primary care groups.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/12">I ask whether there will still be patient choice because in my Oxfordshire constituency we have been told that the mechanisms for choice, in reference to the large contract that has been awarded to an independent-sector treatment centre for cataract operations, will be called managed choice. I do not know whether that will be managed choice, massaged choice or pretend choice, but the patient referrals will go to a central PCT-run hub and be allocated to the treatment centre without the patients or their GPs having any say-so in the default situation. Patients will not be asked, &quot;For your cataract operation, do you want to go to a car park near you in the next three months, or to the Oxford eye hospital?&quot;, but be allocated to one or the other&mdash;most likely the treatment centre. I cannot understand how the Government dare to define that as choice, but I can understand why they are doing it.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/13">The reason, as the hon. Gentleman said, is that those private sector treatment centres, and perhaps even the NHS ones, have an agreed amount of work sent their way. No money will follow the patient, but the Government have set up huge contracts, five years in advance, when the money has already gone, at exactly the same time as saying that they want the money to follow the patients. It is possible that no patients will be referred to the centres, but the centres will still be paid. They have to find the patients to follow the money.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/14">I do not see how that gets over the problems of the Conservatives' flawed internal market, which the Government are rightly keen to criticise, for that and other reasons. I would therefore like the Minister to explain how he sees five-year contracts in advance of guaranteed work going to those treatment centres when he says that the issue is about the money following the patient and rewarding units for attracting more patients, rather than giving them a huge dollop at the outset.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/15">I think that the Minister recognises that GPs do not have much faith in some treatment centres, particularly where there is a good quality NHS service. I would be the first to accept that, in my area, not all the NHS services are good. However, there have not been complaints about either the quality of the service offered on the NHS for cataracts or failing to meet the three- month maximum waiting time target by the end of last year, flawed though that target is, as the NHS has indeed met it.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/16">It is hard to understand why the system was imposed in the way that it was&mdash;it certainly was not a choice for the local population. In order to get the PCTs to sign the legal agreement, the Government had to guarantee that they would fund through the SHA the extra costs involved in patients not going to the private provider and sticking with the high-quality, easily accessible and fair service offered by the Oxford eye hospital.</p>
	<p pid=".386.2/17">The hon. Gentleman hit on another issue, which is that quality is not just about the here and now. We must find ways to ensure quality for the future. One of the key questions is how the Government see training being provided in independent treatment centres, which is done, I guess, to pass muster with the district auditor or the National Audit Office, at a rock bottom rate. The centres cream off the easiest cases and do not have to do any training. Everyone knows that training slows down the process. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will recognise that from having medical students to train who slowed him down, even though they were probably not as bad as I was.</p>

	<p pid=".390.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. As more and more surgery is done at a day case level and in treatment centres, the integration of treatment centres with the acute hospital is vital, otherwise juniors will not receive the training that they need for the work in day case centres that they will do when they become consultants.</p>

	<p pid=".391.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1275" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> on securing a debate on this subject. I think that I can say on a non-partisan basis that it is a pity that we have not been better supported by our Back Benchers on this occasion. This is a crucial issue and I am sure that it will form a central element of what the parties talk about in the run-up to the general election.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/2">I will be a little more charitable than the hon. Gentleman has been because, broadly speaking, the choice agenda is the official Opposition's agenda. It is our agenda because we believe it to be right in principle, and because we feel that, mechanistically, choice will drive up quality. On both counts, we support the general thrust of the Government in promoting choice in the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/3">The hon. Gentleman, no doubt unintentionally, revealed in some of his remarks what one might call the patrician strand of NHS doctoring. I say that with the greatest respect, and I hope that he will not take offence. However, people now expect to be more closely involved in the decisions relating to their medical care and are, perhaps, less willing than they once were to be directed by &quot;the system&quot;. The choice agenda is all to do with encouraging the patient empowerment that, going by his contribution, concerns <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">the hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/4">Mr. Harry Cayton has said, very eloquently, that patient choice is no gimmick. It changes people's lives, gives them control and improves the responsiveness of the NHS. With those words, I could rest my case and sit down. However, I shall not do that because I should like to ask the Minister about some aspects of choice. I agree with Mr. Cayton's sentiments; they are put extremely well in very few words. Choice drives up standards and responsiveness. I commend the Social Market Foundation report of September 2004, &quot;Choice: the evidence&quot;, which poses a number of questions. Let me paraphrase three of them. It asks whether, when it has been offered, choice has been taken up&mdash;the answer is yes, but a support package is required in order for that choice, where offered, to be taken up; it asks whether the population that takes up the choice is socio-economically skewed, and it concludes that it is not; and it asks whether choice has helped to improve quality and efficiency and, crucially, answers yes.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/5">The report bears close scrutiny, and I am probably doing it a gross injustice by summarising it. However, that is, essentially, what it says. It does not ask&mdash;I think that it should have done&mdash;whether health care professionals feel threatened by choice. The answer to that is probably yes. I would also say that the Government have not helped matters by, until recently, choosing to ignore health care professionals in going forward with the cornerstone of choice, the national programme for IT in the NHS. I shall deal with that in a few moments. I entirely endorse the comments that have been made about choice not being just between hospitals. It is between treatments and between specialists. As the MP for a rural constituency, I would say that people would, in effect, be choosing between, at most, two hospitals. However, they would also be choosing from a raft of specialists and, I hope, from different forms of treatment. For rural areas, the choice agenda will mean a great deal more than choices between hospitals. It will mean choices between specialists and between different sorts of treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/6">Mental health has been mentioned, but only once, in passing. That is a great pity. If I were to pick out an area of health care in which I felt that choice could be particularly useful, it would be mental health. Empowerment and choice are therapeutic. Lack of choice and lack of control are anti-therapeutic for many patients. That is probably why those who concern themselves with mental health issues, as well as patients, respond positively to the Government's choice agenda, and agree that it is right for the official Opposition to have at the heart of their agenda the notion of choice.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/7">I encourage the Minister to say a little more about mental health in the context of choice. I say that in all candour. It has not been spoken of enough, and it should be. I fear that the right hon. Gentleman and his right hon. and hon. Friends do not appreciate that the NHS means considerably more than elective surgery. He might wish to take the opportunity to say a few words about how he thinks that his choice agenda will help those with mental health problems. I should also be grateful if he would clarify where we are with choose and book. Last month, the National Audit Office reported that only 63 patients had used it, although more than 200,000 had been expected to do so. Is the Secretary of State's expectation of 100 per cent. usage by the end of the year as ambitious as his plans for NHS dentistry were? Clearly, those have collapsed, with the result that my constituents have considerably less choice than they had eight years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/8">Will the Minister share some of the difficulties that the national programme for IT in the NHS is experiencing? We know that there are a great deal of problems, but, sadly, we have to learn about most of them from the redoubtable <i>Computer Weekly</i>, which has done a good job in keeping us up to date, despite the Government's attempts to bar its reporters from briefings. Why has it proved necessary, at this late stage, to throw bucket-loads of cash at primary care trusts in an attempt to bring GPs online and on message?</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/9">Last week, in a written answer to a question put by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1034" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/10" class="indent">&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-19">19 January 2005</phrase>, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced a &pound;95 million incentive scheme to recognise and reward the key role that PCTs will need to play in engaging primary care stakeholders and encouraging and supporting general practitioners to use choose and book.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2005-02-02.995"><i>Official Report, House of Commons</i>; 2 February 2005; Vol. 430, c. 995W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/11">That seems sinister. How does the Minister anticipate that PCTs will use the &pound;300,000 per trust to bend GPs to his will? We understand that NPfIT will deliver two things: the vestigial national spine, and choose and book, yet each choice booking so far has cost &pound;52,000. The Minister should know that GPs are thoroughly fed up at having invested in kit and training that they are now told will be redundant. Crossing their palms with silver at this late stage is a poor substitute for carrying them along from the start. The slow and clumsy choose and book is becoming something of a laughing stock among GPs. The Minister is fighting a rearguard action.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/12">Will the Minister clarify the Secretary of State's announcement last week that his choice agenda will cause some hospitals to close? I am sure that he will be keen to do that. The press are full of speculation, and a great deal of confusion has been caused. I have my own thoughts on what the Secretary of State meant, but it would be extremely useful if the Minister could clarify those remarks so that we are left in no doubt as to what he meant.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/13">The NHS Confederation points out that patients may well vote with their feet, but from specific departments and on elective procedures only. That is right. As others have pointed out, if elective hip surgery goes, trauma will quickly follow, which will, in turn, be followed by accident and emergency; that would spell doom for an acute hospital. What has not been pointed out as much is that critical mass is needed in an acute hospital for training and accreditation. If one little bit of that is lost, the whole edifice is lost. Insufficient thought has been given to that. Indeed, there is no evidence that any thought has been given to it in any Minister's utterance that I have heard. Perhaps the Minister can correct me.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/14">I have no doubt that patients will vote with their feet. By and large, that will be a wake-up call to hospitals. I suspect that that is what the Secretary of State should have said&mdash;and that it would rarely result in the closure of an institution. Surely to goodness that is what he meant.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/15">There has been mention of the way in which money follows patients, or patients follow money. I share some of the concerns raised, for example that the targets set by the Government to bring down waiting lists have resulted in contractual arrangements that will end up hampering rather than improving patient choice. Labour has set a target that 10 per cent. of operations should be carried out by independent treatment centres. That target is arbitrary, distorts patient choice and prevents NHS hospitals from attracting patients on a level playing field. Again, it would be useful to have the Minister's comments on that.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/16">James Johnson of the British Medical Association is not a great fan of independent treatment centres. He claims that they are destabilising the entire hospital system. He blames the inability of the NHS to withstand surplus capacity, and claims that it is leading to a failure in plurality of provision. I shall press the Minister separately on that issue, but if he voices his thoughts at this stage, we might avoid correspondence of the protracted sort that we are currently having on NPfIT.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/17">I finish, Mr. Deputy Chairman, with a few quick questions, and I would be grateful if the Minister could address them. NHS trusts are facing substantial deficits because of the sheer number of demands placed on them by the Government. Given his recent remarks about closure, would the Secretary of State consider hospitals in those trusts to be failing? Many of them are clinically excellent, and I offer the example of my very own Royal United hospital, Bath.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/18">References to the choice agenda readily fall from the Ministers' lips, but that agenda is not appreciated by a sizeable portion of their own party, including ex-Health Secretaries. How will the Secretary of State deal with such people? That is not really any of my business; I am just interested to know.</p>
	<p pid=".391.0/19">Finally, the Government's idea of choice is restricted to a list of four or five hospitals, chosen by PCTs. Why will they not give that choice directly to patients and their GPs? Why is it restricted to bricks and mortar, and not extended to individual specialists and options for the range of treatment?</p>

	<p pid=".394.1/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1275" name="Richard Taylor">the hon. Member for Wyre Forest (Dr. Taylor)</phrase> on allowing us to have this important debate about choice and what it means. I congratulate all hon. Members who have made a contribution, because they have all raised perfectly fair and reasonable points.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/2">As I listened to the debate, I was struck by the fact that, with one or two exceptions, most comments were confined to the issue of choice over routine operations or elective procedures. In recent years, the Government have rightly taken an important step forward on the issue by giving patients more choice over routine operations, and I shall obviously want to speak extensively about that.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/3">However, the concept of patient choice goes much wider than simply access to routine operations. One should remember that 90 per cent. of all patient journeys in the NHS begin and end in a GP's surgery and that, fortunately, only a small minority of NHS patients need the services of a surgeon or specialist in an acute set-up. When we talk about choice, therefore, it is important that we try not to confine ourselves to the choice of hospitals, and the Government have certainly done that. Hospitals are only the tip of the iceberg, and we need a concept that goes beyond simply providing more choice about operations.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/4">For example, it is important for primary care patients to have more choice, and we can deal with the issue in several ways. NHS Direct has been an important additional service for NHS patients; it is widely used, it is making a significant difference and it is saving patients' lives. Of course, there are people who criticise it, and I understand that. Most NHS services are criticised at the beginning for a variety of reasons: people do not like them and are not familiar with them. However, NHS Direct has proven its worth day after day because of the outstanding work that the nurses do in providing medical advice to patients who ring up. As we approach the elections&mdash;I am sure that we are all looking forward to them&mdash;we shall all want to look carefully at what the parties are saying about the future of NHS Direct. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1132" name="Andrew Murrison">The hon. Member for Westbury (Dr.   Murrison)</phrase> said, quite fairly, that he had some questions for me, and we shall be asking him and his parliamentary colleagues about some of these issues.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/5">On primary care, the walk-in centres have proved to be very useful. My daughter recently used one, and I have nothing but praise and tributes for the staff who run them, because they do a very good job. We shall shortly be expanding walk-in centres into new territory. There will be several GP-led commuter walk-in centres at some of England's largest transport hubs, bringing our services closer to where patients are. Commuters, in particular, are bound to experience serious issues in trying to access the services of their family doctor, because many of them get up early and come home late, and most of the surgeries will, sadly, be shut by the time they return home. So, we have to find a better way of taking our services to where the patients are, and commuter walk-in centres will be one way of doing that.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/6">Another area in which we need greater choice is patient access to medication, and that could be at several different levels. For example, there is the issue of getting repeat prescriptions. By common consent, the process has been far too bureaucratic, and we have found some important ways through that bureaucracy. Improvements could, for example, also mean access to medications over the counter, on which we are making progress. We are the only country in the European Union in which patients obtain access to some of the new anti-cholesterol drugs, the so-called statin group, over the counter. That, too, is important. The Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1332" name="Rosie Winterton">the Member for Doncaster, Central (Ms Winterton)</phrase>, has been making progress with proposals for freeing up some of the restrictions on the location of new pharmacies.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/7">Those are two important spheres of activity in which a flourishing debate about choice is needed, and there are others that hon. Members have raised today. One of those is maternity services, which the hon. Member for Wyre Forest raised in connection with his constituency, and another is mental health, which was mentioned by the hon. Member for Westbury.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/8">I agree that mental health is an area in which it is important for us to take a critical look at ways of expanding patient choice. The hon. Gentleman will probably know that the National Institute for Mental Health in England is considering, with patient organisations and groups, ways of expanding patient choice in mental health. Certainly, patients have been telling us that they want a greater range of choices about the services to which they gain access during times of illness and recovery. That is right and proper and I understand that the Department will, later in the year, publish a mental health discussion document on how we implement choice in local communities. I am sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House will look forward to that publication.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/9">The focus of our discussion today has been choice over routine operations, and it has been quite an interesting debate. I am sorry that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> is not here, because I received a strong sense from him that he was not an advocate of patient choice or any of the reforms that the Labour Government have implemented, even though they were all in our manifesto. However, that is a debate for another occasion.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/10">The hon. Member for Wyre Forest began his remarks by describing a golden age in the NHS. There are only one or two people who can ever remember things happening in the manner of such descriptions; it has certainly not been my experience in 50 years of using the NHS that there was ever a golden age when I could see my GP and be bundled off on a train to see a specialist in Cheltenham, Birmingham, Manchester or somewhere else. On the occasions when I have needed to see a specialist I do not remember being given any choice.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/11">The hon. Gentleman finished his remarks by saying that we should not be attending to that matter now&mdash;that there were other things to get on with and that choice was a longer-term aspiration rather than a short-term priority. I take issue with him about that fundamentally; he is wrong to say that we must make a choice between developing minimum standards and the higher quality care that he argues&mdash;and I agree&mdash;is essential, and providing greater patient choice. I consider the latter an equal priority. To think that we can achieve only one, at the expense of the other, is to make a false dichotomy.</p>
	<p pid=".394.1/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/940" name="Evan Harris">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> made a characteristic good cop-bad cop speech, but seemed, on balance, to be in favour of choice, although I think that he wanted to reserve his position on the matter as far as possible. I do not have the energy today to make any cheap, below-the-belt remarks about the Liberal Democrats. However, it is striking that although one would expect that party, of all the political parties on the British political scene, to be in favour of choice, the hon. Gentleman has, in much of health policy, allowed it to be captured by a group of vested interests who are not in favour of reform at all. In the House of Commons in particular there has been a series of flip-flops from the Liberal Democrats about whether they are in favour of or against treatment centres, payment by results, or choice. There will come a time when they have to make up their mind about where they stand on the issues.</p>

	<p pid=".397.4/2">The hon. Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon made several observations about some of the reforms.   At one point, he described practice-based commissioning as GP fundholding. It is certainly not that for three essential reasons: no price negotiation is involved in practice-based commissioning because we have a single national tariff; no additional bureaucracy or transactional costs are associated with it, because the primary care trusts will be responsible for the contracting process; and, most importantly, practices that take on the responsibility of practice-based commissioning will not have the additional top-up resources that GP fundholding had. GP fundholding was a genuine two-tier system in which some practices gained at the expense of others. No one will do that under practice-based commissioning. To set the record straight on practice-based commissioning, the Government committed themselves to it back in 1998, under the wise leadership of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/856" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Mr. Dobson)</phrase>, in our very first White Paper.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/3">On the subject of community matrons, UnitedHealthcare does not employ any community nurses; they are all employed by the national health service. The hon. Gentleman also referred to suggestions on how we should conduct our general election campaign, but I am sure that he will not want me to take any of them up.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/4">We talked extensively about the ideology of choice. For me, choice is not so much an ideology as the right thing to do in principle, so I agree with the hon. Member for Westbury on that point. Many of us may have been struck by the words of Terence Leahy, who spoke at last weekend's debate, which was sponsored by <i>The Guardian</i>, on the future of public services. He said:</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/5" class="indent">&quot;The ability to make a choice gives you power in your life. They may be small choices but they can add up to a sense of control and purpose. People draw tremendous self-esteem from being asked to choose&mdash;from being trusted.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/6">That is absolutely right, and puts the essential argument very effectively for choice in the public services. Choice puts patients in the driving seat, and it requires providers to respond to the preferences of patients or public services users. It can also help to drive up quality and equity in access as well as the overall efficiency of the service. Those are very important objectives for the Labour Government. We do believe that choice can support equity in access and outcomes, and not destabilise them. I shall return to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/7">A point that may have escaped the hon. Members who expressed their concerns about choice is that we know that it is what patients want. Many right hon. and hon. Members often say that patients do not want choice, but the best way of finding out whether patients want choice is to ask them. That is precisely what we have done, but the hon. Members for Wyre Forest and for Oxford, West and Abingdon seem to have no recollection of the two years of experience of the coronary heart disease pilot on choice, the London pilot on choice and the work that we have done in the area of cataracts.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/8">The number of patients who exercised the right to move to a different provider was very high. The figures are available on the record, so I shall not go into them today. We know from MORI poll surveys, the work of the Picker institute and many other respectable, bona fide organisations that patients want choice. Why should they not want choice? It is a defining characteristic of citizenship in a modern society. We have often characterised choice in this place as the ability to elect the Government. Well, fine. That is obviously a crucial plank of an effective democracy.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/9">However, matters go much wider and deeper than that. In every other sphere of our life, we, as informed consumers and citizens, expect to be provided with choice. Why therefore, when it comes to the public services, is there a desperate poverty of ambition that leads us to say, &quot;No, we cannot have choice. It is too complicated. The patients will be confused. The services might be destabilised. Let us do what we have done for 50 years and tell people where to go to get their treatment.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/10">As a social democrat&mdash;someone who believes in the value of public services&mdash;I do not accept that we can possibly build and sustain support in this country for public services if we believe that we must direct patients to certain types of providers, give them no choice about what they can receive and give them no control over what happens to them. We must challenge that system and giving patients choice does precisely that.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/11">Another matter has been completely missing from the debate. We have talked about choice as though it were something new in health care in the United Kingdom. It is not. Leaving aside the argument about whether it has been in the NHS before, we know that, since the beginning of the NHS, some patients have had choice and they are the people who can afford to go private. Yet, here we are&mdash;a group of Members of Parliament who claim to support the public services and the NHS&mdash;saying that there should not be choice in the public sector, but that it is all right to have choice if people can afford to have better quality care or faster treatment in the private sector. It is impossible to imagine anything less equitable than tolerating that gulf in which personal wealth determines personal health. That is completely unacceptable. I say without hesitation that it is right in principle and right in practice for us to look at how we can extend choice to the national health service.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/12">Choice should not be confined to the few who have money. That is how things used to be. It should in future be extended to those who have need. That is a powerful message of reform. If we leave aside the argument about choice&mdash;there is an argument to be had about whether it is a good or a bad thing&mdash;we must understand choice in the operational sense.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/13">What are the crucial elements in the debate about extending choice in the national health service? There are three essential pillars to expanding choice. First and most obviously, additional investment must be put into the health service because the second crucial element is extended capacity, so that we can allow real contestabililty between providers and give patients the real option of going elsewhere if their local provider cannot accommodate their requirements. Finally, as the hon. Member for Westbury drew attention to, we must give powerful, effective and timely information to patients and clinicians so that they can make informed choices about precisely where to go to receive treatment.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/14">It is important that the three essential pillars of capacity, information and investment are all in place and lined up to support choice, which is why I take issue with the proposals of the hon. Gentleman and the Conservative party that we can have unlimited choice by the end of the year. We cannot do that because the necessary capacity will not be in place to make those choices effective. We could do that if we wanted to extend waiting times. I do not think that that is quite what the hon. Gentleman had in mind, but there is no short cut. We need capacity to exercise unlimited choice and the capacity will not be there if we want waiting times to be kept to a minimum.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/15">The other problem with the hon. Gentleman's policies is investment. I do not want to argue about the James report and associated aspects. There will be a time and a place for that during the next few weeks. However, one aspect of the hon. Gentleman's policies is inescapable: if he wants to take &pound;1.2 billion away from the NHS and use it as a subsidy for patients who can afford private medical treatment and want to go outside the NHS commissioning arrangements with the private sector so that they are willing to pay any price for operations in the private sector, that would take &pound;4 million a year from every primary care trust in the country to use as an effective subsidy for private medical insurance. It would be the equivalent of taking &pound;20 million from NHS patients in the hon. Gentleman's constituency to subsidise the cost of private operations for the rich. It is impossible to imagine how capacity plans, which are essential to allowing choice for the NHS&mdash;in other words, for the many&mdash;are to be met if money is taken away to subsidise the private medical insurance schemes of the well-off. That is a subject for future debate, and I look forward to it, but the hon. Gentleman has not a cat in hell's chance of winning it.</p>
	<p pid=".397.4/16">I looked at the Conservative party's website today&mdash;I look at it whenever I want to cheer myself up&mdash;and it shows the party's five priorities for the NHS. Strangely, there is not a single mention of the patient's passport. I wonder why. It is the Tory health policy that dare not speak its name. However, others are prepared to do it for them. We will certainly be talking about the patient's passport and how it comprehensively undermines the Tory party's bogus rhetoric on its commitment to the national health service.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-02-08.402.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1311" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="402"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050208/halltext/50208h04.htm#50208h04_spnew0">
	<p pid=".402.1/1">To some extent, I sympathise with the Minister. I notice that she responded to another half hour Adjournment debate earlier on health services in Hartlepool. She has to be an authority on all these matters. However, as she was brought up in south Gloucestershire for at least part of her childhood&mdash;I think that I am right in saying that&mdash;Frenchay hospital will be if not of greater interest then at least of considerable interest to her.</p>
	<p pid=".402.1/2">Frenchay hospital faces D-day on <phrase class="date" code="2005-03-14">14 March</phrase>. On that day, the chairs and chief executives of the four primary care trusts serving Bristol, south Gloucestershire and north Somerset will gather, as will those of the two acute hospital trusts. Between them, they will decide where to go with the Bristol health services plan and, in particular, they will decide whether there will be a major acute hospital on the Frenchay site or on the Southmead site, perhaps with a community hospital on both sites.</p>
	<p pid=".402.1/3">In preparation for the debate, I rang the chief executive of North Bristol NHS Trust last night and asked her what I could say about the stage that the trust's decision making had reached. She said that no decision had been made, that the trust board would meet later in the month and that it would have a special meeting at which the decision would be made. I respect what she told me, but the worst kept secret in Bristol and south Gloucestershire is that North Bristol NHS Trust wants to site the acute hospital at Southmead rather than at Frenchay.</p>
	<p pid=".402.1/4">Thousands of my constituents and those of other hon. Members who represent south Gloucestershire are concerned that Frenchay hospital, a centre of excellence with a proud history, may be about to be &quot;downgraded&quot;, to use the jargon. I will not say that it will be closed, because in the most likely scenario there will still be a community hospital on that site. However, it looks as though 24-hour accident and emergency and specialist advanced acute services will go.</p>
	<p pid=".402.1/5">I stress that it is not a question of the people of south Gloucestershire against the people of Bristol, because not only is North Bristol NHS Trust deciding what it wants to be its major site, but the Greater Bristol health community&mdash;to use those awful phrases&mdash;is deciding about provision over the whole area and has already decided that the Bristol Royal infirmary is a given. It is not a question of choosing between Frenchay or Southmead, but it is a matter of having the BRI plus one other.</p>
	<p pid=".402.1/6">The concerns of the people of south Gloucestershire will not be adequately addressed if the answer to the question of where the two major acute hospitals would be is that both would be in Bristol and none in south Gloucestershire, when the needs of the people of Bristol will be properly met by a high-quality acute hospital in the centre of Bristol. The needs of the people of south Gloucestershire would be properly met by a high-quality acute hospital in south Gloucestershire on the Frenchay site.</p>
	<p pid=".402.1/7">Although I disagree profoundly with the trust board and chief executive about their preference against the Frenchay site, I offer them some sympathy. The new chief executive has inherited a very large deficit, is in the process of trying to recover the organisation from a very messy financial situation and is dealing with payment by results, which is difficult for a relatively high-cost trust. It feels almost like permanent revolution in the health service so, to some extent, I sympathise with the pressures that the trust board and chief executive face.</p>

	<p pid=".414.4/1">May I first congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1059" name="Iain Luke">the Member for Dundee, East (Mr. Luke)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the objective and fair way that he presented a case that he passionately believes in and which represents the views of many of his constituents? I also congratulate him on the way that he defended the BBC, even though he might disagree with it over this particular show. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1143" name="Lembit pik">The hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Lembit &Ouml;pik)</phrase> had a different opinion and put forward his case well.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/2">The debate comes at an opportune time. As my hon. Friend said, we will shortly be publishing the Green Paper on the review of the BBC's royal charter. It will be the result of an extensive round of public and industry consultation. More than ever before, licence fee payers have had a say in the review of the BBC's charter and in the future of the corporation&mdash;the keystone of public service broadcasting in this country. The review process has been conducted openly and has benefited from our transparent and constructive relationship with the BBC. The Green Paper is not the end of the story. We want to hear what the public and industry will have to say about the issues raised in it, and there will be opportunities for wider debate, including in both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/3">Since the start of the charter review process, we have been guided by three key objectives, which I hope will reassure my hon. Friend that we consider the interests of licence fee payers to be the absolute top priority. Those objectives are: a strong BBC committed to the highest quality programming and independent of Government and commercial pressures; a BBC with an unprecedented clarity of purpose; and a genuine sense that the BBC is owned by and accountable to the people who pay for it.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/4">Our research has shown that the BBC is not only trusted, but much loved by the general public, who consider it to be the cornerstone of public service broadcasting. The BBC should be stable and strong, but flexible enough to adapt to the post-digital switchover world. It should continue to be the main player in public service broadcasting, but it must also face competition. The Burns panel showed that there is no credible alternative to the licence fee immediately available to us, but we will keep that under review.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/5">All those demands place a considerable burden on the BBC's system of governance and regulation, and it is clear that the old structure is not adequate for the demands of a rapidly changing broadcasting environment. Indeed, I agree with the Secretary of State that the present system is unsustainable. For that reason, we welcome the recent publication of the final advice of the independent panel led by Terry Burns, which emphasises the importance of the separation of the governors' oversight and delivery functions. We also welcome the BBC's moves to reform governance from within, and its commitment to a more transparent, accountable and open system.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/6">Our task is to take the advice, along with the many public and industry opinions offered during consultation, and to ensure that, by the end of the charter review process, we have a governance system that is founded unequivocally in the public interest. That system will be based on the principles set out by the Secretary of State, building on the work done by Lord Burns.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/7">The BBC should consider a number of points. The system should be appropriate for an organisation built on creativity, and it should protect the independence of the BBC from Government but not from the licence-fee-paying shareholders. It should be genuinely open, transparent and objective, ensure appropriate accountability for public money, command public confidence and involve the public adequately in decision making, and provide adequate protection for those outside the corporation who might be affected by the BBC's activity&mdash;principally, although not exclusively, its private sector competitors.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/8">In conducting assessments of impact, the BBC should use criteria that would allow direct comparisons with the rest of the broadcasting market. It should be clear about the distinction between governance and regulation, and include arrangements that would support both. It should be clear about the respective roles of the executive and non-executive, and embody such clarity in ways of working. It should incorporate effective mechanisms for audit and complaint handling and be flexible enough to adapt to change in the wider broadcasting market. I suppose one could put that down to future-proofing.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/9">I assure my hon. Friend that the Green Paper will cover other issues that directly affect licence fee payers. In many cases, those issues were raised in the consultation and through our research as areas where the public would like the BBC to improve its performance. The first issue is spreading the benefits of the licence fee more fairly across the United Kingdom. I have no doubt that my hon. Friend will agree with that, coming, as he does, from one of the more northern parts of the UK. I do, as far as Yorkshire is concerned. Another issue is the provision of a structure to ensure that licence fee payers get maximum value for money, and to improve the BBC's ability to achieve high benchmarks in the service that it provides and ensure distinctiveness and innovation.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/10">Securing appropriate programme standards is a key part of the achievement of the high benchmarks that I mentioned in the BBC service. That brings me inevitably to the argument over the screening of &quot;Jerry Springer&mdash;the Opera&quot;, in which I know my hon. Friend is particularly interested. The reaction from some viewers to the programme, which was broadcast on <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-08">8 January</phrase>, highlighted the importance of a robust and transparent BBC system to ensure that programme standards are upheld. The Government believe that the system should sit within a framework that protects free speech and freedom of artistic expression.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/11">My hon. Friend may be aware that the Government received several complaints about the programme, many suggesting varying types of censorship. My response to those complaints is the same as that of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and, indeed, my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts. Some people have been offended by the programme, but that is what happens when we have free speech. I, and the Department collectively, believe that it is better to have free speech than to try to legislate against offending people.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/12">The broadcasting organisations that regulate broadcasting are responsible for programme content. The Office of Communications, the Welsh fourth channel authority, S4C, and the governors of the BBC all have regulatory roles and are independent of Government. In addition, the BBC's governing instrument, the royal charter and the agreement, place broad obligations on the corporation, including some on programme content and standards.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/13">Within that framework, the details of decisions on programme content and scheduling are matters entirely for the BBC, reflecting its editorial independence. As I have already said, the Government are committed to securing a strong BBC, independent of Government. I think that I have also shown that we believe it to be important that the BBC should be aware of the concerns of its viewers and listeners. It is the responsibility of the BBC governors to ensure that the corporation meets is obligations in the charter and agreements of 1996. Anyone who does not agree with the governors about programme standards can write to Michael Grade, its chairman. Licence fee payers can also complain to Ofcom on matters of taste and decency. I therefore assure my hon. Friend that the complaints procedure, and the mechanisms for upholding programme standards, will be considered as part of the charter review.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/14">As I have said, the Green Paper will be published soon. We welcome as much feedback as possible. This has so far been the most constructive charter review ever conducted, and we shall ensure that that continues.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/15" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid=".414.4/16" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-four minutes past Four o'clock.</p>
