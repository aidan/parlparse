<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-20a.69.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" speakername="George Mudie" colnum="69"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080220/halltext/80220h0001.htm#08022066000290">
	<p pid="a.69.2/1">Once again, it is a pleasure to secure a debate under your benevolent and fair chairmanship, Mr. Gale. I am delighted to have obtained this debate and to see so many of my Leeds colleagues here, which indicates how important the matter is to Leeds. The matter affects the future of the local Leeds economy and, above all, the social cohesion of the city, which everyone has worked so hard for decades to improve and maintain and which is now threatened by the measure that we are discussing this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/2">In December, the Government announced the ending of the neighbourhood renewal fund. From April, a working neighbourhood fund will be in place. The Minister stated that the fund would</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/3" class="indent">&quot;provide resources to local authorities to tackle worklessness and low levels of skills and enterprise in their most deprived areas.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/4">I am sure that nobody in the Chamber has any trouble with a change in emphasis. I have always been of the view that the way out of poverty is through work&mdash;if a person is physically able to undertake work&mdash;and not through the benefit system. The problems in doing that are immense, but the rewards are great for both the community and the individual. Work gives confidence, dignity and financial freedom to the individual and their family, and the knock-on effects on children are palpable to see. Therefore, I do not fall out with the change of emphasis.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.2/5">The fund amounts to &pound;1.5 billion over three years. As is usual with Government announcements, that sounds like a huge figure, but it is less than what was available in the renewal fund by quite a few million. With a new fund comes new criteria, and Leeds now fails by the narrowest of margins to qualify for funds. The partnership arrangements between the Government and the city council, which aimed to deal with the problems of inner-city poverty, have been ended by a Labour Government. Those arrangements have been in place for more than 30 years under both Conservative and Labour Governments.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.0/1">My right hon. Friend is entirely correct, but if the Minister is having difficulty, let us not muck about with big figures; let us consider the schemes. This morning, I will supply him with a list of current schemes that face total cuts or 40 per cent. cuts next year down to oblivion in the third year. We are not discussing abstract figures. We are discussing schemes that work in all sorts of areas to deal with the problem of inner-city poverty, and those schemes will disappear because of this decision. That is what we are arguing about.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">The social effects are alarming. We often refer to two-speed Leeds&mdash;it is openly described in that way. As is usual in every big western city, we have a posh, prosperous centre. We also have posh, more prosperous suburbs, but in-between, as with every western city from America to Europe, we have the inner city, with all the problems that are identifiable no matter whether people are in Paris, Rome, Washington, New York or Leeds.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">I would be interested to hear whether the hon. Gentleman has any influence in Leeds city council, which is a Conservative-led body. It recently raised tens of millions of pounds through the sale of Leeds Bradford airport. It should spend that money tackling depredation by providing better transport throughout the city and, perhaps, even a bus station in Morley, which we do not have, despite being a town of 25,000 people. That would help to get people into work with more mobility. Will he write to his colleagues on the council and urge them to do that?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-02-20a.111.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1398" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="111"  time="015:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080220/halltext/80220h0008.htm#08022066000355">
	<p pid="a.111.0/1">The reason for my appearance in the debate, Mr. Gale, is that my constituency shares a lengthy border with Cambridgeshire, from St. Neots in the north all the way down the eastern side through Wrestlingworth, Gamlingay, Edworth and Dunton to the Hertfordshire border. The two counties are identical in character. Today, I want to raise some cross-border issues on which Cambridgeshire's resourcing affects my constituents. Cross-border issues do not always get much time or attention, so, although I do not expect the Minister to answer my points in detail, I feel it important to raise them for communities that often feel caught between two stools. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1759" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr. Jackson)</phrase> for raising the issue and my hon. Friends and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1473" name="David Howarth">the hon. Member for Cambridge (David Howarth)</phrase> for taking the debate forward. Of course, many of the issues that have been raised would be raised in Bedfordshire&mdash;the pressures in relation to rural crime and resources&mdash;but I do not want to spend too long on them, for obvious reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">I want to raise some of the difficulties that are caused by being in a cross-border area. First, postcodes are not always an accurate location finder in a county, because someone who lives in one county may have a postcode that refers to another. In that case, a call centre will sometimes misdirect a call and tell a resident who is waiting for assistance that they have phoned the wrong force, which causes immense frustration and upset. The Alington road industrial estate in Little Barford, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1649" name="Jonathan Djanogly">the Member for Huntingdon (Mr. Djanogly)</phrase> will know well because it is adjacent to his constituency, has had such problems. People have called the police, and it has taken a long time for the force from the right place to be sent. That lack of certainty is an issue for those people.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">A second issue is the availability of resources to deal with partnership work on the borders. Naturally, forces with constrained resources will concentrate, first, on the Home Office targets set by the Government, and, secondly, on urban areas or areas of high-volume crime. Rural crime will never be high volume compared with urban areas within or just outside our constituencies, so if resources are tight in Cambridgeshire&mdash;my hon. Friends have made it clear they are&mdash;how much attention will be given to the cross-border partnership that is necessary to ensure some degree of protection for those who live close to a border between constituency forces? What time and effort can be spent on ensuring that there is more partnership work, that scarce resources are shared, and that when police are not available in one area it will be easy to call another force on the other side of the border, which may have officers available to deal with the problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">Lastly, I want to raise on behalf of my local National Farmers Union and its chairman Charlie Porter, who has been in touch with me on the impact of crime in some outlying rural areas. Rural constituents in cross-border areas feel not only that they are relegated to minor importance because they live in a low-crime area, but that their location on the border, whether it is the Bedfordshire or the Cambridgeshire side, makes their position even more precarious.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">There has been a significant increase in the eastern region in recent months in thefts of metal, because the worldwide price for scrap has gone up very much. There is a travelling community in the eastern region that has in the past been able to pick up on thefts of metal, and there is concern about how those criminals are tracked from whatever source that might be. Again, if resources in the counties are tight, who will put time and effort into cases that cross borders and involve thieves who know what they are doing as they move through an area and how to resist attention, so that they can concentrate on their crime? There are stories of farmers in outlying areas who have been threatened and bullied, or whose wives were told when they put their heads out of the window, &quot;Just get back inside, love. Leave us to do what we are going to do, and no one will get hurt,&quot; when there is no one else in the farmhouse to protect them. People are very frightened.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">I raise those issues on behalf of the cross-border areas, where those pressures exist. I hope that the Minister will take account of cross-border issues when he gets a chance to respond, either today or in writing in due course.</p>
