<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.72.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="72"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0001.htm#08043090000468">
	<p pid="a.72.0/1">I agree that the trend is very worrying. It is important that Parliament takes note of that and that hon. Members bring their experiences to the Government so that they can be addressed. That is what I hope to do this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/2">It is important that we state that the vast majority of young people are good, law-abiding citizens. In most cases, young people are the victims of violent crime and not the perpetrators. It is important to put the issue in context before we go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/3">The nightmare in my constituency began in the early hours of <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-01">1 January</phrase> when Henry Bolombi, a young man aged 17, died in a knife attack. He was returning from seeing in the new year at Trafalgar square when a row broke out between two groups of youths at a bus stop. Currently, a 20-year-old and a 14-year-old have been bailed in connection with that murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2008-01-21">21 January</phrase>, Louis Boduka, again 18 years of age, was stabbed to death in my constituency following a daytime street brawl. A 17-year-old who vehemently denies the charges is likely to go on trial sometime later this year. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-02-15">15 February</phrase>, Ofiyke Nmezu, who was only 16 years old, was struck on the head during a street attack in Ponders End in my constituency. A week later, he died in hospital from a fractured skull. A youth from Essex, aged 18, has been charged and will appear at the Old Bailey in June.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/5">I continue. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-13">13 March</phrase>, Michael Jones, aged 18, was found with fatal head injuries following an horrific attack in the flat that he shared with his mother. A 45-year-old local man has been arrested and charged. That crime was quite distinct from the others. Finally, Rastafarian Bakari Bernard-Davis was stabbed to death in the street on the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2008-03-31">31 March</phrase>. Two black youths were seen running from the scene of the crime, but, as yet, no arrests have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/6">What we have here is four street attacks in my constituency. Three involved knives and the fourth involved a young man being hit on the head with a blunt weapon. Three of the attacks may be gang related, one possibly has a drug intention behind it, and one may have been racially motivated.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/7">As a consequence of recent events, I undertook an impromptu postal petition, which managed to gain 750-plus returned signatures&mdash;unlike that of the 20,000 of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2031" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase>. The petition, which was put together as a matter of urgency because of the developing situation, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/8" class="indent">&quot;The residents of Edmonton demand action to reduce the guns/ knives on our streets and stiffer penalties for those caught in possession of a lethal weapon.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/9">I then followed that up with a crime survey, which elicited from my constituents a number of letters, expressing concerns about what had happened. Miss. M. from South Mall in my constituency said:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Five young lives taken away, it saddens all residents and there is so little that we can do.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/11">That is a challenge to us all. Miss. B. from Osward place in my constituency said:</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/12" class="indent">&quot;I'm a 16-year-old girl and I find it disturbing to hear about all the deaths recently. I have to travel to and from college and I get scared knowing it's not safe...Being a teenager, I don't think I need to feel this way. I hope no one else has to get killed.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/13">The events are doubly shocking and, as I mentioned earlier, unprecedented. According to all the figures, crime is falling both locally and across London. For example, Enfield is the 11th safest of 32 London boroughs. In 2006-07, in terms of crimes perpetrated by 1,000 residents, Enfield had a figure of 95.6 compared with 122 for London. Even the figure for England and Wales, at just over 100, was higher than that for my borough. There was a 10 per cent. fall in the number of offences committed in the London borough of Enfield between 2003 and 2007. Violence against the person in the year to October 2007 fell by 19 per cent. in Enfield, compared with just over 7 per cent. across London. The fall was 21 per cent in my constituency. Therefore, we had a higher fall in the number of crimes of violence against the person in the year immediately before these events.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/14">Fear of crime, which is almost as important as crime itself, has also shown a downward trend. In my borough, 60 per cent. of people believed that it was not safe to go out at night in 2003. By 2007, that figure had dropped to 47 per cent. The percentage of people who are scared of going out during the day has fallen from 18 per cent. to 8 per cent. Again, those are positive figures. The position is similar across London. Murder reduced by 18 per cent. between 2002 and 2007 and knife crimes of all types, from the smallest use of a weapon through to the most serious crimes, went down by 30 per cent. in that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/15">A number of London initiatives that I would like to see in place in my borough have had a dramatic impact. For example, Operation Blunt introduced a knife amnesty. I know that there are some concerns about knife amnesties, but they have made progress in reducing the number of weapons on the streets. A lot of the operation is intelligence-based enforcement&mdash;getting into the gangs, finding out what young people are doing and being there when there is likely to be a confrontation between young people. That is the essence of the operation, and it has been successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/16">Operation Shield makes great use of portable metal detectors, the so-called arches and wands, and the initiative has been successful. It is used sometimes in schools, although I understand that there are concerns about the use of the detectors in schools, and certainly in train stations, bus termini and shopping centres. That is a helpful development. Of course, the Mayor's gangs, guns and weapons reduction board, which co-ordinates activity on youth crime, is important and does essential work in spreading best practice to address the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/17">I know that detection rates are always a matter of controversy, but the Metropolitan police has had considerable success. It increased the crime detection rate in general from 17 per cent. to 25 per cent. in the two years from 2005 to 2007, and the detection rate of street murders is more than 90 per cent. It looks likely that people will be brought to justice for most, if not all, of the relevant crimes that have been committed in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.0/18">It is important to examine some of the research that has been carried out on gang culture and the violent use of weapons. I have come across two recent studies that throw that into sharp relief. The first was by a charity called the City Bridge Trust, which carried out a comprehensive research project including a literature review, a survey of schools in its local area and a discussion with people involved in the issues of young people, gangs and the violent use of weapons. It found, first, what we would expect: that knife crime affects young people, mainly those from black and ethnic minority communities and deprived areas. I do not think that there was any surprise in that. I found it more surprising that knife crime is four times more prevalent than gun crime. The most shocking statistic that I came across was that one in four of the 16-year-olds surveyed carried a knife, and one in five claimed to have used it at some point.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.75.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0001.htm#08043090000472">
	<p pid="a.75.0/1">I agree entirely. We can learn a great deal from the long experience in Glasgow, especially about the interaction between different gangs and geographical locations. We appear to be repeating some of the experiences there, so we need to examine Glasgow carefully, especially in relation to gangs and knives and in relation to drugs and alcohol as a fuel for the activities in question.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/2">I return to what the authorities are doing. We have set up safer neighbourhood teams, which have been warmly welcomed across the House and contributed significantly to reassuring the public and reducing crime levels. In my area, there have been increased patrols by safer neighbourhood teams, and the police in general have been much more visible and on the streets. That is clearly an attempt to reassure the public that there is a response to the increase in violence that we have seen locally.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/3">Since this Monday, local resources have been reinforced by the Metropolitan police in an operation that is intended to prevent, deter and disrupt gang, criminal and violent activity in the communities in my constituency and, I hope, lead to the arrest of some of those responsible. Again, these measures have the dual purpose of getting to where the violent crimes are perpetrated and reassuring the community about what is being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/4">There has been a significant increase in the use of portable metal detectors. Last week, at one of the busiest stations in my constituency, such detectors were on show and my understanding is that they were very successful in detecting a number of weapons that were being carried and, it must be said, not just by young people. Those detectors are having some success.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/5">We have safer schools teams in Enfield and one of the largest safer schools projects in London. Those teams have been going out to schools and redoubling their efforts to try to get some of these messages across to young people. I will return to that critical activity at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/6">My local authority has also set up a commission that is very much based on the one set up by Lambeth for very similar reasons: to look into the causes and effects of the significant increase in violent crime locally and also the policies that are necessary to try to address it. Furthermore, my local authority is co-ordinating a summit to discuss the relationship between crimes and drugs. We are acutely aware that drugs fuel criminal activity and there is some evidence to suggest that they also increase the level of aggression that is shown in some of these instances of knife crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/7">I now to come to some of the areas that the Minister may be able to look at in addressing the crime issue. NCH, the children's charity, says that it is quite important that, in future, the under-16s should be included in the crime survey work that is carried out nationwide, so that we can have a better handle on the figures and also a better understanding of what is happening out there in the community. Is that idea something that the Minister has looked at?</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/8">Many people also believe that there should be a lower criminal age for the possession of violent weapons. I know that that issue has been discussed in the House and it is an issue that we need to address. If we look at the ages of the people affected and, indeed, the ages of the people carrying out these crimes, we see that some children under the age of 16 are involved, so we need to get a handle on what is happening to very young people in our community.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/9">I refer again to my petition. I did not want to mention the mayoral election at the moment, but all the major candidates are suggesting that we need tougher sentences for the possession and use of knives; indeed, in the debates that we have had in the House recently similar recommendations have been made by individual Members. Could the Minister could comment on the balance of judgment required, in relation to whether we need to send out a signal about the seriousness of the crimes that are being committed?</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/10">I want to see even more arches and wands used in our community. Shopping centres, railway stations and similar areas need to be targeted. If we are to believe the statistics, many people carry weapons. According to the statistics, 40 per cent. of young people carry weapons at some point during the day or in the evening and we need to take some action on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.0/11">There is also a great need for more research on alcohol and drugs, and their role in violent crime. A phenomenon in my constituency would not be found everywhere, because it is located mainly in the Somalian community, and that is the use of a mild drug called khat. The police in my area report to me that the combination of khat and alcohol is leading to much greater levels of aggression among Somalian youth than they have seen in the past. That is a subject where more research could be carried out. The Minister may be able to comment on the fact that the Government have funded 15 local authorities to conduct research into gang culture in their communities.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.76.1" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30b.76.1" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.76.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="76"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0001.htm#08043090000474">
	<p pid="a.76.1/1">I endorse what my hon. Friend says about the strengths of the Somalian community organisations and about their work; that has certainly been my experience in my constituency. Also, I certainly agree that many young Somalians have been traumatised by their experiences back in Somalia, where there is a vicious, ongoing civil war.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">I know that khat is not yet an illegal substance and that it is relatively new in this community. By itself, khat really is relatively harmless, but in combination with alcohol there is cause for concern. I hope that the Minister will look at that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">Fifteen local authorities have been funded to conduct research into gang culture. The one plea that I make to the Minister today is that that research programme should be extended to include other local authorities. Certainly, I make a strong case for my local authority to be included, as it needs to look at the gang culture locally and it requires the research materials to address that problem in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/4">We also need to take stronger preventive measures. I will not go into those measures as time is moving on, but we need to do more in our schools, pupil referral units and in the criminal justice system itself to divert our young people away from gangs and the gang culture that lead to the levels of violence that we now see.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/5">We also need more comprehensive youth services and I shall touch on this issue briefly. I am not sure that the Minister will be able to respond to this point, but it is important to put it on the record. This process is not just about banging down on young people; we have a responsibility to them, too. In my view, in the past, we have not exercised that responsibility effectively and we need to look at what we are doing in terms of providing youth services. Since 2000, local authorities have certainly been spending a lot more on dedicated youth services than they did before. However, the question still must be asked; are they doing anything like enough?</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/6">I could point to many examples of very good practice in my local area. The Edmonton Eagles boxing club is one example, but its work is repeated in karate, judo and other such clubs up and down the country. They do excellent work in diverting young people into sports activity. That activity gives them self-confidence and the ability to gain from the sport they undertake, and I hope that it will have a positive impact on their life.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/7">Community theatre is another example of youth services. In my area, there is a local community theatre group called Ghetto Youth theatre. In fact, it has written, produced and performed a play about knife and gun culture in our community, and that play is taken out to schools and community centres across Enfield. It does a great job in getting the right messages across.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/8">Of course, the Government have put a high priority on youth activities. I could go into detail about the &pound;150 million that the Government have set aside related to their &quot;Youth Matters&quot; Green Paper. That money will be spent this year and next year, and much of it will go directly to young people to give them a voice in their local communities, which is all to the good.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/9">In 2006, the Government laid a duty on local authorities to secure access for young people to &quot;positive activities&quot;. We are yet to see that programme bed down, but I must say that &quot;positive activities&quot; is a rather nebulous form of words in relation to the responsibilities of local authorities . The term should be better defined.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/10">The Government have also recently introduced their 10-year youth strategy. Again sums of money are attached to that strategy, and I think it will be some &pound;180 million in the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/11">One could go on and on. Various sums have been provided. Indeed, even the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families announced an initiative on children's play areas. I mention that because my local authority was fortunate enough to receive funding for that. We will get &pound;2 million and some revenue support to provide play activities in the most deprived communities in my constituency. They will focus particularly on eight to 13-year-olds, but, of course, that is an important group. They will be coming up to the danger zone, if I can call it that, in which the attractions of gang and youth culture begin to take them away from the positive activities that we are trying to engender.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/12">Many other funding schemes are available up and down the country. What we lack, and what I would like to lay on the table for discussion, is a comprehensive local youth service that reaches all the community, not one that involves our saying, as I often do when young people ask, &quot;Where are the youth facilities?&quot;, that there is a community centre two, three or four miles down the road. That is not an adequate response. I recognise that there would be a cost in delivering such a service, but it should be a Government aspiration. I shall quickly suggest some ways in which it could be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/13">First, the local authority should have a duty to draw up a youth strategy. Some years ago, the Government suggested a duty to draw up a homeless strategy. It has been successful, and most local authorities could have similar success if they were to draw up a youth strategy and try to deliver it to local young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/14">Local authorities should also have a duty to engage with representatives of young people. We have set up various youth parliaments and organisations. They all exist on a shoestring, and three or four interested young people usually get involved. We need to be much more serious about hearing young people's voices in all of this. We should be providing small grants for youth organisations. Rather than giving money to adults, professionals or the local authority, let us start giving some limited finance to young people themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/15">We need more community organisations, such as boxing clubs, judo clubs and community arts groups. They will engage young people on territory on which they can be engaged, and would deliver value for money for the Government. I hope that we would begin to see signs of reduced friction and tension in local communities and a reduction in violent crime as a consequence.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/16">The appeal I make to the Minister is that we need the stick, but let us also have the carrot. In the long term, the carrot is much more important, although I understand the need to reassure communities that action is being taken. I hope that he will engage with the debate that is about to take place, and that Parliament and the Government working together can begin to address the real concerns up and down the country about violent crime in our communities.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.87.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1641" speakername="Lynne Featherstone" colnum="87"  time="010:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0003.htm#08043090000489">
	<p pid="a.87.1/1">Or, as the hon. Gentleman said, zero attraction. Young people need somewhere to hang out; in fact, a commercial enterprise has opened a non-alcoholic pub that is incredibly successful. I do not know where that is, so if anyone knows, I would appreciate it if they could tell me. When I visit schools, the sixth formers all say that they want somewhere to hang out so they can be warm. They do not particularly like being out on the street when it is freezing, and there are ideas to deal with that that could be utilised, such as having non-alcoholic pubs.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/2">Sports facilities are important, but unfortunately even in Haringey, &pound;32,000 to develop youth sport will not go a very long way. We need to devote the funding to the need. In terms of prevention, most of all, young people need someone who cares about them when they come home, and when they are at school. Young people also need someone who cares about their achievements and what they are doing and someone who knows when they are getting into trouble. Ideally, of course, that should be a parent, but it can be any adult. Quite often the sports coaches at New River sports centre take on youngsters and encourage them to become coaches. They take an interest in an individual young person and that makes the young person want to do well and to achieve. Such schemes turn lives around and many of the volunteer coaches from that sports centre to go on to have careers. Such things are really important.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/3">As has been said, protection relates to the issue of fear. When I met Haringey youth council and youth parliament, young people said that fear of crime is their number one issue and that they are afraid because they are vulnerable to others carrying knives. Young people also think that carrying a knife gives them status. As the hon. Member for Islington, North said, if someone comes from a deprived area they might not have much, but with a knife they feel like a big guy and can say to themselves, &quot;If I can show that I'm a man, who's going to diss me now?&quot; We have to show that that is not the case. Some kids do not even realise that plunging a knife into someone's leg can be fatal; they do not necessarily know that there is an artery there that can kill someone because they think the leg area is not the same as the chest.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/4">On action to get knives off the street, yes, random arches are good at stations, but I worry that they are of limited use in schools where there is a real problem because the knives would not be taken into school. But, random use outside nightclubs is good. Intelligent stop and search should be used because at the moment it does not target carrying and barely picks up on knives. As the hon. Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington said, we need information from the community. The community knows who carries a knife and if it trusts, it will share that information. The police can then stop the relevant person. If we can remove knives from the streets, kids will not feel the need to carry them, and if that confidence is there, the intelligence will be forthcoming. The knife amnesties that bring in 90,000 knives are great, but there is not a corresponding drop in knife crime. We need to think about how those things are working.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.1/5">Will the Minister give the prosecution rate for young people carrying knives? In the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 I argued for longer sentences&mdash;the third of the three-piece punishments&mdash;and we have to send out a message on that. However, I have been unable to obtain the figures on how many young people who carry knives are prosecuted and what sentences they receive. More to the point, just arresting people, particularly young people, and putting them in prison will not help to change behaviour, and changing behaviour must be the goal of any punishment, penal system or messages that we send. We are here to help young people on to good pathways and into good lives, not to harm them permanently. We owe it to our young people to ensure that we keep the focus on all those strategies.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.91.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1593" speakername="Vernon Coaker" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="91"  time="010:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0004.htm#08043090000491">
	<p pid="a.91.0/1">It is a pleasure, Mr. O'Hara, to serve under your chairmanship. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1568" name="Andrew Love">the Member for Edmonton (Mr. Love)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on setting the tone of our discussions. He has obviously done a lot of work on the subject. I know that knife crime greatly affects his constituency. Indeed, it has affected him not only as a constituency Member but as an individual. Knife crime affects us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">The important thing to have come out of this debate is the realisation that too often debates on crime are a caricature; one is either a hanger and flogger, or one is a wishy-washy liberal. I thought that most contributions to the debate showed the futility of that argument and its ridiculous nature. Clearly, if someone is running around stabbing people, we need others to stop it. We need the police to respond in an appropriate way, as they do, and to bring it to an end.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">Tough enforcement of the law in our communities is essential; it is part of what is going on. I have not heard anyone suggest otherwise today, but the debate is often caricatured by whether or not one is a tough enforcer. Frankly, no one with a half-decent sense of the issue would say that enforcement does not play an important role. However, enforcement alone will not solve the problem. Alongside it, we need other things to happen&mdash;diverting young people, preventing crime, tackling poverty and inequality, and the other issues mentioned today.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">Let us lay the matter to rest. We should try, once and for all, to lay aside that sterile debate. As far as I can see, we have a sense of unity today; it is about putting all those things together. One without the other will fail. The important thing is how to bring those factors together. That is the first important point of principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">The second is this. We all meet large numbers of young people. Last week I met a lot of young people from NCH&mdash;the charity recently published a report on tackling violent crime&mdash;and I discussed the problem with them and dealt with a series of question. They and all the other young people that I meet in my constituency and across the country do not believe us when we say this, so I say it again and hope that it will be picked up: the vast majority of our young people are decent and law-abiding, growing up in difficult times. They do not break the law, they do not go around stabbing people, they do not commit violence, and they do not threaten elderly people. In fact, huge numbers of them help others in caring roles and in many other voluntary ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/6">We should say so and be proud of the fact. There should be as much publicity and comment about them as there is about the small number who cause such immense problems in our communities&mdash;and not to those who are most scared, namely the elderly, but to young people. It is they who demand that we do more to tackle the problem because, by and large, it is they who are the victims of such crime. I say that with some passion because although it has been said here this morning and it is repeated in many other forums in Parliament, it is rarely commented upon. That almost creates a sense of despair among our young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/7">I turn to some of the specific points raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1640" name="James Brokenshire">the Member for Edmonton. He and the hon. Member for Hornchurch (James Brokenshire)</phrase> spoke about including under-16s in the British crime survey. We are considering whether to take that forward. I understand that under-16s can be charged with possession offences, an issue raised by my hon. Friend, the hon. Member for Hornchurch and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/8">I met Assistant Commissioner Alf Hitchcock, the spokesman on knife crime for the Association of Chief Police Officers, and discussed the need to ensure that the courts have the right guidelines. Guidelines on possession offences may not be necessary for first offences if there are no aggravating factors, but they need to be sufficiently clear for the courts to know that we regard possession as a serious offence and that they should deal with it appropriately. As my hon. Friend knows, we have increased the maximum sentence available to the courts, which they can use if they wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/9">On the question of arches and wands, we made a statement a few weeks ago in which we outlined a starting point of 350 wands, 8 arches, but we hope to extend and expand the number. On CAT scanners, my hon. Friend will know from the drugs strategy that we are considering that question. We want to do some research on the matter because there are differing views about the way forward. We want to know whether there is a particular problem that needs to be addressed through CAT. If it appears that we need to take matters forward, we will, but a comment in the drugs strategy document says that we recently considered the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/10">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> spoke not only about neighbourhood policing but about broader social issues. I agree with him. As I said earlier, tackling the problem is not only about enforcement. There are housing issues, and we need to ensure that every young person has opportunity. We should not concentrate only on the bright academic young people in our communities; we need to ensure that all young people have opportunity. I am encouraged by some of the statements that the Government are now making on the importance of vocational education, and ensuring that those who can do with their hands are regarded as being equally important as those who do with their brains. That would be an important step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/11">I also agree with what my hon. Friend the Member for Islington, North said about rehabilitation in prison. People sometimes have to be locked up, but the idea that we should throw away the key is not appropriate in a civilised society. We need to ensure that, as far as possible, people do not re-offend after leaving prison.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/12">I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1604" name="Diane Abbott">the Member for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott)</phrase> about the importance of schools.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for dealing with specific issues. One of the common themes that has come out in the debate is the need for a comprehensive youth service. I know that that is not my hon. Friend's responsibility, but I ask him for two things. First, the subject goes across all Departments, so we need joined-up Government for youth provision at a local level. Secondly, will my hon. Friend take what has been said here to those Ministers responsible for youth provision, and ensure that they understand what we mean?</p>

	<p pid="a.94.1/1">I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss tuberculosis today and delighted that my right hon. Friend the Minister will reply to the debate. I am sure that she is aware that it has come about as a result of the report, &quot;Putting Tuberculosis on the Local Agenda&quot;, which was published by the all-party group on global tuberculosis, which I co-chair with the hon. Members for Arundel and South Downs (Nick Herbert) and for St. Ives (Andrew George). The group is supported, and was inspired, by RESULTS UK. The report was produced in conjunction with the British Thoracic Society, with which the group works closely on the issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/2">TB is a common and deadly infectious disease. It most commonly attacks the lungs as pulmonary TB, but it can affect any part of the body, including the brain, lymph glands, intestines, kidneys, spine, bones, joints and even the skin. During the Victorian era, it was so much part of life, so inevitable and so little understood that its existence was completely accepted as a fact of life. In the early 19th century, it may have accounted for one third of all deaths. Indeed, some argue that the UK gave TB to the rest of the world, emerging as it did from the cramped living conditions of the industrial revolution. They say that we exported it with our engines and armies and rolled it around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/3">Many people today can still remember friends and family who were struck by TB in this country up until the 1950s, and people live with the consequences of having TB. When antibiotics came, everybody thought that TB would be consigned to the history books and that it would be a disease of the past&mdash;that was a strong belief in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/4">One of my first jobs was as a social worker&mdash;I worked in a TB hospital in Sully in south Wales. At the time, my colleagues and I thought that the people we saw would be the last to have TB. The hospital is now closed, and we thought that there would be no need in future for the treatment that we gave to people but, sadly, today, more than one third of the world's population has been infected by TB and new infections occur at a rate of one per second. The emergence of drug-resistant strains has contributed to the new global epidemic and, in March, the first UK case of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis was reported in Glasgow; it was noted with a lot of publicity and is of great concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/5">The all-party group began to work with the British Thoracic Society in early 2007. The society expressed concern that the chief medical officer's action plan, &quot;Stopping Tuberculosis in England&quot;, and the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines, &quot;Clinical diagnosis and management of tuberculosis, and measures for its prevention and control&quot;, which were published in 2006, were not being implemented. At the same time, rates of TB were rising. Since the Health Protection Agency's new surveillance system was put in place in 1998, the incidence of TB has increased by a remarkable 42 per cent., from 5,658 new cases in 1998 to 8,051 in 2006. The group is pleased that the trend appeared to stabilise in 2007, but we do not know whether that was a one-off or whether the trend continues. However, we now consistently see, year-on-year, more new reported cases of TB than hepatitis C and new diagnoses of HIV. Actually, in some parts of the country, particularly London, the rates of TB are equivalent to those found in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The situation is serious.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.1/6">The report is made up of two surveys, both of which were carried out in 2007. The first was an online survey and the second a paper survey that was sent to all primary care trust chief executives. It followed the publication of the Department of Health TB toolkit in June 2007, &quot;Tuberculosis prevention and treatment: a toolkit for planning, commissioning and delivering high-quality services in England&quot;, which was a guide to help PCT commissioners to implement the NICE guidelines. The group was pleased with the response to its survey. More than 70 per cent. of PCTs responded, which was excellent, and we intended the survey to be sent out in both England and Wales.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.101.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" speakername="Richard Spring" colnum="101"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0005.htm#08043090000504">
	<p pid="a.101.2/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to see you chairing our proceedings, Mrs. Anderson? I am most grateful to the Minister for being here to respond. I shall examine the bilateral relationship between the UK and Ukraine before considering developments in Ukraine itself. Some 100,000 Ukrainians live here, and a number of organisations exist to link our two countries. I should like to highlight one in particular, the Ukrainian-British City Club, which provides a lively forum for the increasing number of Ukrainians working in the City of London. There are also student groups at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge and the London School of Economics.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/2">Last year, the British Ukrainian Society was established to act as a bridge between our two countries and as an umbrella for the many bilateral groups here and in Ukraine. It encompasses contact at political and economic, as well as social, cultural and educational levels, and it already enjoys a considerable range of activities. I should declare an interest as the chairman of the society. I am also delighted that a course in Ukrainian language and culture has been established at the department of Slavonic studies at Cambridge.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/3">Many links bind Ukraine and the United Kingdom. Whether in trade, defence, development and business or in our work through the European Union and other international bodies, the ties between the two nations are getting stronger. In recent months, London has hosted a significant number of Ukrainian events. Last month the Foreign Minister, Mr. Ogryzko, was in town. He had successful meetings with the Foreign Secretary and the shadow Foreign Secretary. To coincide with his visit, an early-day motion was tabled welcoming the important progress made by Ukraine in its democratic development and hoping that the relationship between Ukraine, the UK, NATO and the EU can be strengthened even further. It encapsulates the views of MPs across the party political divide.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/4">In September, Lady Thatcher held meetings with Yuliya Tymoshenko. More recently, President Yushchenko met my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition at the World Economic Forum in Davos. It was a very successful meeting. Next month, President Yushchenko will visit Britain. One aspect of his visit will be his desire, which is felt deeply and widely in Ukraine, to publicise the famine that killed millions of Ukrainians in the 1930s: the Holodomor, which was deliberately caused by Stalin. There is a remarkable archive on the Holodomor, and an exhibition about it is being planned with the help of the embassy and the British Ukrainian Society. On Saturday, a concert is being held in London to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the famine.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/5">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase>, who has ably and imaginatively chaired the all-party group on Ukraine. He has done an outstanding job of bringing Ukraine alive for Members of Parliament, and I pay unreserved tribute to him for it. I am delighted that an Inter-Parliamentary Union visit to Kiev will take place in early June to build links between parliamentarians. I also welcome the formation of a new group in the Rada to forge contact and friendship between our two Parliaments.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/6">The relationship between our two countries has never been better. Ukraine vividly caught the UK's attention during the Orange revolution, when Ukrainians bravely poured on to the streets to fight for democracy. Ever since those remarkable events, Britain has supported Ukraine in its reform process. It is fair to say that no country in western Europe is keener to promote the success of Ukraine than ours. Ukraine's geopolitical situation is fully recognised. Britain supported Ukraine's accession to the World Trade Organisation and fully supports its aspirations to EU membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/7">I am a governor of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, which was established in 1992 to assist in building and strengthening democratic institutions overseas, particularly after the end of the cold war. We are sponsored by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and work with political parties, Parliaments and non-governmental organisations to foster democracy through training, experience sharing and mentoring in countries around the world. Since its establishment, the WFD has worked in Ukraine to support civil society organisations, political parties through direct UK political party contact, independent media and free and fair elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/8">Despite the hope and optimism that the Orange revolution brought to Ukraine, democracy did not immediately consolidate as many first hoped. I believe that Europe did not seize quickly enough the opportunities to build on the outcome of the Orange revolution so as to entrench it, and we did not sufficiently understand its significance. Ukraine has faced teething problems, learned valuable lessons and managed to overcome many challenges thrown in its way. Through sheer determination, it has transformed itself into a new, functioning democracy. It now boasts a strong record of democratic elections, respect for human rights and free media. Of course there are sharply defined differences of view in the internal politics of Ukraine. The constitutional balance between the roles of the President and the Prime Minister is now under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/9">The importance of Ukraine's development goes way beyond its own national interests. Ukraine's success provides a positive political and economic incentive to its neighbours. It could be a shining example and model for others in the region. If Ukraine succeeds, it could encourage neighbouring countries such as Belarus and Moldova to choose a similar path to success. It is therefore critical that the democratic underpinnings in place in Ukraine are firmly consolidated. Last week, I received some excellent news about an event that could go some way towards making that happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/10">The Foreign Office plans to give the Westminster Foundation for Democracy a substantial amount of matched funding towards a parliamentary strengthening programme in Ukraine&mdash;&pound;600,000 in total. It is a clear recognition of Ukraine's importance that it has been singled out for the programme, and it is a hugely welcome development. As Ukraine is a new democracy, its Parliament has a limited number of people available who are experienced and knowledgeable in parliamentary practice. The pace of development in that field has been inhibited by the lack of programmes to institutionalise the experience and knowledge of Ukrainian MPs and parliamentary staff and transfer relevant knowledge and experience from more developed Parliaments. The WFD has taken the lead to form a consortium of leading UK experts in parliamentary strengthening to address more effectively the issues faced by Parliaments such as Ukraine's.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/11">Despite the political problems, the country has been enjoying strong economic growth, and the signs of prosperity are apparent. I recently attended a Ukrainian investment seminar here in London. It was evident that despite growing inflation in Ukraine, its economy as a whole continues to go from strength to strength. From January to March this year, Ukraine's gross domestic product grew by 6 per cent. annualised.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/12">The drive for reform is led in many respects by the Ukrainian business community. Ferrexpo, the UK holding company that owns Ukraine's largest iron ore exporter, began trading last year on the London stock exchange. Many other companies have been or will be listed here in London. Despite high inflation, the Ukrainian economy demonstrated robust economic growth in 2007, higher than that of most other countries in the region and central and south-eastern Europe&mdash;an impressive performance, despite huge increases in the price of imported natural gas and high world crude oil prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/13">Investment opportunities continue to look good for exporters and investors. Britain is the fourth largest investor in Ukraine, and there are now more than 85 companies in Ukraine with British connections, representing a cross-section of sectors. Property and real estate, trade, finance, transport and communications and machine building currently attract most of the British investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/14">Ukraine is an attractive investment destination for a number of important reasons. Ukraine has a highly educated work force with almost 60 per cent. university enrolment, a large domestic market with increasing purchasing power, an improving business climate, relatively low wages and excellent agricultural, industrial and high-tech potential, in addition to the prolonged period of economic growth that the country has enjoyed. Because all of us as parliamentarians are so acutely aware of it, it is worth pointing out that at a time of pressure on world agricultural production, Ukraine, with its huge agricultural potential, is in an increasingly important position to take advantage of it. It is not for nothing regarded as one of the world's bread baskets. At a time of world food shortages and ever higher prices, Ukraine has lifted grain export restrictions, which is most welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/15">After 14 years of negotiations, Ukraine has been accepted as a member of the World Trade Organisation. Hailed, by President Yushchenko, as a truly historic moment and a decisive milestone in the country's development, accession has been a joint accomplishment of the past four Governments, which I greatly welcome. Analysts predict that membership of the WTO will lead to an even greater acceleration of economic growth, resulting from an increase in exports and investment as European businesses are given greater access to the Ukrainian market.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/16">As a result of WTO membership, Ukraine has already started official negotiations with the European Union on creating a free trade zone, which should include not only a free trade area, but energy sphere co-operation and strengthened reform efforts and civil society in the Ukraine. President Yushchenko forecasts that the new enhanced agreement will be signed in September. We know that, despite the very considerable burden imposed by the European Commission through the Copenhagen accession criteria, the road to EU membership does encourage the political, judicial and economic reform process.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/17">The EU appears to be suffering from something approaching enlargement fatigue, and the signals to Ukraine have been mixed at best. The Minister will know that enlargement commends itself to all hon. Members in the House, in contrast to attitudes prevailing in some European countries. I hope, therefore, that he will take this opportunity to reiterate our clear support for Ukraine's EU membership objectives and our intention to work constructively to speed up the process, in the interests of Ukraine and the whole continent of Europe. If flexibility is required, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, it should be supported.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/18">Ukraine's application to join NATO is another recent development. Despite no specific date for the membership action plan, NATO's declaration that Ukraine would eventually gain membership has been welcomed. It is the only partner country to support actively all NATO-led operations and missions, as well as practically every international peacekeeping mission under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The aim of NATO enlargement is a broader and more secure Europe&mdash;a goal to which Ukraine would certainly contribute.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/19">All in all, in its major contribution to the peace and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and beyond, Ukraine has proved to be a very valuable NATO partner. However, NATO membership would require broad support in Ukraine. The close historic ties between Russia and Ukraine, and the former's very specific view of the latter, is a source of tension between the two countries. However, after the past delivery and payment problems with energy supplies, it is good that Ukraine has paid off its gas import debts to Russia, which I hope will result in a generally more comfortable relationship between them.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.2/20">Undoubtedly, Ukraine has some tough choices ahead, but with its increasing economic prosperity, the chance to showcase itself to the world as host of the 2012 European football championships, and the continuing consolidation of democracy, I am optimistic that Ukraine faces a very hopeful future.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.109.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="109"  time="014:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0006.htm#08043090000514">
	<p pid="a.109.5/1">And lost; I am a Millwall supporter. I am not suggesting that we make our winning British club teams even less British by importing more people from abroad, but players from Dynamo Kiev and elsewhere are very welcome if they can be afforded and come and join us.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/2">My third topical point is that as we all know, we have elections tomorrow, not just here in London but in the whole of Wales and England. One thing that has brought Ukraine to the attention of the British public has been the democratic process, which has been very exciting and dramatic. I want to give a little quiet encouragement. Of course things have been difficult, such as the constitutional arrangement, which has changed and developed since 1991. In a new and evolving independent democracy, that is what one would expect. We are not without our difficulties in our country when it comes to elections, as you well know from your part of the world and elsewhere, Mrs. Anderson. We do not do everything perfectly and we do not get it all right.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/3">The good news, in a way, is that Ukraine, just like us, does not have a straight two-party system. There are blocs, and no party gets an overall majority, so there have to be negotiations. Sometimes they take a bit of time, but the United States does not solve such things immediately, as I recollect from a recent presidential election. I hope that people in Ukraine are not discouraged by that. Politics is sometimes difficult, but persistence pays off. I pay tribute to the persistence of the President, the Prime Minister, present and past Foreign Ministers and others who are determined to make a go of democracy and make Ukraine as credible as any other democracy in Europe. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1901" name="Bruce George">The right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)</phrase> paid tribute to the fact that the system has evolved quickly and become one that commands respect, having not originally met standards. We need to flag that up. None of us does democracy perfectly, and Ukraine has shown very well how to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/4">I wish to make three substantive points. First, sometimes we in Britain&mdash;I am sure that this does not apply to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&mdash;forget how important a European country Ukraine is. Not only is it the second largest European country, it has a population of getting on for 50 million. It is almost in the big league with Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom and obviously Russia, which is both European and Asian. Although we sit off the western edge of the European land mass and Ukraine sits in the heart of the land mass at the other edge of Europe, we would do Ukraine and Europe no service if we neglected its potential and importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/5">The hon. Member for West Suffolk mentioned Ukraine's huge agricultural importance. That is important not just for Ukraine but because of its ability to serve a continent in a day and age when we are all seeking to have food shipped from one end of the world to the other less frequently. It would be far better to ensure that we fed ourselves within each continent as far as possible, and grew our own food for our own people.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/6">Secondly, Ukraine is strategically important to energy supplies not just for its own part of Europe but for Europe as a whole. We all understand that there are private sector interests, but public-led interests are also very much at play. We always want to say to Russia and Ukraine that there must be a negotiated agreement. That may be difficult&mdash;of course such things are difficult&mdash;but everybody's interests are served by the security of supply at a time when there are threats and risks to the energy industry and we are all trying to reduce our consumption.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/7">Thirdly, Ukraine is hugely important because of its entrepreneurial spirit. The hon. Gentleman commended the fact that one driver of the ever-closer links between the UK and Ukraine is business interests. I have been hugely impressed whenever I have spoken to business people about their willingness to go and do business in Ukraine, and by Ukrainians' willingness to come and do business here, including in the brewing, sugar and construction industries. I hope that the building of football stadiums does not mean that the people in the construction industry, whom we need here to do things such as complete the Olympic site, will instead go off to build stadiums in Poland and Ukraine. I hope that we can have a division of labour.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/8">I have two final things to say. First, I pay tribute to the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, which is an excellent organisation. In particular, it has recognised how important support for the deep development of institutional structures in Ukraine is. Members of the Rada are willing to work with Members of the UK Parliament to exchange experience and political learning. I hope that we can go further, and there have been conversations about the issue. There should be co-operation and dialogue between staff in our Parliaments, as well as between our civil servants and researchers. There should be dialogue between the UK's devolved Administrations and the autonomous region of Crimea, because they have a lot to learn from each other. There should be dialogue between our political parties, and I pledge on behalf of the Liberal Democrat party that we will be happy to continue pursuing such developments, not only around Kiev, but in the east, the north, the south and the west. We must also ensure that more women are involved in politics so that the country becomes a vibrant democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/9">I also pay tribute to the others who are building bridges. The British Council is really valuable in Ukraine, and the BBC now has a significant listenership for its Ukrainian language service. The bridges are becoming ever stronger, and the developments in Ukraine are extremely welcome and positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.109.5/10">Of course, it is for the Ukraine Government to decide when and how they become more fully integrated into the European Union. However, my colleagues and I hope that it will not be long before Ukraine takes its full place as an independent country in a European Union of independent countries so that people recognise the phenomenal contribution that it has made, is making and will make not only to its part of Europe, but to Europe and the world as a whole.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.111.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" speakername="John Grogan" colnum="111"  time="015:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0007.htm#08043090000515">
	<p pid="a.111.0/1">It gives me great pleasure to follow contributions from three such distinguished and experienced parliamentarians. I calculate that they have no less than seven decades of parliamentary experience between them, which almost&mdash;I stress, almost&mdash;makes me feel young again. I pay tribute to all three of them. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" name="Richard Spring">The hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)</phrase> gave a measured and comprehensive overview of the issues facing Ukraine. We then had a clarion call for democracy from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1901" name="Bruce George">the Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)</phrase>, who, if anything, underplayed his role as the OSCE's chief observer in the elections some years ago. His role in Ukraine was crucial, and his keen observation and willingness to speak the truth will be credited there for many decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/2">I am also grateful to be following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, because I want to start where he did by stressing some of the human links between our two countries. He mentioned football, and I first became aware of Ukraine as a result of playing football. I am the grandson of an Irish Catholic migrant to Yorkshire and I remember playing with, and occasionally against, the grandsons of Ukrainian migrants to Yorkshire&mdash;as I recall, they did not take any prisoners on the football field. That was my first link to Ukraine and the first time that I became aware of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/3">As the years went by, and the iron curtain fell, I made friends and acquaintances among younger members of the Ukrainian community, some of whom had perhaps come to the west for the first time. When the orange revolution happened, some of them contacted me in Parliament and asked what Parliament was doing about it. At that stage, the all-party group was not very active, but it was one of those moments in history when there was only one side to be on&mdash;the side of counting votes properly and having a proper democratic election. Now, the all-party group has links with politicians of all shades of opinion in Ukraine, and we are delighted to have members of the Tymoshenko bloc and the Party of the Regions with us today.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/4">The orange revolution was a pivotal moment in Ukrainian democracy. What a joy it was to be alive in Ukraine after that&mdash;everything seemed to go right. Not only was there an orange revolution, but Ukraine qualified for the football World cup for the first time, economic growth took off and the country had not just one, but two world heavyweight boxing champions. It even won the Eurovision song contest, and we in Britain know how hard that is. Obviously, there was bound to be a bit of a reaction after such a honeymoon period.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/5">As other hon. Members and acting members of the all-party group have said, we in Parliament try to do our bit. We are looking forward to hosting President Yushchenko and the Holodomor exhibition in Parliament in a couple of weeks, and there will also be the Inter-Parliamentary Union visit. The hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey was right to stress the rich variety of organisations in Britain promoting links between Ukraine and Britain. The British Ukrainian Society, which he leads so ably, has taken such activities to a new level in the past year. Similarly, the Ukrainian-British City Club in London brings together young professionals. That highlights what a great asset young Ukrainian professionals in London will be to Ukraine in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/6">I could discuss many of the current issues that have been touched on and which are being fiercely debated in the Rada. As has been said, there is a debate about whether Ukraine should stick with and strengthen its presidential system of government or move to a more parliamentary system. There are debates about the economy, with the Rada ratifying one of the 60 elements that are needed for full World Trade Organisation ratification to take place&mdash;the debate on the WTO will probably last as long as our recent debates about the EU. There is also a debate about inflation, which is now touching 30 per cent, and measures have had to be taken in recent weeks to bring it down. Finally, there is the very important debate about NATO, which has been touched on.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/7">I thought, however, that I would make four more general, but crucial points about the future of Ukraine. My right hon. Friend the Member for Walsall, South concentrated on the development of democracy and referred to the OSCE's judgement that the most recent elections had pretty much met almost the highest standards that one could expect of such elections. Friends of Ukraine in Britain are pleased that those democratic standards are being met, although we would rather that Ukraine reached the point where it did not have to prove its democratic standards by having a general election every six months. It is good that a Government have been formed, and I hope that there will now be a period of stability. The fundamental point, which more than one hon. Member has touched on, is that if democracy and much-needed progress in the judicial system&mdash;the country needs to go much further in establishing the rule of law&mdash;can take hold, Ukraine will have a competitive edge, particularly in attracting investment. As the hon. Member for West Suffolk said, the rule of law, democracy and a free media are not nearly as developed in many of Ukraine's neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/8">One of the advantages of having frequent elections as part of the democratic process in a young democracy is that the different parties have observed those elections in different regions of the country. This has been the first time that many young people who have supported a political party avidly enough to want to observe the elections have been able to do so. This is the first time, for example, that people from Donetsk have been to the west of Ukraine and vice versa and have taken part in electoral activity as part of civil society. Such things are binding the country together again and giving people a different view. It is also encouraging that although the east of the country generally votes one way and the west votes another, that is by no means monolithic now, and people in both the east and the west are voting against that trend. That can only strengthen democracy in Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/9">Finally on democracy, it is significant that the Rada is considering a law on the role of the Opposition. That was highlighted at the Foreign Office conference at Wilton Park, which many Ukrainian parliamentarians took part in, and which I was privileged to go along to for a little while. It took our Parliament centuries to appreciate such things. Hard though it is for me as a Labour politician to admit this, there will be a Conservative Government one day, and Conservative Ministers will have the cars and give the statements&mdash;I confidently predict that. It is part of the practice of a mature democracy that we treat others as we would want to be treated if we were in the same circumstances. Things such as the development of Short money and respect for the role of the Opposition are very important, and Ukraine is rapidly developing that culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/10">Just a few weeks ago there was a conference in London to promote investment in Euro 2012. It was extremely moving that the shadow Foreign Minister, a member of the party of the Regions, gave a speech, supported by all his colleagues from the different parties in Ukraine, in which he said that the issue was so important that everyone needed to unite behind it, and make 2012 a success. That is my second point. Many hon. Members have mentioned 2012, but it is well worth mentioning that just as we must absolutely get the Olympics right, for the sake of the United Kingdom's reputation, equally Ukraine, together with Poland, must make sure that 2012 works well. There are reasons for concern at the moment. Michel Platini of UEFA has expressed some concern, and Rada members of all parties, and, indeed, the mayors of the host cities, are all keen to get the infrastructure in place. There may be&mdash;I know there will be&mdash;points of co-operation between London and Kiev when we are both at the centre of the sporting world in 2012; and reputation, so my friends in investment banks tell me, is the thing above all that determines investment. Ukraine's reputation is on the line in 2012 and I am sure the nation will rise to the challenge, but it cannot be complacent.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/11">Thirdly, there is the question of relations with Russia. In recent weeks there have been encouraging signs that, despite strong rhetoric from both sides, both nations are capable of doing deals, when necessary. Earlier this week the Russian and Ukrainian Prime Ministers had important talks. <i>Kommersant</i> reported:</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The decision was made to recommend that Gazprom and Naftogaz Ukrainy 'conclude a long-term agreement on the delivery of gas to Ukraine and its transit through it'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/13">In the European Union, where a quarter of gas supplies come by such a route, that will be welcome. The Ukrainian Prime Minister was reported on Ukrainian news as saying that the two countries have prepared a plan for developing co-operation in ten priority areas, and the Russian Prime Minister described the work of the Ukrainian-Russian intergovernmental commission as sufficiently efficient&mdash;quite a phrase in itself. Those reports show that business can be done by the two nations.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.0/14">As other hon. Members have done, I want to say a word about Ukraine's European Union ambitions. It is perhaps one of the prime purposes of the all-party group to do a bit to advance those ambitions. There are two ways of thinking about the matter. Such ambitions can present a tremendous opportunity for Ukraine, and particularly its young people, in travel and business. However, what Ukraine can do for Europe is also important, as other hon. Members have said. Increasingly, Ukraine is an important actor in the region, in all sorts of discussions on issues including Moldova. Ukraine is a country, as has been said, with a rich history, and there is debate there about how much it should look to the future and how much it needs to come to terms with its history, including such events as the famine. That debate is for Ukrainians to have. However, with its rich history, and given the indisputable claim that Ukraine is a European nation with a place in the history of the continent and which can draw on that history and on the vitality of its young people, it will, before too long, take its place as part of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" name="Richard Spring">the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)</phrase> on securing the debate, and I pay tribute to his hard work as the chairman of the British Ukrainian Society. In his speech he set out very clearly the bilateral relations between our country and Ukraine and an overview of that intriguing country's history and current situation. Positively, he also pointed out the very good work being done to strengthen links between our countries, and in particular by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> and the all-party group on Ukraine that he chairs. It is particularly good to hear that a delegation of MPs will visit Ukraine later in the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">As with so many Westminster Hall debates about various countries, we should recognise that while the relationship with the country itself is important, we benefit from the presence of many people&mdash;in this case tens of thousands of Ukrainians&mdash;who live and work and contribute to society in Britain. It is important to be aware of that community and the positive impact that it can have on our economy and society.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">So far, we have had an excellent debate, with contributions from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1901" name="Bruce George">the right hon. Member for Walsall, South (Mr. George)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1831" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> and the hon. Members for Selby (Mr. Grogan) and for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound). I confess that I have been somewhat lost along the way with some of the football metaphors, but that aside I have certainly found the debate to be particularly interesting.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/4">In my brief remarks, I would like to touch on the relationship between Ukraine and the various international organisations, on the issue of the energy and on a couple of other issues before winding up. First, I would like to share with the Members present today my own experience of Ukraine, which thankfully is slightly wider than just reading a rather excellent novel, &quot;A Short History of Tractors in Ukrainian&quot;, by Marina Lewycka.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/1">I bow to the hon. Gentleman's superior pronunciation; no doubt my version will look alright in <i>Hansard</i>, as long as I ensure that I give them my notes. One of the things that brought that book to mind was hearing the hon. Member for West Suffolk talk about the famine in the 1930s, the horrors of which are described in the book. It is clearly quite right that awareness is raised of that tragic period in Ukrainian history. As with so many events of that nature, it is important that, even once living memory fades, the rest of us do not forget because that is the best defence that we have against such an event happening again.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/2">The hon. Member for West Suffolk also paid great tribute to WFD, the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, of which he is a governor and director. It is certainly excellent news that extra money has been allocated to help WFD programmes in Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/3">My only visit to Ukraine was in 2006 and it was not with WFD but with a programme that was being run by the European Parliament and the National Democratic Institute, which is a sort of American version of WFD. That visit was to assist with running a workshop called &quot;Win With Women&quot;, aimed at women politicians, both current and aspiring, within Ukraine. It had training delivered by women parliamentarians from across Europe and particularly by people involved in politics here in the UK. It is interesting that, in a country that obviously has a very strong woman role model in Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko, there are sadly still very few women Members of Parliament; indeed, I think that the situation there is even worse than here in the UK, which itself is obviously not one of the best in the world in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/4">My impressions of that training workshop were incredibly positive. There was a real feeling of excitement among the women politicians and I may say that there were quite a few very strong voices that clearly will definitely be heard within the Rada. Although it was a very short visit, my impression was that Ukraine is a country that is quite full of character and one that is also increasingly confident.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/5">That was only a short visit, so one of the advantages that I always find of debates such as this one in Westminster Hall is the opportunity to listen to the contributions from many other Members, benefiting from their experiences and expertise on issues. My view is that one always learns something in Westminster Hall and today has been no different.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/6">Moving on to the relationships between Ukraine and various international organisations, obviously the recent NATO summit brought the very welcome news that the negotiations can continue with regard to Ukraine joining NATO. The only slight note of disappointment was that that exciting news was not brought to the House in the form of an oral statement but was released in a written statement. None the less, it is certainly news that is very welcome. Indeed, the future path looks very positive. To quote from the post-summit declaration, there will be:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/7" class="indent">&quot;a period of intensive engagement...at a high political level&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/8">with a progress report due by the end of this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/9">However, as has already been mentioned by various Members during this debate, it is important that we manage to calm Russian fears about NATO expansion. To do that, we need to demonstrate that NATO is no longer about an extension of the cold war but has moved on to deal with the current challenges facing us, such as the situation in Afghanistan, which is also a worry for countries such as Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/10">That aside, however, it is very important that the post-summit declaration was very clear that it is not up to Russia to exercise any kind of veto over whether or not Ukraine joins NATO. The declaration said:</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/11" class="indent">&quot;We reiterate that decisions on enlargement are for NATO itself to make.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/12">I wholeheartedly endorse that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/13">The recent developments regarding Ukraine signing up to membership of the World Trade Organisation are also very positive, particularly as membership might lead to a free trade agreement with the EU, as we hope will be the case, and in due course towards EU membership, if that is what the Ukrainian people want. It is by no means definite what path they will choose; public opinion is somewhat divided and no doubt they will have very heated and engaged debates about Ukraine's future, within or outside the EU, as we often have in our own country, especially over the past few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/14">I would like to turn now to the issue of energy. From just looking at a map, it is obvious that Ukraine occupies a key position strategically regarding energy supplies. Of course, we all remember very well the dispute between Ukraine and Russia that occurred between 2005 and 2006, when gas supplies were heavily disrupted, not necessarily to the UK but certainly to many of our EU neighbours. Such disputes are obviously a great cause for concern going forward, as competition for energy supplies increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/15">Regarding the specific problems that caused that dispute, we would all agree that Ukraine, in time, should pay a market rate for its gas supplies, but a sudden quadrupling of the price was always going to be impossible for the country to bear. A smoother transition and phasing-in of a market rate must be the way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/16">If Russia decides to use its energy supplies as a political tool, that would be a cause for concern. However, before getting overly worried about this issue, we should remember that there is a mutually dependent relationship between the EU and Russia. Yes, the EU needs Russian gas but equally Russia needs the EU market for its gas. That said, if we increase the number of pipeline routes between the sources of gas and the markets for gas, that can only aid our energy security. In the event of future disputes occurring&mdash;we obviously would not want to see them happen, but if they did&mdash;we obviously have a responsibility to ensure that the rest of Europe is able to receive their energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/17">When the Minister sums up, it will be interesting to see if he is able to say whether or not the recent meeting between the Ukrainian delegation and his colleague, the Foreign Secretary, and other members of his Department, brought forward any interesting points about how energy security could be ensured in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/18">I would like to touch briefly on a couple of other issues. The hon. Member for Selby characterised well the internal power struggles in Ukraine since 2004. In preparation for this debate, I printed out a sort of time line of Ukraine and just following that time line since December 2004 is an incredibly complicated thing to do, with various people being Prime Minister or President and elections here and there; the recent political situation looked somewhat like a game of musical chairs. Since the outcome of last autumn's elections, I think that we can hope now for a period of greater stability, which hopefully will enable the country to focus on the business of governing rather than on internal politicking. Let us just remain optimistic on that front for now.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/19">Finally, the issue of the Schengen agreement is worth raising. Since December 2007, that agreement has been extended and now includes 24 countries, including the eastern European states. So there is a huge border of the Schengen area with Ukraine; the border with Poland alone is 526 km long. It is potentially a huge task to police that border and I would be interested if the Minister had any early assessments&mdash;obviously, it has only been a few months since the extension of the agreement&mdash;as to how policing that border is working and whether there have been any problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.2/20">In conclusion, the relationship between the UK and Ukraine is hugely important and currently it looks very positive. It is obviously important that the Government should continue to build on that solid foundation, but it is also important for Members of Parliament to play our role and to ensure that, within the communities that we represent, we forge and build links between the two countries.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.1/1">I thank Mr. Speaker for selecting this debate. I also thank the Financial Secretary to the Treasury for her attendance this afternoon; I am sure that we will be given the answer to the problem that I am about to raise.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/2">I am delighted to have secured a debate about VAT on the membership of sports and leisure trusts. It is an important issue, not only in my constituency but in the neighbouring constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase>. It is also a problem across the entire country, both north and south of the border. There has been correspondence on the subject between my hon. Friends the Members for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) and for Eltham (Clive Efford) as well as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" name="Adam Ingram">the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr. Ingram)</phrase>. The topic is important also as a consequence of a recent report undertaken by Audit Scotland, which states that youngsters' participation in sport is not likely to meet Government targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/3">By way of background, the policy of Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is that unlimited access to all leisure facilities in a leisure centre, typically in return for a monthly or annual payment, is liable to VAT at the standard rate. North Ayrshire Leisure Ltd. is losing not only money, which is important, but it is losing membership over the issue. I am told that back payments&mdash;the policy is being applied retrospectively over the last three years&mdash;are &pound;120, 000, and it has lost just under 100 members due to that imposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/4">South Lanarkshire is in an even worse state. It could lose something in the order of &pound;1 million. I understand from representations made to me that that is the average for the whole of the United Kingdom&mdash;tens of millions of pounds are being lost as a result of this application by HMRC.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.2/1">I warned the hon. Gentleman in advance that I intended to intervene, and I am grateful to him for giving way. He will, of course, be concerned about his local leisure trusts and the others that he has mentioned. However, private-sector companies that run leisure centres have always paid VAT. Although one sympathises with North Ayrshire Leisure, it could be argued that it should pay VAT so that the private and the public sectors can compete equally.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. He rightly said that the issue is of great consequence to both our constituencies. He has referred to North Ayrshire Leisure, which is in difficulties as a result of the change in policy. Does he agree that the public sector has been at the forefront in trying to expand participation in sport, particularly for those from deprived backgrounds? It is vital that we do everything we can to ensure that such public-sector sporting facilities are as cheap as possible.</p>

<gidredirect oldgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.134.0" newgid="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30b.134.0" matchtype="changes"/>
<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-04-30a.134.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" speakername="Brian H Donohoe" colnum="134"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080430/halltext/80430h0010.htm#08043090000533">
	<p pid="a.134.0/1">I accept that point. I hope that the Financial Secretary is listening. I hope now to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/2">One of the main problems is that some services provided by leisure centres, such as sauna facilities, are subject to VAT. However, people who go for a swim and then a sauna should have some part of the charge exempted from VAT. I am told that that is not how the tax is applied. That is the nub of what I perceive to be the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/3">The taxman's long-held view is that if an all-inclusive fee is charged that covers all the services provides by such a centre, it indicates a single supply for VAT purposes. For instance, a membership fee that entitles the member to use all the facilities within such a centre&mdash;I have one in my constituency; it is called the Magnum Leisure Centre&mdash;will attract VAT.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/4">I started studying the system when I was requested to apply for this debate. It has become very bureaucratic. It is a labyrinth; it is almost impossible to establish the simple facts. Visitors to a leisure centre are charged for the services that they use; the exact VAT position of the service can then be taken into account. Customer who do not pay a membership fee are instead charged for the services used. If they swim, there will be no VAT to pay as it is exempt. However, if they want to use the sauna, VAT will be applied.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/5">We need to take a common-sense approach, and I have known the Minister long enough to realise that she applies common sense. I therefore expect to get a sensible answer, so that we can bring the matter to a conclusion in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/6">We are hosting the Olympic games in 2012, and north of the border we have the Commonwealth games in Glasgow in 2014. Those are two of the greatest sporting events in the world&mdash;except for the World cup, of course; we are not hosting it this time, but we hope to do so one day. It seems bizarre, in these circumstances, that we should be hampered in the sports field and are not able to promote sport because of the charging of VAT. It is having a severely detrimental effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/7">I dispute the idea that any of the leisure services provided by leisure facilities should be deemed liable for VAT; I argue that they all have demonstrable sporting and educational benefits. The fact is that not-for-profit organisations such as North Ayrshire Leisure have the principal aim of increasing participation in leisure activities across all sectors of the local community, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran mentioned. However, many people in the area are poor. I argue that a leisure trust should not have the burden of VAT placed upon it, as it will ultimately be passed on to the users of the facilities by way of extra charges or reduced investment. That will be to the detriment of the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/8">The tax burden will have a profoundly negative impact on the future of hundreds of sports and leisure trusts across the country, which face significant financial uncertainty. In turn, that will harm affordable, accessible sports facilities for the community. While I have been a Member, the Government have been trying to promote healthier lifestyles. Given the wider health benefits of sport and leisure, HMRC's current stance does not make too much sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.0/9">I said earlier that a number of representations had been made to me. One of them was made by the Sports and Recreation Trust Association, a national organisation usually known as SpoRTA. It has been advised by PricewaterhouseCoopers and tax counsel that the way in which HMRC is seeking to charge VAT is wrong in law. HMRC's decision to charge VAT retrospectively for some trusts may result in their liquidation. Indeed, in my constituency that is a severe threat. My fear, and that of my colleagues, is that that is a possible conclusion if the situation is allowed to develop. Higher membership fees at leisure centres would be necessary to cover the VAT liability, which could lead to a significant drop in participation, especially among those form poorer communities. That contradicts the Government's aim of increasing participation in physical activity, and HMRC's decision contradicts the Government's efforts to promote healthier lifestyles.</p>

	<p pid="a.135.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing the debate and agree with everything that he has said. Would he go further and say that HMRC's position&mdash;it is not only to seek to apply VAT but to backdate payments, as a result of the test case against The Highland Council in my constituency&mdash;makes matters a great deal worse for the leisure trusts? They would have to meet that call and pay HMRC back as well as their ongoing tax liability.</p>

	<p pid="a.136.2/1">It is a pleasure to be here this afternoon under your chairmanship, Mrs. Anderson. I should say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> that I would normally have agreed a way forward, but I am a servant of the House on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1962" name="Brian H Donohoe">the Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr. Donohoe)</phrase> on securing this debate on an important issue relating to local sports provision. I am aware of the importance that he and many other hon. Members attach to the issue. A debate such as this enables me to take a step back from what is a complex, technical issue, on which HMRC has clear rules that it must apply&mdash;they are not subject to ministerial influence because they relate directly to tax and case law.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/3">I am alive to the hon. Gentleman's concerns. Indeed, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> has written to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the matter and a reply is being considered. I want to think about, and take into account, the points that have been raised in the debate before advising on how to reply to the letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/4">It is worth putting on record that, clearly, access to good quality sporting provision is an essential part of enabling people to lead healthier lives and to participate in sport. My hon. Friend the Member for Central Ayrshire was right: the 2012 Olympics can, as I believe they will, provide a major catalyst for increased sporting participation in the UK and overseas. In the run up to the games, the Government will work to support more people to lead a more active lifestyle. On matters over which we have responsibility, we will continue to promote sport, including at school, community and elite levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.2/5">A number of reliefs already apply and the Government have an excellent record of promoting community sports through the tax system. For example, we have allowed community amateur sports clubs that meet certain eligibility criteria to benefit from a range of tax reliefs. Charitable sport and leisure trusts are exempt from tax on most forms of income and gains, including capital gains tax and stamp duty. Charities also receive a mandatory 80 per cent. relief from business rates and benefit from a range of tax incentives for individual and corporate donors, such as gift aid and payroll giving.</p>
