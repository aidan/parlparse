	<p pid="a.150.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and for the extremely important points that he makes. I was about to say that the IT sector is at a disadvantage when only 20 per cent. of its work force are women, compared with just under half of the UK's national work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/2">My hon. Friend is right to say that it is not only in the IT industry that we need to have IT skills. There are very few occupations now where some IT skills are not an important part of the job.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/3">It is predicted that women will make up the majority of the working population by 2018, so to get more women into the IT sector is &quot;a must&quot; for the work force, business profitability and growth, and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/4">BlackBerry and the women's networking group Aurora hosted the women and technology awards in October. I was pleased to be invited to present one of the prizes and to speak about the event's importance. Award ceremonies such as those&mdash;organised by industry&mdash;recognise and celebrate women's achievements. They raise awareness that women have talents to offer. The overall winner at the women and technology awards was Jackie Edwards from De Montfort university. She has helped women who have been out of the workplace for several years to learn IT by talking to them and showing them how things work. She has done a great deal to build their confidence not only to re-enter the workplace but to re-enter the information technology sector using the skills that they have learned. I was delighted that BlackBerry recognised her contribution to making a real difference at grass-roots level.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/5">I shall move on now to talk about women with science, engineering and technology qualifications. We need more women with those skills. It is a concern that 70 per cent. who have science, engineering and technology qualifications are not working in sectors that use those skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.0/6">Last year the Government set up the UK resource centre for women in science, engineering and technology. I visited it in early September&mdash;it is just up the road from me, in Bradford&mdash;to see the work that is done there. I met women there whom the centre had supported. They had learned how to use their knowledge of and skills in science and technology in their work. Through talking to women who were looking to return from a career break, it was clear that the work that they were doing at the centre was enabling them to return to the areas in which they were qualified. It had previously been difficult for those women to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.150.1/1">My hon. Friend will know that I have also visited the women's resource centre in Bradford. I take the opportunity to congratulate the Government on establishing the resource centre, which had been desperately needed for years.</p>
	<p pid="a.150.1/2">The centre has within its grasp a collection of outstanding women who have been working in the field of science, engineering and technology for decades but who have done so poles apart. That facility brings those women together. Can the Minister reassure me that the Government will continue to support the centre to deliver its objectives, which are commendable and desperately needed?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.151.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="151"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.151.0/1">The Government have invested in that area because we must act to prevent a loss of skills to our economy in an area that is important to future growth. The UK resource centre is developing, not just in science, engineering and technology, but more widely in its links to universities and the construction industry. The centre performs a vital role in attempting to reverse the current situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/2">At the centre, I met employers from the region, some of whom were from the construction industry. We know that too few women go into construction and, too often, those that do face prejudice and discrimination. As I am from Yorkshire, I can say that one employer, in true, blunt Yorkshire style, told me that, in his experience, women in construction jobs were often more capable than men, but were often assumed to be less so. He had had conversations with others in the construction industry who had shared that experience. As a result of that experience, they were beginning to change employers' minds.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.0/3">Fortunately, we also have significant allies in the business world who take occupational segregation seriously. In July, cosmetics firm L'Or&eacute;al and the UK resource centre announced a programme to address some of the issues faced by female scientists when returning to work after a career break.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.151.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="151"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.151.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her contribution on the experience of talking to people in the construction industry. As I said, my conversations were beneficial in highlighting that the experience of employing women was changing minds. We cannot do too much to share positive experiences and good practice. That is why the work of L'Or&eacute;al and the UK resource centre is important. Their programme provides three cash bursaries of &pound;10,000 each, which are jointly funded by the partners, and granted to women scientists each year. They are putting money and investment into this area, as, indeed, are the Government. For those of you who are not familiar with the UK resource centre, I invite you to visit its website to see the range of its activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/2">I am sure that hon. Members were delighted that London secured the 2012 Olympics. Hon. Members will wish to see the games act as a springboard for women in science, engineering and technology. It is an excellent time for women to get involved not only as athletes, but in senior roles and in all aspects of making the games happen, not least in the construction industry, which will play a vital part in developing the facilities. It is striking that, while female entrepreneurship in the US stands at 89 per cent. of the level of male entrepreneurship, in this country that figure is only 46 per cent. If we had the same rate of female-owned start-ups as that of the US, we would have 750,000 more businesses. The case for doing all that we can to boost women's enterprise in the UK is, therefore, clear. It is not a matter only of equality of opportunity, but an economic imperative if we are to capitalise on the potential that women have to offer. The Small Business Service and Ministers are consistently working to raise the profile of women's enterprise, following a dedicated women's enterprise public relations campaign. That arises from the recommendations of the strategic framework for women's enterprise and the women's enterprise content of the innovation report.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/3">In June, we successfully held the women's enterprise online summit, to which more than 5,000 people logged on. The internet does not tell us whether they were men or women, but all are welcome. The summit was designed to motivate more women to start their own businesses and to tap into an exciting community of networking, support, useful resources and targeted services. It was a worthwhile opportunity for women to obtain answers to such questions as, &quot;How can I speak to like-minded women?&quot; &quot;Who can I speak to about my business idea?&quot; &quot;Who can help me to start and grow my business?&quot; and &quot;What resources are available to support me on that journey?&quot; As many hon. Members will appreciate, being able to get such advice and information from someone who is already running their own business is invaluable, particularly when it is another woman who is acting as a positive role model.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/4">The campaign is additional to the range of activities in the women's enterprise programme throughout 2005. I am sure that hon. Members are aware that next week is enterprise week. We have a dedicated day for women in enterprise, which is next Wednesday.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/5">The next few months will see the roll-out of phase two of the case for women's enterprise. That initiative will be principally aimed at mainstream business support providers. They may have limited experience of providing targeted services for women and may not previously have considered segmenting their client needs using a gender perspective. The Government have a strong commitment to increasing the number of women starting and growing businesses and to ensuring that Government-funded business support services are accessible and appropriate to their needs. The Government are committed to maximising the skills of women in the economy and we shall continue to work to improve the chances of women in the labour market.</p>
	<p pid="a.151.2/6">I could say a great deal more about the position of women in the economy and what the Government are doing, but I know that many hon. Members want to speak. I hope that I can provide the information that they want when I sum up the debate later.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.155.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" speakername="Sarah McCarthy-Fry" colnum="155"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew19">
	<p pid="a.155.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention and I am particularly pleased with the work that the Government have done on the modern apprenticeship scheme. In my previous employment, I was grateful to the Government for giving my company a grant, which enabled it to increase its research and to restart its apprenticeship programme, which had stopped a few years before.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/2">Let me return to the point about science graduates. When we consider that China is churning out 4 million graduates a year to 250,000 in the UK, 125,000 computer science graduates to 18,000 in the UK and 270,000 engineering science graduates to 100,000 in the UK, we see the scale of the problem facing us. If we are to raise the skills level so that we have a competitive edge in the high-skills, high-tech market, we will have to persuade young people to choose the science, maths and engineering route. That means improving the image of manufacturing occupations by giving school leavers better advice and, most importantly, by ensuring that we tap into the talents of women, who are, I might add, not a minority group, but 52 per cent. of the population.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/3">Many young people are choosing careers that are popular with their peers or that appear on television, but such careers might not be suited to their skills and talents. Girls in particular often look for careers in a caring profession and are drawn to nursing or social work, for example, but many professions in the fields of science and engineering are immensely caring. Of course, nurses save lives, but what about opening up to young people the possibility of saving lives in other ways? What about developing baby incubators, researching new medicines or developing computer systems to make surgery safer?</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/4">Many young people want to improve our world. We have seen the success of the Make Poverty History campaign and the fair trade movement, but how many young people have thought of helping people in the developing world by building machinery to help them to grow food or to rebuild vital bridges and transport systems?</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/5">Careers in the media sound really exciting to young people, but have they thought about designing, developing and manufacturing the DVD players and televisions on which we listen to music and watch films and TV?</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/6">Last year, when he was Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the Secretary of State for the Home Department, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1745" name="Charles Clarke">the Member for Norwich, South (Mr. Clarke)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/7" class="indent">&quot;In particular, it is essential that girls do not miss out on the varied and well-paid career paths that become available to them when they pursue study options . . . or vocational courses&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/8">in science, engineering and technology. Failing to encourage girls into science, engineering and technology means that the UK is missing out on that skills potential. Baroness Greenfield, director at the Royal Institution, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/9" class="indent">&quot;We are now beyond the token woman scientist or engineer; it is far more important that we have a balanced workforce in science engineering and technology. The essential first step is to attract women as the norm, rather than as the exception.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/10">An approach by a major employer in my constituency, EADS Astrium, has been to sponsor the City of Portsmouth girls' school in its bid to become a specialist school&mdash; specialising in science and maths. EADS Astrium is the UK's biggest space company, employing about 1,000 people in my constituency in highly skilled jobs, but at its three sites in the UK, only about 15 per cent. of the work force are women, although they are predominantly involved in engineering and/or science, including project management, design, manufacturing and integration.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/11">EADS acknowledges that 15 per cent. is insufficient and its support to the City of Portsmouth girls' school is one way it has identified to address that problem. Its support consists of the girls making visits to its manufacturing facility; it has graduates in the role of science engineering ambassadors who mentor the girls to help them to achieve higher grades in maths and science. They are given presentations by staff at EADS Astrium and work experience visits, and there are extended work placements for older students. For EADS, that support is a key element of its corporate responsibility policy, showing its commitment to promoting science in the future, and a conscious effort to shift the traditional image of scientists as predominantly male.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/12">As an employer, EADS recognises that it needs to look beyond the existing range of students opting for science and engineering and to reach out to new groups, including women. It sees that support as helping to create the right kind of highly skilled, high-quality, home-grown work force that my constituency will need in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/13">The head teacher of the school is very enthusiastic about the project; she said that attaining specialist status in science will give the girls in her school a unique opportunity to acquire the technical, transferable skills that they need to thrive in the 21st century. However, that raises a fundamental issue: the City of Portsmouth girls' school is just that&mdash;an all-girls school. Are girls more likely to choose science and engineering as a career option if they are taught in single-sex classes?</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/14">I do not advocate the wholesale segregation of the sexes, but is there a case for science and maths to be taught in single-sex classes? From the early 1990s onwards, girls have been increasingly successful in subjects that many of them previously found difficult or which they disliked, such as maths, science, design and technology. Girls need additional support if they are to achieve their full potential and be in a position to choose science and engineering as a career. There is a danger that the needs of girls could be sidelined as the under-achievement of boys gains increasing attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/15">Some co-educational schools recognise that problem and have introduced science teaching in single-sex classes, with some positive outcomes. In 2002, the Wise Campaign&mdash;Women into Science and Engineering&mdash;commissioned a report called &quot;Singularly Successful&quot;, which investigated whether teaching science in single-sex classes could enhance the achievement of girls without disadvantaging boys and improve the female take-up of post-16 science, design and technology courses.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/16">The conclusions of the report, which looked at several case studies, were very interesting: girls developed confidence and competence, and displayed a more positive attitude to science, technology, engineering and maths. It was noticed that in mixed-sex classes boys monopolised equipment, dominated hands-on activities and tended to show off. Many girls and quite a lot of the boys preferred being taught in single-sex classes, and parents, particularly those of girls, were generally in favour of single-sex teaching.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/17">The report also focused on how science could be taught in a more girl-friendly way&mdash;for example, using everyday situations as starting points; emphasising the human application of science, including stories about male and female scientists; providing opportunities to explain and discuss opinions on science and technology related to social issues; and ensuring that there is no gender bias in resources and illustrations, although it was noted that that became much improved in later years.</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/18">A couple of issues were raised during the study that could be explored through further research, and I will be grateful if the Minister and her colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills take note of that. We should examine the different learning styles of girls and boys, specifically with regard to science, design, technology and maths. We should also examine whether the science and maths curriculum content is right for girls&mdash;for example, does it also meet the demands of the world of work and the needs of employers?</p>
	<p pid="a.155.2/19">If the UK is to retain its manufacturing base and competitive edge in the global economy, we need to ensure that employers have access to a labour market in which people have the right skills to support their business objectives, and that our young people are encouraged, in their education, on to the right pathways to get the groundwork qualifications in science and maths that they need to get those skills. We cannot leave it all to the boys; we need to ensure that the girls get to play with the boys' toys too.</p>

	<p pid="a.158.0/1">We can get an angle on what is happening in the work force, and on its gender nature, if we consider some figures from Tees valley, where my constituency is. The work force is about 50:50 male to female, but socio-economic statistics show that, for people aged 16 to 74, about 23 per cent. of men are in the professional and managerial classes, compared with about 4.3 per cent. of women. In comparison, lower supervisory and technical jobs are occupied by 13.3 per cent. of men and 4.1 per cent of women, and semi-routine occupations&mdash;shock horror, what a surprise&mdash;are held by 9.5 per cent. of men and almost 17 per cent. of women.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/2">The average pay levels in Tees valley are as follows: for males, &pound;466.70 a week, and for females &pound;247.60 a week. In my constituency, in which there is a steel industry, which is well paid and wholly male-dominated, and a chemical industry&mdash;ditto&mdash;the situation is even worse. There, the average male wage is &pound;513 a week and the average female wage is &pound;250 or less&mdash;half as much. If one takes a closer look one sees that in the Tees valley 48.5 per cent. of men are employed full-time and 3.5 per cent. part-time, but of women, 23.9 per cent. are employed full-time and 22.4 per cent. part-time. So, it is pretty much half and half for women regarding full-time and part-time employment, while men are overwhelmingly in full-time employment. Of course, that is highly relevant, not only to pay, but&mdash;the Minister touched on this&mdash;to the quality of jobs available.</p>
	<p pid="a.158.0/3">It may be obvious, but there is no shortage of women's skills in the Tees valley; there is no shortage of damn good women. Almost all the activities in the community in my constituency are run by women: all the volunteering is spearheaded by women; good mothers are involved in many of the sports activities, particularly for girls; and, closer to home, the Redcar Labour women's forum is streets ahead of the Redcar constituency Labour party&mdash;it is not so preoccupied with standing orders, has very interesting meetings, and is pretty big in number. I make that point lest anyone should think that women in Tees valley get poor jobs and pay because they have no skills. That is not the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.159.2/1">Well, what an invitation, Sir John! How can a barrister by training resist?&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Just settle down and go to sleep, girls; I shall be on for a while now. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> is right that role models are very important. I shall talk in a while about my own legal profession and the shortage of role models at the top of that. The shortage of role models in the judiciary is a major feature that deters young women from sticking at the job long enough to be able to get into it.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/2">The Redcar women's forum could tell the world at large that we work really well together, but the real point is that it is a good organisation because it is mutually supportive, and encourages people to go on and do such things as little training courses to become a chair or a secretary. Then people feel that they have the self-confidence to make moves forward. That is the strength of communal groups, and why volunteering is often dominated by women, because they are prepared to be that mutual and to press each other on.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/3">There was a middle question, but I have completely forgotten it. Oh yes, why are we in such a terrible state 30 years after the Equal Pay Act 1970 and the founding of the Equal Opportunities Commission? That is a deep question and I do not have an answer for my hon. Friend, but clearly we are making a bit of progress, as the Minister said.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.2/4">May I come back to part-time work and the questions of pay and wasted skills? We are talking about skills here, and women's skills in the community. The Minister mentioned a figure of around 5.6 million part-time workers, which is four out of five of Britain's 7 million part-time workers, the bulk of whom are women. The statistics in the Tees valley are pretty well replicated nationwide. So four out of five of our 7 million part-time workers are working in jobs that do not use their full potential. According to the results of a year-long investigation by the EOC, to which I am indebted, 3.5 million of those had higher qualifications and skills, and used them, and did more supervision of management of staff in previous full-time jobs, and a further 2 million were satisfied that they could easily work at a higher level, even though they had not done so before. That is a major problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.160.2/1">Picking up the point about the women of the Redcar women's forum working well together, does my hon. and learned Friend feel that there could be a way in which we could get women who have given up work or who are in part-time work to focus on getting back into full-time employment? When my children were young, I used to go to mother and toddler clubs. It is about giving people the confidence; women often lose their confidence when they are out of the workplace. Does my hon. Friend agree that that is something that we could take forward?</p>

	<p pid="a.160.3/1">I very much agree with that. It is quite possible that as children's centres develop on the model of Sure Start, there ought to be more co-operation with employment, recruitment and training. I am sure that the intention is to educate and support children and their parents. That must be a way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/2">The report to which I am referring is called &quot;Britain's hidden brain drain&quot;, published by the EOC. It highlights the nonsense of old-fashioned thinking about work, which leads to men, who mostly work full-time, working amongst the longest hours in Europe, and women, over two-fifths of whom work part-time, ending up in low-paid jobs with no prospects. Women part-time workers earn about 40 per cent. less per hour than men working full-time, which is about the same pay gap as 30 years ago. Let me turn to that, because the Minister rightly mentioned that it has improved, but it has improved only a little. Some material published on <phrase class="date" code="2005-11-10">10 November</phrase>&mdash;today&mdash;by the Fawcett Society, of which I am pleased to be an active member, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/3" class="indent">&quot;Figures released by the Office for National Statistics today show that the mean hourly pay gender gap for full-time work has narrowed by just 0.6 per cent. over the last 12 months to 17.2 per cent.&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.160.3/4">the figure given by the Minister. That is the mean hourly pay gender gap. The mean gender part-time pay gap&mdash;female hourly part-time pay compared with male hourly full-time pay&mdash;has closed by 1.1 per cent. during the past 12 months. It now stands at 38.5 per cent.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.162.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="162"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew34">
	<p pid="a.162.0/1">Absolutely. Such flexibility and interaction between employer and employee builds up a very strong and good relationship, which means that the employer derives more benefit from the skills of their employee because of commitment that he or she has shown, which the employee shows in return. That is clearly a way forward, not only for equality but also for productivity. Joanna, the young woman for whom the only available job with flexible hours was that of PA, had a good degree and 10 years' management experience, and had handled million-pound budgets, but all they could offer her was the job of PA.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/2">There are some quite interesting things about part-time work that are highly relevant to the way in which we progress into better pay and higher calibre jobs. Hon. Members will not be surprised to hear that 25 per cent. of women part-time workers are shop assistants, carers, assistants or cleaners, and that only 4 per cent. are managers or senior officials. Nor will they be surprised to hear that even short periods of part-time work can be damaging. Women who have worked for 15 years and who move to full-time employment after only one year in part-time employment tend to earn 10 per cent. less an hour than those who have worked full-time for the total 15 years, so even a short period in part-time employment has a great impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/3">There are a couple of interesting pointers to progress. First, in the past 20 years men have accounted for almost half the increase in part-time working. There are now an extra 1 million male part-timers. My guess is that that is a significant pointer towards the working conditions and pay rates of part-timers emerging as a more important item on the national agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.162.0/4">Secondly, we are frequently told that we are an ageing population. Again, the Equal Opportunities Commission makes it clear that many older workers would like more choice in their working patterns in the run-up to state pension age, and the option to carry on working after then. The experience of those over 55 is not being tapped. The EOC's report says that about 1.25 million of those over 55 are working at below their potential in part-time jobs. That is exactly the strand of people whom we want to make a more major contribution than they do now, so that we can deal with the demographic problem of there being more pensioners and fewer workers, and particularly with the band of people over 55 who are not working to capacity. The demand for part-time work has increased.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.165.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="165"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew38">
	<p pid="a.165.1/1">I am not aware of any similar plans in the legal profession. Of course, the situation there has a knock-on effect on the judiciary, and the imbalance is important more broadly. There is a similar exodus at the Bar of women in their 30s who are looking to start families. There are particular problems for women barristers because they are self-employed and do not receive maternity pay. Sometimes, if someone wishes to retain their tenancy during maternity leave, they must continue to pay rent to keep their place open, despite being off work. The Bar Council is working on that matter, but it moves at a snail's pace. If it took 100 years to secure equal pay, I have no idea how long it will take to sort that out.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/2">Some 1,100 barristers, including me, have taken silk as a QC. That means that one can take on larger and more complex cases, and charge higher fees. It is an extraordinary system because, as a junior person, one may be doing the same work as a QC. I was leading on serious cases, which is what QCs do, for 12 years before I took silk. As soon as I received a small envelope, put on a new jacket with finely embroidered sleeves and strolled into the Old Bailey as a QC, I got paid 25 per cent. more, which was wonderful but inexplicable. I was doing more or less the same job, albeit with a slight hangover as a consequence of the celebration we held the previous night. That is the only time I have been hung over. I wish to place that on the record for the benefit of my constituents in Redcar.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/3">Only 8 per cent. of QCs are women, and the process for their appointment has historically represented something of a prize. The process has changed, but one had to apply to the Lord Chancellor's Department, which operated a system of consultees whereby the applicant would submit a couple of references, as one would expect, when applying for promotion. The consultees would then ask for the opinion of everyone in the judiciary who might know the applicant. The Commission for Judicial Appointments does not make appointments, but it has scrutinised how the Lord Chancellor's Department has done so. It is made up predominantly of male, upper middle-class, public school educated men. In its first report in 2003, in what I regard as a moderate tone, it stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/4" class="indent">&quot;some consultees' comments appeared to be influenced by a perception of a &quot;Silk mould&quot; i.e. that applicants needed to conform to expectations as to appearance, dress, educational or social background and other irrelevant factors&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/5">I can tell hon. Members that that view is accurate. Since that report, the CJA has examined the case of a woman, whom I know well, who was refused silk. One consultee described her professional performance in moderate but adequate language, but condemned her for having poor dress sense and for not being a &quot;leader of the profession&quot;. Heaven only knows what that means; presumably she does not go to the right cocktail parties. Another person, whom I know well, found that one consultee had expressed his disapproval of an affair that she allegedly had 20 years previously, which was a source of scandal at the time, but did not stop the man in question getting silk.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.1/6">Another unfair comment was made about a woman's performance in the Court of Appeal. However, she should have been given silk for her skill in cross-examining the feedback interviewer, from whom she extracted information that should not be disclosed&mdash;namely, the name of the judge who made the comment. She wrote to that judge, who backed off as fast as a train going through a tunnel, and said how highly he had always regarded her ability. He accepted that the problem he mentioned had been put in language that was rather too strong. Those are examples of problems that the Government's own institution, the CJA, found to be occurring and has reported on. There have been a number of allegations of sex discrimination; almost all of them were upheld.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.166.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="166"  time="015:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew40">
	<p pid="a.166.1/1">No, but I accept that that appears to be the case. The EOC has done a good deal of work recently on pregnancy discrimination. The legislative framework that has been in place for quite a long time does not appear to have tackled that discrimination adequately.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/2">As well as the discrimination implicit in what I have said, judges are drawn from silks, by and large. Therefore, discrimination that stops women becoming silks stops them joining the judiciary, as I shall explain. A woman's chance of becoming a judge is hugely cut as a result of keeping her out of silk.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/3">The judiciary performs a key function in any legal system. Some 96 per cent. of criminal cases are heard in the magistrates court, but district judges, recorders, circuit judges, Crown court judges and High Court judges hear the rest of what are increasingly serious cases. There are the two layers of appellate court on top: the Court of Appeal and the House of Lords, which is soon to be called the supreme court.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/4">If one starts at the top&mdash;instead of at the bottom, as I did&mdash;and works down, one finds that, out of 12 Law Lords, 8 per cent. are women. The keen mathematicians among us&mdash;I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby is one&mdash;will immediately work out that there is only one woman among 12 judges in the highest court.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/5">There are 37 lord justices of appeal, of whom 8 per cent. are women. That means that there are three female lord justices of appeal. Of 107 High Court judges, 7 per cent. are women, which means that about seven women are High Court judges. Women make up 11 per cent. of circuit judges and 12 per cent. of recorders, which is a slightly lower rank. Down at the bottom, 28 per cent. of district judges are women.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/6">Not surprisingly, as one moves from top to bottom, the proportion of women rises strongly. Of 11,000 barristers, 30 per cent. are women, and of 90,000 solicitors, 40 per cent. are women. Judges are drawn from a mixture of those two professions, so should not women make up 35 per cent. all the way through the judiciary?</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/7">Those figures indicate exactly how strong the discrimination is. The legal profession often argues that there are not sufficient women at senior level, so there is a need for trickle-up. We have been admitted to the Bar and been solicitors since 1922. How old do we have to be before we have equal access to the higher echelons of the profession?</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/8">This is just a snapshot. The Government have taken action because they are aware of the problem in the profession. The profession will now determine who becomes a QC. It is yet to be decided whether those who became QCs under the old system will have to reapply for their jobs&mdash;I shall wait and see. My fees might go down, if I ever work as a QC again.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/9">People will fill out a self-assessment form, so that they can put themselves forward. That is fine, but it is fairly well known that women tend to understate their abilities, skills and qualifications in self-assessment forms. There is a famous story that if a job is advertised in the press and a woman thinks that she has five out of the six qualifications for it, she will hesitate before applying, whereas a man with two of the qualifications will apply straight away. One worries that there may be an imbalance in the self-assessment process. However, the process is being undertaken by people with enormous human resources experience, which can only mean progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/10">What will present a difficulty is the fact that the new panel for the appointment of QCs is entitled only to interview applicants. They are very good people, but they can only appraise self-assessment forms and conduct the interviews that follow. The panel will not be able to do anything about the structure of the profession, which is where the imbalance lies. Women do not receive sufficient support when they are in their 30s and having their families, yet that will not be dealt with to broaden the range of applicants.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/11">That continues to be a worry, but we must see how the new system fares. As everyone knows, there is to be a judicial appointments commission, which will have stronger powers to run the appointments system properly. It must attempt to widen the range of applicants for silk, as the interviewing panel cannot. The judiciary is dependent on silks, so the panel will have to include academics, solicitors and so on. It must take advantage of the Act that set it up, which states that it should &quot;have regard to diversity&quot;. It should reach deep into the profession and advise it&mdash;indeed, drive it&mdash;to dealing with the high drop-out rate among women, their lower pay and all the other factors that stand in their way. Frankly, it will have to consider such things as not appointing men from a set of chambers that self-evidently has discriminatory practices&mdash;perhaps because of its outcomes in terms of women's advancement&mdash;unless it puts its house in order and ensures that there is a fair and flat playing field for everyone.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/12">It is a great delight to me that Baroness Prashar has been appointed to head the judicial appointments commission. She was first civil service commissioner and I had the privilege of serving with her on the Joint Committee on Human Rights; she is just the person for the job. Apart from changing the silks system indirectly, which I think the group will have to do, it could follow the experience of the police, who found it hard to recruit women and people from ethnic minority backgrounds because they did not have the confidence to think they could be police officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/13">However, those people can be recruited as community support officers because they think they can do that job, and once they are on the first tier they realise that the job of policing would not be so much more difficult. That strategy has worked very well in the police force and has increased the number of black and women recruits to officer level. The judges probably will not like the analogy, but it follows that the recruitment we are discussing should start from tribunal chairs and the lowest level of district judge and continue to the higher levels of the profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.166.1/14">In my beloved Redcar, and in my criminal justice profession, there are clearly difficulties in losing women's skills to the economy. I compliment the Government on the steps that they have taken, especially in my profession, to drive things forward. I look forward to the enactment of the Equality Bill, which will place a duty on public authorities to promote gender equality, although I do not know how it will play out and whether people really appreciate what a driver it can be in terms of contract compliance in the private sector. Bearing in mind the time scales that I quoted, we will have to work these new tools well, and speedily, otherwise we will not get access to equal pay and equal access to good work while any of the people in this Chamber are alive.</p>

	<p pid="a.168.0/1">I enjoyed the speeches of my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase>. I am so indoctrinated in the world of science, engineering and design that I hardly get time to put my head over the parapet, but having heard what my hon. and learned Friend said, it seems that the situation for women in the legal profession is far more difficult than that for women in science, engineering and design, because our world is changing.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/2">Before I continue, I should declare some interests: I sit as a member of the Engineering Technology Board, which governs and regulates the engineering profession throughout the UK. We cover more than 232,000 people&mdash;by and large chartered engineers. I have been president of the Institution of Engineering Designers for the last two years. I was its first female fellow, and I remain the only one, which is sad, given that we have a membership of 5,000. I am a fellow of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and I sit on the board of that institution. I am also a fellow of the Institution of Electrical Engineers.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/3">I am also chair of the all-party group on women in science, engineering and design, and it is great that some members of that group are present. I also chair the all-party group on construction skills and training. I am a construction industry adviser and I also advise any of my engineering colleagues who seek advice on the retention and recruitment of women in science, engineering and technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/4">My history in engineering goes back a long way. I started my career in engineering as an apprentice fitter on the docks in Portsmouth, so I have a great love of ships and also of Portsmouth docks, because that is where I started my involvement in the most wonderful profession that one could hope to be in.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/5">I regard my current profession as interim&mdash;politicians are elected by others and we can be quick in and quick out&mdash;whereas I think that I was born an engineer, and I am grateful to say that I shall die one. No one can take that away from me. I suspect that my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar feels the same about her profession. Sometimes we are genetically pre-programme to be one thing, and I was genetically pre-programmed to be an engineer. The engineering world is extraordinary, but it is acutely short of women, and we greatly miss the contribution that they can make.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/6">It caused me great sorrow recently to read another Equal Opportunities Commission report&mdash;a fantastic report that fed my worst prejudices. It gives an up-to-date platform from which to assess the progress we are making and lays down challenges for us in the future. As my hon. and learned Friend asked, what is 100 years in the development of women on this planet? It is a short time, and if we did not think so, we should be depressed. However, it is a salutary fact that our great great great-grandchildren might know some degree of equal opportunities in their lives. Oh, that we were so rich that we could tolerate that gap, but that is how it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/7">The Equal Opportunities Commission report to which I refer is called &quot;Plugging the Skills Gap: Challenging Gender Segregation in Training and Work&quot;. Colleagues have referred to it; I shall refer to some of its key points. First, there is a clear link between skills-shortage sectors such as plumbing, construction and engineering and the under-representation of women. Secondly, sectors experiencing some of the most severe skills shortages are also among those in which men make up the majority of the work force. Thirdly, widening recruitment pools to include more women most certainly offers a solution to this acute skills shortage. There are acute shortages in plumbing, construction and engineering.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/8">Earlier, I forgot to refer to my work with women plumbers. The Institute of Plumbing and Heating Engineering is a marvellous organisation&mdash;chock full of men at the top, of course, but women drive the administration like mad. One part of that administration is a great woman called Carol Cannavan, who several years ago decided that the institute would offer a facility for women plumbers. There were not many at the time, and there are not many now, but the institute has provided a home for women in plumbing&mdash;there are quite a number now in London&mdash;and somewhere they can meet and support each other while they undertake training and work experience before going on to work on their own. I commend the institute, although it represents a small token.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/9">I have not yet met anyone who has had a woman plumber attend their home, because the industry is by and large still dominated by men&mdash;99 per cent. The same is true of all other construction sectors. Unfortunately, the proportion of women working in trades and in the construction industry is still only 1 per cent. That is lamentably small, but the Construction Industry Training Board, which is a skills sector in its own right and which funds a huge amount of training for apprenticeships, is making special efforts with women and with people from ethnic communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/10">How do we get women into apprenticeships? It is exceptionally difficult. When I started my apprenticeship, it was not by design but completely by accident. I went along to a jobcentre with some O-levels&mdash;GCSEs now&mdash;and somebody said to me, &quot;What is it that you would like to do?&quot; I said that I liked mathematics and working with my hands, and the man said, &quot;Perhaps you would like to pop along to this place this afternoon and do a bit of a test.&quot; I did not like to ask him where I was going; it seemed rude, given that he was giving me a work opportunity. When I got there, it seemed even more rude to ask, &quot;Why am I here, and what is it that you do?&quot; However, I sat the test and at the end of the afternoon I was told that I had done exceptionally well and beaten all the boys. I was then asked whether I would like to come along on Monday. I went home that evening having passed the test, but not sure about what I was to do on Monday. I turned up, and the money was &pound;19 a week. I was issued with a boiler suit, a pair of Totectors, a hard hat and goggles. Most of my male colleagues immediately abandoned the hard hat and goggles&mdash;safety has never been pre-eminent in the industry&mdash;but I hung on to mine. Four years later, I walked away with my deeds as a mechanical fitter. I was one woman among 3,000 men.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/11">From forays that I have made into training schools recently, some of which I shall tell hon. Members about, I know that the situation has not changed. The four years of my apprenticeship were incredibly difficult. Half the men thought that I should not be there and should be at home. I did not have a family at the time, but they did not think that that was any reason to keep me in the workplace. The other half were delighted that I was there, but unfortunately for the wrong reasons. They wanted to go out with me, and that included most of the married men who worked at the dock.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/12">Pursuing and enduring an apprenticeship in so isolated a position is incredibly difficult. Two young women came after me, but unfortunately they did not have the capacity to cope. There was no mentoring and no organisation to which I could look to support me in that environment. I just had to get on with it. That is immensely unfortunate: unless we change the environment that young women have to work in when they are significantly outnumbered by men, the attrition rate will be huge.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/13">My route into an apprenticeship was ad hoc. Things seem to have been similarly ad hoc for the young women I spoke to today, but there is significant hope. Under this Government, we have seen the introduction of specialist schools. We do not have many single-sex schools left, so the specialist schools&mdash;particularly those with specialisms in engineering, mathematics and computing&mdash;are mixed, and plenty of effort is going into developing young people in those areas. That is leading to a larger number of women considering careers relating to science and engineering-based subjects. That is fantastic, because it gets rid of some problems in other schools, where the careers teachers, God bless them, do not have much experience of the engineering community: sexual stereotyping of such roles still predominates in the advice they offer to the young women and men in their care. If that was not the case, far more young women would have involved themselves in science, engineering and technology in the past 30, 40 or 50 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/14">School specialism is making a difference, both because it focuses the school on a particular area and because it involves employers. Employers are crucial for women seeking apprenticeships, because being able to pick up the document that can mean a fantastic livelihood and financial independence for a woman means having work experience. Apprenticeships have changed. People can do college-based training, but that must be supplemented by work in the workplace with an employer. More women are entering apprenticeships, because schools have awakened their ambitions and provided them with steers. In addition, employers are interested in what schools are doing, because their businesses have skill shortages.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/15">Women who are going into apprenticeships might have an opportunity to work with those employers. If they do not get such an opportunity, the discrimination that they, as opposed to their male counterparts, will face in trying to get work-based training remains significant. It may be possible to place a young man in work-based training, but a young woman, unless there is a family relationship or she has been sold positively by facilitators, will have a far greater problem in terms of finishing her apprenticeship. It does not really matter how good she is at the job. According to many of the companies that I have visited, a young woman is likely to get pregnant and go off to have children. Small companies in particular will go for the racing certainty of a young male over a young female, fearing that any investment they make in a young woman in terms of time and energy will be lost when she leaves the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/16">However, legions of companies in the construction sector are equally reluctant to take on a male apprentice because the industry&mdash;particularly small to medium-sized enterprises&mdash;absolutely refuses to put its hand in its pocket to train young people. It does not do that and tells me that it will not. Why should it, when the trained person will leave a company and go and work for somebody else?</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/17">Companies will not train people if they feel that they are going to lose that investment to another company, which is why we have a chronic shortage of suitably trained people in the construction industry. The industry wants images of perfection to fetch up on its doorstep every Monday, rather than put its hand in its pocket and train them itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/18">Apprenticeships are a difficult field for young women to enter. I have recently been to one great training school, which I really liked. In fact, I would have liked to stay there rather than come here. It was wonderfully equipped, and was launched on the back of the Learning and Skills Council, working in conjunction with sector skills councils, which are both innovations of this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.168.0/19">I shall digress briefly. Sector skills councils are made up of representatives from industry, working with the further education sector through the learning and skills councils. They are directing those councils where money must be delivered in college-based training to satisfy the needs of industry. That is something that we desperately wanted in this country, and we now have it. The LSC is consequently funding thousands and thousands of places in construction to satisfy the demand of the sector, because&mdash;I say this on a party political basis&mdash;since 1997 there has been massive investment in construction. The previous 20 or 30 years saw nothing to compare with that huge investment. However, we are 88,000 people short of delivering the potential capital investment in the construction programme year on year. How we shall achieve the Olympics I shall never know.</p>

	<p pid="a.172.1/1">We must&mdash;that is absolutely right. Jobs for life was something that our parents had, but we have been told that we could never expect it. We expect six or 18 months here and maybe two years there, but that is not true in engineering. Nor is true for British Gas, which is saying, &quot;Because of the contract we have to re-lay all the pipework in this country, we can offer you a job for life.&quot; That is fantastic. The starting salary is about &pound;23,000, which is great money for people in disadvantaged communities. It will enable us to utilise a repository of individuals who were marginalised prior to this huge investment in public sector and utility infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/2">I agree with my hon. Friend: we have an enormous deficit of trained and well-equipped people in the construction sector, and we must start to address that now. We are making the investment that is needed to provide money for academic training. However, to repeat the point that I made earlier, academic training is fine, but it means nothing to the industry without being complemented by experience on the job.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/3">Women have great difficulties getting experience on the job for the reasons I have cited, but the Government can do something about that. We already have section 106s for public sector contracts. I doubt whether many people here will know anything about section 106s, but I, unfortunately, know everything&mdash;I am a bit of a 106 anorak, because I see their use as a pathway to a better door. They are a fantastic facility.</p>
	<p pid="a.172.1/4">Local authorities attach section 106s to public sector contracts so that contractors who win work are obliged to employ local people on those projects. That sounds great; it is just what we need. I could say to all the women I see&mdash;or rather the few women I see&mdash;in apprenticeship workshops, &quot;There is your route to a working opportunity: a section 106,&quot; but very few are enforced.</p>

	<p pid="a.177.0/1">I hope that the hon. Lady will not overlook the fact that the chair was EOC commissioner Jeannie Drake, who is also on the Turner commission on pensions. She is principally responsible for the fact that there will be a chapter on women and pensions in the report when it comes out, and she well understands how the limits on women's work and on women receiving good pay, particularly for part-time work, continue to play on, so that women who have been poor in their earlier lives are also poor when they are pensioners.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.178.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" speakername="Claire Curtis-Thomas" colnum="178"  time="015:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew51">
	<p pid="a.178.0/1">That is so true. I do not know a great deal about fiscal policy, but the changes in pension rules next year, which I have just read about, will favour people on the 40 per cent. income tax rate. That will automatically favour people in highly paid jobs, the vast majority of whom are men. Again, the disadvantage to women will be very evident, and I hope that together we can do something about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/2">I return to what the EOC is calling on the Government to do. As I said, members of the panel, who are civil servants and represent the Government, want a national strategy to be developed to tackle gender segregation in training and work, which I applaud. The strategy should</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/3" class="indent">&quot;incorporate targets to make change happen and provide incentives and information for young people and employers in skill shortage areas to make it easier for them to make non-traditional choices.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/4">I have referred today to many of the Government's outstanding initiatives, but I have not dwelt, as I should, on the contributions that the various institutions have made, because they are all doing their bit. I know intimately all 38 engineering institutions in the UK, and they are all trying desperately to reach out to women and young people, but some are succeeding better than others. I shall single out the Construction Industry Training Board, which has been doing a great deal in this area because it is the area of greatest need. Along with the Government, however, it has not made a huge impact&mdash;I suspect because there is no joined-up thinking that brings all the players together.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/5">Careers information is changing, but we need to do far more. We have portals for careers information&mdash;indeed, they are ubiquitous&mdash;but the industry does not agree on who will do what. If we search, we will probably find a million references to careers for women, but that does not help the person who is seeking advice. I know that Lord Sainsbury, the Minister with responsibility for science and technology, is keen for careers advice to be contracted for and developed to give young people a better opportunity to find the job that they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/6">The report also recommends:</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/7" class="indent">&quot;an overhaul of the Modern Apprenticeships programme plans to remove the barriers faced by young people who want to train in a job usually done by the opposite sex.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/8">That goes back to what I said earlier&mdash;that specialist schools are getting more women into apprenticeships, but that the number is still tiny. The recommendation draws attention to the existence of the modern apprenticeships programme and to the fact that it is fantastic, it will be there for years and years, and it is a Government-backed initiative. Why, therefore, can not we do more with it to realise the potential of women in engineering, science and technology?</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/9">I am not remotely depressed, but I wish that there were more women mechanical engineers, because they could have done much for society and for the quality of people's lives. I have been able to achieve very little. Some of the women with whom I went to school had such big brains, but they have ended up working in, say, a cake shop. There is nothing wrong with working in a cake shop, but we as a society have lost that potential, and we cannot afford to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.178.0/10">We cannot, as my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar said, pay the bills associated with people being stressed out of their minds, not because they are working themselves to death but because they have never realised their potential. That applies to so many women who reach 50 and say, &quot;Oh&mdash;if only.&quot; This Government have tried to eradicate that mentality. They have removed so many barriers and provided so much support, and given that we have made that commitment to women, I want us to do more with the resources available to us so that we can continue to get more women into the professions about which I care dearly.</p>

	<p pid="a.186.3/1">To return to my speech, the second important incentive is pensions. The pensions system is an utter scandal, as even the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has admitted, and successive Governments have failed to deal with women's pensions. It is a scandal that one in four women pensioners in Britain live in poverty. They do so because the system simply does not work. It could be made to work, but does not because it does not take into consideration the different work patterns of women and men. Women have to build into their lives the bearing of children, whereas men do not. I do not see why we do not keep emphasising that fact. The production of the next generation is just as important a job as any other undertaken by any person in our society, yet it has been given scant consideration. Women of my mother's generation, who gave up work to look after their homes and families and who were dependent on their husbands, can find themselves with almost no income at all when they are widowed or divorced. It is utterly scandalous. I give the Government credit for considering that issue and I hope that the Turner commission will produce sensible proposals that we can put into action as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/2">The third of my essential elements is the removal of barriers to employment and to promotion for women in the work force. Employees need flexibility. Flexibility in employment and accounting for the work-life balance must apply not only to women, but throughout the work force. A large proportion of people have caring responsibilities. It is not only babies and children who have to be cared for, but elderly and sick relatives and non-relatives&mdash;people's caring duties are not confined to caring for members of their own family. A lot of people have caring duties that we as a society require them to undertake. It is essential that employers sometimes be required and always be encouraged to take that into account, not only because that is right in altruistic terms in a decent, caring society, but because the work force requires it. If an employer has taken someone on and trained them to do a job to the upper limit of their skills and that person has responsibilities outside the workplace that we, as a decent society, want them to undertake because it is the right thing to do, the employer must be encouraged to take that into consideration, whether the employee is a man or woman, a mother, father, child, daughter or carer of another kind. Otherwise, they will lose the employee's services and that is bad for the economy. The Minister said that the economy is operating below its productivity potential simply because women are not contributing to their full potential. It is not rocket science&mdash;the hon. Member for Crosby might tell me that it is rocket science or some other kind of science&mdash;to work out that if all employers were encouraged to do what good employers already do, good employees would be able to give more back.</p>
	<p pid="a.186.3/3">That brings me to the appalling discrimination regarding part-time workers' pay, which shows that we as a society do not value people who work part-time and that we think that they are not committed. There is this macho thing about commitment to the job, but commitment is not always about the number of hours put in; it can be about the amount of work done within the hours of work.</p>

	<p pid="a.187.3/1">I certainly do. That is a point well made.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/2">The time has passed in which the economy was satisfied by women either having a child or going out to work. That was the norm 50 years ago, in the post-war years when our economy was not strong and did not develop as it should and when it was accepted that women who worked would stop working if they had children. We see a hangover from that in the present attitudes of society and some employers. Having a child is not an add-on luxury for women, it is necessary for the future of our society and economy. To return to the pensions issue, we have a demographic time bomb waiting to go off. By the time that most of the people who are in the Room this afternoon are of pensionable age, there will not be enough young people working to provide pensions. At the moment, the balance is correct, but by then it will not be. Women today have to produce the next generation, have proper jobs and have the chance to work to their full potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/3">I am pleased that we will soon be considering the Equality Bill. I am sure that during the consideration of that Bill we will revisit some of the issues that we have discussed today. I have not mentioned child care&mdash;strangely, it has not been much talked about in this afternoon's debate&mdash;but removing barriers to employment and advancement in employment requires the establishment of a structure of affordable child care at all levels of employment. Efficient health care, too, is essential. All those structures are necessary to ensure that we have a work force that achieves its full potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.187.3/4">Yesterday, the Conservative party held a women's conference in which we discussed serious issues, such as those that we have discussed this afternoon and drugs. We had extremely good speakers from the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Fawcett Society and even from the England cricket team&mdash;an excellent lady called Clare Connor who was captain of the successful women's cricket team that brought back the Ashes. Did you, Sir John, read about any of that discussion in the newspapers this morning? No. The media chose to report that Conservative women discussed the underwear of the two potential leadership candidates. That, I assure the Chamber, was not the case&mdash;it was a 10-second jokey throwaway on Radio 4. When we discuss important issues relating to women in the economy, in the work force and in our society, we have a right to be taken seriously.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-11-10a.188.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1813" speakername="Meg Munn" colnum="188"  time="017:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm051110/halltext/51110h01.htm#51110h01_spnew64">
	<p pid="a.188.0/1">This has been an excellent, illuminating and interesting debate. I hope that hon. Members will forgive me for indicating that I will not take interventions because I have a great number of notes from which I want to respond to the extremely interesting and wide range of points that hon. Members made. I shall already have to go at something of a gallop to get through them all.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1574" name="Eleanor Laing">The hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs. Laing)</phrase> should not apologise for there being so much consensus, because women can make common cause across political parties on these enormously important issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/3">The issues raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1760" name="Alison Seabeck">the Member for Plymouth, Devonport (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> about training and education are enormously important. Barriers that women face must be broken down, and one way in which that can be done is by ensuring that young girls have access to the right skills, such as those that I have seen at the Turves Green girls' school and technology college in Birmingham, which I first visited three years ago when I was on the Select Committee on Education and Skills. That college actively seeks to encourage its pupils to engage with technology, design and the science curriculum and also to take their designs on into enterprise. I was so impressed&mdash;it is probably the best work that I have seen in a school anywhere&mdash;that when we held our EU gender conference in Birmingham earlier this week, I had no hesitation in making that college one of the projects to which we took the EU Ministers to see what can be done and how girls can be inspired.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1766" name="Sarah McCarthy-Fry">the Member for Portsmouth, North (Sarah McCarthy-Fry)</phrase> asked whether we should teach girls in single-sex classes in those subjects. I think that the best approach is to make the teaching of science, engineering and technology much more relevant to all pupils. The new science curriculum, which will come in from 2006, aims to do just that.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase>, who has since had to leave the Chamber, raised IT issues. We know that in many traditional areas the culture can be oppressively male, but I hope he did not leave because he felt that the culture in the Room was oppressively female. However, I am assured by his note that that was not the reason. For his benefit, I can put it on record that the e-skills Sector Skills Council for IT has recently rolled out nationally it pilots of computer clubs for girls, which offer fun and educational activities. The council has been successful in getting girls aged 10 to 14 interested in IT. Initial research suggests that 66 per cent. of participants are now considering careers in IT.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/6">My hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North rightly identified the global competition that we face. As a result of competitive pressures, new entrants into IT must become more productive more quickly than in the past. The DTI is aware of the issues facing the IT industry and has published reports about women in IT, which have discussed the importance of the business case for diversity and how to retain women in that sphere.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/7">On the crucial issue of skills and qualifications, up to a fifth of the productivity gap between the United Kingdom and its main competitors can be explained by the UK having a lower stock of human capital, especially at NVQ level. We are having some success attracting women onto foundation degree courses. The skills White Paper was also aimed at allowing women to acquire level 2 qualifications, because we know that 45 per cent. of women who are not working do not have a level 2 qualification. We are also giving priority support to level 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/8">The Government have taken steps in response to the EOC's recommendations on apprenticeships. The Learning and Skills Council publishes annual data on apprenticeships by sector, gender, race and disability. An apprenticeship marketing campaign has been set up to promote non-traditional sectors of work. The Government are giving further thought to how we can provide a challenge on this issue, rather than replicate occupational segregation, as the EOC rightly identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/9">Much of the debate focused on non-traditional work for women. My hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North referred to the image of manufacturing. The DTI has established a body as part of the Engineering Forum to consider the image of manufacturing to make it more attractive to all young people, especially to girls and young women.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/10">Last week, the Government announced the establishment of a manufacturing academy, where the industry will determine how it trains the people needed to fill the current 48,000 vacancies in manufacturing. There is a good business and economic case for the arguments that have been put forward today.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/11">Role models are important in all jobs. I pay tribute to all the women present, as I am sure they have been role models in their previous careers. That is of great interest and pertinent to the debate. Role models are particularly important in non-traditional jobs. I am pleased that many companies are interested in what they can do and how they can use women to plug their skills gap. I have learned that a major civil engineering company, Ove Arup, is keen to recruit women and to increase the number of its women graduate employees. It has just produced its new 2006 calendar, with images of women in highly skilled roles, all of whom are fully clothed. British Gas is training female gas fitters, because that is often what their female customers want.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/12">There is some good news on higher technical qualifications. The NHS employs 55,000 scientists&mdash;I am not talking about doctors and nurses&mdash;33,000 of whom are women. They work in highly skilled jobs, such as medical physics and the design of sophisticated equipment to help disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/13">There are also some positive trends in some professions, even if not in that of my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" name="Vera Baird">the Member for Redcar (Vera Baird)</phrase>. Graduates in medicine and allied subjects, such as bioscience and veterinary science, are now 60 to 70 per cent. female. That is positive, but engineering and physical science remain harder nuts to crack.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/14">Science, engineering and technology are very important, but we know that the overwhelming majority of people with high-level degrees in those subjects are male, especially those who have high-level degrees in subjects such as physics and IT, to which I have already referred. The picture is improving as more girls choose to study those subjects at university, but problems remain in subjects such as physics where progress has been slow, although I am not sure whether we should replicate the motivation of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase>, who wanted to do physics in order to go to a boys' school.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/15">The Government are promoting science, engineering and technology for women in schools, universities and after, through the UK Resource Centre and through schemes such as the science and engineering ambassadors programme, in which female participation is now about 35 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/16">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1521" name="Claire Curtis-Thomas">the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas)</phrase> rightly wanted to know about our funding of the excellent UK Resource Centre. The original contract would have ended in April 2007. Its total funding was &pound;4.1 million, but it has been extended to the end of March 2008 and its total funding will now be &pound;6.9 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/17">My hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North talked about the problems of women losing confidence outside the workplace. The UK Resource Centre has a programme of &pound;1.5 million, ring-fenced for women returning to work, which includes the full funding of an Open university course to provide advice and information to women returners.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/18">The Daphne Jackson Trust and its excellent work in getting well qualified women back into professional jobs were also mentioned. I am delighted to confirm that the DTI directly supports it and will continue to do so, certainly for the time being.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/19">Hon. Members rightly spoke about the pay gap and the shocking statistics that show the difficulties of closing it. I pay tribute to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Redcar whose illustrations and stories went beyond what I can do in the short time left to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/20">The DTI has considered part-time working and has commissioned research called &quot;The Part-Time Pay Penalty&quot;. The pay differential between women working full-time and women working part-time in occupations is very small. The occupation segregation of women working part-time and women working full-time explains most of the part-time pay penalty: that is, part-time jobs are in low-skill areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/21">The hon. Member for Romsey highlighted the important issue of culture and how we can change it.Women in enterprise is an enormously important area, and the Government view the development of women's enterprise in the UK as an economic imperative. Women are hugely under-represented in enterprise and often offer a massive and largely untapped resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/22">We talked about the regional development agencies and their role. They are key players, and I am delighted that some RDAs are taking the issue more seriously. The East Midlands Development Agency has appointed a women's champion, and Yorkshire Forward, which is in my own neck of the woods, has included diversity as a key priority in its recently revised regional economic strategy, on which I commented. Skills form an essential part of the approach, and RDAs will take action, such as encouraging more women into technology or craft-based careers, to promote qualifications and careers in key areas to non-traditional entrants.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/23">The hon. Member for Epping Forest rightly expressed concern about restrictions and costs that might prevent employers from employing people. My argument is that in protecting the investment in women employees makes sense, and that some companies, such as BT and Ford, already get many returners into employment by doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/24">Tackling occupational segregation and the gender pay gap is the right thing to do, not only because it is fair, but because it makes economic sense. Maximising women's skills in the economy could bring economic benefits worth up to 3 per cent. of GDP, which equates to the total value of UK exports to Germany. I leave that thought in Members' minds as we finish the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/25" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/26" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at twenty-nine minutes past Five o'clock.</p>
