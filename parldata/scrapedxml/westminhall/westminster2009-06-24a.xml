<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-24a.239.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" speakername="Richard Spring" colnum="239"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090624/halltext/90624h0001.htm#09062511000504">
	<p pid="a.239.2/1">It is a pleasure to have you presiding over our proceedings, Mr. Caton. I welcome the Minister to his new role and wish him well in it. I am reminded of Vera Lynn's &quot;We'll Meet Again&quot;, because we come together every few years. I look forward to what he has to say on this important subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/2">The middle east may not be our near geographical neighbour, but we cannot escape from our involvement in the region. That can be seen throughout history with the magnificent crusader castles across Syria, our support for the Arab revolts against the Ottoman empire, the founding of the state of Israel, and the construction and subsequent loss of the Suez canal. The list could go on.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/3">This is not a moment to discuss the merits of the recent invasion of Iraq. Suffice it to say that it impaired a number of our relationships in the region. Today, violence on the streets of Gaza inflames passions on the streets of our country. Whether we like it or not, we cannot escape from the realities of our past and current involvement. In that, we are blessed with outstanding diplomats, whose knowledge of the middle east is unsurpassed. When their judgments have been ignored, it has led inevitably to difficulties for us.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/4">In the past few weeks, we have seen extraordinarily successful and peaceful elections in Lebanon, an inspiring speech in Cairo by President Obama, post-election turmoil in Iran and Bibi Netanyahu implicitly acknowledging the problems brought by the growth of settlements.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/5">I should like to concentrate on Syria, which has been remarkably stable in the past decade under a new and younger President. At no stage in the long history of the region could Syria sensibly have been ignored. I declare an interest as a director of the British Syrian Society, which seeks at all levels to build up our bilateral relationship. I pay particular tribute to two individuals who dedicated themselves so successfully to that task, Dr. Fawaz Akhras and the late Sir David Gore-Booth, who was a distinguished diplomat.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/6">Having spoken out against the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Syria strongly opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003. In expressing the notion of an axis of evil, the United States took a hostile view of Syria. It was widely believed by Syrians that America would invade them, too. There is no doubt that jihadis crossed from Syria into Iraq across a long border that is difficult to police. It was a source of fury that some of those individuals may have been directly or indirectly responsible for the loss life among coalition forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/7">A second source of criticism of Syria stems from the civil war in Lebanon, after which Syrian military forces were invited to help restore order. In time, their role became resented by key players in Lebanese political life, who believed that there was inordinate interference in the domestic, political and economic life of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/8">A third source of criticism is the ties between Syria and Iran, which rose initially out of a shared fear and dislike of Saddam Hussein. Although they may have close trading and economic ties, Iran is a theocratic state, whereas Syria is constitutionally secular. Different religious groupings co-exist extremely well in Syria and Islamic fundamentalism is simply not tolerated. A final source of criticism is Syria's support&mdash; shared by Iran&mdash;of Hezbollah and Hamas, with their terrorist attacks on Israeli citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/9">The central thesis of my remarks is that those important issues must be put in context or updated to reflect current realities in a continuing process of mutual exploration between our two countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/10">A chunk of Syria&mdash;the Golan heights&mdash;is illegally occupied by Israel. The area holds no strategic value for Israel. In 2000, the late President Hafez Assad came close to a deal with Israel that included the return of the Golan heights and a clear recognition of the state of Israel. Israel continues to have concerns about Iranian and Syrian support for Hezbollah. However, it is noteworthy how acquiescent Hezbollah was when Israel invaded Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/11">Also noteworthy is that Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah fully accepted the results of the recent Lebanese elections. It has been a fundamental view of Syria that Hezbollah is a political reality in Lebanon and that it should be seen as such. Latterly, it has worked hard to encourage change in the political topography of Lebanon to entrench Hezbollah as part of the democratic political process. Relations between Syria and virtually all Lebanese political leaders have improved dramatically with many ministerial visits and the exchange of ambassadors, which was inconceivable until recently.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/12">Syria was told that its role in the lead-up to the Lebanese elections would be observed carefully. The outcome was beyond everybody's expectations. I am pleased that our Government, including our ambassador in Beirut, have met with the political arm of Hezbollah, thus recognising its electoral legitimacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/13">I have said many times to Israeli friends that a core impetus to Hezbollah's military activities would be changed if Israel returned the Golan heights to Syria. Without that, there will be no comprehensive and enduring sense of security for Israel on its northern border. The Turkish Government sought to broker talks between the two countries. We wait to see whether Syria's offer to reopen talks with Israel will be taken up by Mr. Netanyahu. His Foreign Affairs Minister, Avigdor Lieberman, has so far explicitly rejected discussion of the Golan heights, but these are early days.</p>
	<p pid="a.239.2/14">No hon. Member can have failed to be concerned about the recent events in Iran.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.0/1">My hon. Friend is right. I pay tribute to him for the work that he has done to develop that argument. I am sure that he will agree that, although a comprehensive settlement in the region would be desirable, that is presenting huge difficulties, not least because of the seemingly irreconcilable tensions between Fatah and Hamas. It would be a shame if that was a major stumbling block or distraction to a Syrian track, because it is in Israel's interest to have the security to which he alluded. We should encourage the Israelis to consider the Syrian offer to continue the exploration, brokered by the Turks.</p>

	<p pid="a.241.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to raise the long-term significance of a relationship between Iran and the United Kingdom. However, at a moment when two of our diplomats have just been expelled from Tehran for no reason&mdash;apparently, the British Government are behind the protests on the streets of Tehran, which is an interesting take on events&mdash;the British Government are absolutely right in the circumstances to react by expelling two diplomats from London. Although we hope that calm will prevail in the long-run and that logic will enter into the equation, I do not agree with the timing suggested by the hon. Gentleman.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-24a.241.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" speakername="Richard Spring" colnum="241"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090624/halltext/90624h0001.htm#09062511000510">
	<p pid="a.241.4/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning the humanitarian aspect. I certainly know individuals whose family origins lie in the Golan heights. Of course, the humanitarian tragedies that abound in the region are what we are seeking to address. That applies on all sides of the equation. Although the Golan heights are occupied, I do not think that even people in the Israel defence forces regard them as strategically significant. However, the matter will sour the relationship between Syria and Israel, which is why some sort of solution to the problem&mdash;a solution was nearly arrived at in 2000&mdash;could take the whole process forward. I hope that the new Government in Israel will see the matter in those terms because the flow of the issue into the Hezbollah argument, with which the hon. Gentleman will be very familiar, means that it is important to Israel's own long-term security to address the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/2">As I mentioned, there have been extraordinary events in Iran in the past few weeks, and there are concerns about the views of senior Iranian figures. The truth of the matter is that Iran unreservedly supports Hezbollah and Hamas. As I said, it is in Israel's vital strategic interest to seek to minimise the impact of Iran's stated aim to export Islamic revolution in the form expressed. Israel enjoys workable relations with Egypt and Jordan&mdash;that should be the role model&mdash;and it should seek to develop a pragmatic relationship with its northern neighbours. Syria has made its position clear: a return of the Golan heights is part of a full normalisation of relations. Israel should simply road test that offer without delay. If successful, the prize would be to enhance its own security and stability, although much work would have to be done and, of course, much reassurance needs to be given.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/3">At different times, Syria has had poor relations with other Arab countries. However, that is no longer the case. The Syria-Saudi Arabia relationship is particularly important, and is back on track. There have been a number of welcome ministerial exchanges between Baghdad and Damascus. The criticism of the border crossings, to which I alluded, has substantially evaporated and help has been given to Syria to achieve that. Exploration of greater commercial ties between Syria and Iraq continues to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/4">Two other facets of Syrian life bear examination. Syria has developed a culture that is unique in the region, perhaps because its history has been marked by so many invasions and occupiers&mdash;from the Romans and the Persians, to the Umayyads, the Ottomans and the French. More than a century ago, Gertrude Bell wrote about that with amazement in her diaries. The Grand Mufti of Syria radiates a generosity of spirit and understanding, which personifies the attitudes of the Muslim majority to the religious minorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/5">I welcome the recent official visit to London by the Syrian Minister of Religious Affairs to discuss Syria's approach to key sensitive matters, including countering radicalisation. It is worth noting that the aim of what was, from every possible view point, an important visit was to represent the Syrian model of moderate Islam, which combats terrorism and rejects extremism. The visit resulted in an offer to send a group of Muslim scholars to lecture at the Islamic centres in the United Kingdom on moderate Islam as practised in Syria. The visit also drew on Syria's willingness to train British imams in Syria according to a curriculum approved by the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Religious Affairs in Syria has indicated a willingness to teach British students who want to study Arabic and sharia for four years at the international institute for Arabic and sharia, so that they can become advocates of moderation.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/6">I say to the Minister that at a time when relationships are very fractious and we have seen a most disagreeable increase in Islamophobia and, indeed, anti-Semitism in our country, it is precisely through such moderation and contact that Syria can play a valuable role. I know the Minister will welcome that visit and the return visit that took place to Syria by British Muslims to discuss messages of peace from Islam. That collective generosity of spirit has enabled about 1 million Iraqis, a significant number of whom are Christians, to find sanctuary in Syria, which is a huge burden on a country of some 20 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/7">Refugee children go to school free up to the 12th grade and medical care is available on the same basis as it is to the local population. This year, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees launched an appeal for $150 million. It would be interesting to hear from the Minister how Britain is assisting in what the UNHCR has described to me as&mdash;this is well known to be the case&mdash;an internationally under-recognised refugee crisis, which, of course, arises directly out of our invasion of Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/8">It is gratifying that, after a long period, relations between Syria and Britain have improved considerably. I hope that the Minister will go there soon, as his predecessor and the Foreign Secretary have done. Of course, Opposition parties&mdash;including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1381" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr. Lidington)</phrase> and the shadow Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>&mdash;initiated a dialogue some time before. Many European politicians have now visited Damascus.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/9">There continues to be attempts to liberalise and modernise the Syrian economy through banking and investment code reforms and the establishment of a fledgling stock exchange. Since 2005, the EU-Syria association agreement has been frozen. It is hoped that, finally, the agreement will be signed this year, which will encourage trade flows between Europe and Syria and the lowering of any tariff barriers. That will compel and encourage the Syrian Government to bring forward further reforms, especially at a time of diminishing oil reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/10">There is now open discussion about the transfer of gas via Syria and Turkey from some of the main gas producers to the east and Qatar. There is concern throughout Europe about increasing dependence on Russian gas supplies. An opportunity is presenting itself to diversify supply to the Mediterranean, and the strategic significance of that is obvious. In the end, real movement in the region will be brought about by focused US involvement. The Obama Administration seem to have made a concerted effort to follow a fresh approach to the region in particular and the Islamic world in general. Numerous visits to Damascus by US Government representatives signal that engagement, and the involvement of George Mitchell, who played such a significant role in Northern Ireland, is to be welcomed. Nevertheless, the US currently has no ambassador in Damascus, and a wholly counter-productive boycott is still in place. Of course, concerns remain about human rights violations in a number of Arab countries, and controversy surrounds the access of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Syria.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.4/11">I shall conclude by coming back to where I started. Many of the criticisms of Syria during the past decade now appear to be out of date. In the right circumstances, Syria could help to unlock a whole series of huge challenges&mdash;whether in relation to the security of Israel, the actions of Hezbollah or Hamas, or through its long-standing relationship with Iran. The terms &quot;dialogue&quot; and &quot;road test&quot; once again spring to mind. Our bilateral relationship is far from perfect, but we can play a part in trying to make continuing progress. In so doing, we would fulfil our historic engagement in the region, which, regrettably, has become so lamentably absent, greatly to our country's cost.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.1/1">I had not intended to speak other than to intervene in the debate, Mr. Caton, but perhaps I could ask my hon. Friend the Minister to comment on just a couple of points.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1854" name="Richard Spring">the hon. Member for West Suffolk (Mr. Spring)</phrase> and also put on the record that this year was a first for some years in that an official Inter-Parliamentary Union delegation from this Parliament to Syria took place in January. I was a member of the delegation, which was led by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1848" name="Keith Hill">the Member for Streatham (Keith Hill)</phrase>. In terms of building understanding, contacts and dialogue between UK and Syrian parliamentarians, the visit was very worthwhile indeed. I hope that further such exchanges will continue, in addition to the good work that the hon. Member for West Suffolk does through the all-party group on Syria and the British Syrian Society.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/3">The hon. Gentleman referred to Iraqi refugees in Syria, which is one of the issues that I would like to raise with the Minister. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is a major issue for us because of our involvement in the situation that led to those refugees being in Syria, but it is also a major issue for Syria. According to the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which we met while we were there, there are 1.2 million Iraqi refugees with valid visas in Syria at present. I give credit to Syria, which gives them access to services and at least primary education. It has done much more than several other countries would have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/4">However, there is still an issue for Syria, because of the drain on its resources, but perhaps most of all for the Iraqi refugees themselves. We met several of them. We visited several UNHCR installations, including its reception centre, and we were able to speak to and hear first hand from Iraqi refugees about their situation, which is something that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/5">The international community needs greater coherence around its approach to repatriation: would it be viable, and, if so, when and how are pathways to be built towards it? However, it also needs to grasp much more consistently the question of resettlement. Several Iraqi refugees told us that, because of all kinds of changes in Iraq and elsewhere, they were now looking at resettlement. If that is to be dealt with properly, it requires a co-ordinated response from the international community. The UNHCR has a great deal to say about that. We need to listen to what it has to say, because it is a major issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/6">My second point on refugees concerns Palestinian refugees in Syria. I am not speaking particularly of those Palestinian refugees who are in Syria as a result of events in 1948 or 1967 but rather those who are in Syria or on its borders as a result of the conflict in Iraq. About 300 Palestinian refugees currently live in a camp in the desert&mdash;in essence, they are cut off from many facilities. Again, that is a humanitarian issue that we need to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.244.1/7">My hon. Friend the Minister will not have come here today prepared to speak about the Palestinian refugees, but I would ask him, if he is not able to say much about them today, to look into the situation, and to consider what we and the international community are doing to try to ease their plight. To some extent, they are the forgotten refugees arising out of the Iraq conflict, but they deserve to be forgotten no longer.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-24a.257.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1467" speakername="Ivan Lewis" colnum="257"  time="010:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090624/halltext/90624h0003.htm#09062511000529">
	<p pid="a.257.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Further progress on the EU-Israel association agreement depends on progress in the middle east peace process, as has been made clear in the dialogue within the EU and between it and the state of Israel. The hon. Member for Aylesbury raised a point about the UK's ability to help Syria with governance and administration issues. We shall consider any requests for such help sympathetically. Our embassy currently has a small number of civil society projects in which we work in co-operation with the Syrian Government, and I am happy to provide him with further information about those projects if that would be useful.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/2">I think that I have dealt, more or less, with hon. Members' specific contributions, and I now want to talk in more detail about the UK's relationship with Syria and how we envisage the latter playing a crucial role in the middle east more generally. Our dialogue with the Syrian Government has focused on engaging with Syria, using our diplomatic tools to encourage progress in certain areas and urging a change of policy in others. However, we are realistic about the issues in our so-called critical dialogue with Syria. Our eyes are wide open and&mdash;to mix my metaphors&mdash;there is no danger of the wool being pulled over them.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/3">That is part of a wider process. As the Foreign Secretary noted, in his recent speech on Islam in Oxford, Britain has embassies in 38 Muslim-majority countries and maintains diplomatic engagement with countries with which we have disagreements. The key point is that we seek to influence through engagement and dialogue. As part of that, last year, the Foreign Secretary visited Syria&mdash;the first British Cabinet Minister to do so since 2001&mdash;and my ministerial predecessor, who is now the Minister for the Armed Forces, visited Syria in April as part of our ongoing efforts to engage with it. I hope to visit the region over the next few months. Perhaps the hon. Member for West Suffolk would like to be my guide&mdash;that was not a totally serious offer, but we shall see.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/4">As I have noted, we discuss a number of important issues with the Syrians&mdash;issues in which we have shared and mutual interests and in which Syria, as a significant power in the region, has an important role to play. What are those issues? We welcome past movement towards dialogue between Israel and Syria&mdash;crucially on both sides. It is obvious that talks between these two countries have the potential to provide a significant contribution towards a lasting and comprehensive middle east peace process. We want talks to continue on the basis of land for peace&mdash;full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan heights in exchange for peace and security for Israel with fully normalised bilateral relations. My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Sparkbrook and Small Heath and the hon. Member for Aylesbury made that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/5">We must also be clear, however, about the messages that we and others in the international community send when Syria continues to support the leadership of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad or when it continues to facilitate the supply of weapons to Hezbollah. Those actions are inconsistent with the openness of Syria to talk to Israel, and these issues will have to be addressed if there is to be peace between the two. We cannot have countries sitting around the negotiating table on the one hand and supporting, fostering and encouraging terrorist activities on the other. The UK cannot support such an approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/6">One issue on which Syria has an opportunity to work productively with the international community is co-operation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. More recently, the IAEA has raised concern over uranium particles found in Syria, and we strongly urge Syria to co-operate with the investigation and to provide, without further delay, the access that the IAEA seeks. It is unacceptable for Syria to continue to refuse access. The US has provided compelling evidence to suggest that Syria was developing a nuclear reactor, and we strongly support the mandate of the IAEA to investigate those claims.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/7">Another important part of Syria's role in the region relates to Iraq. It is important to acknowledge the number of positive measures that the Syrian Government have taken to improve relations with the Iraqi Government&mdash;a number of high-level visits between the two and the establishment of a joint working group to help secure the Syria-Iraq border. We should welcome those very positive steps. However, it is vital, for Syria's own security and as part of building its relations with the west, that it continues on the path of taking concerted action to tackle al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. I welcome Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem's statement that tackling al-Qaeda and other groups that use Syria as a transit route for attacks in Iraq is a high priority. The UK Government have made it clear to the Syrian Government that we are prepared to support and encourage their work in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/8">We cannot, however, tackle extremism or find a resolution to the middle east conflict without regard to the human angle. We need to give people the confidence that their state will protect them and secure their rights. Syria's record on human rights is poor. There can be no excuse for, or dismissal of, that point when discussing our relationship. The Prime Minister has argued, and I agree, that ours is a global society in which universal rights and values still leave room for extraordinarily rich and different ways of living. As the hon. Member for West Suffolk pointed out, Syrian society is rich and diverse, with a tolerance for different faiths. There is much to welcome and applaud.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/9">As the hon. Member for Aylesbury mentioned, however, over the past year, there has been a worrying deterioration in the human rights situation in Syria. Critics of the Government&mdash;those who call for peaceful democratic reform and those who post dissenting comments on internet blogs have been imprisoned&mdash;and as much as we might be tempted to go down that path, in this country, I can assure hon. Members that it will never happen. Sadly, however, disappearances, travel bans and arbitrary detention are increasingly common. There are reports of torture during interrogation and deaths in police custody. We continue, however, to call on Syria to implement internationally agreed minimum standards on the prevention of torture.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/10">The Syrian authorities continue to crack down on peaceful forms of expression. In the biggest collective prosecution of Syrian dissidents in the past seven years, the 12 intellectuals and activists forming the Damascus declaration group appeared for sentencing at the criminal court on <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-29">29 October 2008</phrase>. All defendants received two and a half years' imprisonment for the crimes of damaging the dignity of the state and distributing false news&mdash;another interesting crime that we could put on the statute book in this country. The defendants pleaded not guilty and have done nothing except peacefully exercise their fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the Syrian constitution and international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/11">In recent months, there has also been a significant increase in arrests and harassment of Kurds. Hon. Members would like to make it clear that that is not acceptable. Kurdish rights are still not legitimised within the Syrian constitution. Three Syrian Kurds were killed after security forces opened fire on a demonstration marking Kurdish new year in March 2008. Such behaviour does not serve Syria well; nor does it help to bring peace to a region of extraordinary history and complexity.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/12">I do not want to rehearse the history of Syria's relationship with Lebanon, because it is more useful to focus on the future. We welcome the decision by Syria and Lebanon to establish diplomatic relations and the arrival of respective ambassadors. We also welcome the peaceful conduct of elections in Lebanon and the acceptance by all parties of the outcome. These are important steps forward. However, Syria can do more. It is bound, by UN Security Council resolutions 1559, 1680 and 1701, not to interfere in Lebanese internal affairs, including through material support for Hezbollah. Instead, Syria should continue its regional role in promoting stability and political progress in Lebanon, including through its relations with Saudi Arabia. Demarcation of the Syria-Lebanon border and a resolution of the issue of those missing from both sides are urgent next steps. For too long, Lebanon has suffered from external interference of one kind or another, and Syria has a role to play in ensuring that Lebanon does not again fall victim to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/13">Our dialogue with Syria concerns a number of serious issues, and some might argue that we should therefore not talk at all, but, like hon. Members, I disagree. Isolation is not the answer. We should be realistic, but we shall not ignore Syria or its important role. At this time of great importance in the region, the UK will, through high-ranking Ministers and senior officials, continue to make all efforts to address all the issues between the UK and Syria. This is a timely debate. None of us needs reminding of the importance of President Obama's speech in Cairo. He acknowledged the tensions, fears and mistrust that can exist between different peoples, but he also spoke of a new beginning based on trust and respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/14">Edwin H. Friedman wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Leadership can be thought of as a capacity to define oneself to others in a way that clarifies and expands a vision of the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.257.0/16">That is the challenge that Syria now faces. I am an optimist. I believe in democracy, and I urge the Syrian Government to seize the opportunity to provide the bold and far-sighted leadership that they are in a position to show. Syria can be a major part of the solution in the middle east. Integral to that will be a two-state solution based on an Israel free of terror and violence and on a viable Palestinian state.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right to say that some people have experienced considerable loss and that others have had less of a loss. Nevertheless, people have still lost an important income on which they were relying for their old age. The terrible thing about Equitable Life is that, in seeking to look after themselves in their old age, the 1.5 million policyholders were doing the right thing by themselves and for society, yet they have been very badly let down. That is why Parliament has to act.</p>

	<p pid="a.278.2/1">The hon. Lady speaks eloquently about the situation. I absolutely agree that these people are not rich&mdash;they are not fat cats and they have not salted away great quantities of money for their old age. They have simply done what they believed was right by making provision from their normal, average incomes when they were in work, so that they could support themselves when they were not in work. Sadly, through no fault of their own, they have sometimes found themselves trapped. One constituent wrote to me, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.278.2/2" class="indent">&quot;We 'trapped' Annuitants have fared inexcusably badly, especially after assurances at the outset of Government surveillance. We couldn't leave, and did not have any options other Policy Holders had, such as only AVCs. We have also borne the brunt of losses with E.L., continuing through to Prudential, with no relief from the E.L. calculation system, and probable further reductions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.2/3">That is what people have been faced with.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.2/4">The point has already been made that we are talking about people who are in the later years of their lives. Many have been pensioners for seven, eight or more years and have found themselves in this nightmare at a time in their lives when they should be able to feel that they have got away from the stress of working life and careers. They should actually be enjoying some form of retirement, but they have not been able to do so. The hon. Lady's comment about her constituents who have been forced to move into a caravan displays exactly the problems that people now face.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.2/5">I do not wish to speak at great length. I simple wish to say that all of us come to the House because we are propelled in some way by a sense of justice, and I know absolutely that my hon. Friend the Minister also has that at the core of her political being.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.2/6">For far too many years, we have been meeting in this room to discuss this issue&mdash;indeed, I remember our first debate, which I attended with other hon. Members who are present today&mdash;and we have had subsequent debates on the Floor of the House. We have gone over so much of the same ground, but officialdom has prevaricated and tried to weave in and out of the complexities.</p>
	<p pid="a.278.2/7">I absolutely accept that the Government should not put themselves in a position where every failure by financial organisations becomes a matter for Ministers. Of course none of us would wish to see that. That would be to write a blank cheque to financial institutions and encourage them not to take care in their management and procedures.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1671" name="Fabian Hamilton">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase> on securing the debate and giving us another opportunity to try to persuade the Government to do the right thing by Equitable Life policyholders.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/2">The title that the ombudsman gave to her report&mdash;&quot;Equitable Life: a decade of regulatory failure&quot;&mdash;sums the situation up very well. When Equitable Life was forced to default on its obligations to policyholders in 2000, it is estimated that more than 1 million policyholders lost part of their savings. Therefore, we all have victims in our constituencies. I share the hon. Gentleman's outrage at the fact that the situation is still unresolved nine years later.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.0/3">In the nine years since 2000, about 30,000 policyholders have died. As we heard earlier, the Library estimates that another 15 people die each day. It is important to remember that the victims of the collapse are elderly people who now face hard times. They did what successive Governments recommended they do, by making provision for their retirement. They made sacrifices earlier in their lives to make provision for their old age. These are the victims that we are talking about.</p>

	<p pid="a.280.4/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right about what the ombudsman said, and I agree that the Government should take that into account in implementing the ombudsman's recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.4/2">The case for compensation is straightforward. The maladministration by the regulator was a direct cause of the injustice suffered by policyholders. The regulator was a Government responsibility, so the Government should accept the ombudsman's recommendations to establish a compensation scheme to pay those who suffered the injustice. That injustice was caused by the failure of public bodies. The aim of such a scheme should be to put those who suffered a loss back into the position that they would have been in had the regulator's maladministration not occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.280.4/3">The ombudsman said that it would be reasonable to expect a compensation scheme to be established within six months of any decision by the Government and Parliament to establish such a scheme. Given the advanced age of many of the policyholders, it is important that the Government and Parliament should aim to meet that timetable. However, the remit that the Government gave to Sir John Chadwick is utterly inadequate. It is greatly restrained by the fact that Sir John is allowed to take into account only those recommendations that the Government accepted. I believe that that breaks the link in the chain between maladministration, injustice and compensation.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is perfectly correct. It is important also to remember that the ombudsman is the parliamentary ombudsman, and not the Government ombudsman. Parliament, not the Government, should take the decisions. I hope that, through the deliberations of the Committee that we shall set up tomorrow, we may get to a situation in which individual hon. Members can initiate motions in the House&mdash;I believe that that used to be the situation, long before I entered the House&mdash;as early-day motion 1423 on Equitable Life, which many hon. Members have signed, could then be debated and voted on in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">In May, the ombudsman used what has been described as the nuclear option. She used her ultimate sanction of laying before Parliament a short report expressing her gross dissatisfaction with the Government's inadequate response to her original report. Like that original report, her follow-up report is accurately titled: &quot;Injustice unremedied&quot;. She used the phrase &quot;deeply disappointed&quot;, which is strong language from an ombudsman. I hope that the Government will reflect on it and implement the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">I also ask the Government to reflect on the signal that they are sending out. Unless compensation is paid, what is there to encourage people of working age to save for their retirement? The regulatory failure is the Government's responsibility, so natural justice demands that they implement the ombudsman's recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.282.1/1">I shall take that as absolute direction, Mr. Caton; in fact, I am being instructed to take an even shorter time, perhaps to allow one more hon. Member a couple of words, if possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/2">I particularly want to congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1671" name="Fabian Hamilton">the hon. Member for Leeds, North-East (Mr. Hamilton)</phrase> on obtaining the debate, because debates keep up the constant pressure. Although relatively little that is new happens between each of the Westminster Hall debates on the subject under discussion, the Government must know that the Members of this House are not going to go away. That is a critical message.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/3">I also congratulate the Equitable Members Action Group, whose activities have made it clear that pressure from policyholders is not going to go away. It will continue, and they will have their day in the High Court, pursuing their judicial review, towards the end of July. I wish them the best. Perhaps most importantly I congratulate the 272 Members of Parliament who have signed the early-day motion. That is practically a voting majority in the House, particularly if we take into account the number of hon. Members who simply do not sign EDMs. I think it is the No. 1 EDM, if one can calibrate them in that way. That carries through the incredibly important message that were the motion to be put to the House, which, it seems to me, should be the ultimate decision maker, it would almost certainly pass, and would uphold the ombudsman and her report, and the decision for compensation. I join the others who have argued that as we look, now, to reforming the House, a crucial message is being given, to drive us towards creating opportunities for the House to have its say on such crucial matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/4">I read with dismay the proposals from Sir John Chadwick on the approach that he would adopt and the issues to be addressed in his work on the Equitable Life ex gratia payment scheme. I know that I am putting words into his mouth, but between every line one discerns a great sense of virtual despair as Sir John repeats again and again that he is limited by the terms of reference that require him not to address any issues that have not been accepted by the Treasury. Going through the document one gets his sense that his work is practically pointless because it covers so few issues and can bring about so little compensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/5">There have been discussions of the cost of compensation, but they come in the context of a banking crisis in which the Government have stepped in to rescue many individuals facing hardship, often, again, because of regulatory failure. The underlying principle that the Government should compensate for regulatory failure seems to me fundamental for a civilised society. We are not asking the Government to compensate for market failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.282.1/6">The issue is one on which the House is exercised not only because of the victims&mdash; the Equitable Life policyholders&mdash;but because it represents the dismissal, once again, of Parliament's voice, in Parliament's ombudsman. If that role is to have importance and strength Members of Parliament must stand behind the ombudsman. If we choose not to do so in a situation of this kind, where the case is so evident, we shall be ceding powers that should be retained by Members of the House, and not transferred even to so important a body of Government as the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="a.295.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1667" name="Rosie Cooper">the Member for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper)</phrase> on securing the debate. I know from the passionate way in which she spoke that she is very concerned about the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/2">Governance, leadership and strong lines of accountability are essential to making our schools a success. Parents should be able to send their children to school confident that they will receive the highest possible standard of education; that their health, well-being and safety are being cared for; and that any problems are dealt with by professionals in an appropriate and timely manner. There must be mechanisms in place for parents to express their concerns, secure in the knowledge that they will be dealt with quickly, effectively and fairly by all involved&mdash;the head teacher, the senior leadership team and the governing body.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/3">I was concerned to hear of the experience of my hon. Friend's constituent. I will be pleased to meet my hon. Friend with officials from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to discuss the circumstances of the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/4">To set the scene, I shall talk about the complaints procedure at a local level. Since September 2003, all schools have been required to have a complaints procedure. That procedure must also be published so that it is available for public scrutiny. My Department has produced a complaints procedure toolkit to help schools to formulate their complaints procedures. It took the form of non-statutory guidance that schools could use or adapt to their circumstances. Generally, schools follow the three-part approach: investigation of a complaint by a staff member; investigation by the head teacher or the chair of governors when appropriate; and, finally, if the complaint has still not been resolved, a meeting of a panel of governors.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/5">Governing bodies must act for the interests of the children in their school, which should drive any decision that they take. They must also rigorously ensure that those who serve on complaints panels conduct a fair and unprejudiced investigation. Of course, parents should be kept informed of progress and any decisions taken by the panel.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/6">Beyond the local level, when a parent remains unsatisfied with the outcome of the complaints panel, some local authorities may offer an independent review of the complaint, although that is not a statutory requirement. All complainants, however, have the right to refer the matter to the Secretary of State if their complaint cannot be resolved at local level. Under sections 496 and 497 of the Education Act 1996, the Secretary of State has the power to investigate a complaint and to issue a direction about a decision made by a governing body or a local authority, but he is able to do so only in very limited circumstances, namely when there has been a breach of a statutory duty or when the governing body has acted &quot;unreasonably&quot; with regard to the exercise of a power or the performance of a duty under the Education Acts.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/7">The Secretary of State is not at liberty to substitute his judgment for that of a local education authority or a governing body just because he might have reached a different decision in the same circumstances. Rather, he must be satisfied that a decision is unreasonable in the sense that no reasonable authority or governing body acting with due regard to their statutory responsibilities would have reached such a decision. I should add that &quot;unreasonably&quot; in this context has been interpreted by the courts as meaning acting in a way in which no sensible local education authority or governing body, acting with due appreciation of its responsibilities, would have acted. That is a narrow and testing definition. For example, it does not allow the Secretary of State to substitute his own judgment for that of the governing body, or to issue a direction because he would have acted differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/8">The Secretary of State therefore does not have the power to re-investigate matters that are properly the responsibility of school governing bodies; he can only consider whether the school governing body acted reasonably and within the law in handling and addressing the complaint. Taking that into account, he needs to weigh all the matters and decide whether it is expedient to issue a decision and whether there is a practical step under his powers in education law that he can use to direct the governing body to take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/9">At the heart of the problem that my hon. Friend outlined was a child who fairly obviously had special educational needs that were not being addressed. Local authorities have important and extensive duties to identify, assess and make provision for children with special educational needs, and to keep their arrangements for doing so under review. Schools and governing bodies must do their best to ensure that the necessary provision is made for any pupil who has SEN.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/10">When a child has a statement of SEN&mdash;my hon. Friend indicated that there was no statement in the case she outlined&mdash;parents may express a preference for the maintained school, be it mainstream or special, that they want their child to attend, or to make representations for a placement in a non-maintained special school or independent school. Local authorities must comply with a parental request for a maintained school unless the school is unsuitable to the child's age, ability, aptitude or special educational needs, or the placement would be incompatible with the efficient education of other children with whom the child would be educated, or with the efficient use of resources. If parents disagree with the school named by a local authority in their child's statement, they have a right of appeal to the first-tier tribunal on special educational needs and disability</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/11">If parents believe that provision is not being made to meet their child's needs, they should discuss it with the school in the first instance, through the school's SEN co-ordinator and/or the head teacher. If they remain dissatisfied, they should then discuss the matter with the local authority maintaining their child's statement. If they still feel that there has been no satisfactory resolution, they can make a complaint to the Secretary of State through the SEN operations team in my Department. They should set out their concerns in writing, explaining what provision specified in their child's statement the local authority is failing to provide and enclose a copy of their child's statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/12">The Secretary of State takes very seriously any failure by a local authority to fulfil its statutory duties. Where necessary, the Secretary of State will not fail to exercise the powers available to him under the Education Act 1996. There are, however, limits to those powers, and any direction that he might make must be expedient and commensurate with the issue raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/13">On strengthening schools, my hon. Friend made much of the capacity of governing bodies and the decisions that they might be asked to make. Of course, as our school systems develop to meet the changing needs of education and communities in the 21st century, we must continue to reassess our processes to ensure that they are fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/14">I note what my hon. Friend said about research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment led a working group in his previous role as Minister of State for Schools and Learners to consider how governance will need to develop to meet the needs of 21st-century schools. One of the issues being considered by the working group is improving the skills and training of governors. We will be enhancing training for governors so that it focuses on holding school leadership to account by effective challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/15">Parent governors also have an important role to play. They can engage actively with the school community to communicate the governing body's decisions and give parents more knowledge of how the governing body works. We will press ahead with our work to ensure that all governing bodies have the vision, capacity and skills to provide the best service possible for the children and parents in their communities. The working group is still conducting the review and will report later this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/16">Work is also under way to strengthen the complaints system for parents, following a commitment in the children's plan to consider how to improve the current arrangements. My hon. Friend referred to the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill, which is in the Lords. We are doing two things in the Bill: legislating to enable the local government ombudsman to investigate complaints about individual school issues, and producing both statutory and non-statutory guidance to clarify the processes at school level. She was concerned that matters should be dealt with in a timely way, and I hope that that will be dealt with in the guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/17">The LGO will investigate complaints where there is no alternative right of appeal and where the complaint relates directly to a school's duty. In other cases, parents will still be signposted to other routes. For instance, complaints about permanent exclusions will still be heard by independent appeal panels, complaints related to admissions will still go to the Office of the Schools Adjudicator, and the first-tier tribunal will continue to hear complaints related to local authorities' special educational needs provision. If my hon. Friend wants to write to me formally to say that her local education authority is interested in being a pilot area for the initiative, I will be happy to discuss it further with her.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/18">Most schools handle complaints quickly and effectively, but where they do not, I know that they can cause frustration and upset to parents and pupils alike. That is why we are reviewing the current system and improving it to ensure that it is as robust as possible. That is also why it is important to have checks and balances right through the system, with a clear process so that parents can be heard in the first instance and escalate their complaint if they feel that those handling their case have not given them a satisfactory level of service. We are not asking schools to do something extra. This is about a basic level of service that parents should be able to expect from every school, not just an elite few. Through our reforms, we will ensure that every school is a good school, working hard at the heart of its community to serve local children and their families.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-06-24a.299.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1399" speakername="Andrew Selous" colnum="299"  time="016:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090624/halltext/90624h0010.htm#09062511000597">
	<p pid="a.299.1/1">I am grateful to you, Mr. Caton, and to the previous Speaker for allocating me this debate. It is good that we will have an extra five minutes. I welcome the Minister to his seat. Like me, he will know that we are a nation of animal lovers, which is a good thing, so the issues that we are debating will be of great concern to many of our constituents throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/2">I must confess that I did not know a great deal about the pet passport scheme until one of my constituents came to me a couple of months ago with a rather awful story about what had happened to her and her pet. I will say at the outset that officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs have tried to be as helpful as possible to my constituent. I am grateful to them for that, but I believe that their hands might have been tied to a certain extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/3">By the end of next month, my constituent will have been parted from her much-loved pet for a total of 13 months. The dog has been outside the UK for two six-month quarantine periods. The total cost to my constituent of keeping her dog outside the country now approaches &pound;8,000. Many pet owners would not be able to afford that, so when such things go wrong, sadly, it can effectively be the death sentence of the pets concerned. I accept that the case is an unusual one, but having listened to what my constituent told me and done some research, I have realised that numerous people fall foul of the rules of the pet passport scheme every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/4">Before I describe in more detail what happened to my constituent, it might be helpful if I run through the four general policy areas that that sad saga has illuminated, and I would be grateful if the Minister commented on them. I spoke to his private office early this morning, to be as helpful as possible so that our debate could be constructive.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/5">The first general question is how much discretion the Secretary of State has in such matters. In the case of my constituent, I think that the DEFRA officials generally recognised that the dog posed absolutely no risk whatever to the health of anyone&mdash;human or animal&mdash;in the United Kingdom. The dog had had four different blood tests under two different microchips. It was a British dog and had originated in the UK, which is of course rabies-free&mdash;a significant point. I am aware that the Secretary of State has exercised his discretion on at least two occasions to allow the strict requirements of the pet travel scheme to be waived. They were two distressing cases in which it was right for the Secretary of State to act as he did.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/6">My constituent was told by the Minister's officials that her last hope was for the Secretary of State to authorise a risk assessment in her case. I pressed the Secretary of State hard to do so, but the letter that I received said that it was not possible. My constituent and I are a little unclear about how much discretion the Secretary of State has. As I said, it was recognised that the dog in question did not pose any risk to public health in the United Kingdom. I would be grateful if the Minister elaborated on that slight uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/7">The second general point that I want to put on the record and make pet owners aware of is that, in a minority of cases, people will not be able to bring their much-loved animals back into the UK, which could cause extreme distress and upset. In the vast majority of cases, there are no problems. However, according to Department figures, in 2007, about 4,800 pets fell foul of the scheme and had various problems. There were some problems with microchips, as happened with my constituent. Another 1,300 cases were listed as &quot;any other reason&quot;. People should be aware that, in recent years, the number of people who are faced with such problems has risen to just below 5,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/8">It is significant that pet insurance now covers the cost of quarantine for pet owners who are forced to pay huge sums like the &pound;8,000 that my constituent faced. That should alert us to the issue. I am pleased to put this matter on the public record, so that people are aware of the risk. Although the risk is small, some people may not want to take it if their pets are so important that they could not bear to be parted from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/9">The third area of public policy that I want to probe the Minister on is the six-month quarantine that we insist on for animals coming into the country. The helpful briefing on this debate that I received from the British Veterinary Association said that Nigel Gibbens, the chief veterinary officer, Professor Phil Craig of the university of Salford and Dr. Dilys Morgan of the Health Protection Agency have stressed the need for the current UK requirements to continue. Those requirements are exercised under a derogation from the European Union scheme. However, those people who are much more qualified on such issues than I am support the requirements only because of the problem of tapeworms, specifically the E. multilocularis tapeworm. Is that tapeworm the reason why the UK has a six-month quarantine and is not part of the general European pet passport scheme? We stand with only Ireland, Malta, Sweden and Finland in having a derogation that allows us to have tougher enforcement provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/10">The fourth and final general area of policy that this debate can usefully highlight is about United Kingdom dogs. The UK is thankfully rabies-free, and we must take the proper measures to ensure that we stay rabies-free. Dogs that originate from the UK will have had all the correct vaccinations, blood tests and microchips. When British originated dogs return to the UK from abroad, is there not a case for treating them slightly differently to dogs from the rest of the EU, where rabies is still a problem? It is principally a problem in Romania and Latvia, and is thankfully much less of a problem in the rest of mainland Europe. I wonder whether discretion could be exercised in that area, perhaps in relation to my first point on the general discretion that the Secretary of State is allowed.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/11">Those are the four issues that I want to raise. My constituent's case was tragic. There were two errors, neither of which were her fault. They were innocent errors; they were not made deliberately. The first error was made by a vet after the dog's original microchip came out. A blood test was done after a new microchip was inserted. I understand that a revaccination should have taken place at that point. The dog was then moved to America and had a subsequent blood test there at a local reputable laboratory. However, I understand that the legislation states that the Department accepts only one laboratory in the whole of the United States of America as being valid as far as re-entry into the United Kingdom is concerned. That situation caused the second six-month sentence for the dog, which is currently in Sweden. It is quite a well travelled dog; it has been half way around the world. I am informed that, on <phrase class="date" code="2009-07-29">29 July</phrase>, the dog will be warmly reunited with its owner who has been resigned to waiting for the past month.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/12">In essence, that is what happened to my constituent. She has done a lot of research on this general area, and she has pointed me in the direction of a written answer from the Minister's predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1690" name="Jane Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Jane Kennedy)</phrase>, who responded on <phrase class="date" code="2008-11-26">26 November 2008</phrase> to a parliamentary question from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1509" name="Ann Winterton">the Member for Congleton (Ann Winterton)</phrase>. It is wonderful that our constituents have all this information available through the internet, because they can see exactly what we are up to&mdash;the questions that we ask and the answers given by Departments. The Minister's predecessor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/13" class="indent">&quot;Our current controls may no longer be proportionate to the risk of rabies entering the UK.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-11-26.1621"><i>Official Report</i>, 26 November 2008; Vol. 483, c. 1621W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/14">The excellent officials who are sitting behind the Minister obviously advised his predecessor on that. I would be interested to hear his comments on the matter. I do not want to push the Department to do one thing or another. I am not scientifically qualified and I am not a vet, but I am aware of the rabies risk in this country, and I am here in an interrogatory mode to try to get answers to some of those questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/15">A final related issue is, again, of great significance to disabled constituents, particularly those who have difficulty with their sight or require assistance. I briefed the Minister on that matter this morning. I should like to express my appreciation of the work of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which contacted me to let me know about the difficulties with certain airlines and airports in relation to allowing assistance dogs to travel with their owners who need assistance within the stipulation of the pet passport scheme. I am informed that that issue relates to the European regulation on the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air, which was introduced in July 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/16">The regulation requires European airlines to carry guide dogs and other assistance dogs in the cabin of the aircraft with their owner at no extra charge, subject to national rules, such as the UK pet travel scheme. That all sounds well and good. In the United Kingdom, Birmingham, Bristol, Luton, Stansted, Doncaster, Glasgow, London Gatwick, London Heathrow and Manchester airports are all approved. However, that is not quite as good as it sounds, because I further understand that although Luton, Stansted and Bristol airports are approved, none of the airlines that have sought approval for their routes fly into them.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/17">We seem to be stuck in a bit of an impasse, because people who quite properly should be able to travel with their assistance dogs face a two-stage hurdle: they have to get clearance from the airport and the airline. Will the Minister say whether he is making the airports and airlines feel the heat a little on this issue? Are they delaying in some way? Luton airport, which is close to my constituency and serves a large number of my constituents, has done the right thing. What pressure is the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for Transport putting on those airlines that fly in and out of Luton to make sure that they do the right thing? Edinburgh jumps out as being an airport that is not on the list of nine approved airports. Perhaps the Minister can tell me what he is doing to make Edinburgh airport do what the other airports have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.299.1/18">I shall draw my remarks to a close. Again, I express my gratitude to you, Mr. Caton, and to the former Speaker for allowing me to raise these issues in this land of animal lovers, and I look forward to the Minister responding as helpfully as he can to the various points that I have made.</p>
