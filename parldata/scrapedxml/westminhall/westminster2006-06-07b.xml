	<p pid="b.77.2/1">I congratulate the United British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen's Association, which is based in Nepal, on the excellent campaign that it has conducted, with others, to get a better deal&mdash;a fair and just deal&mdash;and recognition and appreciation from Britain, the country which hundreds of thousands of brave citizens from Nepal have served with such courage and distinction over many decades, for those Gurkha veterans who have not been treated as they should have been after giving up active service. Having praised the association's campaign, I would also like to thank its members for providing so much background information in order to justify a successful conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.2/2">The participation of other Members in this debate is welcome, but I trust that ample time will be left to enable the Minister to respond&mdash;hopefully with encouraging news for the Gurkha veterans.</p>

	<p pid="b.77.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I am happy to call him that, but by convention I should refer to him as the hon. Gentleman. He mentions the campaign. He and I have met good numbers of Gurkhas here in the Palace of Westminster today. Does he agree that the fact that the campaign has been quiet, restrained and dignified has, to an extent, led to protracted negotiations, when the situation might have been resolved rather earlier? Unfortunately, the meek do not always inherit the earth. Nevertheless, people have been very effective.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.77.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="77"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0001.htm#06060755000409">
	<p pid="b.77.4/1">I appreciate that contribution. It is fair to say that the Gurkha veterans have been dignified in the extreme in their campaign. It is a tribute to them that they have been able to maintain that attitude. I hope that their courage and due diligence will pay dividends.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/2">A review of the general issues has been carried out, and its publication by the Ministry of Defence is eagerly anticipated. Perhaps today's debate is pushing at an unlocked door, but how far will the Government open it? Shortly after coming into office, the Labour Government rightly took action towards putting serving Gurkha soldiers on an equal footing with the rest of the British Army, which is to be both welcomed and applauded. However, I seek the Minister's assurance that the 3,000 Gurkhas currently serving in the British Army have equal terms and conditions of service, in all respects, to their British counterparts.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/3">Today's debate relates to veterans who retired before July 1997. It will no doubt be claimed that it is not possible to make amends for the unfair way in which serving Gurkhas were treated by successive Governments prior to then, but I trust that no one will defend the continued unfairness that Gurkha veterans who retired prior to that date have experienced over many decades. That shameful legacy tarnishes British military history and must be ended without further delay. Those veterans were short-changed when they served in the British Army, and they and their families must not be short-changed in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/4">I declare a personal interest. I once served with the 2nd Battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles. Admittedly it was while I was on the armed forces parliamentary scheme, and it was for only four days, but those days on a live exercise in difficult terrain in Kenya are ones that I shall never forget, and I have the T-shirt to prove it.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/5">Two weeks ago I had the honour of welcoming about 50 members of the Nepal-based United British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen's Association to the House of Commons, after which I accompanied them to the Gurkha memorial off Whitehall where wreaths and tribute ribbons were laid, and the last post and reveille were played. We then went to Downing street, where a detailed appeal was handed in calling on the Government to put right the many years of wrong, and to treat Gurkha veterans in the same way as others who have served in Her Majesty's and, in some cases, His Majesty's armed forces. The oldest veteran there had served in Burma in the second world war. Another was the holder of the Victoria cross from a conflict 40 years ago. That medal was one of 13 Victoria crosses to be awarded to Gurkhas among more than 6,500 decorations for bravery.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/6">Gurkhas have frequently been portrayed as the bravest of the brave. They are renowned for their valour on the battlefields and for being exceptional soldiers who are loyal to those they serve. Their tenacity, strength, fearlessness, courage and ferocity are without equal. To Britain's shame, however, there is a parallel history of discrimination in the 190 years in which successive generations of Gurkha soldiers have served the Crown.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/7">The United British Gurkhas Ex-Servicemen's Association, which was formed in Nepal in 2003, is an umbrella group of six different Gurkha ex-servicemen's associations in Nepal. It is a non-profit organisation dedicated to the welfare of Gurkha veterans and to highlighting the problems faced by them and their families. That unifying organisation has been lobbying both the British and Nepalese Governments for equal rights for Gurkhas in relation to pay, pension and other facilities. The association's background briefing tells me:</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/8" class="indent">&quot;That the Ministry of Defence has discriminated against the ex-Gurkhas is a fact, which needs no further elaboration. There is no need to further justify this grave injustice perpetrated 'to a friend by a friend'.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/9">The briefing goes on:</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/10" class="indent">&quot;The Gurkhas have fought with utmost bravery and loyalty for the British Crown and its citizens for the last 200 years. They have made enormous contributions towards the British colonial expansion and have safeguarded the British Empire across the Globe. They fought in both World Wars. They have continued to serve British interests in subsequent conflicts. They have proved to be the most trusted and loyal friends of the British in the most difficult of times...As a reward the Gurkhas are left destitute today. They live a life of misery and shame back home. They are forced to sell their medals of bravery to make their ends meet and many have been forced to beg on the streets of their own villages.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/11">How can we ignore such a situation? Something must be done. I trust that the Minister will say that urgent action will be taken to answer this cry for help. We should collectively hang our heads in shame.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/12">The Minister might suggest that the tripartite agreement between the Governments of the United Kingdom, India and Nepal, which was signed in 1947, or thereabouts, prevents Britain from improving the lot of Gurkha veterans, but I am advised that the Indian Government have written to the association refuting that, and saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/13" class="indent">&quot;This is an issue between the UK and Nepal.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/14">The pension is arguably the most important and contentious issue, and needs to be resolved immediately. Pensions paid to Gurkha veterans need to be brought into line with those paid to British veterans&mdash;proportionate to years of service. The same should be done for the pensions paid to widows of Gurkha veterans. There is no social welfare policy in Nepal, and the widows of Gurkha veterans often suffer extreme financial difficulties. Gurkhas who were discharged without any pension should be considered for a preserved pension, like British soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/15">The medical expenses of retired Gurkhas should be borne by the Ministry of Defence in full. The current system, in which the Gurkha Welfare Trust coughs up funds for veterans' medical expenses, is totally unacceptable. The GWT is a charitable trust and the moneys in it were raised by the Gurkhas themselves or were donated. Rather than allow the current situation to continue, the MOD should bear the full costs of ex-servicemen's medical treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/16">Compensation is another important issue which needs to be addressed. I have been given details of the discrimination in relation to the pay and conditions of Gurkha soldiers while serving in the British Army. I invite the Minister to respond positively to the following point put strongly to me on behalf of the veterans:</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/17" class="indent">&quot;It is only logical that the post-1947 Gurkhas are awarded compensation for the loss in pay and allowances during their entire service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/18">Another issue of great importance that, because of time, I shall address briefly is that of discrimination against Gurkha veterans who left the British Army before July 1997 regarding the granting of indefinite leave to remain in the UK. The Minister need not necessarily respond today; he could do so in writing later. I am advised that veterans who retire after that date are granted leave, and I agree with the association that</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/19" class="indent">&quot;It is morally and legally important that the British Government allow all Gurkha Ex-Servicemen and their families, regardless of when they retired, to enter, work and live in the UK with dignity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/20">Does the Minister agree? If not, why not?</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/21">Another issue that needs to be resolved is the citizenship status of children born to mothers who accompany their Gurkha soldier husbands who serve in the British Army, whether in the UK or overseas. Why cannot they have British citizenship?</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/22">In conclusion, I shall quote from the heartfelt appeal made last month by the association when it sent a special delegation from Nepal to London:</p>
	<p pid="b.77.4/23" class="indent">&quot;As Gurkhas, we feel that the current Review is a wonderful opportunity to address and solve all the aforementioned problems affecting the retired Gurkhas in a just and fair manner, with all sincerity for once and all, acceptable to both the Gurkhas and British Government, thus ensuring that the state of dissent and conflict that now exists between them is resolved forever. It would also ensure that the Ministry of Defence position would be beyond reproach, both legally and morally. Additionally, we feel this will enhance, even more, the warm and friendly relation between the two countries.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="b.80.0/1">First, I should apologise to hon. Members and to you, Mr. Cook, because I may have to leave the debate later to attend to other parliamentary duties.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/2">It is a great pleasure to take part in this debate. I pay particular tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> for the work that he has done on behalf of Gurkha veterans, and to other hon. Members in that regard. In his speech, my hon. Friend displayed his depth of knowledge and his commitment to putting right many of the difficulties that afflict Gurkha veterans after they finish their service with the British Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/3">Nobody can doubt the loyalty and bravery with which the Gurkhas have served this nation. I, too, have experienced service with the Gurkhas, in the jungle in Brunei, albeit for only two days. It was an experience that I shall never forget. Although my jungle warfare skills were not of the highest order, they said that after those two days I was &quot;improving&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/4">I have a particular interest in the Gurkhas in relation to Derring Lines, where company and platoon commanders of the infantry in the British Army are trained, and Sennybridge ranges, which is another infantry training facility. Probably every infantryman in the British Army has experienced it. A Gurkha captain told me that although the Arctic is cold, it is dry, and although the jungle is wet, it is at least warm, but Sennybridge is cold and wet and the highest level of personal organisation is needed to survive there, so it is a test for people wanting to serve in the British Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.0/5">Before I talk about the veterans, I must say that things are improving for currently serving Gurkhas. I pay tribute to the fact that accompanied service for married Gurkhas has now been extended from the minimum three-year period of service. They now have the same conditions as apply to other members of the British armed forces, as long as they have served three years. It is fairly traditional for Gurkhas to get married after their second period of Nepal leave, which is probably after six years. In Brecon, the number of Gurkha soldiers who have their family with them has increased from about 27 to approximately 34. Those Gurkhas serve with the Mandalay company, which is a demonstration company of Gurkhas that helps with the training of platoon and company commanders in the Brecon area. Their contribution to that training is second to none.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.80.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" speakername="David Taylor" colnum="80"  time="009:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0001.htm#06060755000411">
	<p pid="b.80.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is describing the welcome improvements that have been made in recent years. As the hon. Member for Colchester said, there is a serious problem in relation to the 1997 cut-off date, and we must not lose sight of that. Some 32,000 Gurkhas in Nepal are adversely affected by the failure thus far to address the problems that he referred to in his opening speech. That is the key issue of this debate, is it not?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.81.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="81"  time="009:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0001.htm#06060755000412">
	<p pid="b.81.0/1">I agree, but I was hoping to make the point that things are improving for some Gurkhas who will retire from the British Army in future. Their conditions will have been addressed, but the circumstances of Gurkhas who left the Army before 1997 will not be dealt with until the Government take action. We understand those issues, which were well set out by my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester. Gurkhas who are currently serving, as well as those who left the Army before 1997, are still concerned about nationality and indefinite leave to remain.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/2">Although conditions in Nepal have improved to a certain extent and the commitment to democracy which is now emerging will enhance living conditions in that country, the Government must address the fact that Gurkhas who have retired to Nepal do not have sufficient pensions to enjoy their retirement and to ensure that their families are maintained so as to give them security and peace of mind in their remaining years.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/3">My contribution this morning has been relatively short, but my involvement with the Gurkha troops is an ongoing concern. The Minister was kind enough to arrange a visit to Derring Lines, where the Gurkhas are based, so that I could talk to their commanding officer and to some of the soldiers. They have concerns about the people who retired before 1997, some of whom they served with, because they know that the retired soldiers will not have the same conditions and the same enhancements as they will enjoy.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/4">We look forward to the Minister being able to announce at some stage, if not today, that Britain will at last repay the great debt that the nation owes to the Gurkha soldiers, who have made such a huge contribution not only to the defence of the country, but to promoting British interests abroad.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.81.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" speakername="Ashok Kumar" colnum="81"  time="009:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0001.htm#06060755000413">
	<p pid="b.81.1/1">Thank you for calling me to speak in this important debate, Mr. Cook. I had no intention of taking part, but I am happy to say a few words.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/2">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> on securing the debate. The topic is an important one, and I am sorry that some hon. Members are otherwise engaged. Had I not been delayed on the way here, I would have heard all of his speech, but I caught some of it, and I agree with the spirit of his remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/3">I have followed the subject from a distance, always listening and watching what was going on. Over the years, our Government have made an immense effort to tackle discrimination wherever it exists. We have made a start, and although there is still a long way to go, I praise my Government for their record in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/4">I must say to the Minister that the treatment of the Gurkhas is an issue of discrimination. I welcome him to his new post. I am sure that he will take the issue up as one of his causes in his Department and he may become renowned for dealing with it. I agree with what was said earlier about the contribution that the Gurkhas have made as part of the British armed forces; I have never heard a single person say anything different: people recognise the bravery of the Gurkhas and the contribution that they have made.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/5">Discrimination interests me. For the Gurkhas, the important issue is their pensions and how they compare with the pensions given to British soldiers. There is no quick fix or immediate answer, but we must work towards a solution. The Government are carrying out pensions reform elsewhere, so we can take up the matter as part of the reform process if we want to do so. That represents an opportunity for us, although we might be looking a few years down the line. Nevertheless, an acknowledgement by the Minister that there is discrimination in that respect would be a step forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/6">I agree with the spirit of what the hon. Member for Colchester said. We have had many debates on the topic in the House, and it is important that it be kept alive. As long as discrimination and problems relating to nationality, citizenship and so on exist, it is important that the Labour Government&mdash;I hope that people will endorse the Government at the next election&mdash;work to eliminate them. I know that we cannot do everything at once, but we must at least take steps to remedy the situation. I have always championed all that my party has done to tackle discrimination and injustice. I joined the Labour party because it gave hope to young Asians like me. The Labour party cares and fights against injustice and discrimination. The great Governments of Harold Wilson, Callaghan and others introduced race legislation and I see this debate in the same light.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/7">The heroism of the Gurkhas is well documented. Given the contribution that they have made, the injustice must be put right. I believe that in the Government and among Labour Members, there is the spirit to do that. I have known the Minister for almost a decade, since before he entered the House. He gave me a lot of support when I was trying to be elected for my constituency in the north-east and I know that he cares passionately about alleviating injustice. The Gurkhas' situation must be put right.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/8">I am sure that the Minister will tell us all that we have achieved, but I would like him to go a step further and to offer a few words of hope, because hope is important. I am sure that there will be all-party agreement among Front-Bench Members, but we as a Labour Government are in a position to do something and to build on the progress that we have made.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.1/9">I reiterate the importance of the debate and congratulate the hon. Member for Colchester again on securing it. I know that he has been interested in the subject for a long time. At various times in the voting Lobby, often with him walking on one side and I on the other, we have discussed various topics, including the Gurkhas. It is a great credit to the hon. Gentleman and the passionate way in which he has argued this important case that we are discussing it today. As someone who cares that the Labour Government does something about it, I look forward to the day when a debate such as this is not needed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.82.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" speakername="Willie Rennie" colnum="82"  time="009:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0002.htm#06060755000414">
	<p pid="b.82.0/1">I, too, offer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> who has set out his case in his usual passionate, humorous, colourful and casual manner. He is a great asset to the Liberal Democrat Benches and I am sure that all hon. Members agree that he has made a great contribution to today's debate. I am sure that the Gurkhas are delighted to have him on their side.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/2">Fairness and justice; recognition; dignified; equality; destitution; short-changed; begging and discrimination. These are words that have been used in the Chamber this morning and I think that they sum up the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/3">As we have heard, the Gurkhas have served the Crown since 1815. In 1947, the tripartite agreement set out their terms and conditions of service. While their numbers have decreased over the years, the Gurkhas still play an important role, having been deployed in Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone, Bosnia, Afghanistan and many other conflicts throughout the world. In nine years, the Gurkhas will have served this country for two centuries&mdash;200 years of dedication, protecting a country that is neither their birthplace nor their nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/4">One of the key principles of the tripartite agreement was that soldiers in both armies should serve under broadly the same terms and conditions of service. That is an important principle and was an enlightened one at the time. I repeat that soldiers in both armies should serve under broadly the same terms and conditions of service; that is a principle to which I shall return, because it is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/5">I like to give credit where credit it is due, and the Government deserve some credit on this issue. Since they came to power, there have been three important developments, which are rooted in the principles of the tripartite agreement. First, in 2000, the increase in death gratuity to rates comparable with those for British soldiers was a welcome step. Secondly, the introduction in 1997 of married accompanied service for Gurkhas serving in the UK is worthy of praise. Two months ago, all married Gurkhas with three years' service became entitled to married accompanied service. They are also entitled to accommodation for their families, which is charged at the same level as for British servicemen.</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/6">Finally, until recently, Gurkhas could not get indefinite leave to remain in the UK when they were discharged from service. In 2004, the then Liberal Democrat defence spokesperson, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1630" name="Paul Keetch">my hon. Friend the Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.82.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Citizenship should not be something that former Gurkhas should have to apply for. It should be given as a right.&quot;</p>

Shortly after, our call to allow Gurkhas to have British citizenship was finally granted by the Government, albeit upon completion of four years' service and only on application. However, those new rules apply only to those discharged on or after <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>&mdash;the date on which the Brigade of Gurkhas moved its headquarters from Hong Kong back to the UK following the handover to China.

	<p pid="b.84.0/1">My understanding is that we are pressing for full citizenship for Gurkhas, as described by my hon. Friend the Member for Colchester.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.0/2">Many Gurkha veterans and their families are still affected by discrimination in relation to citizenship. About 400 Gurkhas are resident in the UK, of whom 100 are not eligible under the new rules, and there are thousands&mdash;32,000, we have heard today&mdash;back in Nepal. I urge the Minister to consider changes in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.0/3">I also urge the Minister to re-examine the pensions issue. We continue to hear worrying reports from Nepal about Gurkhas living in poverty because they fail to receive sufficient pension payments. I would welcome a report from the Minister detailing his knowledge of the problem, with estimates of its scale. I would also welcome an estimate of the cost of introducing pensions equality between British soldiers and Gurkhas. Unless we have an idea of the real cost, it is difficult to get an exact handle on the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.0/4">A further review of Gurkha terms and conditions of service was announced in January 2005, but it has not yet reported back. A considerable period has elapsed&mdash;sufficient to allow an effective and professional review. I look forward to hearing from the Minister about progress to date. I urge him to use the opportunity to institute changes to the rules of citizenship and to introduce the necessary changes to the pension arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.0/5">To sum up, this has been a short but good debate. It has allowed Members to reflect on the contribution that the Gurkhas have made to the security of our country and our interests abroad, to praise the Government for the improvements to the Gurkhas' situation that have rightly been made&mdash;even if they are long overdue&mdash;and to encourage the Minister to take another step along the Gurkhas' road to equality in citizenship and in pensions. It is the least that they deserve for 200 years of service to our country.</p>

	<p pid="b.84.1/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> on securing this debate and on the way in which he presented his case. Noting the ever-decreasing length of hon. Members' service with the Brigade of Gurkhas, with the hon. Gentleman having undertaken f<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1444" name="Roger Williams">our days and the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Mr. Williams)</phrase> two, I have to say that having been in my post for only a short period, I have yet to do any.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/2">I should like to pick up on a point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> made about the dignified way in which the Gurkhas have presented their case. He questioned whether it has been to their detriment compared with those who present their case loudly. Speaking for myself and for other hon. Members, I respect those who make a well argued and logical case, and I tend to pay more attention to people who make their case in that way than to those who shout from the rooftops, and I hope that the Gurkhas, who have campaigned in the former way, have not disadvantaged themselves. As far as my party and I are concerned, they have not, and I urge all who campaign for change in policy to do so in that way, so that we can engage in a logical and sensible debate, rather than yell at each other.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/3">I, too, pay tribute to the service that the Gurkhas have provided to the Crown since 1815 and in the British Army since 1947. The British public understand and respect that service. That is why the Gurkhas are held in high esteem, and one of the reasons why the subject has been raised in the House on numerous occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/4">When thinking about the history of this issue, it is worth thinking also about the way in which we approach it and from which end of the telescope we look at it. If we consider it in the context of today's circumstances and conditions, we can understand why people use such terms as &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;injustice&quot;. However, if one considers how the current arrangements were arrived at, when the British Army took in some Gurkha regiments, the Indian army took in others and the tripartite agreement was signed in 1947 in a different world and in different conditions, one can see why the arrangements were made in the way that they were.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/5">The Liberal Democrat spokesman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase>, drew attention to the tripartite agreement and the fact that it set down that Gurkhas serving in the British Army should serve under broadly comparable terms and conditions to those under which Gurkhas serve in the Indian army. It is one of the principles that was established at the beginning. The tripartite agreement has not been revised since 1947, although it is true that when British Governments have made changes, they have made them in accordance with its original principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/6">It is worth welcoming the several changes that the present Government have made since they came to power in 1997, but it might be sensible also to recognise that piecemeal change might not be the way forward. That is why in January 2005 we welcomed the then Secretary of State's announcement of a comprehensive review of Gurkhas' terms and conditions of service. That is probably a better approach than making changes incrementally and without thinking through the whole package. We welcome a comprehensive review. It is disappointing that it has taken a good deal of time, but I know that the Minister will say more about it today. I understand that he hopes to complete the review and make an announcement later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.84.1/7">Frustrating though the delay might be, having considered other issues during my time in my present post, I have concluded that it is greatly to be preferred to take the time to get the review right and investigate all complexities at this stage, so that when the Minister comes to the Dispatch Box later this year to announce the results of the terms and conditions review, it is comprehensive, well thought through and results in a change that endures. It should not be rushed, so that we end up returning to the matter every year to put right issues that were not thought through properly. One has to spend only a brief period considering the issues and the complexities that might arise to understand that. I welcome the review, and I am glad that the Minister is taking the time to undertake it properly.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.3/1">The Minister says that he does not know either.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.3/2">When the Minister comes to the House later this year with the results of the review, we will consider the review in detail, and if we consider it wise to give it our full support, we will. With the work not having been done yet and without having seen the review, however, I do not want to commit us in advance to whatever it may propose.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.3/3">As part of the review, it would be wise to ensure that we discuss with the Government of Nepal the review's implications and any impact that it may have on the situation in Nepal. It would be useful if the Minister could confirm whether that will happen. I am conscious that we must consider the impact of our changes on those areas of Nepal from which Gurkhas have traditionally been recruited. In making changes in Britain, we must ensure that there are no unfortunate effects in Nepal. Despite what hon. Members have said about the terms and conditions of service under which Gurkhas serve, and notwithstanding the questions that the hon. Member for Colchester has raised, if we consider the number of Nepalese who apply to join the Brigade of Gurkhas, which is about 100 for each available place, it seems that in their assessment, serving the Crown and serving in the British Army is attractive and rewarding. We should take the review forward in consultation with the Government of Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.3/4">Without wishing to broaden the review, I ask that when the Minister is undertaking it, he considers this final point. There are more than 7,000 other foreign nationals serving in the British Army, and it may be worth him considering whether any changes need to be made in relation to them. The last thing that we want to do is change the terms and conditions of service for the Brigade of Gurkhas, and then find that a significant number of other issues arise.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.4/1">The figure that the hon. Gentleman gave for the number of foreign nationals serving in the British Army is, I think, somewhat greater than the figure in reality. However, the big difference is that the Gurkhas serve in their own units and regiments, whereas other foreign nationals who join Her Majesty's armed forces serve in British Army regiments, battalions and other units. In terms of pay and conditions and, as far as I am concerned, all other respects, they are immediately treated as though they were British. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that the significance is that the Gurkhas serve not in British Army units but in their own regiments?</p>

	<p pid="b.87.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a fair point. I have the latest figures, and there are just over 7,000 foreign nationals serving in the armed forces, most of them in the British Army. I am simply saying that if the comprehensive review considers indefinite leave to remain and the appropriate qualification for British citizenship, and the Minister makes decisions on Gurkhas in those areas, another set of questions will be raised about what expectations those serving in the British Army should have in relation to indefinite leave to remain and becoming a British citizen. It would be sensible to think about that while resolving one set of issues, so that we do not create another set of issues and end up coming back to this place to debate them. I am conscious that if we do not think about the overall position, we could make changes that, although welcome in themselves, create a whole set of other perceived unfairnesses. I urge the Minister to think about that.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.1/1">I commend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1507" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Bob Russell)</phrase> for securing the debate. He had kind words for me on my first run-out in the Chamber a few weeks ago, but I suspect that he will not be as happy with my response this morning. However, I hope that I can give him some reassurances on the points that he raised. He will know that although I am new to this job, I am not new to Gurkha policy; he and I have often sat in on Adjournment debates on the issue just for the fun of it, not least those in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1701" name="Ann Widdecombe">the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe)</phrase> made contributions in 2003 and 2004.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/2">I acknowledge the hon. Gentleman's service of four days in the Gurkha battalion. I can just about beat <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1714" name="Ashok Kumar">my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough, South and East Cleveland (Dr. Kumar)</phrase>, in that I managed to spectate&mdash;but not serve&mdash;for two hours in Catterick last week, when I saw the Gurkhas training. After those two hours, I was not unapprised of their worldwide, fearsome reputation. I hope to spend more time with them in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/3">On a serious point, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> talked about the quiet, restrained and dignified way in which many of the Gurkha ex-servicemen's groups make their point. The United British Gurkhas Ex-servicemen's Association is one of many Gurkha ex-servicemen's groups that put their point to Government day in, day out, and the hon. Member for Colchester has been a powerful advocate for them this morning.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/4">What amazes me about Gurkhas is the journey that they take as individuals. The brigade starts with 15,000 potential recruits in the hills of Nepal. Rigorous pre-selection training narrows it down to 200 recruits, who make a journey from Kathmandu to Manchester and then on to Catterick, where they undergo 39 weeks of training. I have been lucky enough to witness that training. We have all been impressed by their quality and the commitment with which they take up service in the Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/5">One thing that I would like to talk about this morning is the journey that the Government have taken since the tripartite agreement in 1947 to try to target and change policy to fit the changed circumstances of Gurkhas, in the military context. I have a number of detailed points to make in answer to issues raised by the hon. Member for Colchester. He will have read the report, &quot;The Gurkhas: The Forgotten Veterans&quot;, as have I, and I am considering it at the moment. I will respond formally when I have the opportunity to do so thoroughly. However, I want to honour the commitment made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1657" name="Don Touhig">my predecessor, my hon. Friend the Member for Islwyn (Mr. Touhig)</phrase>, to meet the authors of that report. I am trying to ensure that I see them as soon as possible. Also, I am meeting the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald to talk about her concerns about the terms and conditions that apply to our Gurkhas; the hon. Gentleman will know that she has made a large and lasting contribution on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/6">Let me give some reassurances about the current terms and conditions of Gurkhas, and then I shall try to explain the veterans' situation. We believe that successive British Governments have treated Gurkhas fairly, in the context of the time in which they served, and we have already introduced significant improvements to their terms and conditions, as has been acknowledged by Members of all parties today. The review of their terms and conditions of service that is in hand will definitely lead to an even better deal for modern Gurkhas. The Government deeply appreciate the contribution that Gurkhas have made over more than two centuries to our Army and, in more recent years, to the life of this country as their presence here has increased. As part of the British Indian Army, they served in numerous campaigns, culminating in the two world wars, in which thousands of Gurkhas participated.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/7">The British Brigade of Gurkhas is an important element of our defence capability and now numbers some 3,300 men. It includes two battalions of infantry, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, and specialists in signals, military engineering and logistics. They are stationed in 14 locations across England, Wales and Scotland. A battalion of the Royal Gurkha Rifles is stationed in Brunei under our defence agreement with the Government of that country, and over the past 12 months, Gurkhas have been deployed in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Iraq, where they served&mdash;as ever&mdash;with great distinction.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/8">We have not forgotten Gurkha veterans or the debt that we owe them. We pay more than 26,000 Gurkha service pensions to retired soldiers and their dependants, and last year that amounted to some &pound;33 million. Even a retired Gurkha private soldier's pension is comparable to workers' salaries in Nepal and is almost 10 times the national per capita income. On that point, I shall try to answer some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2021" name="Willie Rennie">the questions raised by the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Willie Rennie)</phrase> later.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.1/9">Nepal is a developing country, recently torn by internal strife, which we fervently hope is coming to an end. Retired Gurkhas living there are Nepalese citizens living in their own country, and it is not surprising that some heart-rending instances of hardship can be found there. The Government and the British public support the valuable work of the Gurkha Welfare Trust, which aims to ensure that no such case goes unaided. The hon. Member for Colchester mentioned medical costs; we doubled Gurkha service pensions in 1997 so that retired Gurkhas could use some element of their pension to pay for their medical costs.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.1/1">Not off the top of my head, but I will write to the hon. Gentleman and will go through the figures with him, if that is okay.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/2">As I said, we support the aims of the Gurkha Welfare Trust, and in addition the Department for International Development will pay &pound;30 million in aid to Nepal. We pay tribute to the Gurkhas' courage and commitment on operations, and their hard work as valued members of our community in peace. In return, over the years, British Army service has afforded many benefits to thousands of Nepalese citizens&mdash;to Gurkha soldiers and to their families. In modern times, that mutually beneficial relationship has been possible only because of the unique status of the Gurkhas, in terms of their role in the British Army. Nepal has never been a member of the British empire or the Commonwealth, and Gurkha service to the British Crown has been enabled only by a succession of agreements with the Government of a sovereign and independent Nepal. That remains the case, and those agreements, to which the hon. Gentleman referred, date back to 1815.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/3">After the Gurkhas' distinguished record of service in the Army of the former British Indian empire, at the time of Indian independence in 1947, an unparalleled arrangement between the British, Nepalese and Indian Governments allowed Gurkhas to continue their service to the British Crown while remaining Nepalese citizens. On <phrase class="date" code="1948-01-01">1 January 1948</phrase>, the predecessors of our current Brigade of Gurkhas transferred to the British Army on terms based on that agreement, which is the tripartite agreement that we have talked about.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/4">The unique status of those who transferred means that they joined the British Army, served, and then retired as Nepalese citizens. As my predecessor said in an Adjournment debate secured by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald&mdash;which I think the hon. Member for Colchester and I both sat in on&mdash;it would have been irrational if Gurkha terms and conditions of service had not taken account of that. We were committed to discharging Gurkhas in Nepal where, with pensions that were very substantial by local standards, and often with valuable skills, they settled in retirement and made an important contribution to the economy of one of the world's poorest countries. We employed the Gurkhas on the same terms on which they came to us: those of the Indian army of the day. Therefore, many of the terms and conditions were different from those of the wider British Army&mdash;for example, pay, pensions, soldiers' terms of engagement and the officers commissioning rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/5">Originally, many of these differences came about because the Indian Government, who continue to employ many Gurkhas, wanted equality between their Gurkhas and ours. In those days the Gurkhas were one of a number of forces serving under the British Crown but enlisted and based overseas, whose terms and conditions of service reflected this. British Gurkhas continued to serve as they had in the old Indian army: in formed Gurkha units consisting entirely of Nepalese soldiers and officers, except for a few British officers and specialists. That has always been considered essential to maintaining the Gurkhas' formidable fighting spirit.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.0/1">Does the Minister know what the position is of those Gurkhas&mdash;whole companies on occasion&mdash;who serve in British units?

Would those Gurkhas be treated as Nepalese volunteers or British soldiers in terms of pay, conditions and subsequent pensions?</p>

	<p pid="b.90.1/1">I think I shall answer the hon. Gentleman's question as I continue my speech. If I do not, he can pull me up on it again.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/2">The Nepalese Government were, and remain, rightly sensitive to any suggestion that British Gurkhas were mercenaries, as has been said in other areas of this discussion. They saw exclusively Gurkha units serving in the British Army with their Nepalese identity preserved as reflecting on honour and prestige on the reputation of Nepal. Even now, Gurkhas usually serve as members of formed Gurkha battalions, squadrons or companies within the Brigade of Gurkhas, although there are notable exceptions. Although the working language of the Brigade is English, the structure enables the Nepali language to be spoken, and provides religious and cultural support to every Gurkha family.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/3">There have been improvements in the intervening years. For example, in 1972, Gurkhas serving in the UK received a cost of living allowance that, added to their Indian army rate of pay, gave them broadly comparable take-home pay to that of their British counterparts, and when they served in Hong Kong they were paid an allowance that reflected prices there. Over time there has been a constant review of and improvement to support and services for Gurkhas.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/4">However, the presumption has always been that Gurkhas would retire in Nepal, and their terms and conditions, particularly their pension arrangements, continued to reflect that understanding. When the time approached for the UK to hand over Hong Kong, through a gradual process, the Gurkhas were withdrawn from that country. The hon. Gentleman will know that that process ended on <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>, when what had hitherto been a force enlisted and based overseas was now predominantly based in the UK. It was only natural at that point that Gurkhas and their families would increasingly regard the UK as an alternative home to Nepal, and that their expectations and aspirations would develop accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/5">In my view, it was inevitable that the terms and conditions appropriate to a force based in the far east would have to adapt to that change in circumstances. In evolving these terms and conditions, we have always sought to protect the unique identity of the Gurkhas and their relationship with their homeland, which the hon. Gentleman has talked about, and the presumption of their retirement in Nepal has remained.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/6">Worldwide parity of take-home pay was brought in as part of a package of changes introduced in that great year of 1997. It included a new universal addition, which brought a Gurkha's take-home pay&mdash;wherever he was serving&mdash;up to the same level as that of his counterpart in the wider British Army. Gurkhas were allowed to be accompanied by their families in UK, as was already the case in overseas stations such as Brunei, although under the tripartite agreement, that was limited to 25 per cent. of all personnel. At the same time, Gurkhas retained some privileges not available to other members of the Army, such as the traditional &quot;Nepal long leave&quot; of five months every three years at the public expense.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/7">Some differences stemming from the original Indian army terms and conditions were retained because they were seen as more suitable for the Gurkha's unique status as a Nepalese citizen. The Gurkha soldier was virtually guaranteed 15 years of service, which earned him a pension for life immediately on discharge&mdash;often at the age of 32, 33 or 34&mdash;and after that for his dependants. The Gurkha pension scheme provided pensions that are modest by UK standards but represent a substantial income, annually updated for inflation, in Nepal. Such an early payment of pension is not available to other members of the British armed forces. Over 80 per cent. of ex-Gurkhas, if they had been members of the armed forces pension scheme, would have returned to Nepal with only a preserved pension payable at age 60.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/8">The Gurkha's expectation of service depends on his progress through the ranks. A corporal would have to retire after 15 years, whereas a warrant officer class 1 would serve for 22 years. The 22-year notice of engagement in use for all ranks in the wider Army is only manageable because in recent years British junior ranks have tended to leave voluntarily if not promoted, sometimes after four or five years. Traditionally, Gurkhas serve for as long as they can, and it would not have been possible to offer them all 22 years' service because that would have resulted in a stagnant, unmanageable manpower structure in the brigade's exclusively Gurkha units, and it would have denied to many Nepalese citizens any opportunity of British Army service.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/9">I believe our predecessors tried hard to get the balance right between the maintenance of traditional Nepal-facing terms and conditions and their assimilation, where appropriate, into those of the wider Army. However, since the move of the Gurkhas' base to the UK and the progressive alignment of their roles with those of their counterparts in the wider Army, the differences between their respective terms and conditions of service have increasingly come under scrutiny, as they have today. The Government have responded to that in order to ensure that fairness is at the heart of how we treat the modern Brigade of Gurkhas.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/10">Improved arrangements for Gurkha married accompanied service were announced in August. In 2003, seven Gurkha veterans had challenged many of the differences in their terms and conditions of service, particularly their different pension arrangements, by way of judicial review. The judges accepted that the differences were still justified because of the Gurkhas' unique status, and that a full like-with-like comparison with the wider Army could not be made. The courts dismissed all complaints and subsequent appeals, although they did, exceptionally, warn that the 25 per cent. limit on married accompanied service should be reviewed. We have done that, and from <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, all Gurkhas with at least three years' service will have the same entitlement to be accompanied by their families at their duty station as soldiers in the wider Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/11">The immigration rules were changed in 2004 to make it easier for Gurkhas to return to this country on discharge from the Army. Successive Governments have maintained the policy that British citizenship is not automatically given in return for military service, but granted on grounds of residence, towards which such service might count.</p>

	<p pid="b.92.0/1">I appreciate that this is not a matter for the Minister's Department, but for the Home Office, and I had discussions with his predecessor about it, but will he assure me that the Ministry of Defence is of the view that service to the Crown should count as residence, even when the soldier is serving overseas?</p>

	<p pid="b.92.1/1">I think I can. If I cannot, I will clarify that by letter. I do not want to give the hon. Gentleman an assurance on behalf of another Department, particularly the Home Office, dare I say.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/2">Both Gurkhas and Commonwealth citizens usually serve in our armed forces while maintaining their own nationality. Although the presumption of retirement in Nepal has been accepted by the courts as part of the unique arrangements for Gurkha service, ex-Gurkhas had always been able to apply to return to this country under normal immigration rules, such as under the work permit scheme. I think that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/3">In 2004, we accepted that from the time the Gurkhas became based in the UK in 1997 they should be able to apply for settlement here in the same way as Commonwealth citizens leaving our Armed Forces. On discharge, they could count four years of their military service towards the residential qualification for indefinite leave to enter the United Kingdom and, subject to entry clearance, could settle here with their families. They could subsequently apply for British citizenship, if they wished to do so, under normal rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/4">The Prime Minister announced the new Her Majesty's forces immigration rule on <phrase class="date" code="2004-09-30">30 September 2004</phrase>. We understand that virtually all Gurkhas discharged since the rule took effect have applied for visas to enter the UK. Those discharged since <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> have until October of this year to apply. It became clear that more serving and retired Gurkhas and their families would be living in the UK than ever before, and the Government determined that the remaining differences in their terms and conditions of service, especially the Nepal-facing ones, should be reviewed. That is what we are doing now.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1588" name="Mark Harper">The hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr. Harper)</phrase> made a point about the remit of the review. I shall give a bit of the context. A former Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1378" name="Geoff Hoon">my right hon. Friend the Member for Ashfield (Mr. Hoon)</phrase>, asked in January last year for a comprehensive review of Gurkha terms and conditions. It is by far the widest-reaching review since 1948 and is examining every remaining difference between Gurkha and UK terms and conditions. Much of what I have said, inasmuch as it refers to Gurkhas' current terms and conditions, may be affected by the review.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/6">We have consulted serving Gurkhas through surveys and focus groups, and we are in close touch at official level with the Nepalese Government. We have tried to be as inclusive as possible and have invited other interested parties, including groups representing Gurkha veterans, to express their views. The complexity of the review has proved even greater than we expected, and I welcome the support that we have had in ensuring that we have time to ensure that the review is comprehensive and wide-reaching. I hope to be able to report back to the House with the outcome of the review as soon as I can, and I take the matter very seriously. I want to be able to give good news to the House that will satisfy some of the aspirations that have been expressed today.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/7">Meanwhile, I am pleased to say that we have been able to introduce some improvements in advance of the review's final report. In addition to the immigration concession and improved facilities for married accompanied service, which were the two main concerns that were raised by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald, as everyone knows, the Gurkhas have been included in the national insurance scheme so that they can qualify for national insurance benefits, including the state retirement pension and the state second pension. From April this year, collective settlement of their income tax and national insurance contribution liability by the Ministry of Defence and the provision of free food and accommodation, offset by corresponding abatements of their universal addition, ceased, and Gurkhas will now see full details of their pay, tax and charges and be eligible for rebates of food and accommodation charges when appropriate in the same way as any soldier in the wider Army. Those improvements were widely welcomed by serving Gurkhas and the groups that represent them.</p>
	<p pid="b.92.1/8">I have to emphasise that the review is focused on the terms and conditions of service for serving and future Gurkhas.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.0/1">I am getting a bit alarmed. Did the Minister say that the review is not historical and applies only to current and future Gurkhas? If it is not historical, the campaign that is being waged will have to be reinvigorated.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.1/1">I ask the hon. Gentleman to hear me out and let me make my point. If he is not satisfied, he should come back to me again.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/2">As part of the review, the Department is looking again at the pension position of Gurkhas back to <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>, when the Gurkhas first became a UK-based force. We remain of the view that the position of Gurkha veterans discharged prior to <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase> remains exactly as it was when the judicial review reached its conclusions. We maintain that their terms and conditions may have been different, but that they were not discriminatory. On the issue of veterans' pensions, I remind the Chamber that it has been the long-held policy of successive Governments not to make retrospective improvements to public sector pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/3">The hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife asked whether we had estimated the cost of adding a retrospective element to the scheme for the time before 1997, back to the tripartite agreement of 1947. It would cost many billions of pounds if we were to do that, even before we accept that it would have repercussions in terms of precedent for other pension schemes in the public sector. There are good reasons for our not making retrospective changes for those who have already left under earlier pension rules, as that would make future improvements unaffordable. To depart from that rule for one group would inevitably cause others to demand the same treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/4">I recognise that that will disappoint the hon. Member for Colchester and those who retired before <phrase class="date" code="1997-07-01">1 July 1997</phrase>, particularly those distinguished former Gurkhas who handed in a petition to Downing street on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-22">22 May</phrase>. I acknowledge the strength of feeling that this subject and other veterans' issues generate among certain Gurkha ex-servicemen's groups, although we have tried hard to explain the situation to them, including by sending MOD officials to hold briefings in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/5">I hope that I have provided some reassurances that the Department continues to treat Gurkhas with the significant respect that they earn and deserve. To reflect on the more recent period, in 1997 the brigade became a UK force, in 2003 we reviewed the responsibilities for Gurkha families and later in 2004 we changed their immigration status. I hope to align their terms and conditions further with those of the British Army. We are on a journey with their terms and conditions and I hope that it is a positive one.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.1/6">I know the hon. Gentleman will be disappointed with my last point. There will always be people who think that we should do more and that we can do more, but I believe that our treatment of Gurkhas, Gurkha veterans and their dependants has been and remains both fair and reasonable under the circumstances.</p>

	Hull to York Transport Gateway
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.95.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="95"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0003.htm#06060755000433">
	<p pid="b.95.2/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate and to have an opportunity to shine a light on and raise the profile of the corridor from Hull to York&mdash;often known as the 1079 corridor because of the A1079, which unfortunately is famous more for its accident record, congestion and failure to support a powerful and dynamic growth area than for any other reason. I am grateful to the Minister for being here today and I am glad to welcome her to her new post.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/2">The issue is of growing importance to many of my constituents in Beverley and Holderness, in respect of not only car transport but transport of freight and public transport. First, I plan to discuss the economic and social transformation that has taken place in the region over the past decade and the growing demand for a viable, expanding transport infrastructure that is commensurate with and supportive of that growth. I plan then to concentrate on two specific issues: the A1079, which runs between Hull and York; and the proposed reopening of the Hull to York railway line, including the section that no longer exists between Beverley and York. I shall then focus on the relatively poor funding that the East Riding of Yorkshire receives from central Government for local transport and conclude by making a plea to the Minister to work on correcting all those injustices.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/3">The East Riding of Yorkshire is performing strongly. The local economy is doing well, business investment has increased significantly in recent years and more people are moving to the area than ever before. Population growth in the region is now the second fastest outside London. People are attracted to the area by its relatively high standards of living, excellent leisure opportunities and an education system which, despite being one of the lowest funded in the country, continues to achieve year-on-year improvements under the guidance of the East Riding of Yorkshire council.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/4">Meanwhile, the two cities of Hull and York remain powerful economic regional players. Hull is currently one of the largest cities in the country, with a population approaching 330,000. It hopes to take strides towards becoming one of the country's top 10 cities. It is recognised as an international leader in telecommunications and is an important gateway to mainland Europe, with a successful port that caters for more than 1 million passengers a year. The port of Hull on the north side of the River Humber is a regional priority and has had more than &pound;94 million-worth of investment in the past 15 years alone. It is the leading timber port in the country, and it is estimated that up to 16,000 jobs have been generated in Hull directly from the operation of the port itself or from the presence of local businesses that have established themselves in the area because of relatively easy access to the continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/5">It would be fair to say that Hull is a sleeping giant. Like many of the great football teams that languished in the old second division or the current championship but year after year hoped for life and premiership performance to come their way, Hull is working to make that happen. In fact, this year the people of Hull showed at the ballot box their preparedness for change. Whoever is in power, it is hoped that Hull city council will provide fresher and more dynamic leadership. There are real prospects for future premiership performance for the city of Hull.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/6">That strong regional performance has been achieved in spite of, not because of, a regional transport infrastructure that has grown increasingly inadequate. The cities of Hull and, in particular, York continue to be let down by the sorry state of local transport links. At present, there is no direct rail link between Hull and York. Instead, rail passengers must travel three sides of a triangle via Brough and Selby, which can take the best part of 90 minutes. The main road linking the two cities, the A1079, is certainly not fit for purpose. It runs through the urban centres of Beverley, Market Weighton and Pocklington and is predominantly rural in nature. It is used by an estimated 15,000-plus vehicles a day. That number increased by 9 per cent. in just four years up to 2003. However, only 4.5 km of the road is dual carriageway, with the remaining 39.5 km single carriageway. As hon. Members can imagine, journey times can be long indeed, especially in the morning and evening rush hours.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/7">We all recognise the progress that has been made in reducing road casualties and accidents over the past years, but that road has a dreadful safety record. According to Government figures, there have been more than 275 accidents in the past five years alone. Sixteen people have lost their lives, including three people in a single incident in November 2004. That is undoubtedly an issue of major concern to my constituents. As one local resident said in a recent local authority consultation exercise, there is almost no margin for error when driving on the A1079. Martin Ward, a Market Weighton resident, was involved in two accidents on the road last year. He recently stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/8" class="indent">&quot;There are too many junctions without slip-roads that are opposite one another, which leaves every motivation for people to dash across the carriageway.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/9">For motorcyclists such as Mr. Ward, the road is unacceptably unsafe.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/10">Put simply, the road is crying out for a major programme of improvement. The East Riding of Yorkshire council, which prepared a position statement to assess congestion levels on the A1079, concluded that the road is operating</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/11" class="indent">&quot;near to its theoretical capacity for a single carriageway of its width and characteristics.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/12">It is simply not sustainable in the long term to promote significant migration into a region without taking steps simultaneously to invest in local infrastructure, especially transport infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/13">Realistically, we must start thinking about widening the A1079 to cope with the growing demand. However, that will not come cheaply. For example, the published target cost for widening the A453, which is predominantly a rural road, is &pound;90 million for a 12 km stretch. That is based on an estimated cost of some &pound;8 million per kilometre. Given that the A1079 currently has 40 km of single carriageway, widening it clearly will involve a major investment and almost certainly will require significant Government assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/14">The Yorkshire and Humber regional transport strategy identified the A1079 as an important link and a main public transport corridor. The analysis deals with the importance of Hull and the port, but the assessment of local transport links is focused too much on improving the M62-A63 transport corridor, which, as Members may be aware, is the main route into Hull from the west of the city. The strategy goes no further than to acknowledge that</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Access between Hull and York is also poor&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/16">which is an understatement if ever there was one.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/17">Moreover, the Minister may be aware that the Department for Transport de-trunked the A1079 in 2003 and handed it over to the local authority to maintain. With growing traffic on that road, it is easy to understand why local people believe that that was a cop-out. An important regional road that was already running over capacity was de-trunked and, most importantly&mdash;I shall return to this issue&mdash;funding was not provided to go with that de-trunking. In effect, the Department left the road to the local authority without offering support. I would be interested to hear the Minister's thoughts on that point. If she cannot offer a guarantee that the Department will review the local funding arrangement, will she pledge to consider taking the road back?</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/18">Serious attention should also be given to the proposed reopening of the Hull to York railway line. The Hull to Beverley line is still in existence, but the extension from Beverley to York was axed in 1965 as part of the Beeching cuts and has never been reopened. Recently, however, there has been growing political pressure&mdash;people pressure, from the ground up&mdash;for its return. A local interest group, the Minsters Rail Campaign, was set up two years ago to put pressure on local council leaders and others to consider reopening the line. As a result, East Riding of Yorkshire council responded in March 2004 by appointing a consultancy group to carry out a feasibility study. The results were positive.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/19">The group estimated that 2004 passenger figures would total 395,000 journeys per annum, based on the running of one train an hour; 584,000 journeys per annum for two trains an hour; and 622,000 journeys per annum for two trains an hour, with one journey extended to and from Leeds. A point worth making in that context is that transport in the region, particularly at the northern end of the A1079, is about not just reaching York but accessing Leeds and other areas. Any changes and improvements should recognise that, by providing east Yorkshire with access to other places and other markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/20">Moreover, basing its analysis on a series of roadside interview surveys that took place in March 2004, the consultancy group Carl Bro estimated that 15 per cent. of users of the A1079 would be likely to switch to the train if a decent, reliable service linking Hull, Beverley and York were provided. That could result in the removal of large numbers of vehicles a day from the A1079, which would undoubtedly help to reduce congestion on the road, meet Government targets on reducing the use of the car, and reduce the number of accidents from the current unacceptable level.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/21">The sticking point is cost, which was estimated in 2004 to be in the region of &pound;239 million. That included a &pound;28 million risk allowance and a 15 per cent. optimism bias allocation&mdash;an excellent idea to put into the funding of any project&mdash;as required by the Department for Transport. Carl Bro considered a number of different scenarios, including the running of the line as a community rail project&mdash;again, in line with Government thinking&mdash;which, according to that expert transport consultancy, would increase revenues and reduce costs. As a result, the economic assessment over a 60-year period shows a benefit-cost ratio of between 1.26 and 2.04, with the non-revenue benefits boosting the economic situation to provide a positive net present value in all cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/22">Despite taking that into account, however, the initial assessment based on current costs and fares is that the operation would not be financially self-supporting from fare income alone and would require ongoing financial support. That is one reason for this debate. It has become increasingly clear that if East Riding is to sustain current growth and investment levels and establish a transport infrastructure that will allow it to compete with other regions, it will require a level of Government support far higher than it currently receives.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/23">There is growing evidence of a systematic lack of investment in integrated transport in the Yorkshire region as a whole and specifically in East Riding. The <i>Yorkshire Post</i> recently launched a campaign, &quot;Road to Ruin&quot;, which aims to highlight the huge discrepancy between regions in funding for transport. It has pointed out that, for example, Yorkshire receives just &pound;224.21 a person in transport funding overall, as compared with the staggering &pound;667 a person handed out to transport projects in London.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/24">Like other Yorkshire MPs, I recognise the special case of London and would not suggest that the comparison is entirely valid. None the less, the discrepancy cannot be justified. According to research by the passenger transport executive group, Yorkshire receives just 7.6 per cent of the total transport budget for England, while London receives almost 34 per cent. That is a huge discrepancy, especially when one takes into account population growth in Yorkshire and the Humber, where nearly 5 million people now reside.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.2/25">The unfairness of the current funding system can be seen more clearly at an even more local level. Recent data from East Riding of Yorkshire council show that the area receives just &pound;9.12 a person a year from central Government to spend on integrated transport. That compares with a regional average of &pound;14.47 a person and with the &pound;19.13 a person that is distributed to York. That level of underfunding could have a devastating impact on local businesses, stop the regeneration of the area and prevent the effective meeting of Government targets and aims.</p>

	<p pid="b.98.0/1">I have listened with interest to the hon. Gentleman.

	<p pid="b.99.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right and speaks from his constituency perspective. There are growing connections, but unfortunately the Hull-York bid for the dental school was not successful. However, that effort and the way in which the bid was put together, which was widely praised, was symbolic of growing work between the universities and the cities. The hon. Gentleman is right to focus on that work, which forms one of a number of strands that link the two cities together, involving local communities along the route, so I am grateful for his intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/2">The level of underfunding could have a devastating impact on local businesses. Terry Hodgkinson, who was chairman of Yorkshire Forward, the regional development agency, said recently:</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/3" class="indent">&quot;I am very optimistic that our region's future is bright, but ultimately, how well we do will depend on our success in securing these improvements&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/4">meaning the infrastructure improvements necessary to deliver. As the new chief executive of Yorkshire Forward also said recently, it is not regional development agencies that create wealth, but businesses. The fundamental role of Government is to create a framework and an environment that is conducive to entrepreneurialism and success, if we are to deliver Government aspirations and those of the people whom we represent.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/5">To conclude, East Riding of Yorkshire is the second fastest growing region in the country outside London. Its economic, social and environmental performance depends on the strength of its transport infrastructure. Critical to that is the corridor between Hull and York, but it is simply not up to scratch. The main road running between the two cities is running at above its design capacity and has a bad history of accidents. The old railway line is for the most part still available, and according to a local consultancy&mdash;if Leeds counts as local&mdash;can be reopened and, although requiring some support, be run at a passenger subsidy well below that needed for many other lines, while offering a positive cost-benefit ratio that could be supported by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/6">The region has been systematically underfunded for too long. I urge the Minister to look into the matter and to come forward with funding to support the dualling of the A1079 road and the proposed reopening of the Hull to York rail link, which has the support of a number of MPs in the region. I am glad to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1807" name="John Grogan">the see the hon. Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan)</phrase> in the Chamber and I have spoken at length to other hon. Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1954" name="Greg Knight">my right hon. Friend the Member for East Yorkshire (Mr. Knight)</phrase>, who supports the main arguments that I have put forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.0/7">East Riding has taken great strides forward in recent years, but that development is at serious risk because of a transport infrastructure that remains unfit for purpose in this new century. I and other hon. Members from all parties recognise the pressures on Government funding and, although I might be optimistic in hoping for a positive response in all respects to this debate, I hope at least that the Minister will take on board the arguments. I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the issue and hope that this debate can play a part in our long-term analysis of how to deliver improvements for the benefit of constituents and the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.100.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" name="Graham Stuart">the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr. Stuart)</phrase> on securing this debate, to which I have listened carefully. I also thank him for his kind remarks welcoming me to my new post.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/2">Before dealing with the specific concerns raised, I shall make some general but important points to give some context to my response to the hon. Gentleman. The Government and my Department certainly recognise the importance of good transport links for economic and social regeneration, and for improving access to jobs and key services. Better access to and from urban centres such as Hull and York, whether by bus, rail or car, is crucial to achieving that.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/3">The pressures on the transport system are well known and familiar to us all. We have a legacy of under-investment that goes back decades, and as our economy has grown and prospered, that has brought further pressures on all modes of transport. That is why the Government are committed to sustained long-term investment in transport and have doubled transport spending in the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/4">Our transport strategy is about reducing social exclusion, tackling congestion and pollution and enhancing people's quality of life by improving all types of transport in ways that increase choice and as an investment for the future. In all of this, however, there is a need for realism. We cannot satisfy every demand for transport infrastructure enhancements, whether road or rail, as the hon. Gentleman said. Major infrastructure improvements are expensive, which he acknowledged, and they take time to deliver. Our job is to prioritise and to be realistic.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/5">Partly because of that experience, we have introduced a much more transparent system for seeking the regions' views on their transport investment priorities within regional funding allocations. Regional and local bodies now have a much clearer picture of the resources that are likely to be available to their region in the next 10 years, and we have given them the opportunity to advise the Government on how they believe those resources should be allocated to best serve the region's needs and objectives. That advice, which included the Beverley integrated transport scheme, was received from the regions at the end of January, and we plan to respond to it shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/6">I agree with the hon. Gentleman that good local transport is fundamental to building thriving and prosperous communities. However, I should like to clarify for him the truth of the financial situation. Since 2000-01, we have more than doubled the funding to local authorities for transport in every region, taking it up to more than &pound;1.6 billion in 2006-07. Funding for local transport in the Yorkshire and Humber region has increased from &pound;75 million to &pound;160 million in 2006-07. The East Riding of Yorkshire alone will benefit from &pound;11 million for local transport this year&mdash;a significant increase from &pound;2.9 million in 2000-01.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/7">The hon. Gentleman raised two specific issues. I shall deal first with the question of highways investment in his area and, in particular, the A1079. That road provides a regionally significant link between Hull and York and the urban centres of Beverley, Market Weighton and Pocklington in between. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-04-01">1 April 2003</phrase>, the remaining sections of the A1079 between Kexby Bridge and Barmston drain were detrunked, and the responsibility for maintenance was taken over by East Riding of Yorkshire council. The full route, between the York city boundary and the Hull city boundary, is some 44 km in length and is now part of the authority's primary route network.</p>
	<p pid="b.100.0/8">I advise the hon. Gentleman that, contrary to his suggestion, the local authority wished to take on that responsibility. I can assure him and his constituents that, as part of the detrunking agreement, the Highways Agency made a settlement of more than &pound;500,000 per year to East Riding of Yorkshire council to fund works that otherwise would have been undertaken by the agency. In addition, since detrunking, more than &pound;4m has been provided for carriageway maintenance and &pound;1m for bridge maintenance on the A1079 in recognition of its status as an important corridor on the primary route network.</p>

	<p pid="b.101.0/1">Obviously, all funding that has been provided is welcome, but does the Minister accept that the funding is still inadequate and that the number of fatalities that have occurred on the road&mdash;16 in five years&mdash;is not good enough on a road such as that? As she says, East Riding of Yorkshire council is happy to look after the road, but only if it is provided with sufficient funds, and the council's opinion is that the funding is not sufficient to provide the quality of road and the safety standards that both the council and the Government want.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.101.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1686" speakername="Gillian Merron" colnum="101"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0004.htm#06060755000438">
	<p pid="b.101.1/1">In its second local transport plan, East Riding of Yorkshire council has considered further dualling of the A1079 north of Hull to address the safety issues that arise, particularly when drivers are overtaking. It is exploring the prospects of dualling schemes for the highway between Killingwoldgraves roundabout and Dunswell and between Shiptonthorpe and Pocklington. My Department will consider those ideas if and when firm proposals are made and they receive regional support through the regional funding allocations process.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/2">Without a doubt, safety on the A1079 is a major concern. I am pleased to say that the Humberside safety camera partnership is installing six safety cameras on Market Weighton's Arras hill. A further seven cameras will be installed on Beverley bypass by the end of this month. Judging by the record of the Humberside safety camera partnership so far, that should, I would hope, halve the number of accidents and save the pain and misery suffered by many families each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/3">In view of the time, I shall now discuss the York to Beverley railway line. Before its closure, the line served a number of settlements, and in recent years there has been interest in reopening the line. The most recent local transport plan refers to the potential for reopening, bearing in mind the need for careful evaluation and the realities of funding constraints. I am aware of a study commissioned by the Countryside Agency and published in 2003, which examined the possibility of reopening disused railway lines in Yorkshire and the Humber. The study identified a number of potential benefits of reopening the line in question, but it also highlighted several major obstacles in the form of development across the track bed. It suggested that those might be dealt with through new alignments, but it also noted that at Stamford Bridge and Market Weighton, creating new alignments would be more difficult due to the level of development that has occurred. The study concluded that although the York to Beverley line should be considered for reopening in the longer term&mdash;10 years or more into the future&mdash;it should be protected from further development in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/4">As the hon. Gentleman said, a further study was undertaken by the consultants at Carl Bro for East Riding of Yorkshire council, and I was pleased to have the opportunity to consider it. As he also said, it reported that the operation would not be financially self-supporting from fare income and would require ongoing public subsidy.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/5">The decision to protect a section of railway is a matter for local planning authorities, in line with national, regional and local planning policies. I would expect such decisions to be based on discussion with relevant stakeholders, including Network Rail, and consideration of the costs involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/6">It is important to note that, although the railways are growing faster than ever and we have not closed our mind to the expansion of rail, the Government's investment priorities must be driven by an objective assessment of where the greatest benefit, economic and environmental, is to be delivered. Generally, that follows strong patterns of established demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/7">For that reason and because of the poor historical performance of a range of branch lines and experimental services, it would be unfair of me to suggest that consideration of the proposal outlined by the hon. Gentleman is likely to be a realistic priority for the Government in the immediate future. Of course, it is always open to local planning authorities to produce their own proposals on the basis of their own committed funding, but such a proposal must also be subject to rigorous scrutiny, starting with consideration of whether it offers the most effective transport option. The production of a business case involves a considerable investment of time and resources, and any authority would consider carefully its own priorities in the context of local, regional and national plans, just as central Government do.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/8">This year, the Government are spending &pound;110 million every week to improve the railways. That commitment to our rail network is helping to bring in further substantial investment from the private sector. In addition, there have been significant improvements in the railways in recent years, which have led to a considerable increase in the number of rail passenger journeys. For example, in 2003-04, for the first time since 1961, more than 1 billion rail journeys were made. Importantly, the Government recently announced &pound;370 million to deliver access improvements to stations across the network in line with the new provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.1/9">I confirm that we are working to improve transport connectivity in east Yorkshire as a whole. The local transport plan system has provided more certainty of funding for local authorities, so that they can tackle local issues. We are making progress on improving transport and we are committed to continuing to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.3/1">I thank Mr. Speaker and your good self, Mr. Cook, my parliamentary neighbour, for giving me the opportunity to discuss the vital issue of the middle east peace process. This is a crucial time, and 2006 could well be seen as a key year in the peace process. Of course, every year could be seen as key, given the frustrating nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the wider middle east peace process. I could, for example, mention 1993, when the Oslo accords were signed, 2000, when the Camp David summit was held and the second intifada started, or 2003, when the international Quartet's road map was published, Prime Minister Sharon commented that Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories must end and the Israeli disengagement policy was unveiled. However, 2006 seems to be emerging as a landmark year in the peace process, with the removal of Sharon from active Israeli politics on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-04">4 January</phrase>, the Palestinian elections, which brought Hamas into government, and the Israeli elections in March. I shall first discuss those two hugely significant elections&mdash;one in Israel and one in Palestine&mdash;and then, if possible, widen the scope of the debate to encompass the security barrier and the behaviour of Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/2">The middle east peace process remains full of problems, paradoxes and controversies. Last week, I was privileged to introduce Ambassador Dennis Ross at a meeting of the Labour Friends of Israel, which I chair. As right hon. and hon. Members will know, Ambassador Ross is a distinguished expert on the middle east, who played a leading role in the first Bush Administration and the Clinton Administration and who has dealt directly with Israel and the Palestinians. At last week's meeting, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/3" class="indent">&quot;today we are not in the peacemaking business&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/4">Instead, there is a pressing need to control and improve the situation on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/5">The Israeli elections in March saw the formation of a new coalition, led by Kadima, with the Israeli Labour party as senior partner. I congratulate the Labour party leader, Amir Peretz, on that success. I met Labour Members of the Knesset when I led an LFI delegation to Israel and Palestine in February and I was impressed by the party's domestic social agenda, which had a familiar ring. The party was even using footage from the British Labour party's 1997 and 2001 election broadcasts to promote their key policy&mdash;a minimum wage. That is incredibly encouraging. The success of the Labour party in March demonstrates a willingness among Israelis to debate what sort of society they want theirs to be, and it is clear that that society will be more socially inclusive and embrace a greater redistribution of wealth.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/6">The Israeli Labour party is also progressive and innovative on security matters. It is committed to a two-state solution and a negotiated final status settlement. It has emphasised the importance of sustaining talks with President Abbas's office and is determined to heighten his status. The appointment of Mr. Peretz as Minister of Defence is also a positive development, and I hope that the Labour party's leading role in the coalition will see a greater push towards negotiation. In his own words, Peretz is committed to a</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/7" class="indent">&quot;policy to continue waging war on terrorists while trying to ease restrictions on the Palestinian people&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/8">wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/9">There is much to support elsewhere in the coalition. The new Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert, will visit the Palace of Westminster next week for an open meeting with Members of this House and the other place. At that meeting, I hope that he will explain how he will implement the clear mandate that the Israeli people gave him in the March elections to continue withdrawals from the west bank. What is known as the convergence plan involves withdrawing from all settlements east of the fence, dismantling illegal outposts and potentially resettling 70,000 settlers from the west bank. The policy, which is still in its formative stages, would establish provisional borders in accordance with the road map and would not deviate wildly from the map drawn up under the Geneva accords.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/10">Right hon. and hon. Members would be right to have reservations. Obviously, a unilateral plan is far from ideal, and we should continue to strive for negotiation, but we are where we are, and in the absence of a partnership for peace, unilateralism remains the only option. If we are to keep the peace process moving, we should recognise that fact and reluctantly and cautiously welcome that unilateralism. Concessions on the Israeli side could, I hope, catalyse similar developments on the Palestinian side to produce a state of what some commentators have called, perhaps oxymoronically, parallel unilateralism.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/11">That brings me to the Palestinians and specifically Hamas. On the one hand, the fact that there were free and fair elections in January&mdash;an event matched in the region only in Israel&mdash;is to be welcomed and is a cause for optimism. On the other hand, the fact that Hamas was the victor is a setback. Clearly, the Palestinian Authority, whatever its political complexion, needs to address severe domestic challenges, such as severe economic hardship, the need for social, education and health care improvements and the need to tackle corruption. When I was in Palestine in February, it was evident that it would take time for Fatah really to come to terms with the fact that Hamas was simply better organised politically on the ground, with a shrewd and sophisticated awareness of the simple need to get out the vote. There are domestic challenges, but perhaps parallel unilateralism will allow progress to be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.3/12">However, the election of Hamas remains extremely worrying. The organisation unequivocally calls for the destruction of the state of Israel, which is simply unacceptable in a governing party.</p>

	<p pid="b.105.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this important debate and on his speech so far. Are not the Israelis absolutely right to concentrate on doing their best to support President Mahmoud Abbas and ensure that his view, even if he takes it directly to the people through a further referendum, prevails over that of Hamas, which, as the hon.

	<p pid="b.106.0/2">The international community, which provides &pound;1 billion a year in funding to the Palestinian Authority, has asked Hamas to meet three basic conditions for the funding to continue, and I know from reading the report of one of the hon. Gentleman's Adjournment debates that he mentioned this very issue. The three conditions are that Hamas should recognise Israel, renounce terror and respect existing international agreements. In the past 24 hours, President Abbas has extended by a number of days the time that he has given Hamas to accept his offer implicitly to recognise Israel, which is part of the 18-point prisoners' document.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, because time is short. Would it not represent some progress if Hamas recognised the right of Israel to exist at all, given that its charter calls explicitly for Israel's destruction?</p>

	<p pid="b.106.4/1">I agree absolutely. As I said, time is running out, not only in this debate, but on that wider, more fundamental point.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/2">When a suicide bomber attacked the busy streets of Tel Aviv over the Passover holidays in April, killing nine people and injuring nearly 100 others, Hamas leaders condoned the attack. What could possibly be gained from that? However, I am struck by the recent comments by Rashid abu Shabak, a Fatah leader whom President Abbas appointed in April 2006&mdash;against Hamas's wishes&mdash;to the post of security director for the west bank and Gaza. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/3" class="indent">&quot;Hamas is acting as if it is isolated on the moon and can keep two identities, government and opposition. Hamas jumped overnight from being the group that attacked Israel to the government that has to arrest people who do that.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/4">In the meantime, the Palestinian people have the most to lose. Regimes that are committed to religious fundamentalism have dangerous consequences for the populations over which they rule&mdash;not least for women, minorities and political activists.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/5">Furthermore, there has been the danger that the necessary sanctions may lead to an economic crisis. The international donor community has had to tackle a serious dilemma because of the need to continue to provide aid and assistance to ordinary, decent and innocent Palestinians while bypassing, at the moment, the Palestinian Authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/6">A way has been found to do that. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase> the international Quartet agreed on a new funding mechanism to be administered by the EU, whereby money can go directly to humanitarian causes such as schools and hospitals. Individual state donors have also increased their humanitarian budgets. That includes the UK, led by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development, whose Department has pledged an extra &pound;15 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for humanitarian funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/7">I draw right hon. and hon. Members' attention to the document &quot;Aiding Peace&quot; produced by Labour Friends of Israel, which was submitted to the Treasury as part of the consultation on the economic aspects of the peace process, led by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer and my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury. It details other crucial elements needed for peace, including political stability; improving access to markets and supplies; stimulating employment and building up the Palestinian private sector; and establishing microfinance for Palestinian small and medium-sized enterprises, thereby strengthening the business environment and improving economic competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/8">Arguments persist that economic improvement cannot be addressed until Israeli security restrictions are addressed too. I urge understanding, however, that such restrictions are a consequence of the conflict. At last week's meeting, Ambassador Ross made the point that Israel daily faces about 60 security threats; I shall return to that point shortly. The reason why there are so few suicide bombings is that the Israeli defence force pre-empts many of them. I hope that the reduction in Israeli security restrictions and an increase in Palestinian economic activity and prosperity can, with the right leadership, occur in tandem.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/9">The debate on security must now take in Hamas as well. It may have come to power by democratic means but it has not embraced the democratic tradition and responsibilities of a democracy. Hamas has allowed the streets of Gaza, which was fully evacuated by Israel last year, to be controlled by militant factions engaged in running battles. Members of the Palestinian press reporting on those clashes have received death threats from Hamas because of their critical reporting of the Government and their sympathies with Mahmoud Abbas's office. Meanwhile, rocket attacks from Gaza on civilian targets in small Israeli towns have continued. Those attacks are crude and relatively inaccurate and therefore, thankfully, unsuccessful, but crucially they add to the Israeli sense of insecurity, especially because of the fear that a hit on the Ashkelon industrial zone, with its fuel and chemical depots and power station, would cause a major disaster. The attacks have provoked retaliation from Israel and the re-spinning of the cycle of violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.4/10">I believe that those daily rocket attacks by Palestinian militants are the biggest short-term obstacle to peace. The Israelis fear that if the attacks cannot be stopped in Gaza, from which they have withdrawn, they will spread to the west bank, from where every major town and population centre in Israel will be a target.</p>

	<p pid="b.107.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman share my concern about something that is one of my abiding memories of Israel, from a visit earlier in the year with the Conservative Friends of Israel&mdash;a Hezbollah terrorist guarding the border of south Lebanon and presenting the organisation as the legitimate authority in Lebanon? Is that not an example of a dangerous precedent: a terrorist organisation seeking legitimacy as a political party when it is responsible for the murders of innocent citizens?</p>

	<p pid="b.108.0/1">I agree with those points, and although the hon. Gentleman and I did not go on the same visit, we probably stood in the same place and witnessed the same sort of thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/2">Against the background that I have been describing, the new coalition Government in Israel face big, but not insurmountable, challenges as they build their governing momentum following the election. Perhaps the most immediate challenges are domestic security and the barrier, which I shall discuss next, and the wider context of regional security and the threat from Iran, which I hope to mention later.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/3">The security barrier is an unfortunate but sadly necessary consequence of the conflict. Its route and the impact that it has on Palestinians are contentious and the Israelis are conscious of that, but please let us remember why it is there. A few years ago, no one in Israel wanted it. The left opposed it on humanitarian and political grounds. The right opposed it on ideological grounds, fearing, as the Palestinians do, that it represented a border in contrast to their territorial dreams. For many, the financial cost also seemed prohibitive. Then in March 2002, in a single month, there were 37 suicide bomb attacks, claiming 135 lives. The frame of the argument changed dramatically, and changed again when the barrier proved so effective and suicide bombings dropped down the graphs. There has been a 90 per cent. reduction in attacks by terrorists and a 70 per cent. decrease in the number of Israelis killed per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/4">I am not going to say that the barrier is welcome. I have seen it myself and have experienced in a very minor manner some of the discomfort and frustration of waiting for hours trying to cross the security barrier. I had to endure it only for an afternoon, so I fully sympathise with those people who have to endure that situation for hours, daily&mdash;twice a day&mdash;to go to work, take goods to market or see their families. I have seen at first hand the disruption that it causes to people's lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/5">One cannot dismiss fears about the barrier's status. The international community needs to understand its physical and psychological importance. I mentioned earlier that the Israeli defence force is pre-empting many attempted suicide attacks. The primary reason for that success is the barrier. It slows attackers down, aids their detection and deters their attempts.</p>

	<p pid="b.108.1/1">The location of the barrier, which seemed to me during an Inter-Parliamentary Union visit in November to be more like a very large wall, is the contentious point. Why must it be drawn so as to confiscate so much Palestinian land?</p>

	<p pid="b.108.2/1">It would be wrong to say that no consideration has been given to Palestinian territorial claims or human rights. Israel's Supreme Court, for example, which is open to Israelis and Palestinians alike, has taken a major role in determining the route of the barrier. Israeli judges made a landmark ruling in 2004&mdash;this is, I think, the crucial point in response to my hon. Friend&mdash;that the fence is legal only if the courts determine it to be proportionate in balancing Israel's responsibility to keep its people safe with its responsibility to safeguard the rights of Palestinians. In Jerusalem, which is, I accept, where the barrier is at its most controversial, construction is on hold in many areas, pending further rulings from the Supreme Court.</p>

	<p pid="b.109.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that both the Labour party and the trade union movement in Israel have taken the clear view that, for reasons of security, the wall should stay, albeit that they want it within pre-1967 borders?</p>

	<p pid="b.109.1/1">My hon. Friend and I went on the same visit and saw together, at first hand, the wall and its ugliness&mdash;in all senses of the word&mdash;but we also saw how it provides security and reassurance to Israelis. I certainly accept my hon. Friend's point.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/2">In effect, the Israeli courts have had a veto over the route of the fence, and as a result, since February 2005, the proposed route has run for much of its length along the 1967 border, as my hon. Friend mentioned, and is much closer to that line than it previously was in other areas. Where the fence deviates from the green line its aim is as a tactical restriction to fulfil the aims of hindrance, detection and deterrence.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/3">Let me be blunt. In the end, armies can be negotiated to armistice and walls and fences can be negotiated back or down. The victims of terrorism cannot be negotiated back to life. It is the success of the barrier and its halting of the cycle of violence that created the political space for the Gaza withdrawal to take place and, from that, for the concept of territorial concessions to become the consensus approach to the peace process.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/4">The checkpoints and road blocks around the west bank have made it extremely difficult for Palestinians to travel in and around towns in the west bank&mdash;a reality that has, as I have said, had a detrimental effect on their trade and business. Israel continues to assess its road blocks policy but has found it hard to reduce restrictions when armed Palestinians are stopped on a regular basis and terrorist networks continue to operate. Similarly, Palestinians have found the Gaza-Israel border crossing at Karni closed for, so far, nearly half of 2006, which means that they have lost millions of dollars in wasted agricultural exports that were unable to leave Gaza. Peretz has promised to try to seek a solution to keep that area open more frequently, but there is apprehension from the security forces, which continue to thwart potential terrorist attacks from militants who hope to use the area to gain access to Israel.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/5">I stress that Israel needs to ensure that all its security measures are proportionate and in accordance with the rights of ordinary, decent and innocent Palestinians. We should continue to press for that, but that pressure will be more effective if there is greater acknowledgement of the concerns of both sides, of the dilemmas Israel faces, and of the effectiveness of constructive, contextual, case-by-case criticism rather than the sometimes hysterical and uniquely disproportionate commentary that the conflict often receives.</p>
	<p pid="b.109.1/6">Practical work can also be done. The deal agreed in November 2005 on the Rafah border between the Gaza strip and Egypt is an example of how the international community can make a difference not only in wide and impersonal regional politics but in humanitarian issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.0/1">I would like briefly to draw attention to the relaunch on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-03">3 May 2006</phrase> of the international women's commission for a just and sustainable peace between Israel and Palestine, which is welcomed by many. I understand that women have been meeting across the political divide for many years, even when there was no discussion and debate elsewhere and talks had completely stalled. All women Members of this House, particularly the new ones, hope to work with women elected to both the Knesset and the Palestinian Authority to support them as they move forward with the commission.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. She is far too modest to tell the Chamber that she plays a leading role in this House in creating awareness and co-operation between women MPs here and those in Israel and Palestine. I pay tribute to her in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/2">The international community has a role to play. It is hugely important that the situation is not allowed to stagnate into entrenched positions. The newly formed Israeli Government plan further withdrawals to ensure that that does not happen. The UK Government should support that initiative and ensure that the plan is executed in consultation with Mahmoud Abbas who remains in control of Palestinian security policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/3">The international community must remain engaged in the conflict. The role of honest broker remains crucial. The UK has embraced that role in the past and must do so again. The London meetings on Palestinian reform in March 2005 were forward-thinking and totally opened the debate into Palestinian self-governance, security and economic policy. The UK also enjoys a fruitful relationship with Israel. As I said, the Israeli Prime Minister will be in London next week, when he will meet my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister. No doubt they will engage in an open and productive dialogue.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/4">The UK Government have firmly shown their commitment to the road map and the peace process, but when considering the middle east peace process, we must be careful not to look at the conflict only through the narrow prism of Israel and Palestine. The dispute is being played out on a regional and international stage. The conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is largely determined by the actions of neighbouring countries. Finally, and perhaps most ominously, I move to the issue of Iran.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.1/5">Iran's contribution to the conflict comes in the form of state-sponsored terror, existential threats against Israel, holocaust denial, rhetorical incitement and nuclear proliferation.</p>

	<p pid="b.110.3/1">Yes, I can confirm that. I am not certain how that advances the argument, but I can confirm those facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.3/2">The regimes in Iran and Syria continue to support, fund and train terrorist organisations that operate in the middle east and threaten regional security. Groups supported, bankrolled, armed and, in some cases, even controlled by Iran and Syria include Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. State-sponsored terrorism undermines prospects for peace in the middle east peace process and the UK's commitment to regional reform, and threatens the UK directly where there are troops stationed in Iraq and Afghanistan. Hezbollah, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1573" name="David Burrowes">the hon. Member for Enfield, Southgate (Mr. Burrowes)</phrase> mentioned, receives most of its funding from Iran. It continues to threaten Israel's security along its northern border, and only last week it launched attacks against Israel.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.3/3">Iran's rhetorical attacks against Israel, together with its attempted procurement of nuclear weapons pose, an existential threat to Israel. There have been calls from right hon. and hon. Members for a nuclear-free middle east, but there have also been calls for a middle east stabilised by nuclear deterrence. I suggest that neither is possible when the president of one nation is unrelenting in his call for another to be wiped off the face of the map.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.3/4">Once again, the UK has led the international community with patience and innovation, led first by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House, and lately by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. The latter carries with her, in her first few weeks in the job, the support, wishes and hopes of this House and all hon. Members' constituents in her current endeavours with our European and international partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.3/5">Over the years, we have all seen the ebb and flow of progression and setback which has characterised conflict in the middle east. With each progression, it is easy to become over-optimistic, and with each setback, it is all too easy to slide back into pessimism. I have tried to demonstrate to right hon. and hon. Members that whatever stage we may find ourselves at in that cycle&mdash;as I said at the start, 2006 is a key year in this process&mdash;the overall trend is and always should be towards democratic negotiation, resolution and peace.</p>

	<p pid="b.111.1/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing the debate. The sheer attendance illustrates the importance of this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/2">It is easy for people here and in the middle east to get depressed about the situation given that the state of Israel has existed for 60 years and it has been 90 years since the Balfour decoration. It is almost like a new 100 years' war that never comes to an end. However, when one looks beyond those bald statistics, one sees that there has been enormous change in that period: the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which has held; an exchange of ambassadors and a peaceful relationship; the Jordan-Israel peace treaty, which is an equally important treaty with Israel's second neighbour; and, most significantly, both Israel and the Palestinians have accepted that there should be a two-state solution. That would have been inconceivable for the Palestinians and many Israelis until relatively recently.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/3">What made those things possible? One should not underestimate the significance of national leaders. It is rather like the situation in South Africa with the end of apartheid: it needed not only Mandela, but de Clerk&mdash;two leaders from each community who were able to look to the future, not just the past. In relation to the middle east, considerations such as Anwar Sadat's flight to Israel to address the Knesset, King Hussein's courage with the Jordan treaty, and Yitzhak Rabin becoming a peacemaker having been a warrior all show what can be achieved. The challenge is whether Olmert and Abbas can both come up to those important standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/4">Clearly, a negotiated solution is the best way forward. I almost hope that Hamas will reject what has been put to it so that a referendum can go ahead. I can think of nothing more important and significant than a referendum of the Palestinian people endorsing Abbas's call for a two-state solution, so that thereafter discussions and negotiations could take place with that clearly being the will of the Palestinian people, and Hamas being clearly sidelined on that issue at least. If that turns out not to be possible, for whatever reason, we should not reject out of hand the Israeli commitment to a unilateral approach, because it reflects two fundamental changes that have taken place in Israeli thinking among those who are traditionally on the hard-line right of Israeli politics.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/5">The first change is the recognition that, given the demographic changes taking place, Israel as a democratic society simply cannot hold on permanently to the whole of the west bank and Gaza. In a sense, the Israelis have concluded that in future the state of Israel will not be the same as the land of Israel. The land of Israel may be a biblical concept, but the state of Israel will have to have more modest aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/6">The second change in Israeli thinking is strategically very important. For many years Israel said, and reminded anyone who went there, &quot;Security requires us to occupy the west bank. Look how small Israel is; look how quickly we could be overcome if a conflict broke out&quot;, but the reality is that it no longer has any fear from conventional Arab armies. Egypt and Jordan are at peace with Israel and there is no Arab state that could conventionally defeat it, and the Israelis are comfortable with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/7">Israel faces two kinds of threat: the demographic threat if it holds on to the whole of the west bank and ceases to lose its Jewish identity, and, perhaps more important, a missile threat. Whether nuclear or otherwise, missiles can attack Israel, which is not protected from that simply by holding on to the west bank. For that reason, even those on the right of Israeli politics are now prepared to contemplate a unilateral withdrawal from the west bank, should it prove necessary. That offers a major new opportunity for a peaceful solution to the crisis, which we have not had in the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/8">Given the time limit, I shall just make some brief points. I hope that the Israelis will take them on board should the negotiations go forward, or should they not and a unilateral solution is required. The first is that they should not feel too guilty about the wall or fence. It is not aimed at keeping people in, like the Berlin wall was; it is to keep terrorists out. That is a pretty fundamental distinction. However, as part of any ultimate agreement, unilateral or otherwise, the fence will have to go, because the economic future of the region requires close economic co-operation between Palestine, Israel and Jordan. Such co-operation is not possible with the long-term existence of the wall.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/9">Secondly, the 1967 boundaries cannot be an absolute determinant of where the new frontier will lie. If the Israelis want, for understandable reasons, to hold on to some settlement areas, they must be willing to contemplate exchanges of territory, so that the overall Palestinian territory is not seriously diminished as a consequence.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/10">Thirdly, nobody in their right mind wants a new barrier through the middle of Jerusalem. There are solutions to this. The Vatican-type status in Rome does not detract from the sovereignty or security of Italy any more than recognition of the holy places in east Jerusalem as non-Israeli territory would in any way damage any fundamental interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/11">Fourthly, the right of return is very important from the point of view of Hamas and some Palestinians. The Israelis cannot be expected to concede that, but they can be expected, perhaps with American help, to offer generous financial compensation as part of an overall package. The current plans of the Israeli Government appear to envisage holding on not just to settlement areas, but to a whole section of the Jordan valley. I do not see any military need from them to do so. I believe, and hope, that that is simply a negotiating ploy so that they will have something extra to concede as part of an overall peaceful solution. They cannot expect to hold on to the Jordan valley; it has to be part of a Palestinian state, although a demilitarised valley should clearly meet Israeli requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.1/12">Given the time pressures, I should just like to make one final point. Although Israel and Palestine can be a source of deep worry and depression, we should never lose sight of the fact that there is a fundamental difference between the Israeli-Palestinian dispute, despite the length of time that it has existed, and other disputes, such as those over Kashmir and Cyprus or the Tamil problem. The difference is that we already know what the final structure will be: the Israelis and Palestinians will each end up having their own state. Therefore, the problem is not what kind of ultimate structure there will be; it is exactly how we get there and what the details should be. That is different from any of the other problems that bedevil the world as a whole, and it is a source of hope and confidence rather than one of worry and depression.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.0/1">I shall be as brief as possible. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the debate and the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> on his contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/2">Although I am sure there will be differences of opinion on the substantive issues involved, today's attendance indicates something. This has been one of several Westminster Hall debates on this subject in recent months, but we have not had one on the Floor of the House for as long as I can remember. It is time that such a debate was held. I think that we all agree that it should take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/3">My hon. Friend mentioned that we need to examine the situation on the ground and keep it in mind. He is right about that. Although this is an area where statistics hit us from all angles, we must understand, at this stage more than at perhaps any other time, the grinding poverty that is affecting the Palestinians. We are talking about unemployment levels of 31 per cent.; in Gaza the figure is 40 per cent. Poverty levels are rising. Food insecurity has risen by 14 per cent. in the past 10 months, and the United Nations is predicting that it could reach 51 per cent. this month.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/4">Access for Palestinians in the occupied territories has got worse in the past 12 months. Three ambulances were attacked by Israeli troops in the last week in May. There were 376 road blocks and checkpoints prior to disengagement from Gaza in September and there were 515 by mid May this year. Karni, which is a lifeline of goods going in and out of Gaza, has been closed for 44 per cent. of the time since the start of 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/5">I give those statistics not only because they are part of the reality on the ground that we need to bear in mind, but to say to my right hon. Friend the Minister that, while I understand and have a good deal of sympathy with the international community's demands on Hamas, it is not a simple thing to say, &quot;Cut off assistance from the Palestinian Authority and somehow you can protect the Palestinians anyway.&quot; The Palestinian Authority runs 75 per cent. of all schools, and 62 per cent. of primary health care clinics are run by the Ministry of Health. We are talking about hitting essential operations: water, maintenance of refuse services, sewage collection, and so on. When the Minister sums up this debate, will he say how the alternative mechanisms that will somehow get assistance through to the Palestinians, while bypassing the Palestinian Authority, will work? The statistics that I cited are not from February or March; they are published in a United Nations report from the end of May, after the Quartet's announcement of the alternative mechanisms.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/6">This week, Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian President, engaged in a brave proposal. I believe that Hamas should recognise Israel. I do not say that Hamas should accept the two-state solution, because one thing that my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool should understand is that, to all intents and purposes, it has already done so. There are legion comments from its spokespeople&mdash;most recently, the BBC reported one such comment yesterday by the parliamentary speaker&mdash;saying that Hamas accepts the two-state solution. Recognition is a different issue, and it has some way to go on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/7">If we are to ask Hamas to recognise Israel, the point that I made to my hon. Friend about which borders was not one simply of academic significance. It is of real significance. People are living under occupation. If at this stage there are no guarantees about what their state will be and what the Israelis will recognise, what are we asking them to recognise? The deal might be to recognise the 1967 borders, although there needs to be negotiation about whether that ends up to be the final settlement. Let us accept that international law is the kernel of a settlement. Such a deal would mean that Israel withdraws from land it occupies and it means that the Palestinians accept the internationally recognised borders of Israel based on the 1967 borders. That would be something real, but it is not the situation that we are in.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/8">This issue is of more than academic significance, because if we are to say vote for recognition to Palestinians, who are suffering the poverty that I was describing, we must be as clear as possible that when the referendum or whatever is used comes, they will vote for that. They should not see, one more time, the international community adopting one set of standards for them and another set for the Israelis. If they were to get that impression, given that they are faced with that grinding poverty, we will probably be heading not for an acceptance of the two-state solution but for greater conflict, with all the tragedies that that will mean for Palestinians and Israelis.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/9">I ask the Minister again to clarify whether, when he is asking the Palestinians to recognise Israel, he is saying that they should recognise Israel within its internationally recognised 1967 borders or within somewhere else? If he is saying the former, does he accept that it is only reasonable also to say to Israel that it should recognise a state of Palestine on those 1967 borders? For good measure, if we are asking the Palestinians to have a referendum, perhaps there could be one in Israel as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/10">Will the Minister clarify a couple of other things? The first is about the dividing up of the west bank. It is being split into different &quot;Bantustans&quot;&mdash;to use a term that some employ&mdash;which are segregated from each other, with no proper transport continuity let alone territorial continuity. That is a real barrier to a settlement. That process, through settlements and the wall, is almost complete. One area is standing in the way of that happening: the E1 area, which is part of the so-called Jerusalem bubble. Israel has said that it will build on E1, but it is illegal and is regarded so by the United States, the British Government and the European Union. Does my right hon. Friend the Minister attach the significance that I attach to the E1 plan and what will Britain do to ensure that it does not go ahead?</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/11">I want to make two further points. First, while we demand, rightly, that the Palestinians end the violence, will we make the same demand on the Israelis? Can we at least suggest to them&mdash;or perhaps more than suggest&mdash;that it might be a good idea if they committed themselves unambiguously to abiding by the provisions of the fourth Geneva convention in the occupied territories, because they are not doing so at the moment? In that context, can my right hon. Friend update the House on what is happening in the Hurndall and Miller cases following the decisions of the coroner here?</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/12">Secondly, on the humanitarian crisis, I have asked my right hon. Friend to clarify the alternative mechanisms, but will he also explain how Britain intends to respond to the UN appeal? It is estimated that the emergency needs of the Palestinians require approximately $385 million extra. Are we going to respond to that and, if so, how?</p>

Most of the discussion involved us saying why suicide bombings were morally wrong and why they did no good for the Palestinian cause. That discussion led to a dialogue. I am not suggesting that we should say anything other than that Hamas should recognise Israel and give up violence, but my experience indicates that fostering a dialogue would be much more effective than pushing Hamas into a corner.

	<p pid="b.116.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing this timely debate. He is right to say that this is a crucial time for the middle east and an appropriate moment to consider what steps Her Majesty's Government can take to help to resuscitate and support the peace process involving Israel and the Palestinians&mdash;the conclusion of which would, of course, send a powerful message to the wider region that peace and democracy are the future, as well as providing the conditions for safety and prosperity for their own populations. In recent months and years it has been difficult to identify any clear chinks of light in a rather gloomy scenario, but they are there and I want to focus on a few of them in my brief contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/2">It is important to recognise that although unilateral disengagement by Israel, including withdrawal from certain settlements, the continuation of the security fence and the fixing of its borders, will not amount to a peace settlement, it does represent a courageous and vital attempt to achieve some lasting security for its citizens and an end to occupation of the Palestinian territory. In the current scenario, that is a logical course of action and deserves the active support of the international community, but it is not a peace settlement. Even more so than in the final years of Yasser Arafat's leadership, which was characterised by broken promises and missed opportunities, Israel does not currently have a partner in the peace process, and it needs one. If there were any doubt about that, the election of Hamas in January settled it.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/3">In no sense can Hamas be described as freedom fighter turned statesman. It is a terrorist organisation that speaks the language of bloodshed, both against Israel and within the occupied territories. Between 1989 and 2005, Hamas was deemed responsible for murdering 579 and wounding more than 3,200 Israeli men, women and children, 93 per cent. of whom were innocent civilians. The Hamas leadership condones that record and refuses to condemn the attacks that have been carried out since its election. In fact, all the signs are that it sees no incompatibility between being a democratically elected Administration and encouraging terrorist atrocities.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/4">Indeed, Hamas has set up a new 3,000-strong security force led by a former commander of the popular resistance committee. The violent clashes in Gaza city in recent days between Fatah-dominated security forces and Hamas forces have again left the Palestinian leadership with innocent blood on its hands. The United Kingdom and the EU cannot and must not do business with Hamas. Yet we cannot turn our backs on the Palestinian people. We must do everything we can to isolate Hamas and encourage a strong constituency for peace and democracy within the occupied territories&mdash;a constituency that will recognise the fundamental need for peaceful co-existence with the Jewish state.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/5">The Palestinian elections represented something of a paradox. On one hand, they brought about the election of an anti-democratic terrorist organisation and, on the other, it must be recognised that they were something of a victory for democracy. They reaffirmed the overwhelming commitment by the Palestinian people to determine their political future by democratic means. In a region where Israel has traditionally stood out starkly as the only real democratic nation, the relatively trouble-free elections sent a signal that there is a strong appetite within the troubled Palestinian territories for democratic solutions. That represents an important chink of light that we must do all we can to foster.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/6">Having read the European Union election observation mission's report on the January elections, one cannot fail to be impressed with the exercise of democracy in the Palestinian territories. As the report concludes, the elections amounted to</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/7" class="indent">&quot;an open and fairly-contested electoral process that was efficiently administered&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/8">by the Palestinian Central Elections Commission. I strongly encourage the Minister to read the recommendations in the report to see what extra support his Department can give to improving electoral arrangements for Palestinians in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/9">Another significant chink of light is President Mahmoud Abbas's intention to call a referendum on Palestinian statehood that would implicitly recognise Israel's right to exist if Hamas will not directly accept his two-state proposal. His dialogue with Hamas on the matter seems to be failing, but all the opinion polling in recent days seems to suggest that if he takes his call for a referendum directly to the Palestinian streets he will win, and that support for Hamas is declining. I have huge sympathy with the powerful point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> who wants Hamas's destructionist view to be buried by popular opinion.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/10">The border plan drawn up by Palestinian prisoners from Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, who are being held in Israeli prisons, forms the basis for the Abbas proposal, but may not represent a final peace settlement with Israel, However, it could at least provide the bedrock for a united Palestinian approach which is committed to peaceful co-existence and which can engage with a meaningful peace process. The Israeli Prime Minister said again at the weekend that his country wants to talk with Abbas and to restart the peace negotiations, but that will bear fruit only when Hamas accepts the three conditions set out by the Quartet.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/11">I am conscious that I have focused overwhelmingly on the Palestinian side of the peace equation, because I believe that the next substantive steps towards peace must come, and can only come, from the Palestinians, whose people have been impoverished and betrayed yet again by bad leadership.</p>

	<p pid="b.118.0/1">I shall be brief so that other right hon. and hon. Members can speak. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing this debate, but I note that he was unable to reply to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the intervention from my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> about the final borders of the state of Israel. Clearly that is the kernel of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/2">Many Members of the House have visited Israel or Palestine or both at various times. No one can go there without realising that the disparity of wealth and power between Israel and Palestine, the sheer misery of daily life for Palestinians and the sense of being in an open prison by merely existing in Gaza must be a cause for concern and must drive people into Hamas and other such organisations. Crossing from Israel into Gaza means crossing from the first world to the third world or worse. It means crossing from tarmac roads to potholes, from cars to donkeys and from prosperity to utter misery.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.0/3">It is not as if that is a recent phenomenon. Talking to older people in Gaza, I found that their whole life has been one of either getting driven out of their own homes when Israel was established in 1948, or, if they are slightly younger, growing up in refugee camps and relying on the United Nations for food, water and work all the time. If they are lucky enough to be able to get out of Gaza daily to work in Israel, they are required to get up at literally 3 o'clock in the morning to queue at the checkpoint to get through into Israel to do a day's work on a building site. They then have to go through the same performance again to get home late at night. Is it surprising that the ordinary people of Palestine get very angry about what goes on in their lives?</p>

	<p pid="b.118.1/1">I agree that that situation has been ongoing ever since the foundation of the state of Israel, but will the hon. Gentleman explain to the House why rich Arab states have not done more to alleviate the poverty in the Palestinian lands?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.118.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="118"  time="015:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0007.htm#06060755000465">
	<p pid="b.118.2/1">I cannot explain that and I do not intend to. The reality is that Palestine is imprisoned by Israel. It is imprisoned by a wall around the west bank and by border checkpoints all around Gaza, and as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield said, there are now 500 checkpoints and their number has increased in the past few months. It is simply not acceptable to assume that the struggle is between equals and that Israel equals Palestine. It does not. One side has nuclear weapons and F-16 jets, and is high-security in every sense, while the other has very little indeed. Is it surprising that some people are driven to terrorism?</p>
	<p pid="b.118.2/2">I remember very well a discussion that my hon. Friend and I had when we visited Gaza a few years ago. I have been there since, but on that visit, we put it plainly that we thought that suicide bombing was crazy, counter-productive, immoral and wrong. We then launched into what turned out to be an interesting discussion between various Palestinian groups and ourselves. All felt a sense of isolation, because they were not being taken seriously by the rest of the world. If Israel wants to achieve a long-term peace, it must do a number of things. First, it must recognise the state of Palestine, and secondly, it should decide what its borders proposal actually is. Israel has never done that.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.2/3">As to the idea that the security fence is a benign fence between neighbours, it is at least 25 ft high, it has razor wire on top and surveillance cameras all along it, and it has been built beyond the 1967 borders, taking a further 10 per cent. of Palestinian land. How many more concessions do the Palestinians have to make? Every time talks come around, the idea is that the Palestinians must give up more land. They have suffered enough poverty and they have had enough land taken away from them, and although it is true that there has been unilateral withdrawal from settlements in Gaza, there has been an increase in many illegal settlements in the west bank and Israel has made it clear that it will not halt the settlement policy there.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.2/4">The Palestinian Authority have tried with great difficulty to run affairs in Palestine. They rely on aid, trade and tax income. Who is Israel to decide that the tax income, to which the Palestinian Authority are legally entitled, should be withheld?</p>

	<p pid="b.119.0/1">On that point, the tax revenue is due according to agreements that the previous Palestinian Authority and Israel entered into. If the current Palestinian regime will not even recognise Israel or those agreements, it can hardly expect the Israelis to hand over money in compliance with them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.119.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="119"  time="015:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0007.htm#06060755000467">
	<p pid="b.119.1/1">Frankly, that is utter nonsense, as the hon. Gentleman knows perfectly well. If the money is due to Palestinians and has been collected by Israel, it should be paid to them. What are the political consequences of not paying them, and what is the likely reaction? Does it benefit anybody to increase unemployment in Gaza from 40 per cent. to 70 per cent., or to increase yet further infant mortality and all the misery that goes with it? I think not.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/2">We need Israel and those outside to continue the aid to ensure that the Palestinian people can live a reasonable life, and we need to move forward to try to achieve a long-term, permanent peace settlement. That requires a recognition that Mahmoud Abbas was democratically elected in difficult circumstances. Along with my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield, I was an observer at that election, and I chose to be an observer in Rafah in Gaza. It was a strange election, because we had great difficulty getting through the settlements to the polling stations for the Palestinian people, and on one occasion, the Israeli watchtowers decided to shoot at the polling stations in Rafah. That was hardly a recognition of an independent, democratic process. Nevertheless, the election took place and Mahmoud Abbas was elected to the presidency.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/3">We have now seen the election of a majority of Hamas members to the Palestinian Authority. I do not agree with suicide bombings or violence, and rapid steps must be taken towards a two-state solution. However, one does not engender a sense of safety or security by not talking to the people who are elected. We must talk to people even if we do not agree with or like them. We must have that debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/4">I hope that through the Government's approach, we can maintain the aid that is essential to the Palestinian people, put as much pressure as we can on the United States and others to promote a peace dialogue and process, and above all, recognise that a democratic process is alive and well in Palestine. We must consider what will happen if we allow the policy of Palestinian impoverishment to continue. We should put ourselves in the position of a young Palestinian whose grandparents were thrown out of their homes and whose parents have lived in refugee camps, and for whom life is security checkpoints, barbed wire, walls and the inability to travel anywhere. What attitude does that place in somebody's mind? What benign feelings does that give them towards the rest of the world?</p>
	<p pid="b.119.1/5">If we want peace and we need to get on with our neighbours, that will be best achieved not by building a wall with barbed wire on top, but by talking to them, understanding them and working with them. Israel must remember that it is part of the middle east. It is not an extension of the USA or western Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.120.0/1">I shall be extremely brief and pick up on two points. First, I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> about the importance of the economic difficulties. It is simply impossible, however, for Israel to have free economic relations if that is at the expense of the killing of hundreds of Israeli citizens. The fence is a reaction to that security situation, and it has been effective. It can be removed only when the security threat is removed.</p>
	<p pid="b.120.0/2">My right hon. and learned Friend made his most important point when he spoke about the importance of political leaders. The tragedy of the Palestinian situation and part of the reason why it has gone on so long is that for many years, the Palestinians were led by someone who had a singular skill in missing every opportunity that was presented to him. He let down the people whom he was supposed to lead. The Palestinians now have an opportunity with their new leadership under President Abbas and the Israelis have elected a new Government, which presents them with an opportunity. What we need to do, and what I hope the Government will be able to do, is to give those two leaders the best support from outside the area in order to take the brave and imaginative steps that will allow a two-state solution to succeed. That is the single most important way in which we can help to deal with the security situation and move forward the economic situation, which I agree will help to enable the two sides to live together in peace.</p>

	<p pid="b.121.0/1">I start, as is obligatory but highly appropriate on this occasion, by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing the debate. This is the highest attendance I have ever seen for a debate in this Chamber, and it reflects not only the interest in the subject, but, regrettably, the entrenched views in this House, which perhaps mirror the entrenched views of people in the area that we are discussing.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/2">It was a privilege to listen to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the right hon. and learned Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase>, who drew on his expertise as a former Foreign Secretary and, before that, Defence Secretary. In six minutes, he encapsulated the kernel of our entire debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/3">Drawing on the contributions, I want to touch on four subjects. First, my party and I strongly believe in the necessity for a two-state solution. The right hon. and learned Gentleman's most telling point was that this conflict, unlike others, has an end point, on which almost everybody, regardless of their opinion, can agree. For the Israelis, that end point is security and being seen as legitimate by their neighbours, by people across the middle east and by the world. To balance that, for the Palestinians, it is having a viable state.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/4">Politicians can be so immersed in conflict resolution, especially in troubled areas of the world, that they lose sight of what much of day-to-day politics is about. I was particularly struck by what the hon. Member for Hartlepool said about the minimum wage in Israel and about the elections, in which some slogans and themes of Labour's 1997 and 2001 campaigns were drawn on, perhaps unwisely&mdash;well, given the success of the outcome, perhaps it was wise. Relating politics to people's day-to-day concerns is extremely important; politics needs to address people's concerns. Ultimately, politicians should not be judged solely on their ability to strike poses and negotiate settlements in protracted disagreements that have lasted for many decades. They also have to be able to bring tangible economic and social benefits to the people whom they serve.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/5">My second point is on Israel's place in the wider middle east. It is extremely welcome news that Israel continues to enjoy cordial relations with Egypt and Jordan. That points the way forward for mature relationships with other parts of the middle east. Everyone would agree that the Iranian president's rhetoric about the existence of Israel is alarming, but there is some cause for optimism even there, although I do not want to exaggerate it. We should not underestimate the leap that the Americans have made in the past week or two in offering to have dialogue with the Iranians. Also, interestingly, the Iranians have shown imagination&mdash;something that is not always displayed&mdash;by at least engaging in that process. I do not wish to overstate the progress made, but nor do I wish to understate it.</p>
	<p pid="b.121.0/6">My third point is about the security wall, which has been touched on in nearly every contribution so far. People disagree on how to describe it, but let us call it a wall for the time being. I well understand the reasons why that wall was built. We need only go back to events in London just under a year ago to understand the threat and the terror that suicide bombers pose to people going about their normal business, and we should never lose sight of that concern and that menace. However, it is also reasonable to observe that the wall is aggressively placed, and that it divides communities both economically and socially. I do not particularly wish to make a judgment, other than to say that no wall has ever offered a lasting solution to a political problem, whether it is in Northern Ireland, Berlin or elsewhere. Some people may take the view that it is necessary in the short term, but I caution anyone against thinking that it is anything other than a short-term measure.</p>

	<p pid="b.122.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way because I am conscious of the pressure on time. It is precisely on that point that I wanted to speak. Does he accept that people who comment on the security fence or wall that has been developed in the middle east ought to visit Northern Ireland to see precisely the same abomination in Belfast? No matter where a wall is put, it is an aggressive intrusion into communities, but in Northern Ireland, where both Conservative and Labour Governments have built these abominations, the experience of communities on either side is that the immediate relief that a wall brings from snipers, bombs and stonings means that people can begin to refocus on their economic circumstances, on their education and on local well-being. It allows breathing space. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that a wall is short term. In Northern Ireland, they have been there too many years&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.122.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" speakername="Jeremy Browne" colnum="122"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0008.htm#06060755000472">
	<p pid="b.122.3/1">I am grateful for that intervention, because it essentially, and eloquently, reinforces the point that I was seeking to make, which is that one can understand why the wall is located there. If one puts oneself in the position of someone who feels under threat, one can understand that even more; but also, if we take a step back, we can see that there is no long-term viability in a political settlement that includes literal barriers between people.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/2">My final point is on Hamas and the government of Palestinians. People can interpret the result of the elections differently, but I would like to think that some of Hamas's support&mdash;perhaps even the bulk of it&mdash;was more the result of a social cry than a political statement. By that I mean that one should never underestimate the desire of people voting in elections to concentrate on the basics&mdash;on jobs, prosperity and the future of their families. That is a point that I tried to make earlier, and that the hon. Member for Hartlepool also made. Sometimes, people feel the need to make a dramatic statement in order to underline their desire or desperation.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/3">To draw on a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> and others, it is important that we continue to recognise that there is huge social deprivation in the Palestinian territories, and it is potentially perverse for us to make that worse, or to cause ourselves greater difficulties, by making the situation more problematic. Even if we see that as a potential political solution, the likelihood is that it will turn out to be quite the opposite, and that it will lead to greater militancy and a greater desire on the part of rank-and-file Palestinians to seek more radical solutions to their problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/4">My party and I agree that Hamas should renounce violence against the Israelis and should recognise Israel as a state. Indeed, it is in the Palestinian interest to do both those things; it is not just of benefit to the Israelis, because the scope for politics and a political solution is very limited until the Palestinians put themselves in a position with which the Israelis can more reasonably negotiate. They will inevitably find that easier if both those concessions are made.</p>
	<p pid="b.122.3/5">In summary, my party and I&mdash;and, I think, people across the parties in the House&mdash;favour negotiation. Imposed solutions are likely to be short-term solutions, particularly with regard to borders and land. Although there is not often cause for optimism in that part of the world, we hope that at least with the rapid political change that is taking place there, there may be more reason for being optimistic looking forward, than there has been looking backwards.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has spoken in similar debates over the past six months with great eloquence and commitment. The one thing on which we can all agree is that, in a period in which so many political commentators&mdash;and, indeed, political leaders&mdash;in the United Kingdom say that politics is dead and that it is all about packaging, spin and a feel-good factor, one need only come to Westminster Hall for a debate such as this to hear real issues being debated with real passion by people who believe in what they say and take a line that may not be consensual, because this is not a subject on which it is easy to find consensus.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.0/2">In this debate, I am struck, as was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1660" name="Malcolm Rifkind">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase>, by the historical anniversaries: this year is the 90th anniversary of the Arab revolt and the 50th anniversary of the Suez operation. The point about that&mdash;and we can draw other historical analogies&mdash;is that Britain had, and still has, a deep, important role in the middle east. At least some of the things happening today are a direct consequence of actions taken by previous Governments, so Britain has an interest and, to a certain extent, a responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.0/3">Another point that I draw from this debate has already been made by a number of Members. I suspect that the actions of the Israeli Government, in terms of their security policy&mdash;what they refer to as defendable frontiers&mdash;and the election of Kadima, have bought a period of negotiations. The Israelis believe that they have established security against terrorism in the short term, and that they have placed themselves in a strong negotiating situation. I agree with Members who say that those who have suffered terrorist activities within their borders will feel a powerful motivation for anything that can prevent those activities. However, that is not a long-term political solution. Israeli security officials tell us, as my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington and Chelsea said, that people will undoubtedly find other ways of directly attacking Israel in the medium term. A political solution is likely to be the only answer.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.0/4">Several hon. Members referred to the plight of the Palestinians&mdash;I and many people in this Room have seen it&mdash;and brought it graphically to life. There is no doubt that the plight of the Palestinians is not just related to the fact that, compared with Israel, they appear to be a poor people, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said. Their plight is not just a result of actions taken by the Israelis, the United States of America or any of the other western powers. It is also a direct result of a failure of their own leadership and corruption on a scale that makes that in many other parts of the world look puny. When I went to Palestine, I was struck by the large number of people wandering around wearing designer clothing and driving modern cars. There is a lot of money in Palestine and the ordinary people are being cheated, not just by outside organisations but by the Palestinian authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.124.1/1">I will not because I have very little time, and I want to keep my comments short so that the Minister has time to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.1/2">The crucial question that I draw from the debate and similar previous ones is simple, but it is the most difficult one to answer&mdash;I do not expect the Minister to answer it. What is Israel, and what is Palestine? It is almost impossible to agree immediately on what the definable borders of Israel and Palestine are. That will be the most difficult problem to resolve. The question the Minister has to face is what role the British Government have in keeping those negotiations open and persuading the two sides to come together. I suggest that we do so in the following way. We have a responsibility in the historical context. We also have one because we have been&mdash;and still are&mdash;directly in contact, both formally and informally, with a wide range of those involved in the conflict. We still have tremendous influence among the bordering states, and I would like more action to be taken by the neighbours of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Many of them stand on the sideline criticising what is going on, but they could make a much greater effort. It is a question not just of providing money, but of political support for dialogue as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.1/3">In addition, we have influence on the United States of America. It seems that the United States is sometimes very heavily engaged in this area, but at other times, it seems totally disinterested and not engaged at all. We have a responsibility and duty to encourage the US, whatever the Administration, to continue direct engagement, showing the sort of imagination it has shown recently in giving diplomacy a chance in negotiations with Iran. The United Kingdom also has a responsibility to continue direct practical support, which has taken place under this Government and previous ones, to Israel and Palestine. We do so by giving advice, supplying officials, assisting security and through United Nations and other humanitarian aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.124.1/4">Sometimes, we hear colleagues say that Westminster Hall debates are irrelevant. After all, we are out of sight. Who sees us? It would seem only a few people sitting at the back of the Room. But most of us know, from talking to those directly involved in Israel and Palestine, that they watch, listen and hear what is said. I urge the Government to continue their good offices in bringing the sides together, as far as possible, to seek a solution. That will not be found in the next few months, but there is a window of opportunity because of the actions taken by the Israeli Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1620" name="Iain Wright">my thanks to my hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Wright)</phrase> for raising this issue for discussion in the House. It is appropriate to examine the way forward in the middle east at this time, four months after the election of the Hamas-led Government in the Palestinian territories and two months after the Israeli elections.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.0/2">Others have reflected on their visits to the region, and I shall do so as well. Nearly seven years ago, I went to Israel and Gaza to negotiate final status issues. Negotiations took place on borders, water rights, the status of Jerusalem and refugees. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1869" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton (Mr. Browne)</phrase> is right to be optimistic because it is clear that the actions of the two new Governments will determine whether the path of peace in the middle east, which we all want to see taken, is actually pursued.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.1/1">While listening to the debate, I was greatly struck by the number of Members in all parties who have recently visited the middle east. The Minister has described his own, not-so-recent visit. However, I would like to put on the record that it is a long time since I was able to visit the middle east. There may be people listening to this debate who are able to change that.</p>

	<p pid="b.125.2/1">I am not entirely sure how to respond to that. <i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> Unfortunately, I am not one of those people.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.2/2">The British government have consistently made it clear that Hamas came to power as a result of free and fair elections and that, as a consequence, it has a democratic mandate. However, those who take part in the democratic process must play by the rules of democracy. Democracy is about more than elections: it is about assuming the responsibilities of government. We expect the Hamas-led Palestinian Authority to assume their prime responsibility to the Palestinian people by working actively towards a lasting peace with the state of Israel. Peace remains indispensable for the creation of the vibrant, fully functioning Palestine that we all want to help to develop.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.2/3">The way towards that is set out in the road map, endorsed in 2003 by both the Israeli and Palestinian Governments of the day. It sets out clear steps to be taken by both sides and the international community, culminating in the creation of an independent and viable Palestinian state, living side by side with Israel in peace and security. We and our international partners are profoundly attached to that vision, and we regard it as the best possible means of achieving the two-state solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.2/4">However, we cannot advance the agenda for peace&mdash;the road map&mdash;as long as one party refuses to recognise the other. It is essential that the Hamas-led Government commit themselves to non-violence, recognise Israel, and accept previous agreements and obligations, including the road map. Those are the principles set out by the Quartet on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-30">30 January</phrase>, and endorsed by Palestinian President Abbas and most of the international community. We are firmly committed to them. We are asking nothing more than we asked of the previous Palestinian Government, but so far Hamas has not signalled a readiness to accept the principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.125.2/5">We naturally welcome the process of national dialogue launched by President Abbas on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-25">25 May</phrase>. We are encouraged by the President's clear desire to establish himself as the international representative of the Palestinian people, and we recognise him as such. I sincerely hope the outcome of the national dialogue is positive for the Palestinians, and positive for the peace process. The UK is certainly eager for Israel and the Palestinians to re-engage with the peace process as soon as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.0/1">On the point of trying to bring forward that re-engagement, I mentioned earlier the international women's commission, which is convened by Unifem&mdash;the United Nations Development Fund for Women&mdash;and supported by European countries, particularly Belgium. Given that women MPs in our party and throughout the House are interested in supporting both that initiative and elected women in Israel and Palestine, will my right hon. Friend advance possible membership and support of that organisation from the UK? We have been asked to support it, but that matter has not been resolved yet. Given the interest from women MPs, now is a suitable time to do something about it.</p>

	<p pid="b.126.1/1">We welcome any practical way of furthering dialogue and understanding. If my hon. Friend would care to write to me or the Minister directly responsible, we can consider that in more detail.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/2">We welcome President Abbas's call on the Hamas Government to endorse the prisoners' accord. Their doing so would be a step in the right direction towards meeting the Quartet's three principles.</p>
	<p pid="b.126.1/3">The UK, along with most of the international donor community, continues to provide assistance to the Palestinian people. Along with our EU partners, we have a strong record of support for the Palestinian people. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-25">25 April</phrase>, the Department for International Development announced a &pound;15 million payment to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. The UK alone has given &pound;147 million to the Palestinian people since 2001, and we continue to be one of their largest donors.</p>

	<p pid="b.127.1/2">In the present circumstances, the UK and the international community cannot renew direct assistance to the Palestinian Authority institutions. Given Hamas's position and, in particular, its support for terrorism, we simply have no choice. We are, however, determined to continue to support the Palestinian people and to help to provide for their basic needs. We have been at the forefront of the debate on how best to do that. The international funding mechanism endorsed by the Quartet and now being worked up by the EU was based on a UK proposal on how to channel funding to meet the Palestinians' basic needs while bypassing the Palestinian Authority. The mechanism should be in place soon and the United Kingdom is, of course, willing to contribute funding.</p>

	<p pid="b.127.3/1">I shall deal with those points in due course, if my hon. Friend will bear with me.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.3/2">We are concerned about the deterioration of the Palestinian economy. We continue to press Israel to open crossings into the Gaza strip to enable Palestinian goods to be exported. We want to do more, but it is a fact that the true regeneration of the Palestinian economy&mdash;which would require public and private international investment and access to regional and international markets, and would make a sustainable difference to Palestinian living standards&mdash;can be achieved only through a lasting peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.3/3">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has spoken on several occasions about his ideas for further withdrawals from the west bank, although those ideas have yet to be set out in detail. We certainly support the principle of further withdrawals, just as we supported disengagement from Gaza last summer, as a step in the right direction, but we and international partners, including the US Secretary of State and the UN Secretary-General, have been clear that the final status issues, such as borders, must be determined through a process of negotiation.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.3/4">The UK and the international community have on numerous occasions set out their strong views that there should be a negotiated solution. President Bush repeated that to the Israeli Prime Minister in Washington two weeks ago. We are encouraged by Prime Minister Olmert's and President Abbas's commitment to negotiations. We hope to see those two leaders act on their commitment in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.3/5">To encourage such a solution, Israel must stop any action, such as settlement activity and the construction of the separation barrier on Palestinian land, that is contrary to international law and threatens the viability of an agreed two-state solution. All final status issues&mdash;including borders&mdash;are for both parties to negotiate. The Israeli Government should not take any actions that might prejudice these negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="b.128.0/1">My right hon. Friend has clearly outlined well established UK policy. Given that Israel continues to build settlements and says that it will go ahead with the E1 plan, what, in practical terms, can Britain and the international community do to try to ensure that the objectives that my right hon. Friend wants to be achieved will be achieved, rather than precluded by further settlement building, particularly in E1?</p>

	<p pid="b.128.1/1">We have continued to set out the clear view in international law as well as getting the two parties into negotiation. In the end, the history of this tragic situation demonstrates that only the Israelis and Palestinians can reach conclusions. They might have help, assistance and guidance from the international community, but only if they sit down together and negotiate the issues&mdash;including the question of settlements&mdash;can there be real and lasting progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/2">We believe that the Israelis should adhere to international law and we remain concerned by Israeli policies on settlements, the barrier and access to Jerusalem, all of which threaten to cut off Palestinian East Jerusalem from the west bank. Those policies will have serious economic, social and humanitarian consequences for the Palestinian people, and risk reducing the possibility of reaching a final status agreement on Jerusalem. The Government have therefore called on both parties to implement the <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase> agreement on movement and access and for Israel to take steps to improve the humanitarian and economic situation of the Palestinians, including by resuming transfers of the withheld Palestinian tax and customs revenues.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/3">The Karni crossing is the only access point for Palestinian goods from the Gaza strip and is the major point for the import of goods. The Israel defence forces closed Karni on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-26">26 April</phrase> following a suicide bomb attempt that was foiled by Palestinian security, and reopened it on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May</phrase>. We continue to raise the importance of crossing points with the Israeli authorities at all levels.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/4">We remain concerned at the worsening security situation in Gaza and parts of the west bank. The Palestinian Authority must take action to stop the rocket attacks from Gaza on nearby Israeli villages. We also urge the Israeli Government to act with restraint in response to those attacks. The impact of Israel's military operations in the occupied territories continues to cause concern. Israel, like all states, has the absolute right to defend itself against terrorism but it must respect international humanitarian law. IDF operations have resulted in Palestinian civilian deaths, including those of children. Such civilian casualties are unacceptable. In addition, the destruction of infrastructure only deepens Palestinians' despair and hinders efforts to achieve a comprehensive settlement. The conflict cannot be solved by military means alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/5">We are also concerned about the increase in intra-Palestinian violence, the effects that has on people's daily lives, and the potential repercussions on the delivery of aid and on the political process. Legally constituted security services must take action to maintain law and order in the Gaza strip and the west bank.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> raised two consular cases. Tom Hurndall's family met the Attorney-General on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-05">5 May 2006</phrase> and will meet the Foreign Secretary shortly. We will decide on future actions once the Foreign Secretary has been able to discuss the case with the family. In relation to James Miller's case, the Foreign Secretary met the Miller family on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase> and is considering follow-up action in consultation with the Attorney-General.</p>
	<p pid="b.128.1/7">In conclusion, the UK Government remain committed to a two-state solution to the middle east conflict and are eager to work with Israelis and Palestinians to achieve that. The only solution, as I have made clear repeatedly, remains a secure Israel and a viable, independent Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security. We are encouraged that Prime Minister Olmert and President Abbas have made commitments to negotiations and look forward to early progress. We and the international community stand ready to support them in any way we can. We also look to the Hamas-led Palestinian Government to commit to the Quartet's three principles and thereby come into line with the international community's views on how to make progress towards a lasting and permanent settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.130.1/1">It is a pleasure to appear before you this afternoon, Mr. Cook, and a particular honour that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Europe will be responding for the Government. Few Ministers, if any, know more about the subject and I could not have chosen a better Minister to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/2">I start with a minor point. The subject of this Adjournment debate appears on the Order Paper as &quot;Genocide in Armenia and Assyria&quot;. I am not seeking to apportion blame, but that is not the title that was submitted. The original title was &quot;Recognition of the genocide of Armenians and Assyrians&quot;. It would be obvious to you, Mr. Cook, and to many people, that to talk about genocide in Armenia, a country that has existed in its present form for a comparatively short time, and Assyria, a country that might have a millennia-old history but is not recognised in international boundaries, would be superfluous.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/3">I wish to speak about the incidents in the then Ottoman empire, particularly in the spring of and throughout 1915, that led, I hope indisputably, to the planned, calculated genocide of the Christian community, which consisted principally of Armenians, Assyrians and Greeks. I shall seek to persuade my right hon. Friend that the time has finally come for Her Majesty's Government to join so many other countries, Parliaments and legislatures in recognising the genocide that occurred in that year.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.1/4">I hope that it will be comparatively uncontentious to state a few basic facts. One and a half million Armenian residents of the former Ottoman empire died between 1915 and 1923 as a result of calculated genocide. I hope that it is not contentious to say that 3.5 million of the historic Christian population of Assyrians, Armenians and Greeks then living in the Ottoman empire had been murdered&mdash;starved to death or slaughtered&mdash;or exiled by 1923. I hope that those are not contentious points. I hope that no one would seek to deny that the process started on <phrase class="date" code="1915-04-24">24 April 1915</phrase> in Constantinople, where 1,000 Armenians were identified, taken from their homes and murdered. I hope that it is not contentious to reaffirm that 300,000 Armenian males were then conscripted into the Turkish army, unarmed and then murdered, and that death marches into the Syrian desert took place.</p>

	<p pid="b.130.2/1">I do not wish to contest what my hon. Friend says, but I point out that the oppression of the Armenians started much earlier, in the 19th century, particularly under the reign of Sultan Hamid, who was one of the really evil people in this history.</p>

	<p pid="b.130.3/1">Were I to attempt to address the history of the Armenian and Assyrian peoples, I would require far longer than the time that Mr. Speaker and you, Mr. Cook, have allocated to me. I shall refer later to the Caliph Sultan Abdul Hamid. For the record, I confirm that my hon. Friend is correct&mdash;massacres took place in 1895 and 1909, and throughout this period&mdash;but I am concentrating on 1915, because it is the first example of ethnic cleansing and genocide in the 20th century. For that reason, it is vital that we identify the full horror of what occurred.</p>
	<p pid="b.130.3/2">I say that the events are uncontentious, yet Turkey's greatest living writer, Orhan Pamuk, is currently the subject of attack and vilification, and even a court order, for stating that the Armenian and Assyrian genocides took place. The modern Turkish Government, of whom I am no enemy and who are not entirely responsible for their precursor Ottoman empire, deny to this day that genocide took place.</p>

	<p pid="b.131.0/1">The real problem is that article 301 of the Turkish penal code makes it an offence to insult Turkishness, and that is what Orhan Pamuk has been charged with. During the past year, 29 other journalists have been charged under that article, and eight have been convicted. Article 305 talks of acts against the fundamental national interest&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.131.3/1">I freely and publicly admit that there are few in the House who have a deeper knowledge of the Turkish penal code than my hon. Friend. He is absolutely correct. To deny genocide is bad enough, but for a state to structure within its legal framework a formal legalistic denial of it seems to be taking us into another area.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/2">I said earlier that I hoped that what I was saying was not contentious, but we have heard that it is. I put to the House the simple question, &quot;Did it happen?&quot; There are those in modern Turkey who would say that there was no genocide&mdash;that there was inter-communal fighting, and that a movement of people chose of their own free will to march into the desert and die; and that the decision was freely taken by people in the eastern Ottoman empire to leave their homes, in which their families had lived for hundreds of years, and to move away from their livelihoods and their ancestral lands and to choose instead a lonely death.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/3">I find that view unconvincing, and I cite as evidence one of the most remarkable books that I have ever read. It is by Viscount Bryce and Arnold Toynbee. That book was published during the first world war at the express instigation of the then Foreign Secretary in order to respond to the reports that were then reaching Her Majesty's Government, particularly via the United States Ambassador Morgenthau, of what appeared to be a systematic programme of genocide.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/4">Toynbee, a distinguished Oxford historian, produced one of the most thoroughly researched and empirically backed volumes that I have ever read. Over and over again, it lists evidence from people who were there at the time. The original version was censored, because it did not name the witnesses. I am grateful, as is the House, to Ara Sarafian, who has published the full uncensored edition of &quot;The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915-1916: Documents Presented to Viscount Grey of Fallodon&quot;, which identifies those who were there at the time&mdash;those who witnessed with their own eyes the horrors to which I refer.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/5">I give credit to Lord Avebury, known to many of us as Eric Lubbock, who with me and the tireless campaigner Odette Bazil, presented a copy of the book to Downing street last year. We know that Lord Avebury is not well, and I am sure that we all send our best wishes to him. I also pay credit to Ninos Warda, whose famous book &quot;Seyfo: the Assyrian Genocide in International Law&quot; was recently published.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/6">I also cite as evidence the &quot;Blue Book&quot;&mdash;provable, substantiated and sustained evidence. It contains 102 specific eye-witness reports by neutral or belligerent nationals&mdash;neutrals such as the United States, and belligerent nationals such as German missionaries. It also contains 10 full statements by missionaries and missionary societies and 66 reports from Armenian clergy, local residents and refugees, as well as the extraordinary documents released by the American State Department&mdash;the state papers of Edward Nathan, the US Consul in Mersina. To read his reaction to the unfolding horrors is to realise that this truly was the first genocide of the 20th century.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/7">We have from the then Ottoman empire the evidence of the orders of the Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, to the man whose position might roughly be described as analogous to that of a deportation Minister, Abdulahad Nuri, in which the Minister of the Interior orders Nuri to increase deportation and destruction finally to &quot;solve the Eastern Question&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/8">Genocide did happen&mdash;3.5 million people were killed or died in the desert. Why did it happen? Armenians, Greeks and Assyrians had lived in the Ottoman empire for many hundreds of years, and some for even longer; and there was not a systematic programme or pogrom until late in the 19th century. Without doubt there were isolated incidents, but something changed, particularly during the caliphate of Sultan Abdul Hamid, and especially with the election of the Committee for Union and Progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/9">Ittihadve Terakki, normally referred to now as the Young Turks, were heavily influenced by ideologues such as Via Gokalp and Behaeddin Shakir, and created an ideology of Turkification. They harked back to an earlier Turkish empire, which they wanted to see freed of those who were not Muslims and not Turkish speakers. The Christians were the obvious target.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/10">On <phrase class="date" code="1914-11-12">12 November 1914</phrase>, the sultan-caliph addressed an imperial declaration to the Turkish army and navy, demanding their participation in what he described as a &quot;jihad&quot;&mdash;a word that few of us knew 10 or 15 years ago, but which now sadly resonates throughout Westminster and the city. &quot;Jihad&quot; was the word that he used on that day. The ruling triumvirate of Talaat Pasha, Jemal Pasha and Enver Pasha were all enthusiastic supporters of the process of Turkification.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/11">If one asks modern Turks why they still deny it, in addition to giving the theory that people willingly wandered to their deaths, they will say that the Armenians in particular were traitors. The Turks will refer to the huge Armenian community around Van lake in Van province, and the fact that some Armenians fought with General Nicolaieff, who led the Russian troops south to the Van lake and the vilayets in the area. This is an argument that constantly arises. General Nicolaieff's fighting took place in July, long after the massacres had started. By May 1915, despite strong border censorship, reports were already being taken outside the Ottoman empire by travellers, missionaries and particularly employees of the Baghdad railway. Ambassador Morgenthau received a report that the River Euphrates was so choked with bodies that the water was breaking the banks and flowing beyond its course.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/12">At that time, further evidence was identified. Previously, forced conversions to Islam had been demanded to spare people's lives, but the rule was changed so that, to be spared, families could convert only in groups of no fewer than 100, or they would not be allowed the protection of Islam. By late May and early June, wounded orphans and widows were arriving in Aleppo, Marash, Aintab, Tarsus, Adana, Sivas, Konia and Smyrna. Refugee bodies throughout the world were begged to help those people, who were arriving in such huge numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/13">I have referred to the slaughter in Van, one of the traditional Armenian centres. That was matched, if not exceeded, by the genocide that took place in Cilicia in the vilayet of Adana and sandjak of Marash. That population had already endured a massacre as recently as 1909. Despite that, the population had increased and it was a stable community that had established its own churches and schools. There was little unemployment and a strong tradition of arable land and animal husbandry. Yet that community had the great misfortune to live on a strategic route through the empire and, more than that, to be the chosen target for Muslim refugees from the Roumelian vilayets that had been ceded by Turkey in 1913 as a consequence of the Balkan war. Those refugees wanted the area around Cilicia, and they got it&mdash;over the dead bodies of the established local community.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/14">Zeitoun was ethnically cleansed from April 1915; its inhabitants were driven into the Anatolian desert to die. Those who did not were harried to Sultania and beyond; we do not know where they ended up nor what happened to them. We have records of who they were, but none about what happened to them. We know only that they ceased to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/15">It is intensely difficult even to describe what was happening in the Ottoman empire at that time. Typically, the pattern was that Turkish regular army troops&mdash;I underscore that; they were regular army troops&mdash;would surround a village or community such as Ourfa. The local community would defend itself, as Ourfa's did for a month. Then, inevitably, through force majeure, the Turkish regulars would surround, overcome and kill.</p>
	<p pid="b.131.3/16">The one exception to that horrific repetition of slaughter was in Jibal Mousa in the vilayet of Aleppo. A French naval squadron lying offshore witnessed the inhabitants' defence of Jibal Mousa, aware of the horror&mdash;the certain death&mdash;that awaited them should the Turkish regular army manage to breach their defences. The squadron rescued the inhabitants and carried them to Port Said, where they came under British protection.</p>

	<p pid="b.133.0/1">That account was very moving. It is a pity that when the same happened in Smyrna in 1923, the navies of the world stood by and let that city burn to the ground with the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of its inhabitants&mdash;Greek, Armenian and other Christian minorities. Ultimately, that led to an exchange of populations. My hon. Friend mentioned an example of when something was done by the rest of the world. Since then, however, the rest of the world has stood by and allowed the Armenians to suffer.</p>

	<p pid="b.134.0/1">As I said, if I took right hon. and hon. Members down every bloodstained byway of the 20th century, I would exceed the time that I am allowed, Mr. Cook. My hon. Friend mentions the sacking of Smyrna and its replacement by Izmir. That is a scar on the history of our globe and our people. We know that.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.0/2">I seek recognition of the genocide that occurred in the Ottoman empire. One might think that that ideologically motivated, militarily enforced genocide was so horrific, appalling and awful that recognition would be almost an irrelevance; after all, it would not bring anyone back to life. However, the relatives of those who suffered have experienced what they see as a double death: the deaths of their relatives and the death&mdash;the pain and agony&mdash;that they feel, knowing that those deaths are denied by those responsible. When we take those feelings into account, we begin to understand why recognition is so crucial and important.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.0/3">I am massively indebted to the work of people whom I am proud to call my friends, such as Dr. Harry Hagopian, Raffi Sarkissian, Ninab Lamasso, Andy Dharmoo and so many others. They tell me over and again that until there can be recognition of the genocide, there can be no peace. Only when the denial has been confronted and the reasons for it analysed, and when the modern, secular Turkish Government finally understand what their ancestor Government did, can there be peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.0/4">The friends whom I mentioned make that demand for the sake of remembrance, recognition, respect, redemption&mdash;and, yes, recompense. How otherwise can a people move on? The Armenian and Assyrian community has now spread to France, San Francisco, Australia and to our islands, where its people provide a service as ideal, model citizens. They are hard-working decent people, whom we are proud to call British and our brothers and sisters. Every time we look them in the eye, we see reflected the pain of the denial of their history. We simply cannot allow that situation to pertain.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.0/5">I understand how difficult matters diplomatic are, and how Turkey is becoming increasingly important in the European context. It is a country for which I have no enmity; I have affection and respect for modern Turkey and only hope that it can do as this country has in respect of the crimes committed by our ancestors in centuries past. I hope that modern Turkey can accept what happened in its name and bring some peace.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.0/6">Since 1965, many countries and bodies have recognised genocide: Uruguay, Cyprus, Argentina, Russia, Greece, the United States House of Representatives, Belgium, Sweden, Lebanon, the European Parliament, the Italian Parliament, the French Assembly, the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly, the Swiss Parliament, the Canadian House of Commons, the Slovakian Parliament, the Dutch Parliament, the Polish Parliament, the German Bundestag, the Venezuelan Parliament, the Lithuanian Parliament and recently even bodies such as Edinburgh city council and the legislative body of British Columbia. The Holy See recognised genocide on <phrase class="date" code="2000-11-10">10 November 2000</phrase>. They have all recognised that genocide occurred, and I cannot see how we can fail to follow where they lead.</p>

	<p pid="b.135.0/1">There is another reason why we should remember that first genocide of the last century: to be able to look to the future. I remind my hon. Friend of what Adolf Hitler said some 30 years after that genocide: &quot;Who remembers the Armenians now?&quot; That was one of his justifications for what he was doing to the Jewish community during the second world war.</p>

	<p pid="b.135.1/1">My hon. Friend's words are so prescient and important that I almost felt like pausing when I heard them. I remember standing on the steps of Downing street with the noble Lord Avebury, who repeated those words in the original German. As we know, when people said to Hitler, &quot;You will never be forgiven for the genocide of the Jews&quot;, he said, &quot;Who remembers the Armenians now?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.135.1/2">Genocide was the new horror of the 20th century. Technology had progressed in such a way that whole populations could be slaughtered. The 1915 Armenian and Assyrian genocide in the Ottoman empire was the first; sadly it was not to be the last, either in the last century or this one. Now no one seeks to deny that genocide took place.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.1/3">I hope that we can be realistic, because only when we accept that ethnic cleansing and genocide take place can we confront their horrors. We owe that not only to our Armenian, Assyrian and Greek friends, or only to our Christian friends from the former Ottoman empire, but to ourselves. How can we seek to combat the evil of genocide when the very existence of such a major example is denied?</p>
	<p pid="b.135.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">My hon. Friend the Member for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> quoted Adolf Hitler. I would like to close by quoting a contemporary of Hitler's, but a man who walked in the light rather than the darkness. In 1929, Winston Churchill stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.135.1/5" class="indent">&quot;In 1915 the Turkish Government began and ruthlessly carried out the infamous general massacre and deportation of Armenians in Asia Minor...There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.135.1/6">Churchill was right then, and he is right now. I look to my right hon. Friend the Minister and to this Government and this country to play their part in assuaging the agony of those whose relatives died so horribly by recognising in this country the fact that genocide took place. I hope that by such recognition in this House of Commons, in this Parliament, ultimately we may influence the Turkish Government, because as long as we refuse to recognise that genocide took place, they have the perfect excuse for denial.</p>

	<p pid="b.136.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Cook. It is obvious from the passionate presentation of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1560" name="Stephen Pound">my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Stephen Pound)</phrase> that he has a thorough and detailed interest in this difficult and painful subject, and we are all grateful to him for setting out his arguments with such clarity and, indeed, for securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/2">This matter has been debated in this House on many occasions, not least, as I am sure my hon. Friend is aware, in the immediate aftermath of the 1915-16 massacres that left so many dead and forced survivors into exile. What happened to ethnic Armenians and other smaller Christian minorities living in the Ottoman empire, including the Assyrians, was roundly and rightly condemned at the time. I extend the Government's deepest sympathies to the relatives and descendants of the victims.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/3">That the events took place, and that the then rulers of what is now Turkey should bear some degree of responsibility for encouraging, allowing or failing to prevent them, is not a matter of dispute in this House, but the main concern of this Government is not what we call such horrific events but ensuring that the lessons are learned, and that relationships are rebuilt to ensure a peaceful and secure future for everyone living in the region. To that end, we shall continue to encourage the Governments of Armenia and Turkey to improve co-operation and understanding between their countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/4">I want to deal with my hon. Friend's call for the United Kingdom legally to recognise the events of 1915-16 as genocide. The fact is that the legal offence of genocide had not been named or defined at the time when the atrocities were committed. The United Nations convention on genocide came into force in 1948, so it was not possible at the time of the events that we are considering legally to label the massacres as genocide within the terms of the convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/5">I recognise that it is perfectly possible intellectually to try to apply the definitions of genocide from the convention to appalling tragedies that occurred, in this case, some 30 years before. The common practice in law is not to apply such judgments retrospectively. It is not possible for us properly to provide a substitute today for the submission of evidence, cross-examination or arguments that necessarily would have arisen in mitigation in a court of law, whether a local or international one, had there been one with the necessary jurisdiction and had the crime already been recognised and defined. Not least would be the issue of who should be charged with the offence in the circumstances. That is why I hope that my hon. Friend will accept that the legal process that he is asking for would not necessarily be appropriate at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/6">In any event, as I hope he will accept, historians question each other's accounts of what took place. The debate has primarily been about the causes of the events, those responsible for them and the extent to which the wartime security context may have been a factor, perhaps obscuring the motives of those who were involved. As a result, neither this Government nor previous British Governments have judged that the evidence is sufficiently unequivocal to persuade us that the events could be categorised as genocide, as defined by the 1948 UN convention on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/7">However, I emphasise that that in no way diminishes the scale of the terrible individual and mass tragedies that occurred between 1915-16 and both before and after, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1628" name="Andrew Dismore">my hon. Friends the Members for Ealing, North and for Hendon (Mr. Dismore)</phrase> have made clear. The key now is to ensure that the full truth about those events is brought to light and that both Armenia and Turkey look to the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/8">In that context, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1790" name="Denis MacShane">my right hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Mr. MacShane)</phrase>, my distinguished predecessor as Minister for Europe, raised the need for an independent inquiry on the events of 1915-16 at a European Union ministerial meeting with Turkey in March 2005, in an attempt to promote a truth and reconciliation process. I share the view that the work of establishing truth, if it is indeed to help towards reconciliation, must be conducted as a joint exercise by the parties directly involved. Outsiders can commend the idea to them, but they should not try to do the work for them, as the doing of the work by the parties themselves is an important part of the confidence-building and reconciliation process.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/9">Last year, shortly after that idea was proposed, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan and the leader of the main Turkish opposition party joined forces to call for an impartial investigation by Armenian and Turkish historians of the allegations. I understand that the Armenians felt unable to accept the proposal at that time, but we believe the Turkish proposal to be a welcome signal that Turkey wishes to engage with its neighbour and re-examine the issue. My conclusion is that the idea, or some variant of it, is not at an end, but that further developments in the international situation will be needed before the idea can be explored again and constructively developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.136.0/10">Obviously, I cannot give the House an absolute assurance that Armenia and Turkey will undertake to move relations forward this year or even the next, although I certainly hope that they will, but I commend to the House the idea that the resolution of the questions raised by my hon. Friend should be pursued through some kind of truth and reconciliation process undertaken by the people of Armenia and Turkey. This Government will continue to encourage the parties to embark on such a process. In the meantime, we should resist the temptation to pre-empt its conclusions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="138"  time="016:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0010.htm#06060762000078">
	<p pid="b.138.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this important debate, given the joint announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase> by the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence of the proposal to move forward with the part-privatisation, as I interpret it, of the search and rescue helicopter service provided variously by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency through private providers, by the Ministry of Defence through a branch of the RAF and by the Royal Navy. In my constituency, in which the Royal Navy air station Culdrose is based, there is, as I am sure the Minister will understand, a significant sensitivity about the impact that the proposal will have not only on the base, but on those who have enjoyed the safety and security of knowing that such an excellent search and rescue service is available. Indeed, it is a vital service. The capability of the Ministry of Defence both on land and at sea provides significant reassurance to mariners and to those who have enjoyed the benefits of the search and rescue service and whose life has been saved by it.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/2">In a written answer to questions that I asked the Minister about the future of the 771 Squadron at Culdrose, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/3" class="indent">&quot;In contributing to Search and Rescue (SAR) in the coastal waters of the south west extending 200 miles out to sea, 771 Squadron of the Royal Navy was scrambled 211 times last year and rescued 154 people.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-10">10 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 446, c. 293W.]</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/4">The importance of the service is known to many, and certainly from my consultations prior to this debate with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the National Coastwatch Institution, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations and many other voluntary organisations, I know that there is widespread recognition of its significance and importance. I am sure that, when considering any change to any service, the Minister will be quite used to the expression&mdash;I think it is American&mdash;&quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot; That phrase will surely be ringing in his ears when he considers what changes are appropriate to such an important service and the potentially detrimental impact if any decision is wrong. Those are the issues on which I seek reassurances from him today.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/5">The 771 Squadron at Culdrose provides two Sea King Mk 5 aircraft, which are primarily located on site, although sometimes the aircraft on duty can be taken up to five hours' flying time away from the base. A back-up aircraft is therefore needed. In providing the important search and rescue service&mdash;going as far out as 200 miles off the west coast of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, as mentioned in the written answer that I quoted&mdash;the squadron needs a greater capacity than one aircraft with a back-up.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/6">As the Minister is also aware, the service fulfils an important maritime anti-terrorism function, to which he referred in his letter to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-26">26 May</phrase> this year:</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/7" class="indent">&quot;Additionally, the new UK SAR-H will not undertake the counter-terrorism role currently undertaken by 771 squadron. This is a military role, the continued requirement for which will be assessed in due course.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/8">Both he and the Minister of State, Department for Transport, have written to me about the new opportunity to bring the service together, but I am concerned, as I am sure many others are, about the possible break-up of the service and the potential for it to be salami-sliced, instead of brought together as a more harmonised service. If the maritime counter-terrorism role is taken away from the search and rescue capability, that is another service that the Ministry of Defence will need to consider how best to provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/9">In my area, as I believe in many others, the search and rescue service also doubles up as the night-time air ambulance. The air ambulance in my constituency, which is very much appreciated and is supported largely through voluntary contributions from the local community, can fly only during daylight hours. The service can be provided out of hours because 771 Squadron backs it up, providing an excellent service itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/10">The search and rescue service also provides a medevac service. For example, my constituents on the Isles of Scilly are 30 miles out to the sea and cannot get to the main acute hospital at Treliske, in Truro, very quickly. They are sometimes evacuated from the isles when there is an emergency and that service is very much appreciated. The search and rescue service also provides other medevac services in other situations and a casevac service&mdash;in other words, a service for casualties, for instance in road traffic accidents. Where the air ambulance cannot get in, the 771 Squadron search and rescue service will come in and provide an important service.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/11">The search and rescue service also provides important support in major incidents, with its standby helicopter and its back-up helicopter. However, if there were a major incident, more helicopters would be required than those two. For instance, on <phrase class="date" code="2004-08-16">16 August 2004</phrase> there was catastrophically heavy rainfall in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1513" name="Daniel Rogerson">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Rogerson)</phrase>, particularly in the Boscastle area. Many people know the name of Boscastle because it has been etched on their memories from that day, when 50 or more cars were washed away from the village and out to sea. Many buildings were also washed away, because of the torrential rain and flooding that hit the village. Some 91 people were saved by the helicopter services, with three helicopters from RAF Culdrose and three from RAF Chivenor. If we simply have a search and rescue service but we do not have the capability, training and back-up of the military service, we will not have the capacity to provide that level of flexibility and respond to such catastrophic major incidents, for which we clearly need to ensure that the service is available.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/12">There are other important dimensions to the service. The significance of the training for military pilots, crew and divers is often overlooked. Surely it is better for them to have real-life experience, rather than simulation exercises. If pilots, crew and divers are to be engaged in combat situations or combat search and rescue, it is surely far better for them to have had the opportunity of experiencing those real-life situations rather than&mdash;I should like the Minister to clarify how firm the Government's plans are on this&mdash;finding themselves taken away from the many civilian situations to which they are currently scrambled.</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/13">There is also the question of the tests necessary for the capability of future aircraft. In a letter of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, written in answer to questions from me, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/14" class="indent">&quot;With regard to the training concerns you raise, whilst it is true that 771 squadron currently conduct residual Sea King training for Sea Kings Mks 5/6 and 7, the planned withdrawal of these aircraft types, in the years 2014 and 2018 respectively, means by definition that the requirement for this training will diminish and eventually disappear. That said, whatever optimum method is ultimately identified for the provision of future SAR coverage, this will of course encompass full delivery of the necessary training for the aircraft types involved.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/15">The problem, however, as I indicated in a letter to which the Minister replied on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-01">1 June</phrase>, is that all the evidence seems to suggest the Merlins that have been brought into base to replace the Sea Kings have neither the capability nor the flexibility to perform the search and rescue function, despite costing &pound;104 million an airframe. The question remains: what aircraft will be used to perform those important functions, despite all the expense and investment going into the Merlin project?</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/16">The Sea Kings have been excellent workhorses, for the Royal Navy in particular, and they have been much appreciated at Culdrose since they were first brought into commission in the 1960s. They are being phased out in coming years, but the Ministry must surely consider what aircraft will replace them before it engages in such an exercise and considers the part privatisation of the service. How will those aircraft be provided and can we be sure that they will be sufficiently tested and proven capable of providing such a service?</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/17">I have mentioned combat search and rescue. I am sure that the Minister will also have reflected on the experience that civilian search and rescue can provide for personnel who are then engaged in combat search and rescue. My noble Friend Lord Garden tabled a written question about what plans the Government had for</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/18" class="indent">&quot;development of combat search and rescue capabilities.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/19">Lord Drayson answered:</p>
	<p pid="b.138.1/20" class="indent">&quot;The UK is developing a combat recovery operations capability, of which combat search and rescue is a subset. This will be achieved through the utilisation of existing support helicopter assets from within Joint Helicopter Command.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May 2006</phrase>; Vol. 682, c.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.140.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" speakername="Andrew George" colnum="140"  time="016:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0010.htm#06060762000079">
	<p pid="b.140.1/1">During the break I found a quote from the Minister of State, Department for Transport, which I failed to lay my hands on earlier. The quote is from a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June 2006</phrase>, in which he responds to a letter of mine. He says:</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/2" class="indent">&quot;The decision to proceed to this next stage, however, gives an opportunity to bring together the current Search and Rescue helicopter providers into one harmonised service under a single contract providing the taxpayer with a service that is better value for money whilst remaining as effective as the current one...Indeed newer airframes, optimised training opportunities and greater harmonisation between the providers, will enhance the service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/3">He goes on to say something that has been repeated in a number of responses and statements from both the Department for Transport and the Ministry of Defence: that the new service will</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/4" class="indent">&quot;continue to use a high proportion of military aircrew alongside civilian aircrew&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/5">Certain questions arise from this type of situation. In his letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-15">15 June 2005</phrase>, the Minister now present said that in incidents such as that at Boscastle, which I mentioned earlier,</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/6" class="indent">&quot;the military will always be able to be called upon to support the Civilian Emergency Services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/7">That raises questions about how the military can provide such support after the only airframe left in the service is the Merlin, which has shown itself not to be capable of providing such a service.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/8">In relation to the points made by the Minister of State, Department for Transport, in his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>, I would like to know how a more harmonised service will be provided if the maritime and counter-terrorism service is being taken away from the search and rescue service. We still do not know how a service including the air ambulance, medevac, casevac and other functions provided by 711 Squadron&mdash;I can talk only about that service, but this no doubt applies to many other MOD-based services&mdash;that are not part of the core search and rescue function can be said to be part of a harmonised service if they are not included in the cost-benefit analysis of the proposal brought forward by both Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/9">In order properly to inform those who are most concerned about this&mdash;many Members from across the country will be concerned about this&mdash;both Departments must give us more information on costs and savings, and on how they will underpin the maritime, counter-terrorism, medical air ambulance, RTA and other roles for which the search and rescue service currently provides services.</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/10">In cases in which civilian services are provided by Bristows, such as in the Solent, for example, how often have such services failed to respond because of unserviceable aircrafts? What proportion of jobs have they failed to attend for which the MOD has provided back-up? I understand that that has happened on a number of occasions. How will the training that I mentioned earlier be provided, especially given that it is important that the civilian function provided by the MOD provides that essential real-life experience for the combat search and rescue situation? How will it perform its combat search and rescue? Which aircraft will be used if the Sea King is coming out of commission in total by 2018? What will be put in its place, and on the basis of what training and experience will that combat search and rescue service be provided? How will the Government&mdash;I suppose it will have to be done across Government&mdash;deal with major incidents such as those that I mentioned? How will they scramble those aircraft and make sure that the service is a harmonised service of the type that the Minister envisioned in his letter to me? What preparation and training will be given? Which aircraft will perform those duties?</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/11">I am sure that the Minister understands that the future of the 711 Squadron is close to my heart and those of my constituents. It is interesting that in his letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-26">26 May 2006</phrase>, he says:</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/12" class="indent">&quot;No decisions have yet been taken on the future bases for this service. The PFI process will identify any gaps and risks, and only after full consideration of all these will decisions be taken.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.140.1/13">From that, I presume that he is saying that there is potential for the present search and rescue services to be moved off-base in future. He says that the military crew should be used, but there is no guarantee or surety in his response, given that it is unclear which bases the services will operate from and whether many, if any, of the services will be based on MOD sites such as RNAS Culdrose. I hope that the Minister will take on board my concerns, and appreciate that I want to engage constructively with him on this matter. I look forward to hearing his response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.142.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Ministry of Defence"  colnum="142"  time="016:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0011.htm#06060762000080">
	<p pid="b.142.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1801" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St. Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> on securing this debate and on providing me with the chance to speak on an unquestionably important issue. From his opening and closing comments, I know that he shares my appreciation of the excellent search and rescue helicopter service provided by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy under the Ministry of Defence, and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency under the Department for Transport. I hope that he accepts that it is our intention to maintain the current high standard of service. I want to touch on how that has been approached.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/2">The hon. Gentleman correctly referred to the written ministerial statement laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase> by the Minister of State, Department for Transport, which said that the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Transport are moving forward together to ensure that we continue to have an excellent service. That is a very positive step and we were able to announce it jointly.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/3">It may be helpful if I were to set out the background to that recent statement. The organisation of search and rescue in the United Kingdom is an amalgam of separate Departments, the emergency services and other organisations, all of which play a vital part. The Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency together provide a 24-hour military and civil search and rescue helicopter service.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/4">We cover the United Kingdom search and rescue region from 12 bases around the United Kingdom. Currently, the service is provided by the RAF from six bases&mdash;at Boulmer, Chivenor, Leconfield, Lossiemouth, Valley and Wattisham&mdash;and by the Royal Navy from two bases, which are at Culdrose and Prestwick, using Sea King helicopters. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency service is provided from its four bases, which are at Lee-on-Solent, Portland, Stornoway and Sumburgh, through a contractor, as it has been for many years. That is re-competed for regularly, approximately every five years.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/5">Over the next decade, the Ministry of Defence search and rescue Sea Kings, which, as the hon. Gentleman said, have given us good service since the 1970s, will come to the end of their useful life. I sense that he wanted them to continue in some shape or form, but they will come to the end of their useful life. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency service contract will also come up for renewal in 2012. It was therefore essential for us to decide the best way to ensure the continuation of that important service well into the future and to work together even more closely. We needed to ensure that the best possible service was delivered, while ensuring that it demonstrated value for money. That was the overriding priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/6">The hon. Gentleman made the point that if it ain't broke, don't fix it. As the Sea Kings are going out of service, they will not be available, so we need to replace them. Therefore, it is right, at this point, to consider what will replace them and what the replacement will do. He began to allude to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/7">As a result of that, a joint Ministry of Defence and Maritime and Coastguard Agency procurement team was set up under an inter-departmental steering group to assess options. Over the past three years, a rigorous joint assessment has been carried out. It concluded that we should move to a harmonised service, and that a service under the private finance initiative has the best potential to deliver the capability we need at maximum value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/8">The decision is very much in line with the plan outlined in the defence industrial strategy, which states that the majority of search and rescue helicopters in the UK currently are provided by the RAF and the Royal Navy. The remainder are provided by civilian helicopters under contract to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It is planned to replace that capability with a single contract that retains a proportion of military aircrews to enable operational readiness of deployed search and rescue crews in the middle of the next decade. I understood that the hon. Gentleman's party supported the DIS. I suggest that he perhaps reads what we set out and his party supported in the construct of that document.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/9">The next stage is what do we do now that we have set out that definition, and we are moving forward to the joint search and rescue helicopter project as a competition under the private finance initiative. The decision to proceed to that next stage provides the opportunity to bring together the current search and rescue helicopter provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.142.0/10">We intend to provide a service that is at least as effective as the current one. We also anticipate additional benefits from the flexibility that harmonisation brings, from the improved capability and sustainability that modern aircraft and technology will deliver, and from military and civilian aircrew being trained to the same high standard. We believe that that will enhance the service and provide an excellent service that offers value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="b.143.0/1">I am grateful for the Minister's reassuring comments. Will he address the question of which aircraft he believes will perform this function? Will he reassure me that the additional roles that Ministry of Defence search and rescue services provide with regard to the air ambulance and so on will be contained in the contract proposed?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-06-07b.143.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1976" speakername="Adam Ingram" colnum="143"  time="016:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060607/halltext/60607h0011.htm#06060762000082">
	<p pid="b.143.1/1">I was moving on to the process. Hopefully, the hon. Gentleman understands that it will be a thorough process. We do not enter such a process by being prescriptive. We must see what is out there and what the options are. We must test the range of opportunities that exist. I shall explain how that is approached, and hopefully that will deal with some, if not all, of his points.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/2">The competition is being carried out in accordance with the European Union procurement regulations and was launched through a notice in the European Union journal on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-12">12 May</phrase>. It will benefit from the new European Union competitive dialogue procedure, which has been designed to deal with PFI projects. The process, in partnership with industry, promotes full evaluation of customer requirements and industry responses prior to selecting a preferred bidder. We will use it to establish a robust contract with industry and to ensure that we deliver an excellent service for the taxpayer. The first step will be to ensure that companies wishing to take part in the competition have the appropriate capability. That will be done by thorough assessment of their pre-qualification questionnaires later this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/3">The hon. Gentleman asked me which aircraft will be involved and how things will be delivered. Is he therefore asking me not to go through a procurement process, and not to have rigorous examination and to be definitive before we see what the market has available and how things should be delivered? Given his strong European credentials, there seems to be a contradiction. We should ensure best value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/4">There has been some speculation about the implications of that decision for the standard of service. I shall provide reassurance on the issue and bring out two key points. First, the Ministry of Defence and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency will continue jointly to manage and task the service. In particular, the search and rescue tasking, which is currently carried out by the aeronautical rescue co-ordination centre at Kinloss and the appropriate maritime rescue co-ordination centres, will continue to be jointly managed.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/5">Secondly, the principle that the service will be no less effective than the current one will underpin the detailed requirement specification against which the competition will be conducted and performance will be measured. Key performance indicators will be set to ensure that all aspects of the service are met.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/6">As with the current service, military crews will play a key part in the future delivery of the search and rescue helicopter service. This is not, as some have said, privatisation. People should not set hares running, because there is no evidence for the assertion. People should not raise it, because what has been said will not happen at the end of the process. We will ensure that a high proportion of aircrew from the RAF and Royal Navy will continue to form part of the future service. We will continue to develop and maintain those valuable search and rescue skills in the military. That is in line with current policy, which seeks to transfer search and rescue skills to our deployable military helicopter fleets. There is an essential defence role in all that we do, and we have no intention of moving away from that, because we need the skill capability for all the reasons mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, and for some others.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/7">I shall address three other areas where I am aware that there has been considerable interest: the specific aircraft, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned; basing arrangements; and contract duration for the future service. The very nature of a service provision competition places the incentive on industry to propose the optimum means of delivering the service. That will include consideration of many issues, such as basing, operational capability, safety and the ability of airframes and crew to cover simultaneous incidents. The specific parameters will be established through the competition, and all aircraft proposed by industry will be rigorously assessed to ensure that they are capable of delivering the level of service we require. Only once that process is completed will any decisions be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/8">The hon. Gentleman mentioned Merlin helicopters. He is right in saying that although those based at Culdrose are not designed for search and rescue purposes, they are used by other nations in a search and rescue role. It is for providers to decide whether they want an adapted airframe for that purpose. The hon. Gentleman seems to be writing off the Merlin, but that is not desirable given the importance of the airframe, so let us see whether it can be adapted for that use and whether it can meet our rigorous testing, against which it would be measured.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/9">Clearly, the hon. Gentleman has a particular interest in the Royal Navy air station at Culdrose. The future use of Culdrose as a search and rescue base will be fully assessed during the competitive phase. He set out various reasons why it should be retained and I assure him that all those factors will be taken into account. We are not setting out to close stations; we want to see how best we can continue to deliver where there is demand.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/10">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the maritime and counter-terrorism role of 771 Squadron, which will be unaffected by the future helicopter search and rescue plans. The maritime counter-terrorism role of the squadron, which is based at RNAS Culdrose, will be transferred to an alternative, equally capable military unit in due course and where it is best placed. I am sure that he recognises that. The squadron needs to remain at Culdrose because its function is UK-wide, so let us see where it is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/11">Another issue that must be addressed is the duration of the contract, which will be established following dialogue with industry during the competition phase. The duration must provide a solid assurance of the future search and rescue service and is likely to relate to the potential lifespan of the new aircraft. It is anticipated that that will result in a duration of between 20 and 30 years, so when a determination has been made it will be for two or three decades, which is significant. It will depend on the airframes and other component parts selected. None of that has been fixed and will be subject to full and proper evaluation.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.1/12">Our plans for the future are of course relevant to the wider search and rescue community. There is no question about that and we shall continue to keep the UK search and rescue strategic committee and its operators group informed. They are a key aspect of delivery and monitoring because they bring together Departments, emergency services, charities and voluntary organisations that contribute to search and rescue in the United Kingdom. The wider public will be able to keep abreast of progress through the Maritime and Coastguard Agency's website. The process will be integrated. As each stage is reached, it will be defined and set out&mdash;</p>
