	<p pid="a.1.5/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. Broadcasters' role is merely to ensure that appeals meet their criteria. I have before me the BBC guidelines for televised appeals, and anyone who runs through them quickly will find that they have been met completely. First:</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/2" class="indent">&quot;The disaster must be on such a scale...as to call for swift international humanitarian assistance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/3">That is a tick. Secondly, agencies must be in a position to provide it. There may have been doubt about that earlier, but there is none now: agencies are there already. Thirdly,</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/4" class="indent">&quot;There must be sufficient public...sympathy...to give reasonable grounds for concluding that a public Appeal would be successful.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1.5/5">Yes again. For the life of me, I do not understand on what grounds the BBC refused the appeal. It is undoubtedly true that however much money Channels 4 and 5 and ITV may have raised last night, much more would have been raised if the BBC and Sky had been there as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.6.0/1">Like other colleagues, I shall be brief because many hon. Members want to speak. That is good and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on securing the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2">The situation in Gaza is obviously appalling, but it is not new. The situation in the west bank is difficult&mdash;if not also appalling in many places&mdash;and, again, it is not new. Although the issue about the BBC and Sky refusing to broadcast the appeal is important&mdash;I will return to that in a moment&mdash;I want to draw attention to the systematic curtailment of economic activity and development in both the west bank and Gaza by the blockade, by the construction of the wall by Israel, by the prevention of the export of goods from Palestinian areas, and by the high levels of unemployment and difficulties that Palestinian people have in travelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/3">In relation to any aid that is provided for development, we have to be sure of two things: one, that it will get through and be used to develop, and, secondly, that it will not be wasted by a subsequent bombardment. Many of us have memories of visiting Gaza in the past and of seeing, for example, the airport or the water treatment plant, which were splendid. The water treatment plant was built with a great deal of support from the Department for International Development. There were new roads and new pavements, schools, hospitals and all the other things that have been built largely with international support and aid&mdash;some of which came from this country, although some came from the EU and from all over the world. All those things have been destroyed in Gaza. On various occasions in the west bank, that degree of damage has also been done and many aid packages have been destroyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/4">Although I strongly support appeals for aid and the international support currently being given to the Palestinians, there is a case for the Israeli Government to be deposited with a large bill for the damage that they have done in Gaza over the past four weeks. What has happened has been a wanton act of carnage by the Israeli army against the civilian population in Gaza and has resulted in the destruction of their means of economic livelihood.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/5">The aid appeal that the BBC and Sky ought to be broadcasting is being made by the Disasters Emergency Committee and, as others have pointed out, in relation to every previous international disaster of any sort&mdash;whether it is a tsunami, volcano, flood, war or any other form of humanitarian disaster&mdash;if the DEC meets and decides to launch an appeal, the broadcasting channels have always broadcast it, irrespective of the place concerned. They have done it for Burma, for the earthquake in Iran, for the Congo and many other places. I do not know what on earth is going through the mind of the BBC&mdash;it is mainly the BBC that has caused this problem&mdash;in not broadcasting the appeal. Is it that the Israeli Government have some kind of power of veto over what the BBC actually does, because it is beginning to look a little bit like that?</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/6">I thank the Government for putting what pressure they can on the BBC, and I welcome that. I hope that they will notice that a large number of hon. Members have also applied such pressure because we want the broadcast to take place. Of course, the whole thing has been counterproductive because the huge publicity given to the BBC's refusal has damaged its reputation and encouraged people to contribute to the appeal anyway. I hope that they do so to a large extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/7">I would be grateful if the Minister gave us some good news about DFID, British aid and support for Palestine, and the way in which aid will get through&mdash;particularly in relation to exerting pressure to open the crossings to enable people to travel and in relation to the development of education. I also hope that the Minister will give us some news about the situation facing other aid agencies, such as Interpal. A number of British banks have refused banking facilities for Interpal, in particular Lloyds TSB. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1416" name="Richard Burden">the Member for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard Burden)</phrase> has put a great deal of effort into supporting Interpal, which is a well respected, recognised charity. We should support all charitable efforts by ordinary people all over the country&mdash;indeed, all over the world&mdash;to respond in a decent, normal way to ensure that the people of Palestine no longer suffer from a lack of medicine, clean water, decent food and, above all, an absence of education for the young people there. It is our job to do all that we can, but I want to see a permanent settlement that allows the Palestinian people to live in peace.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.1/1">I completely agree. It is dangerous if the two ideas run together. Wars are controversial&mdash;it is in their nature&mdash;but the impact on the victims is real, and that should be our focus.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/2">I have several questions, some of which I hope my hon. Friend the Minister will be able to answer, others that, perhaps through him, people outside Parliament may be able to deal with. In today's <i>Guardian</i>, there is a report that the DEC approached the BBC on Tuesday, asking for the appeal to be screened. The BBC's decision to refuse to broadcast it was communicated to the DEC at 5.47 pm on Wednesday, because, as we know, it believed that the content would be partial and compromise its impartiality. At that stage, the appeal had not been filmed, and I understand that on such appeals, editorial content rests with the broadcaster. So, what was the BBC saying? If it felt that there was a problem with impartiality, the solution was in its own hands.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/3">On the first reason why the BBC refused to broadcast the appeal, the letter that I received from Mark Thompson says:</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/4" class="indent">&quot;There were two key factors in making this decision. In addition to the practical issue of delivering aid, there was a second important reason&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/5">and it then mentions partiality.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/6">I just want to focus for a minute on the practical delivery of aid, because it is relevant to this debate and was clearly a reason that the BBC gave in its letter to me on Saturday. By the next day, the comments from BBC spokespeople were indicating that the issue of getting aid through was a less important factor because it probably could get through now. Interestingly, however, by yesterday that issue had re-emerged as a factor and, again, BBC spokespeople were saying, &quot;We're really concerned about whether aid will get through and whether it will get into the right hands.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/7">There are questions that the Minister may be able to shed some light on, but if he is not able to do so I hope that the BBC will. Who did the BBC ask about the issue of access for aid, when did it ask and where did it get its advice from? Was any advice sought from the Government, either through the Department for International Development or elsewhere, was any given and what was that advice? Apparently anticipating the DEC appeal, according to the report in <i>The Guardian</i>, the BBC charity appeals committee met in the run-up to the request for an appeal and some concerns were expressed about the ability of aid to get through. Apparently, those concerns had subsided by the time that the DEC made its request. We need to know who the BBC was asking and where it got its responses from. If the issue of access ceased to be such an important issue by Sunday of this week, why did it re-emerge as an issue yesterday? Who was the BBC asking and who told it that that was an issue? Who else did the BBC ask? I mention this matter because it raises some serious questions not only about what the BBC have been doing over the past week, but about the future of aid to Gaza and the Palestinian territories. If Chinese whispers can get in the way of the BBC's broadcasting such a crucial appeal, will Chinese whispers not raise their head again and again and get in the way of the delivery of aid in future?</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/8">Before the war on Gaza started, for 18 months it was subject to an amazing blockade that was well reported by the United Nations and others. I spoke to the mayor of Gaza about 18 months ago, before the blockade got really tight, who said, at that stage, that he was having real difficulty getting the materials in to repair sewers, roads and so on. This man was not Hamas; he was an independent. He was having difficulties. We were told that hospitals were having difficulty getting medical supplies in, because those could be used, possibly, by terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1688" name="Louise Ellman">the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs. Ellman)</phrase> said that some of the materials that come in could be diverted for use elsewhere. However, the question is, if there are concerns about that, who makes the decision about whether materials go in or not? So far, the decision has been made by Israel. Israel decides whether aid could be abused and, if it thinks that it could, it just stops it getting in. That happened for 18 months and for a long time before that, to a lesser extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/10">If we are going to sort this matter for the future and if the borders are going to be opened, who will decide what goes through when they are open? Will it be Israel or the Palestinians? Will the decision be made between them, jointly, or will the international community have a say in that matter? If the international community is going to have a say in that, will my hon. Friend the Minister say what the mechanisms might be for achieving that rather than its remaining the prerogative of Israel in future?</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/11">The discussion so far has rightly focused on humanitarian aid, but the solution for Gaza is not humanitarian aid. This should not be a poor part of the world. I do not want everyone to say that the matter is sorted once the people of Gaza are able to live for the foreseeable future on food parcels let in by the grace and favour of the international community, Israel or someone else. I want the people of Gaza to be able to trade and to have a decent, normal life. That is what they want.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/12">Finally, if my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside is worried about the smuggling of arms and about whether food parcels contain bits of food that could be used by terrorists, or whatever, the answer is to open the borders, let trade happen and let the Gazans raise money for an economy, for themselves, and let them link with the west Bank. That is the solution and that is what we should all be working for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-27a.18.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="18"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090127/halltext/90127h0003.htm#09012745000543">
	<p pid="a.18.0/1">I am delighted to serve under your chairmanship, Lady Winterton. I welcome the Minister back from Palestine and congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the hon. Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> not only on securing this debate, but on providing the Chamber with a well-informed speech. I shall draw later on some of his comments. I should add that the shadow International Development Secretary, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1862" name="Andrew Mitchell">the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr. Mitchell)</phrase>, is on his way back from Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/2">Three weeks of fighting in Gaza have caused damage estimated at &pound;1.4 billion. Four thousand homes have been destroyed, 17,000 residences partially destroyed and upwards of 1,300 Palestinians have lost their lives. In that context, we should remember the Israelis who have lost their lives as well as the Israeli soldier killed this morning. I hope that the latter does not lead to a new upsurge in violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/3">We should not for a minute underestimate the scale of the crisis in Gaza. The hon. Members for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) and for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett) graphically illustrated the destruction of public services and the absolute misery of people living with raw sewage, and without running water or enough equipment in the hospitals. The situation in Gaza is truly dreadful: it existed long before Operation Cast Lead began, but it is now inescapably more desperate.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/4">The short and long-term scope for the spending of economic aid is huge. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency has launched a campaign whose stated aims demonstrate the immediacy of the need for humanitarian assistance&mdash;that need is recognised throughout the Chamber&mdash;and many other groups are, of course, working to provide that much needed assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/5">Many Members have criticised the BBC's decision not to broadcast the Disasters Emergency Committee's appeal. My hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield said that</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/6" class="indent">&quot;while it is clearly a decision for the BBC and other broadcasters as to whether they show the appeal, the British public ought to have the opportunity to make their own judgment on the validity of the appeal. British generosity through our leading NGOs will make a huge difference to this appalling humanitarian crisis.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/7">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1655" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington, North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> said, the BBC must be very careful not to lag behind or to contradict public opinion. It is the guardian of the licence payers' money, and ultimately they should have a broadcaster that conforms to their wishes, and indeed those of this Chamber&mdash;a number of signatures are on the relevant early-day motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/8">A number of questions have been posed to the Minister this morning about the role of the Department for International Development. In 2007, DFID agreed funding of up to &pound;243 million to the occupied Palestinian territories, although it is to be linked to progress in peace negotiations. In light of the recent violence, I would welcome an update from him on how DFID's aid campaign will now progress and on how he envisages us getting the aid into Gaza. As I said in a debate in this Chamber last week, it is imperative that we get water, food and medicines into Gaza as soon as possible and that we use every means possible to do so, including, if necessary, by ship and under the auspices of the Royal Navy.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/9">The UK is not alone in providing funding. The European Commission is providing nearly &euro;500 million, and the United States has pledged $555 million. However, even with all that funding and good will, the cessation of violence and the steady establishment of the Palestinian economy and infrastructure have not been achieved. In Gaza it is even more tragic that any gains made might have been destroyed during the fighting, and many infrastructure projects will be back to square one. The hon. Member for Bolton, South-East mentioned the excellent housing projects that might sadly have been destroyed. That is a tragedy. I share with Members in the Chamber the genuine hope that the ceasefire can hold. We must continue to try to look forward, which is why we are all here today.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/10">Economic assistance must be spent wisely and properly, and audited correctly. We must ensure that it does not find its way into the hands of the Hamas extremists. That is not where the aid is needed. We must do all that we can to assist in the negotiations for a lasting peace settlement in the middle east. Only through a two-state solution, with a secure Israel living alongside a sovereign and viable Palestinian state, can true peace exist. Trust must be restored through negotiations. There is recognition that Israel must open its borders, but in doing so it must be open only to items that foster development, not violence.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/11">As I have said to the Israeli ambassador, if peace is to endure in the long term, there will have to be a political solution, as we found in Northern Ireland. The onus is on Hamas to demonstrate that it prefers its people's welfare to warfare against Israel. In the west bank, Fatah has chosen a path of political engagement over conflict&mdash;a process that has not been easy but is beginning to show signs of progress. Developments are being witnessed in trade, employment, security and agriculture, all of which lay the groundwork for future economic and social developments, free from the threat of war. More can be done, however, and I hope that the Minister will say something about the fact that Mahmoud Abbas needs to receive more support from the western world to prevent him from being sidelined and silenced by Hamas. Israel needs to offer more carrot and less stick in the west bank, and the further opening up of borders to allow the free movement of goods and people that will allow the region to develop.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/12">From the other middle eastern states neighbouring this conflict, we must see a greater demonstration that they truly believe in peace in the region and are doing all that they can to assist. I was very interested to hear the hon. Member for Battersea say that Saudi Arabia has pledged $1 billion and Kuwait $500 million, and that the United Arab Emirates has pledged to rebuild 1,300 houses. That is an excellent start. However, I urge all Arab states, many of which have plenty of wealth from oil revenues, to do more and to apply pressure to bring about a political solution. In addition, the international community must monitor developments to ensure that the rocket attacks do not resume, because the consequences of a resumption of hostilities, on top of what has happened already, do not bear thinking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/13">I welcome Barack Obama's initial engagement with the issue and greatly look forward to seeing how he and Hillary Clinton, the new Secretary of State, choose to proceed. In particular, I welcome the appointment of George Mitchell in his new role as special envoy to the middle east. He has a proven track record in Northern Ireland where he was pivotal to the peace process. Let us hope that he can repeat some of that work in the middle east. However, we should not lose sight of Britain's historical involvement in the region and must ensure that we remain a key player and continue to work with our friends in the United States and Europe in trying to find a solution to this desperate situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.18.0/14">In conclusion, I welcome the good will of all those, especially our generous public, who choose to provide money to combat suffering wherever it takes place. I hope that, despite the BBC controversy, they will continue to donate generously to the DEC appeal and to other non-governmental organisations trying to alleviate the suffering of those poor people in Gaza.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1393" name="Martin Linton">the Member for Battersea (Martin Linton)</phrase> on introducing this debate. It is not only timely, but has been of a very high quality, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for Cotswold (Mr. Clifton-Brown)</phrase> said. I congratulate all Members on their contributions; I shall address as many of their questions as I can, but if I cannot do so in the time allowed, I shall follow up in writing to the Members concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/2">We have heard hon. Members' concerns about the grave situation in Gaza&mdash;concerns that the Government share. We have all been shocked by the loss of life and the scenes of violence in Gaza in recent weeks. The images on our television screens have been harrowing. My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea asked whether we should debate the causes of the situation&mdash;whether it was 1967 or 1948, for instance. When I was in Saudi Arabia, yesterday, we talked about events as far back as the 1917 Balfour agreement. However, we should leave historians to debate and rewrite the history books. What we should do as politicians is try to shape the future for the Palestinian people.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/3">May I remind the Chamber, and all those listening, what the UK's position has been since <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-27">27 December</phrase> when the conflict resumed? We called for an immediate ceasefire. The Foreign Secretary led the way at the United Nations to secure resolution 1860. My Department has led efforts to ensure that, even when violence is wrecking people's lives, they have access to medical supplies, food and shelter. The Government have not stood by, and we have not walked by on the other side of the road. My Department has moved incredibly fast to ensure the availability of all the resources that are needed for this immense humanitarian effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/4">Since <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December</phrase>, the United Kingdom has pledged nearly &pound;27 million for the relief effort. According to the UN, that makes the UK the current largest donor of humanitarian assistance. Many other countries have pledged future commitments. Saudi Arabia, for example, has pledged $1 billion for the recovery and reconstruction of Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/5">Of the more than &pound;11 million that we have spent since <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-31">31 December</phrase>, &pound;4 million has gone to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides food and shelter for the people in Gaza. Last Sunday, I announced a donation of &pound;4 million to the International Committee of the Red Cross to deliver medical supplies and to support the medical evacuation to Egypt; &pound;1 million has gone to the UN humanitarian emergency response fund to help non-governmental organisations support local work; and &pound;1 million has gone to the World Food Programme to support logistical efforts in the task of getting aid through the crossings from Israel into Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/6">Yesterday, the UK airlifted three specially modified vehicles to enable the UN to distribute safely humanitarian assistance and to allow the needs assessment to take place, with aid workers being kept safely in the vehicles. In addition, the Secretary of State announced that we were sending &pound;200,000 to the Mines Advisory Group to help it clear unexploded munitions and other explosive material.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.0/7">This morning, I can announce that &pound;600,000 will be given to Oxfam to provide water and sanitation in Gaza. That should help to deliver clean water for up to 50,000 people who are most in need, and sanitation kits to more than 2,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.1/1">Every Member is in the Chamber today because they have constituents who have suffered as a result of the situation being discussed. They will be looking for something a little more concrete. I have not yet heard the hon. Gentleman say how much he thinks it will cost to put right this wrong. Without quantifying the amount that hon. Members think the Government should invest in a compensation scheme, all we are hearing today are warm words.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.2/1">I have to disagree with the hon. Lady; she is starting in the wrong place. She asks how much we can afford and says that afterwards we should tweak the scheme to meet the bill. We are talking about an injustice that needs to be righted. She knows that figures of up to &pound;4 billion have been talked about. That is one estimate. However, we do not have access to data on scheme members&mdash;how much they have lost and the different categories&mdash;so it is difficult to know how much the bill would be. The starting point must be to remedy the injustice. Of course, we will have to put a bill on that, but to start by asking what we can afford is not the way to remedy the injustice.</p>
	<p pid="a.31.2/2">My final concern about the John Chadwick process is the following fundamental issue: is it about hardship, charity and discretion, or about righting injustice? Surely it must be the latter, which is why the ombudsman process was involved. Was there maladministration leading to injustice? The ombudsman said yes. The Government said, &quot;Well, probably not.&quot; However, they excluded most of the ombudsman's expensive findings. The Government say that they agree with five in 10 of the findings, but those are the cheap five. The position is so constrained that it is not acceptable.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.0/1">I add my congratulations to those given to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> on securing a debate on the inequitable life fiasco. Two things come out of the issue. First, I hope that at some stage we will enshrine the role of the ombudsman in law, and, secondly, despite not just this case, but the occupational pensions case and all the banking issues that have arisen over the past six months, hardly anyone has said anything about the auditors. Those who audit these things write them off, put their reputation on the line, and get off scot-free. We must examine the law on auditing and auditors, but that is for another time.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/2">I completely associate myself with the remarks made by the hon. Gentleman, and I will not repeat them because I know many hon. Members want to speak. In terms of compensation, there are some extraordinary parallels with the occupational pension scheme debate that I started in the House back in July 2002. We met the Secretary of State for more than a year and there were lots of warm words. If we had had 50 per cent. of the occupational pension scheme that we wanted, we would have signed. Those concerned were happy to go for 50 per cent.&mdash;they would have gone for anything because they had nothing. Instead, however, they sensibly dug in. Amazingly, they also had an ombudsman report, which found in favour of my and other constituents. There were only 126,000 people involved&mdash;not 1 million&mdash;but all were individuals with a case to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/3">What did the Government do? They started by saying, &quot;Let's hang something out. Let's have &pound;400 million. That seems a good figure. Let's go &pound;1.2 billion. No, that's not enough.&quot; Gradually, as the campaign developed, they said, &quot;Let's go to &pound;3 billion.&quot; Eventually, we got our justice, which was &pound;8 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/4">It seems that exactly the same parallels exist in relation to Equitable Life and I simply do not agree that it is right for the Government to concentrate only on those who are needy. Let me give an example from just one constituency case out of 500. Lorraine and Richard Baker state:</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/5" class="indent">&quot;We find it unacceptable that the Government Minister is prepared to discriminate against some of those affected by the Regulators failure whilst others will receive compensation. Whether we have yet experienced hardship as a result of this fiasco is not entirely the point. If we are not compensated for the losses we have so far incurred we will of course experience hardship in the future.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/6">That just does not come under any jurisdiction that we have so far heard about from the Chief Secretary in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.32.0/7">My sense is&mdash;the point has been made previously&mdash;that the Government actively want a legal challenge in the court. In relation to a legal challenge, I will give 100 per cent. support to the Equitable members who are here listening to this debate and to those in my constituency. I do not know whether it should be a judicial review or whether it should take place in the High Court as I am not a lawyer, but it is imperative that we support them as a House. It is critical that we go with the people concerned and support them&mdash;whether in the High Court or as part of a judicial review.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.2/1">The Government appear to accept that there has been regulatory failure, that the failure amounts to maladministration and that a resolution should come sooner rather than later, but they have also, almost immediately, gone in for a series of blocking and delaying tactics in response to the ombudsman's report, and that is wholly indefensible. I accept that the Government have apologised, but what exactly did they apologise for? It seems that they apologised for some vague 20 years of regulatory failure, but we need an apology for the decade of delay while the issue was on the Government's books waiting to be dealt with&mdash;while it was on their watch.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> on his remarks, and I shall sum up his key points, to which he has already alluded. There are two unacceptable factors: first, the arrangements for compensation and, secondly, the effect of the decisions on the time it will take before compensation comes through.</p>
	<p pid="a.33.2/3">On the compensation arrangements, we have had the transmogrification of what should have been a compensation scheme into a hardship fund, and that is wholly unacceptable. The Government have rejected the parliamentary ombudsman's recommendations for arranging compensation, and they have introduced means testing, which the ombudsman said would be a novel and worrying development. The approach has been rejected in other cases and, explicitly, by the Public Administration Committee. Somebody has already quoted point 84 from its second report on the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.35.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> on securing this debate. The subject affects constituents of all of us. As a former court lawyer, it occurs to me that the Government's actions in relation to Equitable Life are similar to those of an old lag up before the sheriff. He starts with an outright denial, but as the evidence accumulates he reluctantly accepts that he will have to plead; he makes a half-hearted plea and then tries to minimise it and wriggle out of the consequence of his actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/2">No one could have been in any doubt from the ombudsman's report that the Government had a case to answer on the inaction of the regulator that led to the downfall of Equitable Life. I do not intend to cover the cause; what is required is urgent action to put right a wrong. Frankly, the actions announced by the Treasury are far to little, far too late. Like all hon. Members, I have a significant number of Equitable Life policyholders as constituents, most of them now elderly, who have suffered significantly. Sadly, some died while waiting for justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/3">When the Government said that they would apologise, there was real hope that action would finally be taken to end the saga. It was therefore a considerable let-down&mdash;to put it mildly&mdash;when all that was announced was yet another investigation, under Sir John Chadwick, on how a compensation scheme, if it was even that, would work. Worse still, it was abundantly clear that the Government expected that it would be some years before compensation was paid to anyone. In her statement, the Chief Secretary said:</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The ombudsman recommended that a payments scheme should be completed two and a half years after the decision to pay out. The Select Committee said that it could not assess whether that was viable, and our initial assessment of the ombudsman's approach is that it might take significantly longer than that to implement fully.&quot; &mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-01-15.379"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 January 2009; Vol. 486, c. 379-80</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/5">The more cynical among us might consider that statement as putting a decision beyond the next general election. However, it raises some pertinent questions. What is the date of the decision to pay out? Is it the date of the Chief Secretary's statement to the Commons, the date on which Sir John Chadwick reports with specific recommendations or some other day? We do not know whether the two and a half year period has even started. It could be some time before it does. There is absolutely no time scale for telling anyone if and when they will get any payment. In responding to the debate, will the Minister clarify that point? How long do the Government think it will be before payments are made?</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/6">It seems that even after nearly 10 years of waiting, policyholders will still have to wait several more years before compensation is available, but of perhaps even greater concern is the Government's stance on who will receive compensation. It seems abundantly clear that they do not intend to compensate everyone who has lost out but only those who have suffered disproportionately. What that means is unclear to me and, I think, to many others, but it seems clear that some sort of means test is envisaged, and the hon. Member for Northavon gave a clear exposition of what that could mean. Will the Minister clarify how the disproportionate effect will be calculated? How will it be determined which losses are directly due to maladministration? Both concepts could keep the lawyers in business for years, if not decades.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.0/7">The worst thing about the scheme is that it will inevitably lead to endless arguments about definitions, calculations and who is more worthy of compensation than others. It is a mean-minded scheme that will set policyholders against each other. I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to give justice to that group and come up with a simple, even-handed scheme so that my ageing constituents need not wait interminably before finding out whether any of them will be compensated. I leave it at that, as many more Members wish to speak in the debate, and I hope that the Minister will take these points on board. There is extreme anger within the House and among our constituents at how such a vulnerable group is being treated by our Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.2/1">My hon. Friend is correct in saying that this matter should be debated on the Floor of the House. The ombudsman's report was to Parliament, not to the Government, and Parliament should take the decision. It should have the chance to vote and to decide whether to implement the ombudsman's report in full by paying compensation, without means testing, to everybody who lost out.</p>

	<p pid="a.39.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point and is, of course, absolutely right. There is no clearer demonstration of how isolated the Government have become on this issue than how Members here&mdash;a few have had to leave&mdash;have chosen to seat themselves. With great respect, it would not have been possible for the Labour Members here at the start of the debate to have sat any further away from the Minister than they chose to do. It was almost as if they were frightened of being tainted by the Government's pathetically inadequate response to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/2">I want to speak out on behalf of the many constituents who have contacted me about their policies held in Equitable Life and the many more who, I am sure, have been adversely affected. My constituents, and those of hon. Members around me, have waited long enough&mdash;years, in fact&mdash;to hear their fate and whether their savings will be returned to them. Despite the Government's announcement, they are still none the wiser. They are left waiting in limbo. That is disgraceful, particularly in the current economic climate, when people find things so difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/3">The Government announced that they would fund a compensation scheme only for those who had been &quot;disproportionately affected&quot;. That is the term used in their response. The Government would decide who those people were by checking</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/4" class="indent">&quot;the extent of somebody's losses, how great the losses were but also perhaps looking at how great they were as a proportion of their income&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/5">As we have already heard, that is tantamount to means testing. Does the Minister really believe that that is fair to all policyholders, who have been waiting so long to hear whether their pensions will be saved?</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/6">The ombudsman's report also made it clear that the aim of any compensation scheme should be</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/7" class="indent">&quot;to put those people who have suffered a relative loss back into the position that they would have been in had maladministration not occurred.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/8">That is not what the Government propose. They decided to disregard the ombudsman's recommendations by helping only those whom they decide are worthy. When will the Government accept the ombudsman's report in full and put in place appropriate compensation for all those who are affected?</p>
	<p pid="a.39.3/9">After the Government acted so promptly and with such urgency to bail out bankers in their moment of difficulty, and acted promptly for other depositors, who lost money in the Icelandic and other banking situations, does not the Minister believe that the same treatment should be afforded to Equitable Life policyholders?</p>

	<p pid="a.40.2/1">Let me just say a few words; the hon. Gentleman has made a couple of interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/2">I do not to diminish the role of the management and the pseudo-Ponzi scheme that they were operating within Equitable Life, or their culpability in creating the circumstances that came about, but we must and do also accept the role of the regulators&mdash;the Department of Trade and Industry, until 1997, and then the Treasury, and after January 1999 the Financial Services Authority and the Government Actuary's Department. With all those taken together, there was a toxic mix of rule-bending within a financial institution and failure by the safeguarders of the public interest to do their job properly. That is why we ended up in a mess.</p>
	<p pid="a.40.2/3">Since that time, we have had endless debates on the subject. I reread a speech made by my hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham on <phrase class="date" code="2002-11-27">27 November 2002</phrase>, at column 67WH of <i>Hansard</i>. It was a superb exposition of the position at that time. My hon. Friend looked forward even then to the ombudsman's report and to what he hoped would be the resolution of a sorry saga. Since then, as we know, the Government have decided to play it long. We have had a succession of questions, speeches and interventions. I participated in a Westminster Hall debate just before Christmas, and the Minister answering on that occasion, the Economic Secretary to the Treasury, cut a sorry figure. He was unable to answer any question cogently.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-27a.51.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1711" speakername="Caroline Spelman" colnum="51"  time="012:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090127/halltext/90127h0009.htm#09012745000625">
	<p pid="a.51.0/1">In the same vein, I praise my right hon. Friend Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) for the way he has championed this cause and for articulating both the needs of people at the latter stages of their lives and the needs of their relatives. I thank him for calling for this debate, thereby making it possible for me to contribute to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/2">I, too, care passionately about this subject, not least because both my parents were unable to die at home, although they wished to do so, and because, in my constituency, there is a centre for the study of ageing and spirituality, which is led by the Reverend James Woodward, who spoke to us only last night in another place about what more could be done to improve the quality of the end of people's lives. I share my right hon. Friend's view that, if only we did more to improve the quality of life at end of life and to make people's ending better for them, they would be less afraid and less likely to resort to ending their lives prematurely.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/3">As my right hon. Friend said, there is a stark contrast between the 75 per cent. of people who say that they would like to die at home and the 25 per cent. of people who manage to do so. We as legislators have something to address here in respect of an aspiration that is completely unmet. However, this issue is even more important than that. As a Member of Parliament&mdash;I am sure that you experience the same thing, Mr. Gale&mdash;I have noticed the number of times that relatives have come to my surgery burdened with a sense of guilt and grief about not being able to provide the best end for a loved one, because all their efforts to bring a loved one home or to make them more comfortable in dignified surroundings were thwarted. That is what has motivated me so strongly.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/4">We hear also from professionals working in this area how difficult it is for them to help to meet the wishes of the person who is dying and the wishes of their relatives. One professional nurse relayed how she had to make 10 or 12 phone calls a day over a prolonged period to ensure that her mother did not go into accident and emergency but went instead into a nursing home with a visiting palliative care nurse. I am sure that plenty of people who read the report of this debate will be able to relate to the difficulty of trying to secure for people what they really want.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/5">It is difficult for the terminally ill patient to find out what their choices really are. If they are not fully informed and given all the information available, almost by default they find themselves swept into the system and swept into a hospital bed, which, often, they are unable to get out of to go back to where they would like to die or into palliative care, which has the specialist provision that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/6">It is vital that palliative care teams are fully integrated into hospitals, so that at the point of decision, when a terminal prognosis has been gently and clearly given to the patient, they can be presented with the choice of dying elsewhere&mdash;in a hospice, for example&mdash;or being able to go home. It would be no good asking a patient if they wanted to go into a hospice when it had not been made clear to them that they had only weeks to live. As my right hon. Friend says, we are, as a society, for whatever reason, not good at talking about such matters to the people who really need to know. I ask the Minister, what could the Government do to facilitate that?</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/7">One reason why people do not wish to talk about death is that it raises huge existential questions, but we would help those facing their end if we shared their options with them and helped them to plan their last days. I, too, am grateful to Lady Finlay for helping me to understand better the needs of terminally ill patients through her own professional background. She was present at the talk given last night by Reverend James Woodward. At that talk, we heard from Lady Neuberger, who is also well-informed on the subject. She pointed out the stark contrast between this country, where our default setting is to put people in hospital beds and expect them to remain there until they die, and the Netherlands, which interestingly has gone further down the road to euthanasia, but in some respects has better end-of-life provision. We need to address the culture surrounding someone's last needs and consider how to enable them to continue to accomplish tasks, until their dying day and hour, that confer on them a sense of human autonomy, which we do not relinquish until our last.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/8">People are very afraid of the process of dying when faced with limited choices and forced to remain in a hospital bed where there is little that anyone can do for them. I tend to understand that. I encourage the Minister to address the question of what more we can do to enable people in their last days to lead a normal life. I am concerned, at this economic juncture, about the position of our hospices, which on average receive only 30 per cent. of their funding from statutory sources. Sue Ryder Care estimates that it is subsiding primary care trusts by about &pound;6 million a year due to the shortfall in funding. In this recession, there is a genuine threat to hospices that depend so much on charitable funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/9">Hospices and the Government have explored the possibility of a tariff negotiated with the NHS, so that a patient expressing a wish to die at home or in a hospice could bring with them the necessary funding from the acute setting. That would help many hospices to survive&mdash;hospices on which we depend, in partnership between the third sector and the state, for the provision of palliative care. The Secretary of State announced last week an increase in patient rights. Will that extend to the rights of terminally ill patients? Does the Minister see that as a means to secure the funding, so that the money could follow the patient back to a hospice or into the home, where they could end their days?</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/10">As a result of the out-of-hours contract with general practitioners, some terminally ill patients are less sure of being seen out of hours by the GP attending to their needs into the last stages of their illness. In light of last week's announcement, have the Government any thoughts about helping to ensure that a GP who, over time, has built a relationship of trust with a terminally ill patient may be with them at the end? Good 24-hour nursing provision, supplemented by organisations such as Marie Curie and Macmillan, and the comfort of the familiar face of the family doctor would help to improve people's experience of their last days.</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/11">As the Minister will know, the gold standards framework is aimed at improving the standards of end-of-life care. Although it has come into being as an example of best practice, there are concerns that those in palliative care feel that its provision is patchy. What plans do the Government have to ensure that the framework is not patchy, but more consistent, and something on which everyone in the country can rely to ensure that our experience of palliative care at the end of our lives is to that standard?</p>
	<p pid="a.51.0/12">To conclude, the distribution of specialist palliative care across the country needs to be fair and even. There are pockets of good provision and pockets of weaker provision. I shall endeavour to address more of that issue when I introduce my private Member's Bill. However, I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for initiating the debate, and I feel that we have a chance today to ask the Government some of the key questions on which so many people&mdash;perhaps even us, one day&mdash;will depend.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2009-01-27a.56.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="56"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090127/halltext/90127h0009.htm#09012745000629">
	<p pid="a.56.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak under your chairmanship, Mr. Gale.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/2">It is appropriate that the debate is taking place in a building that is part of a world heritage site. There are now some 27 world heritage sites in the UK and dependent territories, ranging from historic buildings to fantastic landscapes. Sites in Scotland are as diverse as neolithic Orkney, the city of Edinburgh, Robert Owen's village at New Lanark, the Antonine wall and St. Kilda. The last is the only one that I have not yet managed to visit. In fairness, I have also visited several sites in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/3">Each site is chosen for outstanding universal value to the world's cultural and natural heritage. The idea first began in 1959 with a campaign to save Abu Simbel in Egypt from flooding. A convention was passed in 1972, and there are now 851 sites worldwide. This debate concerns the campaign to have the historic abbey of Arbroath designated a world heritage site, but it also raises a more general point regarding the Government's policy on world heritage sites, particularly on applications for further sites.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/4">There has been an ongoing campaign in Arbroath for the abbey to become a world heritage site, not only because of its grandeur in its own right&mdash;it is a magnificent example of a mediaeval abbey&mdash;but because of its association with the world-famous declaration of Arbroath. The campaign is completely non-political and encompasses people of all parties on the political spectrum and of none; indeed, one of its leading figures is a Conservative councillor, Jim Millar. The campaign has been supporting the case for the abbey and raising money for several years, appreciating that it would be some years before the abbey could be granted world heritage status.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/5">A problem arose in early December last year when the Culture Secretary launched a review of the future designation of sites in the UK. The review was undertaken partly because UNESCO is seeking changes to the system, but a report prepared for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport by PricewaterhouseCoopers states that UNESCO believes the world heritage site list to be unbalanced in terms of the location and nature of sites included. It has therefore asked that well-represented countries consider slowing or temporarily ceasing nominations and that nominations, to the extent that they continue, constitute under-represented sites, such as scientific, natural or cultural sites, rather than urban or ecclesiastical sites, which are considered over-represented.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/6">The campaign's feet were cut from under it somewhat when the Department for Culture, Media and Sport was reported to have changed its policy, refusing to propose any more UK sites for UNESCO approval, although the PricewaterhouseCoopers report stated that the Department had several options. The campaign sought my help, and I wrote to the Culture Secretary to seek clarification. To date, I have received no response.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/7">I therefore took the opportunity to raise the matter at Culture, Media and Sport questions last week. The Minister answered my question, but I was slightly concerned by the phrasing of her response. She said that after consultation, the Government would decide whether to put forward another list, which gave the impression that perhaps no more sites would be proposed. I can guess what she will tell me today: consultation is still ongoing, and we should await the outcome. That is not sufficient. There is great concern about the outcome of the consultation, given the various options before the Department. Furthermore, if we await the outcome of the consultation, we will in effect be challenging a decision that has already been taken, and it will be much more difficult to obtain any change.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/8">We need to put the case for Arbroath abbey now, before we are faced with a fait accompli. It is of the utmost importance due to the nature of Arbroath abbey and the comments about UNESCO. On the face of it, it could be argued that Arbroath abbey is an ecclesiastical site, but it is much more than that. Its significance goes to the very heart of our culture and the democratic culture of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/9">UNESCO's list of properties includes two categories that could have been written with Arbroath abbey in mind. Criteria III says that it must</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/10" class="indent">&quot;bear a unique or at least exceptional testimony to a cultural tradition&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/11">Criteria VI says that it must</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/12" class="indent">&quot;be directly or tangibly associated with events or living traditions, with ideas, or with beliefs, with artistic and literary works of outstanding universal significance.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/13">I shall relate the history of Arbroath abbey and explain why I feel that it falls in those categories.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/14">The abbey of Arbroath was founded by William the Lion, King of Scots, in 1178. It is dedicated to Thomas Becket, the turbulent priest who was killed at the instigation of Henry II in Canterbury cathedral, which is also a world heritage site. In its day, the abbey must have been a very impressive and powerful institution. Even its ruins&mdash;particularly the impressive &quot;Round O&quot;&mdash;are an impressive sight in the centre of our town. William the Lion is believed to be buried before the high altar.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/15">Nowadays, however, the abbey's best known association is with the first declaration of Scottish independence, or the declaration of Arbroath as it is often referred to. As many hon. Members will be aware, that magnificent document was written by the then abbot of Arbroath, Bernard de Linton, and signed by King Robert I&mdash;the Bruce, as he is often known&mdash;at Arbroath on <phrase class="date" code="1320-04-06">6 April 1320</phrase>. It is a letter to the Pope in Avignon and sets out the case for the continuing independence of Scotland, which had been regained following the battle of Bannockburn in 1314. However, the declaration is much more than that&mdash;great though it is; it echoes down through the centuries as one of the great documents of not only Scottish history but world history.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/16">In his book &quot;For Freedom Alone&quot; Professor Edward Cowan puts the point very well:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Scottish activists and thinkers of the period not only attempted to resolve their own political philosophies in response to the unprecedented contingencies which potentially threatened the very existence of their nation and kingdom, but they contributed towards ideas of constitutionalism which would ultimately feed into the mainstream of British, European and eventually American political thought.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/18">It should not be forgotten that in mediaeval times, the kingdom was very much considered to be a fiefdom of the king, who ruled by divine will. In the declaration of Arbroath, however, the first stirrings of democracy can be seen. The people of Scotland declared that the king was subject to the people and not just God. In this magnificent section, the declaration said:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/19" class="indent">&quot;Divine providence, the succession to his right according to our laws and customs which we shall maintain to the death, and the due consent and assent of us all, have made him our prince and king. We are bound to him for the maintaining of our freedom both by his right and merits, as to him by whom salvation has been wrought unto our people, and by him, come what may, we mean to stand. Yet if he should give up what he has begun, seeking to make us or our kingdom, subject to the King of England or the English, we would strive at once to drive him out as our enemy and a subverter of his own right and ours, and we would make some other man who was able to defend us our king. For so long as a hundred of us remain alive, we will never on any conditions be subjected to the lordship of the English. For we fight not for glory nor riches nor honour, but for freedom alone, which no good man gives up except with his life.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/20">That is a powerful passage for any Scottish nationalist such as me, but it goes far beyond that. It sets out the beginning of democracy and outlines the right of people to depose a leader who is not acting in their interests. No longer would they tolerate a king who made deals and alliances without the consent of the people.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/21">We should be thankful that the idea has taken root in many parts of the world. If anything goes to the heart of our culture, it is the idea of democracy. It is believed that the ideas of the declaration had a direct influence on the framers of the American declaration of independence four centuries later.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/22">On <phrase class="date" code="1998-03-20">20 March 1998</phrase>, the US senate passed resolution 155, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/23" class="indent">&quot;April 6 has a special significance for all Americans, and especially those Americans of Scottish descent, because the Declaration of Arbroath, the Scottish Declaration of Independence, was signed on April 6 1320, and the American Declaration of Independence was modelled on that inspirational document.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/24">In other words, the Senate of the United States recognised the influence of the declaration of Arbroath, which led directly to perhaps the most famous of all modern political declarations and the subsequent constitution of the United States. The declaration of independence states:</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/25" class="indent">&quot;We hold these truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/26">Of course, many nations have adopted the American constitution, or parts of it, in their constitution. The ideas of democracy that were born in the declaration of Arbroath in 1390 flow through to the modern world&mdash;to the United States and to the modern democracies that have established their constitution following that country. A resolution of the American Senate established <phrase class="date" code="2009-04-06">6 April</phrase> as Tartan day in the United States, which is a day on which Scotland and all things Scottish are celebrated throughout the country. Heritage is not just about buildings and sites; it is also about ideas and the places where such ideas originated. That is, at least, to some extent recognised by UNESCO, as I mentioned in relation to the conditions it laid down.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/27">Arbroath abbey can justifiably claim to have been one of the places where democracy put down its first roots, and it is worthy of recognition by UNESCO for that alone. That brings us on to another important reason why the Government are wrong to consider changing the scheme of UNESCO listings&mdash;at least in relation to the more draconian options proposed in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report. Since 1947, the Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society has regularly performed a re-enactment of the signing of the declaration, and an impressive visitor centre has been created at the abbey to explain the history of the building and the declaration. In short, Arbroath abbey has been extensively promoted as an important tourist destination. The advent of Tartan day has increased interest throughout the United States and, indeed, in Canada, which also has a Tartan day.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/28">This year&mdash;the 250th anniversary of the birth of our national bard Robert Burns&mdash; has been designated as the year of homecoming by the Scottish Government. The year of homecoming was officially launched at the weekend, and is designed to encourage Scots expatriates and those of Scots descent from around the world to visit Scotland and, we hope, boost our tourism industry. It is vital that we do so at a time of recession. Tourism is still a huge industry in Scotland, as it is in other parts of the UK. The international interest in the declaration of Arbroath and its effect on democratic thought throughout the centuries will play a pivotal role in encouraging expatriates to visit Scotland, and Arbroath abbey in particular.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/29">Following the Cabinet meeting in the midlands, even the Prime Minister acknowledged in a recent speech that tourism would play a vital part in bringing us out of recession. In its report, PWC also recognised that one of the benefits of being listed is that it can increase tourism. In the year of homecoming and at a time when even the Prime Minister is seeking to boost tourism, what message is sent if the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which is responsible for the promotion of tourism, says that we no longer wish to promote our great monuments and buildings as sites of international significance? Is it not the craziest time to embark upon such a policy&mdash;if, indeed, there is ever a time to embark upon such a policy?</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/30">I fully appreciate that the Minister will say that consultation on the matter is ongoing. She will not throw up her hands today, and say, &quot;Okay, you're right. We'll dump the idea here and now&quot;&mdash;although, frankly, she should. However, I hope that she will at least go back to her Department and consider the matter further. I also hope that she will consider the huge damage that the proposed changes to UK UNESCO listings would do to our heritage and tourism industries at the very time when they seek a boost to help in the battle against recession.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/31">The preferred option suggested by PWC may work against the claims of sites such as Arbroath abbey, because of the seeming bias against more ecclesiastical sites. As I have tried to explain, Arbroath abbey is much more than that. We need to make that point now before the consultation is complete. We need to continue making that point and push forward the campaign to show Arbroath abbey's status in the history of Scotland and in the history of democracy throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.1/32">As I said at the outset, the campaign is broad based and has huge support in my constituency of Angus, and especially in my home town of Arbroath. However, it also has huge support around the world, from expatriate Scots and Caledonian societies and those with an interest in Scotland's history and future. Many of us are waiting to hear what the Minister will say. I ask her not to close her mind to my important points. Such sites are vitally important; they have played a number of roles in history and could do so again in boosting our tourism industry. I hope that none of the changes that she and her Secretary of State will consider making to the system will work against the inclusion of such sites. Whatever option she chooses, I hope that important UK sites will continue to be proposed for UNESCO certification.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.1/1">If the Minister is interested in the subject, I thoroughly recommend that she read &quot;The Stone of Destiny&quot;, written by one of those who removed the stone from Westminster abbey. It is a fascinating insight into the story behind it.</p>
