<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.187.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1245" speakername="Bob Spink" colnum="187"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h01.htm#50322h01_spnew11">
	<p pid=".187.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely telling point. The Minister has heard it and will no doubt address it. The social cost of closing post offices must be taken into account. In fact, I was saying before the interventions that we should not underestimate the social impact of post office closures and nor should we undervalue the social benefits that post offices bring to our community. If that means we need social funding, who cares whether we support our post offices at the expense of a couple of new politically correct Government quangos? We are not talking about a lot of money, and the post offices are much more useful and more valuable to our society than almost all the expensive quangos, put together, that the Government have created. The Government have seriously mixed up their priorities.</p>
	<p pid=".187.0/2">Post offices have a commercial dimension that we should not forget. They add to the viability of our shopping areas and community centres. They help newsagents, chemists, florists, grocers, cleaners and caf&eacute;s to attract customers and to provide the critical mass of small businesses required for a centre where people will congregate. As the main banks drive for ever-more profit by shamefully closing branches in villages and in smaller urban shopping areas and high streets, post offices are increasingly important. It is more essential than ever not to close them, yet the Government have not got the message; they simply are not listening.</p>
	<p pid=".187.0/3">UNITE, the National Federation of Royal Mail and BT Pensioners, has an active and socially extremely responsible local branch in south Essex. I met its representative and treasurer, Mr. Colin Melluish, last year and I hope to meet UNITE again soon to discuss the better deal for pensioners that it is promoting. It is doing that because it is a good and caring group. UNITE is seriously concerned that the post office network in the UK is failing to meet the needs of our most vulnerable citizens.</p>
	<p pid=".187.0/4">According to a 2004 MORI poll, &quot;Subpostmaster Income: The Impact of Changes to the Benefits Payment System&quot;, 44 per cent. of sub-postmasters have seen their income decrease in the past year and 43 per cent. are worried that their businesses will not have a future. The crisis in the rural post office network is such that 90 per cent. of those post offices are no longer commercially viable without Government subsidies, and many face closure. Independent research by Postwatch, another excellent organisation, shows that rural post office closures are having a profound effect on local communities. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">The research showed, as the hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> mentioned, that 75 per cent. of respondents felt their local post office was extremely important to them. More than half&mdash;about 60 per cent.&mdash;thought that it was essential to their way of life, and 91 per cent. agreed that it played</p>
	<p pid=".187.0/5" class="indent">&quot;an important role in their local community&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".187.0/6">Those figures increased among the elderly and those with disabilities that affect their mobility, which is hardly surprising.</p>
	<p pid=".187.0/7">The much-respected National Federation of Sub-Postmasters has published a hard-hitting manifesto urging the Government to pull up their socks in the run up to the general election. I expect another U-turn from the Government. If they are listening, they will certainly see the sense in that. The manifesto born out of the frustration of sub-postmasters all over the county lists a series of unfulfilled Government promises and warns that further inaction could mean the end of the post office network. The key demands include:</p>
	<p pid=".187.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Government must provide more funding to pay for the social and economic service provided by post offices. Government must take a leading role in ensuring that all major banks enable their customers to access their bank accounts at post offices.&quot;</p>

	<p pid=".190.0/1">With respect to that &pound;150 million of subsidy, does my hon. Friend agree with me and the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters that merely subsidising the income of sub-postmasters is only a short-term solution? As my hon. Friend has said, it takes us only to 2008. Should that money not be used, together with a change of Government policy, to recreate a new working environment for post offices so that they have a long-term future that will not require subsidy?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.192.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" speakername="David Drew" colnum="192"  time="09:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h01.htm#50322h01_spnew24">
	<p pid=".192.1/1">I will leave that as a statement from my hon. Friend, as I have no evidence one way or the other. He has made his point, and I am sure that he feels as strongly as I do as a constituency MP that the aim is to keep open as many post offices as possible.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/2">My story starts with the list produced some years ago by the Post Office to do with its designation of the branch network. It kindly referred to all its branches as urban or rural. Some of us would say that it could have referred to some as suburban, but the designation was made. When the list was produced, I had no real disagreements with the way in which branches were designated, except in one case, which was that of the Whiteshill post office.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/3">Whiteshill is a village. It looks like a village, it feels like a village, and the people who live there know that it is a village. However, the Post Office designated the post office as urban. They did so because, by pure chance, a sliver of the village abuts the Stroud urban area. On either side, there is countryside, but it happens to be a traditional ribbon development that has begun over time, by a house or two, to be encroached on by the urban area. I am thankful that that is all the encroachment that will remain as we will fight any planning applications, including rogue ones&mdash;I will say no more about them&mdash;that have tried to infill. We have managed to defend the village.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/4">One advantage of being designated as a rural post office is that rural subsidy applies, as the hon. Member for Castle Point mentioned. In Nympsfield, that led to the recovery of the village post office, which was lost but has reopened because of the subsidy. I hope that the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats will put it on the record that they will continue that subsidy. Although it could be used in other ways, it is a lifeline. The &pound;150 million a year is not chickenfeed; it keeps a lot of our post offices open. Notwithstanding the migration of benefits to different methods of payment, the subsidy must be continued, not just now, and not just for the next year or two, but into the future. We need a rebirth of that way of keeping post offices alive.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/5">When the original designations were made, I was told not to worry because they were merely designations. Then, network reinvention took place and all of a sudden an apparent slip of the pen became a crucial matter of how Post Office management considered a post office. Again, there was no immediate worry. When we looked at the first round of closures, only two were considered, followed by a third. They were Cam Woodfield, Cashes Green and Bath road in Stroud.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/6">I had two criteria by which I judged it right to fight on behalf of those post offices. First, I considered how the community responded. In all cases, there was hurt, upset and questioning about whether closure was right. It depended on whether there were alternatives, which were certainly considered. The second criterion is not openly talked about, but I will talk about it. It was the attitude of the postmaster or postmistress.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/7">The hon. Member for Castle Point, quite fairly, talked about the packages that were made available. I talked to postmasters and postmistresses across the network, and those who have decided to stay in the suburban network&mdash;most of Stroud is what I call semi-rural and is not truly urban&mdash;deserve the highest praise. They have continued to run those businesses, which we all know are not terribly profitable, and many have said that they are working for less than the minimum wage. They are providing a social service, but they wish to do so. They believe that to be their life's work, and it is right that central Government should support them.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/8">In each case deemed for closure, I checked and talked to the postmasters and, in one case, the postmistress. It was clear that it was difficult to run a viable business. It was wrong to stop them from getting the advantages of the packages. Maybe we could have taken matters forward in other ways, but I was clear and open with communities about the repercussions if we tried to keep a business going that would not only remain unviable but would become more so.</p>
	<p pid=".192.1/9">I point the finger at some communities, who want it both ways. They want the post office to remain open, but may not use it often. The Government can be blamed for the way in which they have moved through benefits changes&mdash;which are not the responsibility of the DTI but of the Department for Work and Pensions&mdash;but I have challenged people to go and get a post office card account. My wife and I have a post office card account for our child benefit, and it is not as difficult to have one as people tend to make out. If communities want to keep their post offices, it is important that they keep money coming through.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.200.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/880" speakername="Michael Fabricant" colnum="200"  time="10:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h01.htm#50322h01_spnew34">
	<p pid=".200.0/1">We have had a number of debates on the Post Office in the past few years, and one thing that characterises them is a sense of unanimity. There is a strong feeling among MPs of all parties, who, after all, are elected to represent their constituents, that the post office system has tremendous value. We recognise that post offices exist not just to sell stamps; they also play a valuable role in our communities. Debates on this subject are pleasant because, although we might have specific differences about how to maintain the post office network, we all agree that it has huge value.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/2">It is a great pleasure to me that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1245" name="Bob Spink">my hon. Friend the Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> has secured the debate, and I congratulate him on that. He and I, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/878" name="Nigel Evans">my hon. Friend the Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>, who was present earlier, were elected to the House at the same time, in 1992. We are still here&mdash;more or less.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/3">The debate has been interesting. All Members, regardless of political party, care about <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">the Post Office. The hon. Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> pointed out the importance of the Post Office brand, and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/760" name="Malcolm Bruce">the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> said, that brand is not being utilised enough. I think we all agree on that. The Post Office brand is recognised and respected, and it is regarded as having great integrity. The BBC used its brand to enable it to operate in a wider range of areas, which has cross-subsidised its programme making, but the Post Office has decided not to use other services as a way of keeping post offices viable, either because of externally applied restriction or because of its own restrictions.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/4">The hon. Member for Gordon raised a fascinating point: he explained how, historically, there are differences between post offices that had always been sub-post offices and those that were originally Crown post offices. What does it matter if they are now sub-post offices and they want to offer certain services, such as providing passport applications? Why should they be disallowed from doing so? I have no idea. Can the Minister answer that? Have the Government put that restriction in place, or, as I suspect, has the Post Office done so? Either way, will the Government intervene to ensure that all post offices are able to offer a large number of services, because that is what will keep them viable?</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1271" name="David Taylor">The hon. Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> spoke about the fact that some people find it difficult to get to their post office. With regard to the urban reinvention programme, the Post Office said that it would not close post offices more than one mile distant. The Post Office also claimed that it would take into account natural obstacles, but that simply does not seem to be the case. We have heard time and again, not only in this debate but in debates in the main Chamber, about areas where elderly people live and where there are mountain ranges, canals or torrential rivers&mdash;I exaggerate slightly, but I am making my point&mdash;and the Post Office says, &quot;Well, there are two post offices within a mile of each other, so one of them can close,&quot; even though, in practice, the other is inaccessible. That is wrong, and it must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/6">The Government cannot get off lightly, because they have played their part. We heard from the Minister today that 4 million post office users are now account holders, but not all of them wanted to be. Many elderly people have difficulty in operating cash cards. Many have difficulty in remembering their personal identification number&mdash;as do I. Many, and many disabled people, too, find it difficult to enter their PIN number on the little keypads that are provided; they really are quite small. For understandable reasons, the banks are now introducing chip and PIN, but lots of people have problems in operating keypads, when they go to the gas station to buy petrol, for instance. That is an important issue.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/7">The Government are spending an extraordinary amount of money to try to persuade people to give up their cash books. Some &pound;10.5 million of taxpayers' money is being spent to persuade benefit claimants to abandon their order books in favour of direct payment; that figure has been obtained by the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. That is equivalent to the taxpayer spending &pound;70 per benefit claimant. Of course, the direct payment facility should be available at post offices for people who have bank accounts, or who do not like dealing in cash; it was initiated by a Conservative Government, and I applaud new Labour for continuing with the programme. However, it is wrong to do that in a way that prevents people who wish to keep their benefit books from doing so, particularly as those people are vulnerable, and find using such benefit books difficult enough.</p>
	<p pid=".200.0/8">In this debate, and in others, we have heard of the many campaigns that Members have run to keep their post offices open. Postwatch has played its part. It may not have replied to the Member for Stroud, but it is generally quite proactive. As I mentioned in an intervention, it opposed 73 closure proposals in the west midlands but only 15 were withdrawn. When there is unanimous opposition to certain post office closures among local authorities, local communities, Members of Parliament, and Postwatch, and yet the Post Office still closes those post offices, one has to wonder whether it is completely deaf. Does it not recognise that the Post Office, as well as the Government, has a duty of care in this area?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.204.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1263" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Trade and Industry"  colnum="204"  time="10:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h01.htm#50322h01_spmin1">
	<p pid=".204.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1245" name="Bob Spink">the hon. Member for Castle Point (Bob Spink)</phrase> on securing today's debate. He has been assiduous in voicing local concerns on behalf of his constituents about Post Office Ltd's urban reinvention programme proposals for his constituency. I add my congratulations to him and his colleagues on the efforts that they have made on behalf of their local community. I was pleased to hear him say that one of the post offices will reopen. I congratulate him on that.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/2">Since I became the Minister with responsibility for postal services in September 2004, I have examined the whole area of postal services with great interest. Some people have accused me of being a masochist in accepting that responsibility, given the nature of the problem that we face in relation to a trusted service. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/865" name="David Drew">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud (Mr. Drew)</phrase> is correct in saying that despite all the issues relating to the Royal Mail and the Post Office, people still trust them as brand names.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/3">The hon. Member for Castle Point spelt out his views clearly and fully. That is why I questioned him on subsidy. He spoke strongly about the social aspects of post offices and the importance of maintaining subsidies. I will return to issues relating to his constituency a little later if I have the time to go through them in great detail and if he allows me to do so.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/4">Today's debate has been important. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/880" name="Michael Fabricant">the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant)</phrase> that what tends to happen in situations such as those that we are discussing, particularly with a possible general election around the corner, is that the issues become politically emotive as we all knocks spots off each other in determining who was responsible for things. I will return to some of those issues.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/5">I agree that all of us, when we get down to the detail, want a viable post office network, and we want the Royal Mail to survive and develop. We need to try to find ways of examining the issues together. I was grateful for some of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/760" name="Malcolm Bruce">the suggestions that the hon. Member for Gordon (Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> made. We are at the next crucial stage. The first plan for Royal Mail recovery was in 1999, and it concludes this year. We need to consider what the next plan will entail. Remarks were made about the rural subsidy. What is interesting is that the time frame has given us the opportunity to see what local communities want to do about the range of services that post offices should provide. Some innovative ideas have come from the pilots, which could contribute to a future plan.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/6">The post office network is relevant to every Member of Parliament. We all share concerns about the future provision of post office services in our constituencies. I assure hon. Members that the Government are fully committed to maintaining a viable nationwide network of post offices. The truth is that there have been decades of underinvestment, and the business was in a spiral of decline. If the network is to survive and thrive, it needs to change significantly. The Government want a post office network that can prosper on the needs of today and the future, not those of 20 or 30 years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/7">Because the Government have grasped the nettle and taken the necessary steps to restructure and revitalise the Post Office, the future of the network has rightly become an issue of national debate. We all share concern for the future provision of post office services in our constituencies, and we want to maintain a viable network. Everyone involved faces a massive challenge. I pay tribute to those local communities and people who have voiced their concerns about post office closures. However, I take the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud made about the fact that some people have unfortunately joined the campaign after the horse has bolted, so to speak, given the massive problems that the network was facing.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/8">The starting point for Government policy on the post office network was the performance and innovation unit's report of 2000, &quot;Modernising the Post Office Network&quot;. The Prime Minister called for that report in 1999, because it was clear, following decades of decline and zero investment, that dramatic action had to be taken to get the business on track. We set about producing policies that would help secure a future for the post office network, which was something that the previous Government failed to do.</p>
	<p pid=".204.0/9">I was interested to hear the Opposition say what they would do if they ever return to power. I would ask why they did not do those things when they had the opportunity during their previous reign.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.205.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1263" speakername="Gerry Sutcliffe" colnum="205"  time="10:47:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h01.htm#50322h01_spnew40">
	<p pid=".205.1/1">That was a good try, but not an effective enough one, because closures were already taking place during the Conservative reign, as hon. Members have pointed out. If we consider the problem honestly, we find that it has much to do with the relationship between the Royal Mail and the Government. They have basically been at arm's length since 1967. On other agencies using the Royal Mail and post offices, lots of good work could have been done to ensure that Post Office Ltd played an integral role in community regeneration, especially if we consider the money that the previous Government invested in regeneration and what this Government have done. There could have and should have been an opportunity to involve post offices and other services in such regeneration. That did not happen, and we all stand to blame for that.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/2">The PIU report showed quite starkly that the network of post offices had not kept pace with the changing needs of its customers. Too often, post offices had become dingy and shabby through lack of investment and were losing business. The Post Office faces an enormous challenge. In recent years, Post Office Ltd has incurred substantial losses: &pound;163 million before exceptional items in 2001&ndash;02, &pound;194 million in 2002&ndash;03, and &pound;97 million in 2003&ndash;04. Some 96 per cent. of the nation's post offices are run by sub-postmasters&mdash;private business people who have invested not only their own money into their businesses but a great amount of care and effort into helping the post office network to achieve its high status.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/3">I pay tribute to the National Federation of Sub-Postmasters. I meet the federation regularly and have discussed its manifesto, which contains many interesting ideas, although, as the federation acknowledges, they are uncosted. It is run by people who are committed to the network, as hon. Members have said. It is vital that we listen to the federation and to people who have invested many years of their life in the network.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/4">It was right that Post Office Ltd gave those people who wanted to get out the opportunity to do so through the payments that were made. Some people were put under a great deal of pressure over some decisions. I shall return to the example that my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud raised from his constituency, because I am concerned if people have been put under the pressure that he described. I will write to him with details about the two post offices that he mentioned and will look at the issue of undue pressure being put on people.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/5">The post office network has been contracting since the 1960s. The previous Government presided over 3,500 closures between 1979 and 1997, but in all that time produced no policy on how to structure the network and ensure that it would remain relevant in the 21st century. There have been reductions in post office usage for all sorts of reasons. The absence of investment by the previous Government was an important one. However, major advances in technology, greater mobility, and changes in shopping and financial habits mean that a large proportion of our constituents simply do not use post offices as they used to and that custom has sharply reduced. That trend is not a matter of the Government or some unseen market force acting against the interests of the Post Office and its customers; rather, it is about ordinary people&mdash;our constituents&mdash;making choices.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/6">The decline in transaction volumes has not been caused just by the changes in benefit payment arrangements that have recently been completed. The decline started well before the move to direct payment and applies not only to benefit payments but to a much wider range of services, including Girobank and National Savings transactions, telephone bill payments and postal orders.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/7">As the recent National Audit Office report noted, the change is not a uniquely British phenomenon. Research commissioned by Postcomm, the regulator for postal services, has noted that people in other countries increasingly access services electronically over the telephone and through the internet. In response, most countries have been remodelling their networks, usually by closing the smallest or least profitable offices and converting directly run offices to agency offices. In Germany, for instance, the number of post office branches has been reduced drastically, from 30,000 to 13,000. In Britain, other networks, such as those of the retail banks, have also been scaled back. Like them, the post office network needs to adapt to changes in people's preferences and new ways of doing business. Such external changes pose big challenges to the network of post offices, which have to be addressed not ducked. That is what the Government have done and it creates the emotion that we have seen.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/8">Postwatch has done a tremendous job of creating a picture for consumers, through its response to Post Office Ltd's plans. That was a deliberate plan by the Government, in order to create a balance, so that a number of things could be dealt with. Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd were losing money, and the Government set them targets: to turn the situation round, to stop those loses, to maintain a viable network, and to ensure that there were no unplanned closures. The difficulty would have been an acceleration in those closures, creating gaps, which would not have put us in the position of having post offices within a mile of one that had closed.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/9">Postmaster preference, Postwatch operating on behalf of the consumer, and Post Office Ltd were involved in trying to create a viable network. Clearly, there have been difficulties. Since becoming the Minister with responsibility for postal services in September 2004, I have tried to ensure that hon. Members in all parts of the House have had the opportunity to meet Post Office Ltd directly. I have done that through arranging surgeries in the House on Thursdays with senior management of Post Office Ltd, so that hon. Members can at least have face-to-face discussions about the concerns that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/10">The Government are listening. When we look at the new plan, we shall have to consider the role of Postwatch and Postcomm, the regulator. Postcomm is looking at a survey of how the urban reinvention programme has affected certain areas. If gaps appear, we shall have to ensure that they are filled.</p>
	<p pid=".205.1/11">We are debating a difficult issue to which I am we shall return, notwithstanding what happens in the general election. Hon. Members have shown great dedication in dealing with the issue. If we take party politics out of the debate, as I am sure we will after the election, and consider the good ideas that are around, I am sure that we can restore and develop our constituents' confidence in Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd. That way, we can ensure that our constituents understand what has happened and what we all agree is the need for change, and that the change is as painless as possible for them. If we do that, I am sure that confidence will return.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.210.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" speakername="John Randall" colnum="210"  time="11:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h02.htm#50322h02_spnew3">
	<p pid=".210.2/1">Although the Minister claims that plane-spotting would be an amply good pastime for me, one of my constituents did that, which did not help his summer holidays that year. Having been a bird watcher, I know the perils of walking around the Balkan countries with a pair of binoculars around my neck.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/2">More seriously, I return to existing conditions in Serbia. Before the civil war, Serbia was not exactly at the forefront of economic success. It was doing quite well years ago when I was a student there, but it fell behind under successive Governments. In 1990, the income per capita was $2,850; now it is only a few hundred dollars. We can see what has happened to a large proportion of the population: unemployment is 38 per cent. and rising, and sadly, industrial production is down 50 per cent. compared with 1989.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/3">I understand, and I know that the Minister will repeat, the insistence on the bringing to trial in The Hague of Mladic and Karadzic, and I know from I speaking to members of the Government in Serbia that they are keen on that too. All I can say is that I would like to know whether the British Government or our allies&mdash;NATO or whatever&mdash;have firm evidence of where those people are. If I thought that the authorities had been given firm evidence and were unwilling to help, I would have less sympathy for them.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/4">I remain open on that issue, which I know is very big in the country. The Serbs feel that they were not granted the same rights as the Iraqi people to try those who caused severe problems&mdash;problems is an understatement. The issue gets to the people there. They saw a further such example when there was no international tribunal in The Hague, or anywhere else, for the criminals who caused all the difficulties in Iraq.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/5">I know that this is a big problem, but I hope that the British Government and others are not saying, &quot;We want those people,&quot; if they have firm intelligence. If they can offer help on the ground with intelligence, I hope they are doing so. If they are not being helped by the authorities, I would certainly have a deal less sympathy for what is going on there.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/6">That said, there is a severe humanitarian problem in Serbia and&mdash;albeit less so&mdash;in Montenegro. Of course, Kosovo is included in that, and it is sad that a number of people come to my surgeries in fear of returning to Kosovo because of action by the Kosovo Liberation Army. They feel that the army is still in control despite international efforts.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/7">Kosovo is not the wonderful idyllic state that perhaps we sometimes want to think it is following our intervention there. In many ways, I presume, the indictment of the former Prime Minister of Kosovo reflects, without stirring up too many other problems, our obsession with Irish republicans. It becomes difficult to accept that they have given up military and criminal action, and we have seen in recent months that they have not given up what they say they have given up. Kosovo is like that, only more so.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/8">A mere Back Bencher can possibly do a service by raising a matter continually. I cannot do the grand politics of the region, but I can raise the humanitarian problems that exist. This country was instrumental in making things worse by the bombing, however well intentioned the Government and the majority of people in this country&mdash;although I happened not to be one of them&mdash;thought the intervention would be. What worries me is the huge number of refugees living in Serbia: there are internally displaced people living in appalling conditions, but they are not the only ones who are important. Because of the economic state of the country, there is incredible poverty away from the major cities.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/9">One of the problems is that people such as me tend to go to Belgrade when we visit and we see a caf&eacute; society that is still almost blossoming. It is a pleasant place, there is affluence and the shops are full of items, but if one goes a few miles away to villages that were never really developed anyway, one is back in an era that many people would be shocked to see in Europe today.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/10">Indeed, I heard a report from someone who recently visited a hospital in Zemun, which is just outside Belgrade, on the other side of the river. The last of that hospital's cookers had packed up, so patients could not have any hot meals and it was down to a couple of volunteers to keep things going. However, Zemun is a major conurbation; it is really part of Belgrade. That that should happen anywhere in Europe&mdash;virtually in the capital city of that country&mdash;is a disgrace and we must do whatever we can to help.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/11">Pensions and pensioners are one of the biggest problems. There have been masses of suicides because elderly folk cannot afford medication or, in many cases, food. I do not think that I am exaggerating: I really do think that there is a humanitarian disaster there, and we must do something. We owe it to those people not only because they are in Europe, so we should be doing something anyway, but because of the history&mdash;not just the recent history&mdash;and the fact that the Serbs have been our strong allies in the past.</p>
	<p pid=".210.2/12">Incredibly, the Serbs still have great respect for the British. This is the moment to show that we can and we shall help them in their hour of need&mdash;not just paternalistically by giving aid, but by treating them as equal partners. The future of that area lies in ensuring that it integrates within the European family. That is some way off, but we must give those countries hope.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.212.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1083" speakername="Denis MacShane" speakeroffice="The Minister for Europe"  colnum="212"  time="11:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h02.htm#50322h02_spmin1">
	<p pid=".212.0/1">I am genuinely grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1180" name="John Randall">the hon. Member for Uxbridge (Mr. Randall)</phrase> for introducing the debate, because it allows the Government to place on the record in the House our current thinking on the western Balkans. I pay sincere tribute to him, as he has consistently brought to the House&mdash;in the form of parliamentary questions, oral questions, Adjournment debates and interventions in broader European debates&mdash;the issues of the western Balkans in general and of Serbia, to which he is greatly attached, in particular. He has done so very moderately, avoiding some of the polemic to which the region has given rise.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/2">I entirely take the hon. Gentleman's point that the people of Serbia deserve a better deal, if not a new deal. For me, Belgrade is the natural capital of the western Balkans. The people of Serbia are cultivated, intelligent and skilled, and in every way have the potential to deliver enormous benefits to the European economy. No Government more than this one would want to see Serbia as anything other than a full member of the European family of nations. I welcome President Marovic's return visit here; his political business was done on his previous visit a couple of weeks ago. I am in regular and, I hope, friendly contact with other leaders in Belgrade, but it would be helpful if all Serbian elected politicians and leaders in Belgrade spoke with one voice on behalf of the Serb people.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/3">It would also be helpful if Serbia moved forward with economic reconstruction. I refer hon. Members to the interesting article in today's <i>Financial Times</i> about the problem of investing in Serbia and, in particular, the difficulty of ensuring that land is available for investment. According to the <i>Financial Times</i>, great swathes of land are still held under state control, with no liberalisation of land ownership. That results in a paradox: Serbia is one of the poorest countries of Europe, but its housing is among the most expensive. So, there is much that the Serbs themselves can do. I have also had meetings with leading British multinationals to urge them to invest in Serbia and the region. For example, I would like to see direct, low-cost flights to Serbia, as we now have to Croatia. That would be a good step forward.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/4">Unfortunately, there is the fundamental problem of coming to terms with what happened in the 1990s. The entire elected leadership must clearly say, urbi et orbi, that the indicted war criminals&mdash;not just the fugitives Karadzic and Mladic, but the generals whose whereabouts are known&mdash;must go to The Hague. We welcome some of the transfers, but I would like 2005 to be the year in which there is a real effort in Serbia, including the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina, to bring to an end the problem of sending indicted generals and leaders to The Hague.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/5">One might wish that the tribunal process was different, but we cannot rewrite history. Honourable men have gone there, including Ramush Haradinaj, the Prime Minister of Kosovo, who immediately accepted his responsibilities when he was indicted and flew to The Hague without fuss. Others might care to follow his example. We would like 2005 to be the year when we make clear and definite progress in the western Balkans.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/6">It is nearly two decades since Slobodan Milosevic made his infamous speech in Kosovo Polje. We all remember with shame the inability of European Governments in the early 1990s to rise to the challenge of stopping the murderous nationalism that was unleashed in that beautiful part of our common European home.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/7">On Sunday, I took my children to see the film &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;, and I know how often you have raised the issue of human rights in Zimbabwe, Mr. Deputy Speaker. It was horrifying to be reminded of how, 11 years ago, a British Government colluded with other European Governments and the United States to prevent the United Nations from backing its forces in Rwanda to stop the genocide. I recommend that all Members of the House take their children to see &quot;Hotel Rwanda&quot;.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/8">That happened in 1994, but a year later there was a genocidal attack on European citizens, when 8,000 were killed in cold blood at Srebrenica. They were killed because, like the Jews and Roma in the Nazi era, they belonged to the wrong religion or the wrong community. We all thought that the scapegoating of Jews and Gypsies had stopped in 1945. Well, Srebrenica proved us wrong. The United States had to intervene to impose the Dayton settlement, but four years later we saw waves of asylum seekers&mdash;I am sure that all Members of the House have had them in their constituency surgeries&mdash;fleeing Kosovo because of the brutality there. By then, at least, Britain had a new Government, who were not prepared to sit on their hands. We had decisive British leadership to put together a coalition that was not frightened to use force to deal with tyranny and terror.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/9">That is history&mdash;the last century. Today, let us try to look forward, not back. This year, we have a chance to close the chapter on that lost decade and, in particular, to send a message to the men and women of Serbia that their talents and skills deserve a full future in a Serbia fully in Europe.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/10">The same is true for Croatia. I regret that it was not possible last week for Croatia to begin talks on accession to the European Union. In my view, it is question of when, not if, a Croatian Minister sits in the European Council and Croatian MEPs take their place in the European Parliament at Strasbourg. Britain wants Croatia in the EU.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/11">When I was made a Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister four years ago, one of the first visits I undertook was to Zagreb. I asked the then Croatian Government to take immediate action to deal with the case of Ante Gotovina, the Croatian commander accused of serious war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague. Alas, my entreaties fell on deaf ears, and they have done so every year since.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/12">For four years, I have been repeating that message, and so have Ministers from other major European Governments. Alas, too many agents and officers in the Croatian state apparatus defied the authority of the elected Government and, far from co-operating in persuading Gotovina to report to the Hague, they colluded with him in evading both his and Croatia's responsibilities under the international rule of law. No one can join the EU on the basis of refusing to accept their responsibilities under the international rule of law.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/13">Let me make this appeal through the House of Commons to General Gotovina. An officer of any rank in the army of any democratic state must accept the authority of the elected Government. An officer of any rank in the British Army, the American army or any European army who is charged with any crime in connection with his command has to answer to the Government.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/14">The patriotic and honourable course for General Gotovina is to stop holding the Croatian nation to ransom and to report to The Hague. He will face a fair trial, his living conditions will be good and he will have full legal representation. If he surrenders voluntarily now, there is even the possibility of bail, although I must emphasise that that is a matter for the tribunal, not for any Government, and nor is it a question of negotiation between the tribunal and the accused. As a soldier, General Gotovina should do his last great patriotic duty by going to The Hague. I urge him to open the door to Croatia joining the EU by reporting to the international tribunal.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/15">The same goes for Messrs. Mladic and Karadzic. We have sought to work with Serb authorities, but, in the end, it is Serbs who can track down and capture a person wanted in Serbia or the region of Serbian nationality. It is up to the Church and the communities to understand that Serbia's route to Europe lies through The Hague. We will continue to offer co-operation and officials, including from the Ministry of Defence, are seeking to work with the Serbian Government. The British Government want Serbia on the road to Europe, but not at the price of sweeping under the carpet the terrible crimes committed at Srebrenica 10 years ago.</p>
	<p pid=".212.0/16">The hon. Member for Uxbridge mentioned Macedonia, and I understand that the position is difficult, but he is slightly wrong, as the United Nations, NATO and other international bodies use the name attributed to Macedonia when it split from the former Yugoslavia more than a decade ago. This is a passionate issue in Macedonia and in northern Greece. In Macedonian northern Greece, 2.5 million Greeks see themselves as Macedonian. The name, for them, is a passionate issue. I am not a Solomon in the House of Commons or the Foreign Office to decide between Skopje and Athens. I know that talks are going on. In English, we say that a rose by any other name smells as sweet. I do not know whether that is a proverb in Greece or in Macedonia, but I urge Athens and Skopje to try to find a solution to the problem.</p>

	<p pid=".220.2/1">I am delighted to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1003" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase>. I shall not follow his path of highlighting individual cases; I merely want to speak to the principal issue that claims handlers should be regulated, not self-regulated.</p>
	<p pid=".220.2/2">This is an ideal time for the Department for Constitutional Affairs to act. We have already heard about the Clementi review. I note with interest the comments made by the Lord Chancellor yesterday, and I want an assurance from the Minister that claims handlers will not fall outside the net. They are cowboys: they are making false claims, raising false expectations, taking money out of people's pockets who cannot afford it, and on many occasions leaving people in debt. Enough is enough.</p>
	<p pid=".220.2/3">The Minister knows well about those complaints. He told the House not long ago that claims handlers were in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1093" name="John Mann">the last chance saloon. My hon. Friend the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> and I went to see the Lord Chancellor earlier this month, and I am delighted that the Lord Chancellor has taken up the opportunity to go to the heart of the Nottinghamshire coalfield to Thoresby miners welfare this Friday&mdash;Good Friday, a public holiday&mdash;to talk directly to the people involved. The claimants will talk with strong voices about the way in which scams have operated on them.</p>
	<p pid=".220.2/4">The time has come to act, and we cannot delay any longer. I hope that the Minister will be impressed by today's debate. I am sure that the Lord Chancellor will be impressed by the voices of men and women in Nottinghamshire who have been quite bluntly given false hopes and expectations. The problem is simply this: people in coalfield areas are honest and hard working. Many of them have given their health and, in many cases, their lives working down the pits to keep us warm. Although there have been difficulties, the two coal health schemes have been enormously important in north Nottinghamshire. My hon. Friend the Member for North Durham quoted figures for his area; in Nottinghamshire, the two schemes together have brought in &pound;265 million to former miners because of injuries to their health. Of that &pound;265 million, however, a significant amount is simply being siphoned off.</p>
	<p pid=".220.2/5">My hon. Friend talked about claims handlers, and one body of claims handlers is the trade unions. I have talked to a variety of trade unions in the coal sector: the National Union of Mineworkers, the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers, the deputies' union, and the British Association of Colliery Management&mdash;Technical, Energy and Administrative Management, the managers' union. All of them make some charge for handling coal health claims.</p>
	<p pid=".220.2/6">The BACM makes a small charge in lieu of trade union membership. I do not object to that. It is right that if a trade union operates for somebody outside the membership, it should charge a membership fee. I fundamentally object to companies such as Vendside, which is connected to the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, in effect double charging. Let us be clear that with coal health claims the union gets its fees from the Government, and they are significant and substantial fees. I am at a loss to know why any trade union should be ripping off members and former members by double charging and taking a fee out of the compensation awarded to miners. That is wrong, it must stop, and those bodies, which are about fraternity, ought to act more sensibly.</p>

	<p pid=".222.4/1">I would wholeheartedly endorse that. The problem is that people feel that once they have signed a piece of paper they are legally bound. The solicitors who are given the work by the claims handlers write and tell the individuals, and take a dual instruction&mdash;one from the claims handler and another from the claimant. I have letters, received in the past week, from the largest firm of solicitors when it comes to outstanding claims, Beresfords, warning people of the danger of not paying money to claims handlers. That is a routine feature of the system.</p>
	<p pid=".222.4/2">Let me explain how claims handlers go about their business. I can give a good example: only two weeks ago, I was on the Larwood estate in my constituency. A widow aged 92 had received a knock on the door. A claims handler had gone to a pensioner's bungalow&mdash;it would be a good bet in Worksop that a miner or a deceased miner would be related to the person living there&mdash;and asked: &quot;Has anyone in the household or any of your relatives worked in the mining industry since 1954? There's money due to you and we can get it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid=".222.4/3">In the miners' welfare clubs, it is the same. I suspect that some miners' welfare clubs were paid to put leaflets out. Men, some of whom have retired, and widows of men who may have died many years ago were told that they could get some money at no risk to themselves. The companies said that they would do the work and that those people need do nothing. It seems perfectly reasonable, on the face of it, that there should be a payment for the work that has been done.</p>
	<p pid=".222.4/4">I have referred more than 700 cases to the Law Society in which solicitors were negligent about advising that, with this scheme, uniquely, the defendant had conceded the costs and they would be paid in full.</p>

	<p pid=".233.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1003" name="Kevan Jones">my hon. Friend the Member for North Durham (Mr. Jones)</phrase> on securing this good and important debate. I particularly thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1282" name="Paddy Tipping">my hon. Friends the Members for Sherwood (Paddy Tipping)</phrase>, for Bassetlaw (John Mann) and for Barnsley, West and Penistone (Mr. Clapham) for their powerful and passionate contributions.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/2">The debate is, in effect, about justice&mdash;social justice. It is about what all of us in this Room went into politics to do: assist people who are vulnerable and who cannot speak up for themselves. Therefore, it is most definitely about the role of our solicitors in society, and the claims management industry that has grown up over the past few years. Central to that discussion is the subject of regulation, particularly of our solicitors.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/3">We expect the highest standards of our solicitors and lawyers; on the whole, they are respected across the world, but it is the practice that we are debating today that goes furthest towards undermining that reputation. That is why the Government made the decision, which they announced yesterday, to accept Sir David Clementi's recommendation on the regulation of solicitors: that is, to separate their representative function&mdash;their function as a trade union of solicitors&mdash;and their regulatory function. It is precisely because of some of the frustrations that we have heard about this afternoon that that decision had to be taken. There is an issue about how our solicitors are regulated, notwithstanding the work that the Law Society has done and is doing on the issue. I will come back to that.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/4">The sharp and wicked practices in the claims management sector must stop. My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood reminded me in the House a few months ago that the sector was in the last chance saloon; the saloon door is now closed. The Government are moving to regulate that area. It really is outrageous what some of our vulnerable constituents have had to experience.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/5">Obviously, I do not represent a former coal mining area, and particular issues arise in those constituencies. However, what my hon. Friends and I share is the fact that we represent some of the poorest constituencies in this country&mdash;the constituencies that come high up in the index of deprivation, the constituencies where over 50 or 70 per cent. of children are on free school meals. We understand what that means for those people. We understand the incomes that they have, and we understand what it means when someone knocks on the door, advertises in the newspaper or appears on television, wearing a suit, and says, &quot;Look, I can provide this service.&quot; We understand what it means to those very hard working people who take on face value what professionals claim to offer before moving on to exploit people.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/6">When we talked about the issue in the past, we tended to assume that claims handling is a dry, technical or legal issue, and we heard in this debate that it is far from that. It is not about legalese; it is about the everyday lives of some of the most vulnerable people in this country, especially in former mining areas in the north, and in the Welsh valleys and other areas.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/7">This issue is about access to justice. It is about ensuring that people have honest, accurate and effective legal support that does not raise expectations but is fully committed when a client has a genuinely good case. People must have proper routes to redress, where redress is required, and compensation must be targeted on those with genuine cases who deserve the full weight of our support. The Government's position on this issue is clear. We need to tackle the practices that help to encourage false expectations of compensation, and to improve effectiveness and efficiency for people who have a genuine claim.</p>
	<p pid=".233.0/8">Let me explain why some of the practices of claims management companies have been unacceptable. Their methods of dealing with potential clients are often inexcusable. Some of them use the hard sell, putting the squeeze on people even if there is little chance of them receiving compensation. Their practices are even worse because of the kinds of people they approach&mdash;ordinary working miners and former miners, and people who work in the textile industry and factories. They are vulnerable people who expect more from lawyers, and from people who operate with lawyers and the insurance industry. The law can seem like a minefield, and it is the job of legal professionals to help people plot their way through it. At its best, the legal system in our country is the finest in the world, providing honest, transparent and expert advice. However, claims companies have failed to live up to that standard. Many of them earn money by using complex systems of referral fees and charges, and, ultimately, the losing party picks up the cost.</p>

However, although I do not want to mix metaphors too much, unfortunately, in many cases, the horse has already bolted. There are many cases throughout the country&mdash;thousands we suspect, but we do not know precisely how many&mdash;where people have already had the money taken from them. That is a serious problem, and changing the legislation now will not affect those cases. Will the Minister look into how we can establish the precise level of this problem in our country?

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2005-03-22.240.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1212" speakername="Malcolm Savidge" colnum="240"  time="15:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200405/cmhansrd/cm050322/halltext/50322h04.htm#50322h04_spnew6">
	<p pid=".240.0/1">I am sorry, but I am short of time.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/2">The greatest immediate threat is from nuclear weapons. The high-level panel indicated that there is a real possibility of terrorists producing a simple gun-type nuclear device, whereby the combination of two amounts of highly enriched uranium could produce a bomb roughly similar to that which the South African Government produced during the apartheid era. The panel suggests that the use of such a weapon in a major city could lead to the deaths of anything from tens of thousands of people to more than one million.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/3">One need only imagine the scenario of, say, a suicide bomber in a van in London taking out the whole of Westminster, Whitehall and Buckingham palace. If they chose the state opening, for instance, they would destroy not only the buildings, but the people, which would decapitate the state. One can picture similar scenarios in different capitals. An attack in Washington during the State of the Union address could take out the Executive, the Congress and the judiciary. One can repeat that example for various capitals, whether of dictatorships or democracies. Such an attack could devastate a country and cause panic worldwide. Modern capitals cannot ban vehicles from their centre, so it is therefore in the common interest of all countries, of whatever type, that we co-operate to reduce that threat.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/4">It is important that we reduce proliferation both of nuclear materials and among states and non-state actors. The high-level panel report indicates that the nuclear non-proliferation treaty has enjoyed considerable success, with only eight definite nuclear weapons states&mdash;with the possible addition of North Korea&mdash;over 40 years, as compared with the much higher number that most experts predicted beforehand.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/5">However, the &quot;atoms for peace&quot; strategy, as Eisenhower put it, has had problems. Civil nuclear energy and military production were assumed to be completely separate, but we now know that they can have considerable dual use. We must therefore beware of the fact that the nuclear power industry produces not only materials that terrorists could use, but targets that they could attack.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/6">The report also indicates that as many as 40 of the 60 states that now have nuclear power are suspected of being able to produce nuclear weapons fairly rapidly. It warns of the risk of a cascade of proliferation. We must therefore recognise the basic risks in the nuclear power industry. However, on the assumption that it will continue to expand, we must certainly try to reduce reprocessing and enrichment, ensure the use of low-enriched uranium rather than highly-enriched uranium, enforce the additional protocol and increase security in the ways discussed at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference that the Government hosted in London last week.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/7">We must also have the utmost control. It is not satisfactory that Sellafield cannot account for significant quantities of weapons-grade material, not only because of the risk of material that is not being properly checked being passed to terrorists: how can we answer if a country such as Iran claims that it cannot account for significant amounts of such material? Will we find that acceptable?</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/8">I repeat the appeal that Senator Sam Nunn made when he spoke at the conference and here in Parliament: when the UK is to try to persuade the G8 to deal with the problems of climate change and global poverty, we should also insist that we fulfil the promises made at the G8 meeting in Canada to give proper financial support to the threat reduction programme of decommissioning. That is vital in and of itself, but it is important also because not fulfilling past pledges gives little meaning to the commitments that we make at future G8 meetings. Furthermore, the four issues of poverty, climate, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism are crucially interlinked as we try to build a safer world.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/9">The report makes many other constructive suggestions, which I shall not go into because of time and because some were covered in our debate on the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, but I repeat the one major claim made on the nuclear weapons states. We should not abandon the 13 steps that were agreed at the NPT review conference in 2000 and we should give evidence of good faith as to our commitments, including those under article 6, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1236" name="Llew Smith">my hon. Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Llew Smith)</phrase> indicated.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/10">The report comments on the A. Q. Khan threat of black market distribution of such materials and suggests that the proliferation security initiative deserves support in that respect. The only caution that one should offer is to be wary of precipitate military action, because that can obviously be dangerous, in which context it is correct that the world community is thinking of diplomacy to address the difficult situations with Iran and North Korea.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/11">We should also not forget that there are worse dangers than nuclear terrorism, such as regional nuclear war. Only two or three years ago, India and Pakistan faced terrible risks. There was an acute danger at that time, and we should give our fullest support to the leaderships of both countries, including the past and present Government of India, in their work in the peace process. I am sure that they would say that a number of other countries, especially the US and the UK, played a crucial, positive role in helping to defuse that dangerous situation. However, we must face the fact that if there is more proliferation, further risks of regional war may increase.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/12">There is also the risk of accidental nuclear war. It is surely insane that, this long after the end of the cold war, there are thousands of nuclear weapons, exceeding any possible rational defence or deterrence requirement of any country involved. It is even more insane that so many weapons are on hair-trigger alert. The United Kingdom has set an example by de-alerting, and we should urge other nuclear weapons states to follow it.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/13">I stress the views in the report of the high-level panel, but one cannot ignore the fact that there are different views abroad in the world today. There are influential voices in the United States&mdash;neo-conservatives and other hawks&mdash;who, in their most extreme version, take a view of US national sovereignty that opposes international treaties, arms control and the United Nations. Such commentators take the view that military might rather than common security should be the basis of defence and that aggression should take preference over diplomacy. Also, they talk of pre-emptive and preventative war. The Project for the New American Century talks of seeking US military dominance throughout the century. There are also plans for new nuclear weapons, and the military-industrial complex seems to be even more powerful than when General Eisenhower coined the phrase.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/14">Such voices give frighteningly different visions from that espoused by George Bush senior of a new world order. Indeed, I would suggest that such views are very different from the mainstream tradition of both the Democratic and Republican parties. If such counsels prevail, we will surely increase rather than reduce the risks we face, and we may even face the risk of global nuclear war, whether before or after the end of the century, which could endanger humanity as a whole.</p>
	<p pid=".240.0/15">In a world where nuclear weapons cannot be disinvented, and if we are to have a more secure future, we need to strengthen the United Nations and international treaties and progressively to develop a fair system of international governance and law whereby conflict can be resolved without resort to war. That might seem an impossibly distant vision for a human race whose entire history and culture have been dominated by war, but it shows the scale of the challenge we face.</p>

	<p pid=".250.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/982" name="Simon Hughes">the hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Simon Hughes)</phrase> on securing the debate. I assure him, his constituents and all Southwark council's tenants that we are committed to delivering decent homes for all.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/2">The hon. Gentleman may not know this, but I visited the Aylesbury estate last Thursday&mdash;not that part that is in his constituency, or I would, of course, have informed him accordingly&mdash;and I conducted, for the first time, a street audit regarding an organisation called Living Streets and what can be done when local issues affecting people's lives are addressed, as well as how changes can be made by the community, the local authority and other partners to improve the quality of life on the pavements, along the shop fronts, in the streets and among traffic. I may say some more about that.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/3">The hon. Gentleman began with a good summary of the position in Southwark&mdash;the number of houses in council ownership and so on&mdash;and I want to put that description of Southwark into a national context, because it is helpful to see its relevance. There are 4.1 million social homes, which are a tremendous asset in financial terms&mdash;worth around &pound;400 billion&mdash;and an immeasurable asset to the community and the country. However, the impact of decades of neglect and under-investment left us with a &pound;19 billion backlog of repairs in 1997. We responded to that huge challenge by radically changing our approach to housing policy, building in far greater flexibility and greater capacity for investment in that housing stock because of the scale of the problem.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/4">The results of that radical change since 1997 have been dramatic. We have reduced the number of non-decent social homes by no fewer than 1 million and we have increased the proportion of vulnerable households in the private sector living in decent homes to 63 per cent. That is important to us. We have massively increased investment: local authorities have invested more than &pound;13 billion in bringing their homes up to a decent standard and a further &pound;5.3 billion&mdash;a billion being &pound;1,000 million&mdash;has been levered in from the private sector through transfer. On top of that, local authorities' plans suggest that they will invest a further &pound;11 billion in their stock by 2008. That is a huge investment in our local social housing stock.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/5">We are on track to meet our target that, by 2010, everyone living in social housing will have a decent home and that 70 per cent. of vulnerable households in private accommodation will also have a decent home. By the time that we meet our target, we expect that local authorities and housing associations will together have spent no less than about &pound;42 billion on ensuring that their tenants live in decent homes.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/6">That target is not merely about bricks and mortar&mdash;a point the hon. Gentleman made. It is about individuals, families, the young and the old, and their right to live in a secure and stable environment. That is absolutely right. The spending of that &pound;42 billion by 2008 is a crucial part of our commitment to create safe, sustainable communities. Last month, the Deputy Prime Minister launched &quot;Homes for All&quot;, the Government's five-year plan that sets out the way forward for housing. Decent homes and the decent homes target are, of course, an integral part of that plan. I am confident that we all agree that the decent homes strategy is tremendously important to our communities and neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/7">I will now talk about Southwark specifically. The hon. Gentleman rehearsed some of the facts. For example, 44 per cent. of Southwark's homes do not meet the decent homes standard. Southwark is considering what is achievable with the resources that it has. It may be viable for Southwark to deliver most, if not all, decent homes using the borough's resources. That is, of course, for Southwark to determine. It is the responsibility of the London borough of Southwark to work with tenants to develop a strategy for the council to achieve its decent homes target and to close the funding gap.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/8">Other London boroughs with a large housing stock have taken on that challenge. The London borough of Lambeth, for example, is also one of the country's biggest landlords. The council's option appraisal&mdash;the appraisal of the various options for improving the stock in Lambeth&mdash;has just been signed off. I stress that we need Southwark to do the same. I do not for one moment underestimate the size of the challenge facing Southwark. As the hon. Gentleman said, it is one of the largest landlords in the country, and the largest in London, with responsibility for more than 45,000 properties.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/9">There are options and choices, and I shall mention one route that might be appropriate for Southwark. If retention is not an option, the arm's-length management organisation option is one that will deliver additional resources to deliver decent homes while keeping the stock in local authority ownership and ensuring that tenants retain all existing rights. That is important, because it is not the popular understanding.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/10">As there has been much misleading campaigning about that option, not just in London but elsewhere, I want to be clear about the fact that ALMO programmes are not a means of privatising housing by the back door. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that, where tenants opt to have their homes maintained by an ALMO, those homes remain the property of the local authority. That is an important point. The option, therefore, is not only not privatisation&mdash;I will keep saying that until people finally understand it&mdash;but it offers tenants an improved service, with many council housing departments making particular efforts to raise their performance so that the ALMO can achieve the necessary two-star rating and attract additional Government funding to help it to deliver decent homes. Southwark is in that position. So, we have opportunities and options.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/11">Separating management and maintenance functions enables councils to focus their efforts more directly on the strategic management of their stock, while the ALMO focuses its efforts on delivering the highest standards of service to tenants. Those high standards are delivering results. This year we will see the first ALMOs bring all the council stock that they manage up to the decent homes standard.</p>
	<p pid=".250.0/12">So, I understand why the hon. Gentleman mentioned what he called the fourth option&mdash;a different option for investing in housing. That does not exist, but ALMOs do, as does the option of retaining the existing stock. I hope he recognises that ALMOs are an option that merits attention.</p>
