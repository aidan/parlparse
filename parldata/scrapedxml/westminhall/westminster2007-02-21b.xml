<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.75.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" speakername="George Mudie" colnum="75"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0001.htm#07022158000526">
	<p pid="b.75.2/1">I am delighted to have this debate for two reasons: first, because of the importance of home care for the elderly, but particularly, Mr. Marshall, because it gives me the opportunity to participate in a debate under the benign chairmanship for which you are renowned.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/2">I approach the subject of home care for the elderly with some trepidation. Social care policy is a separate world with a language of its own and, in this Chamber, one tends to leave such subjects to the experts. I got involved when I continued to meet elderly constituents or their relatives who were complaining bitterly about the withdrawal of home care support. One case that stood out was that of Mr. Thomas Place, who is not only a war veteran, but a hero with medals for bravery. Thomas is 93, is in a wheelchair and lives alone. When I met him at a Remembrance day ceremony, I was astonished and angered when he told me that his one-hour-a-fortnight home care support had been withdrawn. There was anger throughout Leeds because, quite rightly, the local paper splashed the story on the front page. A number of people rang in to say that they would take care of his home care personally, such was their anger at the plight of that elderly gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/3">Initially, I thought that a mistake had clearly been made, until I met other elderly residents&mdash;all in different circumstances, but at an advanced age and frail and vulnerable enough to justify support. I met ladies in their late 70s, one with recurring mental health problems, who had all been assessed as not being serious enough cases to need support, despite their backgrounds. Although Thomas Place's case stood out, it was not the worst that I have come across. I know of an elderly couple, both struggling with ill health and living in bad circumstances, where the man struggled to help his wife, despite his medical condition, and often at great physical cost to himself. That is not an isolated event. The whole business of home care would collapse if it were not for the vast army of unofficial carers, unpaid and unsung, who voluntarily put in many hours daily, looking after relatives and neighbours.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/4">Still thinking that this was a local matter, peculiar to east Leeds, or at best, to the city of Leeds, I made further enquiries and it emerged that the local council is carrying out a review of people receiving the service. Of the 2,471 cases reviewed by January last year, 751 were deemed not to require the service and 406 had their hours reduced. Nearly 50 per cent. of the elderly people reviewed so far had their hours taken away or reduced. On questioning that approach, I was assured by the council that it was all being done at Government diktat and was caused by Government cuts in grant. That proved, as the Minister will confirm, not to be the case, but I soon realised that the policy of cuts and reassessment was being replicated throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/5">Thanks to the excellent Commission for Social Care Inspection, I discovered that 100 of the 150 main commissioners, who are mainly local authorities, had changed their criteria for home care&mdash;that is two thirds of them. As a result, thousands of elderly people had lost their support, and the CSCI gave figures that showed the effect of that. The number of households receiving support fell from 528,000 in 1992 to 354,500 in 2005. My immediate thought was that perhaps the money had been cut after all, but again the CSCI said that the contrary had happened. Although I do not have the figures&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will be delighted to produce them at the appropriate time&mdash;commentators on the sector accepted that that was the truth, and that resources were actually much higher during the same period.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/6">The agreed explanation seems to be that, as people are living longer in greater numbers, the result is that much more expensive care packages are required by the minority who run into ill health. That is also the result of the effect of the Government's policy of getting people out of hospital sooner, which is a welcome one, and of trying to keep people independent in their own homes for as long as possible, which is the avenue favoured by most elderly people. The net result is that most councils have more people falling within the substantial and critical categories, and to service those, other categories of need are being ignored. That leaves Thomas Place and those like him bereft of care, and left in what are often difficult and undignified circumstances that cause great distress and can have dangerous consequences, as I shall relate in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.75.2/7">At this point, I should like to break off and talk about a second phenomenon that I have discovered that I thought was a Leeds one: the extent to which the old home help service&mdash;now the home care service&mdash;has been quietly privatised. Some hon. Members will not complain about that, but to my mind it has been carried out very questionably, and speedily, in an area where customers are vulnerable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.80.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" speakername="George Mudie" colnum="80"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0001.htm#07022158000541">
	<p pid="b.80.1/1">I see that I have one supporter in the Chamber<i>&mdash;[Interruption.]</i> I am being asked to put that to a vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/2">It would be interesting to see whether that report or a departmental document will be the focus of the national debate and decision. However, Mr. Wanless is considering the 20-year projection, and although that is excellent and necessary, it should not obscure the urgency of the current crisis. The situation that I have briefly outlined is serious and demands urgent action. I find it unacceptable that councils should have raised the threshold for help to such a height that it rules out support to people whose quality of life will suffer, if not disappear. That those people are among the most vulnerable makes the actions of the councils indefensible.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/3">The Government have a similar responsibility. No one can deny that they have put large additional resources into the service, but faced with the declared needs and the vulnerability of the elderly, further and prompt action needs to be taken. Remember that the Alzheimer's Society expects that no one with lower than critical or substantial needs will be supported after 2009. There is, of course, the national debate along the lines of the recent pension exercise, as the Secretary of State suggests. However, that could appear to some cynical people as a method of avoiding facing up to the current problems and cash shortages. The pension debate could be undertaken at a leisurely pace because the real problems were well in the future; however, the social care problems are with us now and, as the Alzheimer's Society survey suggests, they will immediately get worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/4">I have the following questions for the Minister. If he and the Secretary of State are united in wanting a debate, when will it start? As I asked earlier, will the formidable King's Fund report by Mr. Wanless bethe vehicle of that debate? Very pertinently, where does the Treasury stand on that debate? After all, the inescapable fact coming from any examination of the present crisis is that even more money will be required. Is that the real reason why the Secretary of State has called for a national debate but not taken any obvious steps to programme one?</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/5">In the industry, the attention is on the comprehensive spending review. Already the pessimistic view is that in light of their toughness, it is unlikely that social care problems will figure high on the Chancellor's agenda. In other words, if help is to arrive, it will come after 2010. Given the facts outlined, that would be disgraceful and too late. If that pessimism proves to be correct, there will be real hardship and loss of quality of life for hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/6">In their 2006 pre-Budget report, the Government state that they will consider proposals relating to the future of social care provision, including</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/7" class="indent">&quot;whether they are affordable, whether they are consistent with progressive universalism&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/8">whatever that means&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/9" class="indent">&quot;and whether they promote independence, dignity, well-being&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/10">I say to the Chancellor, through the Minister, that not taking urgent steps to deal with the current problems in social care will deny so many of the elderly their independence, dignity and well-being. Whether that is affordable is a strange question in the fourth richest country in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.80.1/11">I hope that I have succeeded in making clear the urgency of the crisis. The British public need to be aware of how shoddily we are treating so many of our elderly citizens. I hope that the Minister will accept the urgency of the funding crisis and give a real indication of how it will be met in the short term. I hope that we will be given an indication of the Government's view of the Wanless report and some details of the national debate&mdash;when it will start and whether the Wanless report will feature in a major way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.83.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" speakername="David Kidney" colnum="83"  time="009:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0002.htm#07022158000544">
	<p pid="b.83.1/1">Recently there has been a greater focus on how the health spending that I mentioned a moment ago is distributed across the country, and the same issue arises in respect of how social care money is distributed to local authorities. I shall deal briefly with the case of Staffordshire later.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/2">I agree that there will always be arguments about how money should be distributed. It is the difficult task of any Government, of any political colour, to achieve a fair distribution of the available funds, but my basic point&mdash;certainly in the case of health&mdash;is that this Government could not be better or fairer in the total amount that they distribute.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/3">I want to discuss the gap and how we might narrow it. First, we must look at our daily lives to find measures of how bad the situation is. I always think that a good barometer at local level is the number of delayed discharges from hospitals, because that tends to tell us that there are people in hospital beds who no longer need free health care in a hospital setting but who cannot go home because supports are not in place there or in their community to enable them to leave the hospital. I have seen ups and downs in Staffordshire&mdash;there have been good times and bad times for social care services in their ability to respond to their share of the challenges.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/4">The 2002 Wanless report pointed to other measures. It gave as one example the number of older people admitted to hospital in an emergency caused partly by reductions in the availability of appropriate social care. Having reviewed that evidence, Wanless stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/5" class="indent">&quot;In planning the delivery of care, health and social care must be considered together in order to ensure that both provide high quality services&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/6">As a result, another recommendation was that there should be in the future a greater focus on what he called &quot;whole systems&quot; to cover both sectors.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/7">It was Wanless's recommendation that, just as he had made a major report on the future trends in health care, there should be a similar investigation and report on future trends in social care. As my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East said, that is where the King's Fund stepped up to the plate, not for the first time, and funded another investigation and report by Derek Wanless.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/8">We have the information and there are arguments about what should be done. As my hon. Friend said, it is now a matter of having the political will to do the right thing. Will my hon. Friend the Minister explain how social care services will keep up with future demand? There are many different ways in which they need to keep up. First, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East said, demographic change means that a growing proportion of people will live longer and require more services in their homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/9">Secondly, there is growing public expectation about standards and quality of care; people expect care to be available when they want it, at their convenience. It is difficult to keep up with such demands. Thirdly, it will also be difficult to keep up with the excellent performance of the NHS as it continues to improve if similar resources are not available alongside in the social care sector. How does the Minister expect that social care services will keep up in such circumstances?</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/10">Can the Minister tell us whether the funding shortfall for social care will be addressed in the comprehensive spending review this year? My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East said that the soundings that he has taken are pessimistic, but surely, for the reasons that he gave, social care must be a top priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/11">I shall illustrate the intensity of the pressures on social care services by explaining the position in Staffordshire, which starts from a slightly out-of-the-ordinary base because, until now, it traditionally retained direct ownership of more residential homes than many other authorities, thereby tying up more of its resources in bricks and buildings, and services delivered in residential homes, than most other comparable local authorities. In addition, Staffordshire is one of those shire counties that always seems to be near the bottom of the funding league table, whether for education, health services or, in this case, social care provision. The hon. Member for Eddisbury referred to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/12">Furthermore, Staffordshire is experiencing the same demographic changes as the rest of the country. The trends indicate that parts of Staffordshire such as my constituency in the middle of the county&mdash;Stafford&mdash;tend to have more people living longer who, because of their backgrounds, will be keen to insist on their fair share of services. Such demands on services certainly will not go away in the future&mdash;they will get stronger.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/13">Staffordshire social services has found that because of its over-provision of directly provided residential home care, it has not been able to offer the range of services in people's own homes that my hon. Friend said was available in Leeds when it had a Labour-controlled council. Staffordshire was not quite in that position to begin with, yet it faces the pressures I have described.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/14">Last year, in &quot;Changing Lives&quot;, Staffordshire began to consider the reconfiguration of its social care services, including lessening the reliance on fixed buildings and providing residential care, but extending the range of home help services, such as those that my hon. Friend said used to be available in Leeds. The council proceeded at a good pace. It involved everybody, consulted everybody, explained the path ahead and set out a good timetable&mdash;up to 2012&mdash;for making the changes.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/15">Suddenly, last Thursday, under a document with the rather innocuous title of &quot;Medium Term Financial Strategy&quot;, the county council&mdash;it is still Labour controlled, of which I am proud, but in this case it is mistaken nevertheless&mdash;adopted a financial strategy that apparently requires it to close every one of the remaining 22 residential homes within the next12 months, and to refocus all its finances on services in the community, which I shall describe more positively in a moment. However, I want people in the Chamber to imagine the position last Thursday as hundreds of residents in those homes heard without any previous consultation or notice that their home would closethis year and that they could not expect to be there in 12 months' time, and as thousands of residents' relatives heard the same news at the same time. Imagine the hundreds of staff who work in all those homes who now have not the faintest idea of whether they will have a job in 12 months' time. It has been a difficult seven days, as anyone can imagine.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/16">There has been great heartache, anguish and not a little anger at the decision, yet the local authority's motives are excellent. It wants to reach a position where social care services are available around the clock for anybody any time they need to call on them. It wants to extend respite care services and give greater support to the carers who do such fantastic work, as my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East said, out of love rather than for reward, and who save the state billions of pounds of expenditure every year. It wants to develop extra care housing so that there is a middle way, so that people who cannot live any longer in their own home, even with support, but who do not want to be in an institutionalised residential home can have their own home space with support on hand when it is needed. The local authority wants, too, to do more work in partnership with other organisations, especially those in Staffordshire's splendid voluntary sector&mdash;or third sector, as some people like to call it now. Those proposals are all beneficial.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/17">In the past, the range of services has been narrow and the number of clients who can be satisfied has been too few. The local authority wants to be able to say that a wide range of services, including re-ablement services, will be available to all who need them in the future. I support those ambitions and want them to succeed, but if the local authority is saying, as I think that it is, that its finances are suddenly so stretched and so tight that it has to upset thousands of people by instantly closing a lot of residential homes to have the right funding in place at the right time for its new policy, something is wrong. It is not merely a case of my saying to the Minister, &quot;Could you send some more money to Staffordshire to solve our problem?&quot; I have never been one to say, &quot;Let's throw money at the problem to solve it.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/18">If there is a problem of timing, and in getting the right sequence of investments and decision making in Staffordshire, and if we need some help from above to plan in a better way so that the finance is more stable and lasts for longer than just 12 months, will the Minister give some attention to Staffordshire? Will he help the concerned Members of Parliament from Staffordshire who are trying to represent thousands of people who are angry and upset? We want them to be satisfied and reassured, and all of us in Staffordshire should have high quality services for the elderly. My hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East described such services in Leeds in the past; can we get them for the first time in Staffordshire and make them sustainable for the long term?</p>
	<p pid="b.83.1/19">My general contribution to the debate on the national importance of the subject has turned in the end to a narrow plea of self-interest for Staffordshire, but I hope nobody minds that in the circumstances. The problem is so pressing that I hope the Minister will be able to spare a couple of minutes to give it some attention.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.86.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" speakername="Sandra Gidley" colnum="86"  time="010:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0002.htm#07022158000545">
	<p pid="b.86.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on securing the debate. He spoke with compassion and concern. It is a shame that there are not more hon. Members in the Chamber. The subject is increasingly being mentioned at MPs' surgeries and constituents are raising concerns. I am sure that the lack of presence in the Chamber does not reflect the unimportance of the subject, but rather that other things are going on.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/2">The hon. Gentleman was right to highlight the problem of councils restricting their services, in many cases, to those with critical or substantial needs. The depressing trend is that an increasing number of councils over the past couple of years have decided to raise the threshold. They previously provided help for those with moderate and lower needs. Many people believe, and there is evidence to support it, that the provision of lower level care is an investment in the future, because it helps to keep someone slightly more mobile and active in their own home for longer. In many ways, the approach that is being taken makes only a short-term saving. Councils are allowed to do it, because they can take into account their budgetary pressures. Although I accept that a lot more money has gone into council services, far more money has been diverted towards the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/3">There is a tension in Government policy. I support the principle that people should receive care in their own homes. Often, when an individual goes home an unseemly battle takes place over whether their care is health care, when it stops becoming health care and becomes social care or personal care, and who picks up the tab. Personal care is, of course, the responsibility of the local authority and services are means-tested. In cases of pure health care, the tab is picked up by the NHS. Far too much time and effort is wasted on an unseemly struggle over who will pick up the tab. That is not what older people want when they are probably not feeling at all well and when they are having to adapt to changes in their life circumstances. I would be pretty grumpy, too, if I were not well and could not go out and about and be as active&mdash;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I am sure that the Minister is saying something not entirely complimentary from his sedentary position, but I will leave that there.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/4">The problem seems to be that when care is delivered at home sufficient money does not seem to come across from the health service to pick up the costs that it should be picking up. Hampshire county council is increasingly that particular problem with me, and it is having to pick up the bill for the provision of services for more acute needs, which it regards not as personal care, but as health care. Ultimately, somebody has to deal with the problem. Many people in local government do not want to see people suffer.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.0/1">The Minister is being rather tedious&mdash;he seems to raise that question on every occasion. I suggest that <i>Hansard</i> is a matter of public record, and if people are sufficiently interested they can read my previous words. I have different words to say today, and I hope that the Minister appreciates that.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/2">Returning to local councils, one of the problems is that many would like to increase spending in this area because they recognise the problem, but the capping system allows them very little flexibility for keeping within budget the level of service that they would like, not least because staffing costs have rightly increased. It is not something that we should be getting on the cheap. The number of people requiring services, too, has risen, and we must take that into consideration. However, there is a caveat. Many people want to stay at home, but it is not everyone's choice, so we must not say that everyone must do it. Dame Denise Platt was mentioned earlier. I remember being quite exercised when I heard her talk; she quoted an elderly lady who had said, &quot;This is no longer my home. It's their workplace.&quot; A stream of people come in; indeed, the hon. Member for Leeds, East said that it could be different people from the care agency every day. People with complex needs may have various people delivering many different services, which can be quite invasive of someone's privacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/3">There is a protection issue. It is a fact that many older people are unwilling or unable to complain. I was pleased that the CSCI has decided to regulate matters. A lot is made of abuse in care homes, but other workers often provide checks and balances&mdash;unless there is an institutional problem, I would suggest that there is a greater chance of problems being found out in care homes. However, we should bear in mind that most abuse takes place in the person's home, and it is often committed by someone known to them. With individual workers going into people's homes, it is only right that they should be supervised initially and that spot checks should be made on their work. Because such workers often work alone, it puts people in a vulnerable position. Many surveys show that workers are not supervised in their early days in the job.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/4">I raise the spectre of Criminal Records Bureau checks. I am told that there are still delays, which are often as long as 16 weeks, in getting approval. If the Minister can do anything to speed it up, it would be welcomed. When workers apply to an agency or a care home, they will already have decided to work in the area and cannot afford to wait until the CRB check is completed. Another complication is that the smaller agencies can no longer administer their own applications for CRB checks, unless they do more than 100 a year. That will put an added cost burden on them, and if the Minister can do anything about that, it would help the sector greatly.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/5">The CSCI report, &quot;Time to Care&quot;, highlighted the problem of performance. It concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/6" class="indent">&quot;There is relatively poor performance in the 'managers and staff' domain. Too many organisations fail to achieve satisfactory standards in relation to supervision, support and training for staff. Nearly 39 per cent. are not conforming with basic requirements for the selection and recruitment of staff.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/7">That is shocking. It would be helpful to know what is being done to address the problem. If we are moving towards more people receiving services in their own homes, it seems fundamental to ensure that the problem is not repeated. It has to be tackled before we increase the number of people receiving such care packages.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/8">I turn briefly to carers and the support of o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" name="Stephen O'Brien">thers, which the hon. Member for Eddisbury (Mr. O'Brien)</phrase> has alluded to briefly. I heard on the radio this morning a welcome announcement of money for respite care. It is much needed, and I am sure that those who receive it will be grateful. However, I hope that the Minister will confirm my understanding that the money is for emergency respite care. Unfortunately, my experience from surgeries and from visiting homes is that people would like to be able to plan such care. If they are able to take an occasional break, be themselves and not have to worry, they feel that they can carry on caring for longer. Making a small investment in regular respite care could result in longer-term savings, as individuals would almost voluntarily be undertaking the caring role. A constituent recently highlighted the problem. She was a bit frustrated that she had to book her respite week several weeks in advance&mdash;it was difficult to plan anything, but she accepted that only to find that she was frequently messed around when she had made plans. She accepted that others may have had a more acute need, but it highlights the desperate need for better services.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/9">Having mentioned some of the slight problem areas with home workers, it is only fair to put on record the number of complaints to the CSCI about domiciliary care, of which there were 684 in 2005-06. That is 684 too many, but given the large number of people receiving care, it suggests a relatively high level of satisfaction. Indeed, the CSCI found that most older people speak highly of their own care workers, blaming problems on the system. I quote again from &quot;Time to Care&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The vast majority (90 per cent.) felt that they received sufficient visits and three-quarters felt they had the things done that they wanted but, in practice, almost a third felt that at least on occasions less time was spent with them than they were entitled to. Linked to this, over half of the respondents reported that, at least sometimes, care workers were in a rush, and a fifth that care workers were only sometimes or even less often on time, with 5 per cent. never knowing when the care worker was going to arrive.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/11">Many older people like to plan their lives, because they like a routine. That needs to be considered more carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/12">My final comments are on a key finding, about which I would like to hear the Minister's comments. The CSCI concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/13" class="indent">&quot;When the national minimum standards for home care are reviewed by the Department of Health, revisions will be needed to reflect changing priorities and expectations. In particular the standards over-emphasise plans and record-keeping, and under-emphasise the importance of promoting independence and of listening and responding to people's changing needs and aspirations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.88.0/14">Given that one in two women and one in three men over the age of 65 will be receiving these services, will the Minister say how he sees the future developing, and whether funding, particularly at council level, will be fairer and more equitable, so that more people can receive the services to which they are entitled?</p>

	<p pid="b.90.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the hon. Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on securing this important and timely debate. It is an issue about which he has been exercised over the past few months and has raised a number of times at business questions. He provides an example to us all in the way that he champions his constituents' interests&mdash;in particular, those of Mr. Thomas, whom we heard about earlier. The hon. Gentleman has been courageous in shining a spotlight on the serious failures in providing health care to the nation that have occurred during the decade of this Government. During a debate on social exclusion on January 11 this year, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/2" class="indent">&quot;I do not even think that I will read the figures; it makes too hard reading.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-11">11 January 2007</phrase>; Vol. 455, c. 474.]</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/3">It is a shame that the Government are not prepared to address this issue on the Floor of the House, despite the hon. Gentleman's repeated requests for them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.0/4">We have heard the wider failures of the Government on social care rehearsed on a number of occasions in this Chamber. Their response to the Derek Wanless review was to produce a zero-based review, about which the hon. Gentleman quite rightly prompted and chided the Government. We have heard nothing since about that. It is right and timely that we should know whether that national debate will start or whether the Government are attempting to let the long grass to grow around the issue for as long as they can get away with it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.91.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1567" speakername="Stephen O'Brien" colnum="91"  time="010:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0003.htm#07022158000556">
	<p pid="b.91.0/1">There has certainly been a raging debate in the House since Wanless reported. However, the hon. Gentleman raises the serious issue of whether that debate has caught the public imagination in a broader sense or whether it is still a matter discussed only locally, according to local conditions? I suspect that the latter may be true.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/2">This issue also displays the twofold impotence of Department of Health Ministers in the face of the Chancellor's roadblock to reform. He holds the purse strings, but the double whammy is that the Government are in stasis in terms of policy development until we know whether or not the Chancellor will take prime ministerial office.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/3">The Government's failure in health and social care extends to home care. I am sure that the Minister will seek to pray in aid the CSCI's statement that</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/4" class="indent">&quot;the total number of people using home care during 2004-05 rose to 584,000, up by 9,000 compared to 2003-04&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/5">and that</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/6" class="indent">&quot;greater numbers of home care...services are meeting more of the Government's National Minimum Standards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/7">That marks a shift in resource provision away from those with low-level needs towards those with the most intensive needs&mdash;a key point made by the hon. Gentleman. In 2005, 98,240 households received intensive home care, which is an increase of 6 per cent. from 2004. In 1990, home care was provided to 500,000 households and last year 584,000 people were using that home care. I accept that the figures are not directly comparable, but they are close enough to draw the conclusion that little has improved in low-level provision since policies before the last decade&mdash;indeed, CSCI seems to suggest a regression from those policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/8">Although it is undoubtedly right to give people the choice of remaining in their own home and to work to reduce unplanned emergency episodes through better home care, it is wrong that those with lesser needs should suffer because the resources required by those with greater needs are given priority. As I said in an earlier intervention, such cost shifting is not only unacceptable, but short-sighted. Low-level help and care is just as important in supporting older people as other levels of care. It is also important to keep people at home where that is their choice and it is appropriate to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/9">I praise the dedication of home care workers. We have all met those who are selfless and deeply talented at such work. It takes a very special person to do that work well. However, as a number of charities that are active in this sector have highlighted, there are problems. We must take note that the CSCI reports that</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/10" class="indent">&quot;improvement against standards has slowed down&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/11">and that there are pockets of very low standards. That mirrors and is broadly connected to the wider failings of the social and, particularly, the home care market.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/12">The biggest concern about this issue relates to direct payments. Despite having been introduced as far back as 1997 and all the warm words of &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, we must ask whether local authorities have set challenging targets for the take-up of direct payments. What has been the effect of the national awareness campaign that the White Paper said would work</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/13" class="indent">&quot;with a range of external stakeholders to increase awareness and improve understanding of the benefits of direct payments.&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/14">How can it be that direct payments still account only for about &pound;1 in every &pound;100 of social care expenditure by councils in 2004-05? Individual budgets are also moving painfully slowly.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/15">The CSCI notes in its report, &quot;The state of social care in England&quot;<i></i>that social care is being hindered by an underdeveloped care market. Collaboration on commissioning is weak, and I hope that the Government will support our amendments to the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Bill, which aims to support collaboration. It is beyond me why patient and public involvement should be introduced in a Bill from the Department for Communities and Local Government. Does that show a lack of faith in the Department of Health, or a lack of ability or desire to engage in the issues surrounding the crossover of provision between local government and the NHS? As highlighted during this morning's comments, I suspect that the latter is the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/16">In addition, councils often have immature relationships with home care providers and short-sighted, cost-driven approaches to commissioning. Although in some places blame for that might rest with local council politicians and officials, it is more likely to be the result of national policy drives. The CSCI calls for</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/17" class="indent">&quot;a better understanding of how the availability of one form of service (such as a care home or intermediate care bed) might impact on another part of the health and care system.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/18">The continuing disjointedness in health and social care lies entirely at the door of the Government. The Wanless review highlights an innovative funding scheme created, as it happens, by Conservative-controlled Kent county council. The council wanted to research&mdash;not instigate&mdash;the issue of Government subsidies to encourage contributions to long-term care investment. However, as Wanless despondently puts it,</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/19" class="indent">&quot;In the end, Kent county council found there was no appetite from either the Department of Health or the Treasury to fund further modelling on how such a scheme could be implemented, each department wanting the other to sponsor the work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/20">As usual, faced with the intransigence of the Government, particularly the Treasury, there was no further chance to consider that innovative scheme for general application. That would have potentially provided a serious answer to some of the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/21">Likewise, short-termism in commissioning is born of a financial climate made extremely uncertain by Labour's continuing mismanagement of our national health service. The CSCI says that</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/22" class="indent">&quot;councils and other commentators report that the NHS deficit of over &pound;500 million last year is affecting local partnerships between local authorities and the NHS&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/23">and that they are pulling out of pooled budget arrangements and are nervous about re-entering them. The CSCI also notes that people have little control over the services that they use. With such disjunction among users, providers and commissioners, it is unsurprising that the market is having problems. I use the term &quot;market&quot;, as did the hon. Member for Leeds, East, to refer to the overall provision in this area, whosoever may be delivering it.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/24">It is not just those who need care who bear the force of the Government cuts. Where formal care is no longer provided, informal carers often step into the breach. Even with the &pound;33 million that I believe was announced this morning on the &quot;Today&quot; programme&mdash;again not in the House, I note&mdash;the Government have done too little to support that work force. I am thinking particularly of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1787" name="Sandra Gidley">the point made by the hon. Member for Romsey (Sandra Gidley)</phrase> about planned respite care, which is probably the most valuable and valued type of respite care for the army of carers in the population. The issue involves not just emergency, plugging-the-gap respite care, although that is unquestionably important. Of course, that funding must be welcomed. This is a very important area, in which policy is being not only rapidly focused on but developed in my party.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/25">I will highlight once more for the record the Government's failure&mdash;the fact that something has not been produced does amount to a failure&mdash;to produce the continuing care proposals. When will they be published? Given all that has been debated and even if the Minister can find two minutes to answer <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1833" name="David Kidney">the points raised by the hon. Member for Stafford (Mr. Kidney)</phrase> about his local issues, I hope that the Minister can, if he gives us nothing else in the next 20 minutes, give us at least the long-overdue date for publication of the continuing care proposals</p>
	<p pid="b.91.0/26">I again congratulate the hon. Member for Leeds, East. He is right to highlight the fact that, as a result of policy, there are a number of areas where the elderly people of this country are being shoddily treated&mdash;that was his phrase. It is incumbent on us all&mdash;there is a duty on us&mdash;to address this live, very important issue of our day. We must get it right; we cannot call ourselves a civilised society if we cannot support and treat with dignity the elderly people of this nation.</p>

	<p pid="b.99.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue. I am also pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1788" name="Janet Anderson">my hon. Friends the Members for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson)</phrase> and for Burnley (Kitty Ussher) are present in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the Chamber, as is the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>. I hope that they will all have the opportunity to make a brief contribution, because I know that they are as concerned as me about this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/2">Given that the hon. Member for Ribble Valley is present, I should say in passing that, by rights, I ought to be the Member of Parliament for that constituency. I contested the seat in the 1987 general election, and I think that it was widely acknowledged that I was unfortunate to lose by 22,000 votes&mdash;it rained on polling day and it was hard to get the Labour vote out.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/3">Five or six years ago, I raised in a debate the issue of the housing conditions that some of my constituents had to endure. I told the House that the conditions were a disgrace and that they were a badge of shame for various people&mdash;those involved in public life; the council, whichever party ran it; the Government and the previous Administration; and, perhaps most of all, myself, as a Member of Parliament. I had tolerated for too long a situation in which people were living in intolerable conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/4">At that time, more than 2,000 houses had been abandoned in my constituency. They were terraced houses that were unfit for human habitation. People could not sell them and had simply walked away from them. In 2000-01, houses changed hands in public houses for less than the cost of a round. In such an environment, unscrupulous private landlords flourished, because they rushed into towns such as Accrington knowing that they could buy up properties for next to nothing and then make a healthy profit out of the housing benefits system. They did not care what sort of people they had as tenants, which added to the spiral of decline.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/5">It was a housing market that had no base on which to build future prosperity. There was no rising equity in most of the property stock in Hyndburn or in other parts of east Lancashire, which meant that there was little financial incentive for home owners to invest in their properties, although there were obviously other incentives. The housing market at that time was not so much stagnant as in a spiral of complete decline.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/6">My advice surgeries, and, I suspect, those of my hon. Friends, were full of decent and hard-working people. Some of them had perhaps served in the war and had then bought a respectable working-class property, settled down and raised their family. Such people found themselves being the last ones living in a terraced block or street. Imagine what it must be like for an elderly person trapped in that situation. The houses next door would be empty, abandoned, vandalised and burnt out. Damp would be coming through because next door's roof had been burnt off. The truth is that no matter how well my decent constituents looked after their own properties, they were trapped in that nightmare and could not move. They could not sell their properties, because those properties were essentially valueless. That situation was endemic in the heart of Accrington in my constituency, as well as in Blackburn, Burnley, Nelson, Colne, parts of the Rossendale valley and, I suspect, parts of Ribble Valley. People tend to think of Ribble Valley as being a prosperous area&mdash;large parts of it are, but all-too-real pockets of deprivation exist there, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/7">I was going to say that what has happened since is that we have been fortunate enough to be part of the housing market renewal programme and to have Elevate East Lancashire as the pathfinder, but we have not been fortunate&mdash;those things happened not by chance but as a result of political will. We were not lucky to get the help that the Government gave us, because we deserved it. I am proud of the difference that Elevate is making to the communities that I represent and to those represented by my hon. Friends in east Lancashire.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/8">A few years ago, I took the Minister who had responsibility for housing at that time, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, as he now is, to Lonsdale street in Accrington, in my constituency, to show him the nature of the problem. I think that he was shocked by what he saw and by the conditions in which people were living. Since then, we have had the pathfinder programme, which has made an astonishing difference. Let us consider what has happened in Lonsdale street and its neighbouring streets. Lonsdale street has rightly been demolished. I shall come on to the argument about demolition and refurbishment, but I should say that in some cases demolition is the answer. For example, the conditions on Lonsdale street were dire and needed clearing. We have cleared that street and the neighbouring ones. People who walk along it now can see what we are building in its place: a state-of-the-art health centre in the middle of a ward that has some of the worst public health statistics in the UK. Around that health centre, we will build a mixture of diverse housing that will meet different housing needs in a diverse community. There will not be a one-size-fits-all approach; there will be different types of large and small housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/9">This is not just about demolition&mdash;or even mainly about it. I must deal with one of the myths that has been put about by lazy journalists who rolled up in places such as Liverpool and east Lancashire and said that we are somehow ripping the hearts out of communities, that we are demolishing our built heritage and that it is all a disaster. If that were the case, neither I nor my hon. Friends would be here&mdash;far from it; we would all be signing up to a campaign to oppose what Elevate is doing. That is not what is happening on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.99.1/10">Some demolition is taking place, but the truth is that more than twice as many properties are being refurbished as are being demolished. In 2005-06, which is the last year for which figures are available, Elevate improved 830 houses and demolished 331 houses, mainly older ones that were unfit. The improvement-to-demolition ratio is more than 2.5:1. The reason why I support Elevate so strongly&mdash;I believe that this is also the reason why my hon. Friends support it&mdash;is that this is about creating sustainable communities. It is about far more than just housing; it is about culture, sport and business. All those things are interwoven.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.101.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1650" speakername="Greg Pope" colnum="101"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0005.htm#07022158000570">
	<p pid="b.101.3/1">The hon. Gentleman has made an important point. We are not just talking about traditional manufacturing areas such as Accrington&mdash;people would think of those areas as having manufacturing&mdash;because there are manufacturing companies dotted across Ribble Valley. There are many such companies in Clitheroe, some of which are having a tough time. They need help just as much as companies in my constituency, so I strongly support what he has said.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.3/2">Returning to housing, five or six years ago, there were streets in my constituency in which house values were essentially nil&mdash;I made the point at the beginning of my speech that there was no base to the housing market. I checked some house prices on the internet yesterday in streets in inner-urban areas of towns such as Accrington. To someone living in London, the figures may not sound astonishing, but they are astonishing when house prices in those streets were nil five, six or seven years ago. In China street, Accrington, houses are now for sale for &pound;100,000, and in Aitken street they are &pound;97,000. However, prices in Pendle street show that we still have a problem: houses are for sale at &pound;44,000 because three blocks have been done up, but one block has not. That street is outside the Elevate area, and I hope that the Minister will arrange with Hyndburn council that Pendle street should be the next street to be improved. Only around 200 people live in that block, but they deserve our help in having their case listened to. There are some clouds on the horizon, but we have made a fantastic start.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.3/3">During the last bidding round for 2006-08, Elevate bid for &pound;104 million and received &pound;94.9 million. We are grateful for that &pound;94.9 million, because it is money that we did not have before. It is great and we are thankful, but if there is to be a &pound;10 million gap every year&mdash;it could become wider&mdash;we will end up with a funding gap over the period of the project of &pound;150 million or even &pound;200 million. The figures I have seen go as high as &pound;272 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.3/4">We are in the business of transforming people's lives with this project, which is making a huge difference to the communities that I represent. We have been blighted by years and years&mdash;decades&mdash;of under-investment. My plea today is that now is not the time to stop. Now is the time to say that the comprehensive spending review is an opportunity for us. We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a real difference to those communities, and I hope that the Minister will press for proper funding for Elevate in the comprehensive spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.3/5">My hon. Friends and I have asked the Minister for Housing and Planning to visit my constituency and the neighbouring ones to see the work, and I make that request again today through the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1388" name="Angela Smith">my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon (Angela E. Smith)</phrase>. If the Minister for Housing and Planning comes to see what is happening, she will see that it is worth supporting the project and worth campaigning for extra resources.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.102.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1788" speakername="Janet Anderson" colnum="102"  time="011:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0005.htm#07022158000571">
	<p pid="b.102.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1650" name="Greg Pope">my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope)</phrase> for allowing me to make a brief contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/2">My constituency is in east Lancashire, and I want to start by paying tribute to Elevate's valuable work. At the outset, we had a fight to ensure that the borough of Rossendale was included in the scheme, and I am pleased that it was included. Some of the work has made a huge difference to people's lives, particularly in parts of Bacup and Stacksteads, where there were some very poor living conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/3">I pay tribute to the vision for Pennine Lancashire of Mr. Anthony Wilson and his partner, Yvette. Their plans for an adrenalin gateway in the Rossendale valley would fit in with the spirit of the valley, where we are fond of outdoor activities and sporting events. The proposals are very exciting indeed&mdash;I endorse what my hon. Friend said to the Minister&mdash;and we hope that they will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/4">As my hon. Friend said, there is a problem because of the increase in house prices, which adds to our concern about the potential funding gap in years to come. In my constituency, we reckon that house prices have risen by a staggering 57 per cent. Houses that were worth &pound;30,000 two years ago are now worth around &pound;70,000. Compensating people for four houses of that value obviously costs a great deal more.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/5">I also endorse what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" name="Kitty Ussher">my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Kitty Ussher)</phrase> said about transport links. We want very much to improve transport links into Manchester from Rawtenstall in the Rossendale valley, to cut down on the daily congestion on the M66, and on the Clitheroe to Manchester line, which runs through Darwen, where we are sure a commuter service would be popular. My plea is also intended to try to get things done, and I hope that the Government will consider bridging the funding gap, which we are concerned about, because it will mean that that much-needed project cannot continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/6">I want to bring a problem to the Minister's attention. In Darwen, the Redearth Triangle is due to be demolished. Most of the houses are boarded up and the residents have left. In fact, a former resident of Sudell road came up to me in Sainsbury's recently, put his arms round me, hugged me, and said, &quot;Janet, I'd just like to say that I have moved to much better house and I am absolutely delighted. Thank you very much for what the Government have done.&quot; I fully endorse what my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn said about Elevate. It has transformed people's lives, and some of the doom and gloom exposure in the media has been far removed from the truth.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/7">We have a particular problem in Darwen because a small group of protestors have managed to hold up the demolition of the area. A planning compulsory purchase order inquiry is due to take place on <phrase class="date" code="">12 June</phrase>. We are concerned about the delay, because the proposal for the site is to build a city academy, which is much needed in Darwen. We have no sixth form in the town, and we have the highest proportion of NEETS&mdash;young people not in employment education or training&mdash;in Lancashire, because there is no sixth form in Darwen.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/8">We want to improve education and that is what the academy would do. However, there is a small group of protestors, led by Mr. Simon Hugill&mdash;I make no apology for naming him&mdash;who does not even live in the area. He does not educate his children in Darwen but chose to move them to Bolton. It does not matter to Mr. Hugill whether the academy is held up, but it matters to the rest of us and to the children in Darwen. Perhaps the Minister would see whether she can do anything to bring forward that inquiry date.</p>
	<p pid="b.102.0/9">I want to underline what my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn said about a ministerial visit. We have written to the Minister for Housing and Planning to ask her to visit. We would very much like her to see for herself the improvements, the way in which many people's lives in east Lancashire have been transformed, and why it is imperative that that work continues.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1650" name="Greg Pope">my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn (Mr. Pope)</phrase> on securing this debate, and on his passion and commitment, which have led the efforts that he and his colleagues have made to secure the improvements in east Lancashire. All MPs from east Lancashire, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1788" name="Janet Anderson">my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen (Janet Anderson)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1781" name="Nigel Evans">the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr. Evans)</phrase>, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1464" name="Kitty Ussher">my hon. Friends the Members for Burnley (Kitty Ussher)</phrase> and for Pendle (Mr. Prentice) have shown a wide commitment to the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/2">We recognise that much of east Lancashire had faced deep-seated and long-term housing, social and economic challenges, but the Government's ongoing sub-regional response is robust, positive and proactive, as my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn acknowledged. The Government's primary role has been to stimulate private investment by tackling particularly challenging blockages to recovery, a number of which my hon. Friend highlighted. Our approach to east Lancashire has focused on investment to address problems in the housing market, and we have invested in capacity-building its people and institutions, where poor performance exists. We have also focused on challenging poor performance to raise aspirations and on stimulating the growth of an entrepreneurial economy, which the hon. Member for Ribble Valley mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/3">We recognise that, in encouraging sustainable investment, we need to address the many other factors that influence whether people want to live and work in an area. As has been mentioned, such issues include low crime, decent schools and colleges, clean streets and access to leisure facilities. The general issue is whether people want to live in an area and whether they feel safe and secure there and part of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/4">Changes are taking place in respect of all those issues in east Lancashire. It is a particularly beautiful part of Britain, and I say that as a Londoner and an Essex girl. It also offers a great quality of life. I was delighted to hear my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn and other hon. Friends refer to our housing market renewal policies there. As a result of those polices, many people are now choosing to live and work in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/5">In December, we were pleased to announce the success of the Pennine Lancashire bid for the local economic growth initiative. The competitive process, which was largely assessed by the private sector, awarded &pound;22.3 million over three years, subject to the comprehensive spending review. That award is the biggest nationally and will benefit the constituencies of Pendle, Burnley, Blackburn and Rossendale and Darwen. I understand my hon. Friend's comments about funding, and I shall say more about that in a moment. The local economic growth initiative is aligned with, and complemented by, a range of wider strategies because other challenges feed into the housing issue that he mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/6">Housing formed a large part of my hon. Friend's speech, and I understand his concerns. Although, as he said, things are slightly different for those of us who live in London, I grew up in an area with very poor housing. I still remember how thrilled I was at the age of 10 when my family got its first house, which was in New Town and had a bathroom and a garden. I am sure that my hon. Friend's constituents would feel the same. Having somewhere decent to live is one of the most fundamental rights that any person has.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/7">I commend the excellent progress that has been made by the nine housing market renewal pathfinders. More new homes are being built and refurbished to modern standards than are being demolished&mdash;my hon. Friend also made that point, and it is worth placing it very strongly on the record. Such initiatives help to improve the quality and choice of housing on offer. The record on that issue is impressive, and I congratulate all those involved. They have had strong support from local MPs and should take enormous pride in the work that they have undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/8">Since the start of the pathfinder programme, more than 30,000 run-down homes have been refurbished. Since spring 2003, average house prices in the nine pathfinder areas have almost doubled from &pound;40,000 to &pound;79,000. As my hon. Friends the Members for Hyndburn and for Rossendale and Darwen suggested, however, we must recognise that the decades of under-investment in housing and people's lives mean that there is still much more to be done to restore stability to communities and ensure that they are truly sustainable not only in the longer term, but in the short term, too. In recognition of that, the Government have allocated &pound;1.2 billion to pathfinders for 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/9">I was grateful for the comments that my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn made about funding and about the difference that has been made by the money from the Government. We must look at new complementary funding solutions to capitalise on increasing land and property values and draw in as much private sector funding as possible. Value for money is key to making our money work smarter, and we look forward to working with local authorities and pathfinders to identify solutions that bring about even greater private sector investment. We expect the recently announced Communities England to play a significant new role in helping to ensure that that happens. However, we must ensure that partnerships spend money wisely and to best effect. We are talking not only about houses, but about improving people's way of life in disadvantaged areas and meeting community aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/10">I was pleased to hear my hon. Friends for Rossendale and Darwen and for Hyndburn give their strong support to Elevate, which the Government, too, strongly support it. As we are seeing all over the country, but particularly in Lancashire, the housing market is beginning to turn the corner. Only five years ago, some areas were facing widespread abandonment and market collapse, and my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn wisely set out the social costs of that. Now, however, we are seeing the creation of more balanced housing markets that reflect modern communities' needs and demands. As a result, we are seeing a strengthened housing market.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/11">My hon. Friend referred to the house price increases in his constituency, and I am sure that many Members in other parts of the country would welcome such prices. I was looking at information about the new apartments in Accrington, and they are part of an incredible new development, which would not even have been thought of a few years ago. I understand that there are plans to clear the derelict site on the other side of the lake, which will bring real benefits to the area. It will create a community in which people will want to live and work, of which they will want to be part and where they will feel safe. Hyndburn is therefore an excellent example of how housing market renewal activity is being complemented by other public sector investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/12">I was pleased that my hon. Friend mentioned the other issues that must be tackled to bring about real change, and my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley, too, referred to interconnectivity. Unless we deal with transport, employment and business, we will not make truly sustainable communities. Such issues are being taken on board, and we recognise that despite all the work that has been done, considerably more needs to be done. Our aim is to ensure that all housing is decent and attractive. I take the view that if I am not prepared to live somewhere, we should not expect other people to live there either. That should be a strong driving force behind the improvements that we want to make.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/13">Several deep pockets of market failure and weakness remain. Too many houses are still in serious disrepair, and there is insufficient choice and quality for today's communities. Those problems will not be resolved overnight, but my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn clearly highlighted the direction we are taking. We are moving in the right direction and we are in this for the long haul; we will not abandon areas now that we have made a start on making improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/14">There is considerable encouragement to be had from the progress that has been made. I commend Elevate's partnership work with the private sector and registered social landlords to deliver a much better choice of social housing for people in east Lancashire. I am aware of some of the excellent wider working that Elevate has enabled through programmes such as &quot;Constructing the Future&quot;, which offers residents the opportunity to improve skills and gain qualifications to improve their ability to access good employment opportunities. Elevate has also worked closely with Lancashire county council to develop a new regional economic strategy across the sub-region, and that is directly related to raising the housing offer. It is worth putting on record that unless we deal with the economy and businesses, as the hon. Member for Ribble Valley said, we will not provide sustainable communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/15">I pay tribute to the partnership work that has been done in east Lancashire, and local people clearly have a role in determining the future of the places in which they live. I also pay tribute to all those in the sub-region who have risen to the challenges. They have made a personal commitment to, and put effort into, enabling their communities to develop clearer strategies and significantly improve performance. The local strategic partnerships of Pendle, Burnley and Hyndburn have undergone significant change, which has made a real difference to changes in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/16">Let me say something about liveability, because regeneration is about more than just housing and the economy; it is really about people, although I sometimes think that that gets lost in the debate. My hon. Friends the Members for Hyndburn and for Rossendale and Darwen made it clear, however, that people are the crux of the issue. Regeneration is about raising aspirations, improving the skills of the community, improving the environment and creating places where people really want to live, raise their families, work and spend their leisure time. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn said, we are seeing improvements in all those issues in east Lancashire. The local area agreements covering the area have been well regarded and have been important in strengthening partnership working, developing proposals for continuous improvement and ensuring a joined-up approach to rationalising and aligning resources to deliver the priorities agreed by the community as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/17">I assure hon. Members that I will take on board the issues that they have raised and take them back with me. I understand the concern expressed by my hon. Friend the Member for Rossendale and Darwen about the town of Darwen, and my colleagues in the Department will look at the issue. Her commitment is clearly to ensure that people who live and work in the area have the best possible services, and I pay tribute to her for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/18">In closing the debate, let me say that we are working, and will continue to work, to support the economic regeneration of the sub-region. I look forward to a day when east Lancashire has re-established the vibrancy that it experienced during the industrial revolution, with the economic diversity providing a varied and sustainable offer for the whole community. I pay tribute to all hon. Members involved for playing their part, and particularly to my hon. Friend the Member for Hyndburn, who raised the issue. He can take some credit for the changes that have been made, as they are due in no small part to his efforts.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.108.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="108"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0006.htm#07022158000574">
	<p pid="b.108.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss the triumphs and, I am afraid, the threats to the voluntary adoption sector. Children in the so-called care of the state, despite the efforts of many fine foster carers, have a miserable and insecure existence, all too often shuttled between carers. That is reflected in appalling outcomes, and I provide just two examples of that: one quarter of girls who go through the care system become pregnant in the process and more than half the inmates of young offenders institutions have been through the care system.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/2">Having children in care adopted by loving families is a noble objective. That is why a small number of MPs established an all-party group in the late 1990s. We welcomed Government announcements that gave priority to improving the miserably low levels of adoption that prevailed then. They have introduced the national register, the Adoption and Children Act 2002 and targets to encourage local authorities to adopt. All those measures have been blessed with some success, and adoption numbers rose from about 2,000 a year to a peak of 3,800 in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/3">However, when we realise that more than 50,000 children have been in care for six months or more, and when we consider the best performance of a few really good local authorities, we see that the figure should at least double again. Thousands more children could and should be placed in loving homes. In fact, last year the number of adoptions fell, and the rumour going around is that last year's number will be 2,600. That is the context for the role and the plight of the voluntary adoption sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/4">In 2004-05, the last year for which detailed figures are available, voluntary adoption agencies placed almost 500 children, one eighth of the total sector. Most were hard-to-place children: older children, disabled children, children from ethnic minorities and severely damaged children; and more than half of them were in sibling groups. The latest report from the Commission for Social Care Inspection pointed out that 82 per cent. of voluntary adoption agencies reached the required standard on matching, against only 52 per cent. of local authorities. Some 92 per cent. of voluntary adoption agencies reached the standard for adoptive parents, which is so important. Only 55 per cent. of local authorities did so.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/5">The report goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/6" class="indent">&quot;Overall the quality of adoption practice is still very variable across and within local councils, with some aspects of practice falling below the required standard in most places. Voluntary adoption agencies...generally meet or exceed the required standards.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/7">Only 5.5 per cent. of planned placements break down for voluntary agencies in the period up to the adoption order. The Prime Minister's report mentioned a figure of about 20 per cent. for local authorities. At a time when an independent report has estimated that of the most recent cohort of children selected for adoption, 40 per cent. are awaiting adoption, such agencies are a precious resource.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/8">However, the agencies are under attack from two separate angles: first, the problems of financial squeeze, exacerbated by delays in the courts, and, secondly, the sexual orientation regulations. Voluntary adoption agencies are reimbursed for each parental group they find, typically at a rate of &pound;19,000, and rather higher in London. Barbara Hutchinson, deputy chief executive of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering commented:</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/9" class="indent">&quot;We have examples where social workers don't place a child with a family approved by a voluntary adoption agency because they don't have the money. Fees for using a voluntary adoption agency can be about &pound;6,000 more than using a local authority.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/10">In fact, some local authorities have free inter-relationships.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/11">The use of the voluntary adoption agencies is sharply declining because of costs. Barnardo's has written to me to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/12" class="indent">&quot;There are reports that there has been a reduction in placements to voluntary adoption agencies of up to 33 per cent. Barnardo's has placed 50 children for adoption in the last year, compared to 70 children in each of the previous two years&mdash;a 29 per cent drop in placements. We are concerned that if this decline continues the future of the voluntary adoption sector will be unsustainable.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/13">However, the fees that voluntary agencies charge are often heavily subsidised from fundraising. Delay&mdash;let us remember that that means already damaged children waiting months and years for placements&mdash;is demoralising for the children and it can sometimes lead to eventual failure in adoption. Stinting on placement fees with voluntary agencies, when children are waiting because a local authority cannot place them, is the economics of the madhouse anyway. Fostering a child costs anything from &pound;12,000 to &pound;25,000 a year, so an up-front fee, even at the upper end of that range, represents in the long run a massive saving to the authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/14">That problem is exacerbated by problems in local authorities and the courts concerning the implementation of the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which only recently came into force. There has been a massively disappointing downturn in the numbers of children adopted, from the peak of 3,800 to&mdash;the Minister may be able to confirm this figure&mdash;2,600 last year. That is the figure doing the rounds, but it has not been published yet. Much of the downturn has been driven by horrendous delays.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/15">The Consortium of Voluntary Adoption Agencies has sent me a string of cases in which the legal process from beginning to end, which is not the whole delay that a child faces, has taken 18 months or longer under the new system. It is extremely damaging for the children, who can no longer be placed temporarily with a couple, and for the agencies because of the delay to their cash flow caused by the delay in payments. Many are on the financial edge.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/16">I call on the Department to publish the report that it commissioned from Deloitte. Perhaps the Minister could explain the delay&mdash;I understand that it was finished last autumn&mdash;and provide us with a date for publication. More importantly, the Department should impress on local authorities that at a time when they have been provided with extra money for the purpose, the use of voluntary authorities to cut waiting lists of unhappy children is vital to those children. It makes excellent economic sense, even though it means social services departments having to bite their lips and pay out of stretched budgets for out-of-house activity. Equally, local authorities must sharpen up their court work in some parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/17">The other main problem is the sexual orientation regulations, the publication of which has been delayed until April. They threaten a number of agencies, especially the 13 branches of the Catholic Children's Society, which accounts for one third of the voluntary adoption sector. Like the rest of the sector, it takes a very difficult mix of children: almost one quarter of its clients have severe medical problems and well over half are in sibling groups. However, it has the lowest breakdown rate of any agency in the country, with an average of 3.6 per cent. in the latest year's figures. It is heavily subsidised by the Catholic Church&mdash;in fact, the annual collection for the society took place at my church last Sunday. Like all voluntary sector agencies, it provides a full range of activities, from information through to excellent post-adoption care.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/18">It may bring matters alive to provide an actual case. I am grateful to the Salford branch of the society for sending me details of three children with suspected autism. Time allows me to quote the details of just one:</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/19" class="indent">&quot;Jake was three when he was placed for adoption... Jake had waited a long time for a family. He had been placed with a very experienced foster carer who managed his extreme behaviour with difficulty. Jake had insecure attachments and screamed for long periods if he did not have the undivided attention of the foster carer. He had some obsessional behaviour in that he had to have doors closed, he did not like getting wet&mdash; even a few drops of rain on his trousers were enough to send him into a panic. His speech was and still is much delayed. The Local Authority...did feel a diagnosis of autism was likely. The LA social workers were so concerned about a family coping with his challenging behaviour that they asked his foster carer to provide a video of him&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/20">I stress: a video of him&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/21" class="indent">&quot;to show to prospective adopters. Jake's adoptive parents accepted him from the start. They were given the option to say no but felt that this little boy needed them.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/22">Happily all three children have now been adopted, and they are progressing well within their own limitations. However, all that is being put at risk. Nobody is missing out on the opportunity to adopt under the current arrangements. Gay couples form only 4 per cent. of the pool and, as far as the records show, only one gay couple has ever applied to the Catholic Children's Society. They were courteously and immediately referred to another agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/23">The society has for many years accepted single people, provided that they are not engaged in sexual activity, whether heterosexual or homosexual. However, the regulations require that every adoption organisation should have a charter explicitly declaring gay partnerships to be on a par with marriage. Jim Richards, who is, incidentally, a former Labour councillor, is the long-serving director of the largest branch of the Catholic Children's Society, which is in Westminster. He has commented:</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/24" class="indent">&quot;If we bow to the Government's Regulations we would, in recruiting adopters, have to state that we accept gay couples, as well as those we accept at present. This would need to be clear in all our published literature and in making public appeals at say, a church. We would not be able to state within the context of adoption, that it is our belief that a married couple is better for children than a gay couple. One needs to imagine the position committed Catholics would face in speaking to a group of sixth formers and extolling the virtues of marriage, with them rightly accusing the speaker of being a hypocrite.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/25">The problem is not confined to the Catholic Children's Society I have received an e-mail from Cornerstone North East Adoption and Fostering Services, a small but highly successful evangelical-based organisation which makes very similar points. Anyway, the strong statement by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York brings a wider dimension to the whole business.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.2/26">We should surely not be discussing the rights of a small number of prospective adoptive parents, who can approach a range of agencies anyway under the current arrangements. We should be thinking about the welfare of desperately disadvantaged children, who are currently handled by some of the best practitioners in the field working for the Catholic Children's Society. It is a field where good practitioners are in very short supply.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.113.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="113"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0007.htm#07022158000587">
	<p pid="b.113.0/1">It is not a question of blackmail; the issue is straightforward. The Catholic Church will not place children with gay couples and has a conscientious objection to doing so, and it cannot continue to do so within the scope of the new law.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/2">A number of wider issues are raised. I mentioned that of abortion, but one that is more immediately topical is that of governors' appointments of teachers to faith schools. The Catholic Church has a policy, as do the governors of other religious schools, that people who are living in unmarried relationships, whether heterosexual or homosexual, will not be appointed to teaching posts in its schools. Schools have been given an exemption from the legislation by the Government. It seems strange that schools that affect tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of what I might call ordinary children have been exempted, but no such way forward has so far been found for a very specific arrangement that affects only relatively small numbers of desperately disadvantaged children.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/3">Why should the Government say that Catholic and evangelical social workers cannot continue to carry out a highly professional job unless they agree&mdash;bearing in mind that there has been only one case in all the years that the process has been going on&mdash;publicly to proclaim opposition to their deeply held beliefs? The Government have allowed a two-year transition and Ministers have promised that no child already adopted will suffer. That is an ambitious pledge indeed, given the lack of after-care in a high proportion of authorities&mdash;45 per cent. have failed the inspectorate's tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/4">David Holmes, the new director of BAAF, has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/5" class="indent">&quot;BAAF campaigned to widen the pool of prospective adopters to ensure as many children as possible have the opportunity to be placed in loving families.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/6">In other words, BAAF strongly supported the move on gay adoption. However, he continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/7" class="indent">&quot;But we have also been concerned to ensure the expertise of Catholic agencies isn't lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/8" class="indent">We...believe this package should lead to a sensible solution. We look forward to hearing the detail and offering any assistance that we can.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/9">I am not quite as optimistic as him, but there is a possibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.0/10">To return to the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Stone made, I have seen a great deal of testimony on the clash of rights between competing groups&mdash;Christian rights and gay rights, for instance&mdash;but I wonder whether endless arguments about rights are the best way to resolve such increasingly common clashes, in what is becoming a more and more divided, fractured and unhappy country. No child will benefit from the application of the regulations to close successful organisations that help the most damaged children. The Government have allowed themselves two years to find a way of enabling some of the best agencies in a thin field to continue, within their consciences, to serve the most vulnerable members of our community&mdash;damaged and disabled children in care.</p>

	<p pid="b.114.2/1">First, I have urgent business in my constituency this evening, so I apologise that I shall not hear the summation speeches.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.2/2">I am a Catholic and I am a liberal, and I have agonised over clashing rights. There are issues on both sides. As a Catholic, I have helped my wife, who was formerly chair of a joint Catholic-Anglican adoption agency for six years. As a liberal, I sat with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1756" name="Evan Harris">my hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, West and Abingdon (Dr. Harris)</phrase> on the Committee that considered the Gender Recognition Act 2004, and he knows that I fought for those rights for recognition. I have also stood up for gay rights since I first became involved in politics many years ago. When two sets of rights appear to clash with each other, how do we resolve the matter? With the sexual orientation regulations, it appears that the legislation will ride one set of rights over another, but it does not have to do so. If I thought that there were a prima facie case for that and that some rights had to be subservient, I would accept that argument. However, I do not accept that argument.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.2/3">Let us consider faith-based rights. Catholics have their views about homosexuality. Not all Christians or even Catholics necessarily share the Church's view, but let us put that on one side for the moment. People have a right to their faith. We have recognised and extended that right in this country, so that people can give education, and so that other rights, concerning who they allow into their schools, are set to one side. In the past, people have traditionally also done that in the family context of adoption agencies, but we are in danger of cutting off something that is fundamental to adoption agencies&mdash;to work within a family context of adopted families. I would argue that that is not necessary to preserve the other set of rights, which are equally important.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.2/4">I shall come back to the other set of rights at the end of my speech. We have talked about the rights of the parents and the child&mdash;they have been well aired&mdash;but so far we have not discussed the adoption process and how it works. Given the details and pitfalls of the process, we do not need to impose the SOR across the board, as is proposed, to preserve both sets of rights effectively. Anyone who has gone through the adoption process or worked in a charity will know that potential parents are given the third degree. Some find the process extremely distressing, while others withdraw from it because of the intrusion into their lives by social workers trying to ensure that they are proper and fit people to bring up children.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.2/5">By and large, social workers get it right. However, there are difficulties in how they relate to different families. It is quite common for adoption agencies working with different ethnic groups to try to employ people from that ethnic background to work with those families, in order to have a better understanding of who those people are. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> has said, there is only one case on record of a gay couple coming to the Catholic adoption agency for approval, and they were referred on. Why would they do so? Would a gay couple really want a local priest to try to judge them and their lifestyle as appropriate to bringing up children?</p>
	<p pid="b.114.2/6">There are circumstances in which it might be entirely right for a gay couple to bring up a child. An example of that would be a child&mdash;particularly a girl, but also a boy&mdash;who had been severely abused by men. An entirely female setting might be the best setting for that child. The question is whether we would ask a Roman Catholic, a Muslim or someone else with strong religious views to judge whether that was the right setting, and whether that person would have the right values to judge whether such potential parents were suitable. Could that person ask the pertinent, searching questions without being offensive and in a way that came to right solution? I suggest that the answer is probably not.</p>
	<p pid="b.114.2/7">The adoption process as it currently exists is multi-faceted and needs to be so. The danger of the SOR is that it will homogenise the process and that we will return to the bad old days of a politically correct form of adoption that rules certain people out because they do not fit within a narrow definition. We only have to think back to the 1970s, when we had that sort of process. People were compartmentalised according to who could adopt whom, rather than considering individual families on a proper basis.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.116.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" speakername="Michael Weir" colnum="116"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0007.htm#07022158000593">
	<p pid="b.116.0/1">As you will be well aware, Mr. Marshall, in Scotland adoption is a devolved matter. I should also like to address the sexual orientation regulations, because there is a particular issue to do with Catholic adoption agencies that affects Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/2">I stress that I personally support the regulations. I note in passing that although there has been much comment on rights, no couple&mdash;gay or heterosexual&mdash;has a right to adopt. We should be considering the rights of the child, which seem to be lost in much of the smoke and fury around the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/3">As I have said, I personally do not agree with the stance of the Roman Catholic Church on gay adoption. I see absolutely no reason why gay couples cannot provide a loving and caring environment in which to bring up a child. However, the fact remains that Catholic adoption agencies, of which two operate in Scotland, provide a valuable service. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> has mentioned, they are particularly good at placing children who are otherwise difficult to place. It would be an utter tragedy if such agencies were unable to continue their valuable work because of this dispute.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/4">A specific Scottish dimension applies, because when the Scottish Parliament debated the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Bill, which allowed gay couples to adopt in Scotland, the matter of Catholic adoption agencies was canvassed. Indeed, amendments were introduced to try to ensure that Catholic adoption agencies would be able to continue their work. In his comments on those amendments, Robert Brown, the Liberal Democrat Deputy Minister for Education and Young People, made it clear that the equality law was the responsibility of the UK Parliament in respect of the sexual orientation regulations. He also stated that agencies would be required to comply with it and regulations made under it.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/5">It is also important to set out what Robert Brown said in the debate about the position of Catholic adoption agencies. He said that Peter Peacock, the then Minister for Education and Young People</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/6" class="indent">&quot;and I made it clear to the Education Committee and the Parliament that the Scottish ministers want faith-based adoption agencies to continue their work, which is a valuable additional service to the services that local authorities and others offer. Indeed, I want faith-based adoption agencies to find more adoptive parents, to provide services to a range of adults and children, and to appeal to their faith-based communities to secure more adoptive parents who can meet all the stringent requirements of the adoption process and can give good homes to children who need them. That is the central point that we should bear in mind. Ministers have consistently made it clear that nothing in the bill will alter the position or practices of Roman Catholic adoption agencies. In practice, if an adoption agency thinks that it is unable to assist a child or prospective adopter, it should refer them to another adoption agency that could provide the necessary service and support. That is the current practice of adoption agencies...Standard 20 of the national care standards for adoption agencies includes a power to refer people who cannot be assessed to another agency, so the amendment&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/7">which was to protect faith-based agencies&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/8" class="indent">&quot;will make no difference to what happens in practice. I hope that the Roman Catholic adoption agencies will be reassured by the reassurances that have been given at stage 2 and today on that matter.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/9">In the light of that, the Scottish Parliament took the view that nothing in the legislation would have impacted on how Catholic adoption agencies were operating and the Bill was enacted. That was right, because the Bill was dealing only with adoption and the right to adopt, not with the question of equality, which is a matter reserved to Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/10">However, the equality question was canvassed during the passage of the Bill. The Minister&mdash;Robert Brown again&mdash;specifically said:</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Equalities legislation is UK legislation, and agencies will be required to comply with it and regulations that are made under it. Peter Peacock and officials have engaged with the UK Government on how agencies will be affected. However, I say again that we do not intend to affect the practices of the Roman Catholic adoption agencies; rather, we want them to continue to do their good work.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/12">Clearly, Ministers at the Scottish Executive were in touch with UK Ministers to try to deal with the situation, because the Scottish Parliament recognised the need for the good work of the Catholic adoption agencies to be protected. It was understood that they would be allowed to continue to pass on people to other agencies. It was a practical compromise, to avoid the situation into which we now seem to have got ourselves. Will the Minister say what approaches were made by the Scottish Executive on the matter and what became of them?</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/13">The issue is important in Scotland. As I have said, the understanding was that if a gay couple approached the Catholic agency, they would be passed on to another agency. It is a great shame that that now appears effectively to have been undermined by the actions of the UK Government in refusing to allow the exemption under the sexual orientation regulations. At least we assume that they will refuse to do so, although we have not yet seen the regulations, but given those that have been introduced in Northern Ireland, one presumes that they will.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/14">The reasonable compromise that I have mentioned would not undermine the regulations. Despite some of the more outlandish allegations made in the letters that we receive about the sexual orientation regulations, the regulations already contain exceptions for religious reasons. For example, if I read it correctly, regulation 16&mdash;again, I refer to the Northern Ireland regulations&mdash;allows religious groups to refuse to rent out their premises to gay groups and others of which they disapprove. The problem is that that applies only when they are operating as a religious organisations. It does not apply to Catholic adoption agencies,which operate outwith the Church and fall under regulation 6, which applies to goods and services.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.0/15">It is right that we should legislate to prevent discrimination against gay people. However, in legislating, we sometimes need to heed the beliefs of others. Perhaps in this case a small compromise could avoid a serious problem with the adoption agencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.123.0/1">That worries me enormously, as does the fact that the nature of the regulations means that we shall not effectively be able to amend them. As I mentioned in the debate on the Human Rights Act on Monday there are specific requirements imposed on parliamentary draftsmen, including through the review of human rights by the Government, that, in a nutshell, all our legislation must be drafted to be compatible with the European convention on human rights. I do not believe that it is possible in this context to come up with a declaration as to compatibility when there are competing rights as in this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.123.0/2">In addition, adoption agencies were not mentioned at all in any discussion of the measure that I know of, except when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1463" name="John Bercow">my hon. Friend the Member for Buckingham (John Bercow)</phrase> raised it&mdash;I invite him to respond, but I presume that he did not just invent the point, and that someone may have suggested to him that it was an important question that needed to be raised. He specified the cases of general practitioners and adoption agencies. I have travailed and trawled through the debates, and I think that last November was the first time the matter was ever raised. In effect, the Government have created a legal presumption in favour of a particular principle, which, by virtue of the Equality Act itself should be condemned, because there is no such thing as complete equality between any one of the principles concerned. However, the Government have chosen to go down that route&mdash;I think against the advice of the Prime Minister and one or two others, including the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.127.0/1">I warmly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">my good and hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> on securing <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1844" name="William Cash">the debate. I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr. Cash)</phrase> said earlier: it is surprising to learn yet again that the regulations that form the core of the two challenges raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury will be pushed back by another month and will not be published until April, whereas we had the benefit of the Prime Minister's view in his statement. The matter was not discussed when the Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2006 were published and adopted, although I am sure that many hon. and right hon. Members received correspondence, because adoption did not form part of the Northern Irish remit.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/2">As my hon. Friend the Member for Stone has pointed out&mdash;I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has been greatly exercised by this, too&mdash;we did not have the chance to discuss the subject during the passage of the Equality Act 2006 through both Houses until an amendment was tabled at the latest possible stage on Third Reading in the House of Lords. That cannot be democratic, and it cannot be in the Government's interests not to allow debate. Perhaps the Minister will confirm my understanding on reading the Library note that the consultation document that formed the basis of the regulations, which we will discuss at a later stage, did not put the question of adoption services provided by either local authorities or voluntary agencies out to consultation. If that was the case, it is regrettable. That is why I warmly welcome the opportunity to debate the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/3">Like so many who have spoken this afternoon, I put the interests of the children at the starting point of every stage of the debate. I want to nail my personal colours to my moral mast: I place particular emphasis on marriage as a special relationship and was delighted to see the Archbishops of Canterbury and of York recognise that so warmly. That is not to say that I do not recognise that there are other relationships and other partnerships, but I believe that children brought up in a traditional marriage have the best of all possible starts in life. We recognise that not every child is fortunate enough to be the heart of that traditional family, and we have all noticed, up and down the country, the disappearance of the extended family. That leaves some 60,000 children in care, some for short periods before they are returned to their natural parents and others for longer periods. There are 61,000 children in care each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/4">I recognise and celebrate the work of all adoption agencies, including those which work for local authorities, and especially that of the voluntary adoptive sector. We know that adoption is a challenging and lengthy process, but it brings tremendous happiness and stability to a child, where they are successfully placed. In 2004-05, the voluntary adoption organisations in England and Wales placed 708 children, of whom 227 were placed by the Catholic adoption agencies. For <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1959" name="Michael Weir">the benefit of the hon. Member for Angus (Mr. Weir)</phrase>, I believe that the figures for the two Catholic adoption agencies in Scotland, where we share a common interest, show that 47 children were placed by them in 2006, of whom only two were disrupted. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has given us a tremendous opportunity to debate the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/5">The Minister faces a difficult situation. Perhaps he has had sight of the regulations that cover the main subject of the debate. In passing, however, I shall refer to the financial squeeze and the problems of delays up and down the country that have been caused by the courts. I want to pause for a moment to refer to an article in <i>The Sunday Telegraph.</i> One of the problems that we face in placing children for adoption is the shortage of adopters. I have been left in no doubt that one of the reasons for that is that parents who put themselves forward, initially as foster parents and ultimately as adoptive parents, often feel that they are on their own. They would certainly welcome more mentoring and training opportunities, and I hope that we can reach a cross-party consensus on that. Another problem is the huge fees faced by local authorities, which <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> put at up to &pound;26,000 per child. Clearly, if that situation is affecting the number of children who are placed in families for adoption, I hope that we all&mdash;and most importantly the Minister&mdash;will have regard to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/6">There is some good news. I want to pay tribute to the recent work of Kent county council&mdash;obviously, North Yorkshire county council is doing good work in this regard, too, but I do not have time to mention every county council. Kent county council has set out a wonderful example of best practice, and last year alone it placed 95 children with adoptive parents, which was a record for that council and for any other county council in the country. The methods that it has used have included family group conferencing and the staying together project. I hope that we can all learn from that and that the Minister will look favourably on those practices.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/7">I wish to focus only on a couple of questions given the time available and the importance of the debate. I believe that when the House comes to consider the sexual orientation regulations, it should not be asked to choose which form of discrimination is higher or lower. We should not be asked to choose whether we are in favour or not; we all oppose any form of discrimination on the grounds of sex, race, religion or any discrimination that came under the human rights umbrella. To force the House to decide in favour of one type of discrimination might create a new form of discrimination on the grounds of religious belief by forcing the former on other agencies, which are predominantly Catholic although, as my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury has pointed out, other religious voluntary adoption agencies&mdash;such as Cornerstone, which operates in the very north-east of England&mdash;also do some excellent work.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/8">Why are the Government forcing the House to make that choice? It was never made clear through the passage of the Equality Act 2006 that the matter would have to be faced in such a way. It was not made clear during the passage of the Adoption and Children (Scotland) Act 2007 in Scotland that there would be a threat to the Scottish Catholic adoption agencies, and it was certainly never made clear that it was an issue in the discussions on the Northern Irish sexual orientation regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/9">I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me that the regulations that his party proposes to put before the House in April will work. Have the Prime Minister and the Department for Education and Skills closed the door on any eventual compromise? Such a compromise would match the mood of those of us in this Chamber and of the House. We would all like to see a compromise, but my fear is that that will not be possible. There is not an umbrella organisation or a gateway process that would work. Who has been tasked with forming such an umbrella organisation to make the regulations work?</p>
	<p pid="b.127.0/10">Why were the Government reluctant to debate the issues earlier? Why did the consultation document not cover the point that we have discussed? Why have the regulations not been published? How can we have reached a situation where the Minister's party is considering not allowing a free vote, when such a vote should, by any stretch of democratic values, be allowed on moral judgment?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-02-21b.134.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" speakername="Paul Rowen" colnum="134"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070221/halltext/70221h0010.htm#07022158000617">
	<p pid="b.134.1/1">It is true that part of the letter said that, but, from talking to consultants at Rochdale, I know that further discussions were taking place about what joint services could be provided on both sites. If we are to have a genuine chance of providing the geographical coverage needed, facilities must be provided on both sites. That will be a far cheaper option than a newly created service at north Manchester. I hope that the independent review panel will give the proposal serious consideration and that Rochdale and Bury can work together to make it a reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/2">The Pennine Acute Hospitals NHS Trust is responsible for the Rochdale infirmary. It is the largest non-teaching trust in the country and was established four years ago. The trust's management has been heavily criticised by consultants, the unions, and Professor Alberti in his report published last year. It is heavily in debt and the chair and chief executive left under a cloud. Four years ago, I criticised the need for a four-hospital trust and subsequent events have demonstrated that it is too unwieldy. I hope that the Minister will consider alternatives, including splitting the trust into two; one based on the sites in Rochdale and Bury and one based on the sites in Oldham and north Manchester. That solution would be welcomed locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/3">Rochdale PCT is a three-star trust and in the top10 per cent. of PCTs in the country. The merger of Rochdale and Heywood and Middleton PCTs into one unified trust is a welcome move that builds on the strengths of both trusts. The Government say that changes in primary care services will negate the need for continued provision of many acute services based in hospitals. I support that, but the reality on the ground at the moment is rather different.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/4">The LIFT&mdash;local improvement finance trust&mdash;scheme to provide 10 combined centres throughout the borough of Rochdale is years behind schedule. Only one of the 10 centres has as yet received planning permission&mdash;two years late. I am aware, from talking to GPs, that there is real resistance to leaving purpose-built GP centres, which they own, for private finance initiative buildings with increased costs. Of 69 GPs in Rochdale, only one practice, as far as I am aware, has so far agreed to move.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/5">I want an assurance from the Minister that acute services at Rochdale infirmary will not be discontinued until replacement primary care facilities in Rochdale are in place. If she cannot give that assurance, she should not be surprised if we regard the Prime Minister's pledge on the NHS as hollow rhetoric.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/6">Perhaps of more concern is the development of ICATS&mdash;integrated clinical assessment and treatment services&mdash;which involves privately run treatment and diagnostic centres. Concern has been expressed elsewhere today to the Prime Minister about the effect of those centres on locally provided, publicly run NHS facilities. Can the Minister tell us where the centre for Rochdale will be sited and what analysis her Department has done of the effects on existing NHS services?</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/7">The Minister is aware, from our meetings on the provision of dental services in Rochdale, of my concern in that regard. She has admitted that, between 1997 and 2005, NHS dental registrations in Rochdale, under the old system, fell from 57 to 35 per cent. The new contracts change the way in which patients are counted, but that does not negate the fact that the number of people entitled to an NHS dentist has continued to decline. In an area with Rochdale's index of deprivation, that is not acceptable. I acknowledge that the PCT has opened an additional dental centre at Castlemere community centre and commissioned an additional two dentists, but that is a drop in the ocean when compared with the number of dentists who have gone to the private sector in the past few years. I would welcome an open debate with the Minister on what we can do to restore an NHS dental service to Rochdale. At the moment, an emergency-only service through the dental access centre is all that is available for the majority of Rochdale residents.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/8">I want to comment briefly on the provision of mental health services in Rochdale&mdash;the responsibility of the Pennine Care NHS Trust. Despite additional investment in capital refurbishment at the Birch Hill site, I am concerned that the trust's current deficit will result in further cuts in community services&mdash;a sector that has traditionally been underfunded not only in Rochdale but elsewhere. We need a commitment that there will be more investment, not less, in community mental health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.134.1/9">The NHS is acknowledged as the only living creation of the 1945 Labour Government. It was the product of a report written by Beveridge, a Liberal MP. We need to see that the words of the present Government are backed by actions and that there is a commitment to a full and free NHS delivered locally in Rochdale in the area of need. I look forward to the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="b.135.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1784" name="Paul Rowen">the hon. Member for Rochdale (Paul Rowen)</phrase> on securing the debate. He has raised concerns on a number of occasions about health service provision in his constituency, including dental services, to which I will return. It is also very good to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1466" name="David Chaytor">my hon. Friend the Member for Bury, North (Mr. Chaytor)</phrase> here and being allowed to contribute to the debate, because he has been greatly concerned to represent his constituents with regard to the health service provision in his area.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/2">I will return later to some of the details and questions raised by the hon. Member for Rochdale, but I should like to start by reflecting on some of the progress that has been made in his constituency. I was a little disappointed when he talked about the decline of the NHS in his area. I hope that he will join me in celebrating some of the improvements that have been made, not least because many of them are due to the very hard work and commitment of local NHS staff and have led to real changes in the quality of the services that are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/3">Of course, that hard work and commitment has been backed up by increased investment locally. The Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale PCT&mdash;I am glad that the hon. Gentleman welcomed the joining together of the trusts&mdash;is benefiting from that investment. Inthe current financial year, the PCT has received&pound;288 million, which will go up to &pound;316 million next year. We are talking about a real-terms increase of6.7 per cent. As a result, waiting times have plummeted and there have been major local achievements. The NHS walk-in centre in Rochdale is well established and has made a major contribution to reducing the burden on local accident and emergency departments, but it is also often extremely convenient for the local people who use it.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/4">The PCT, together with Bolton PCT, is developing a new generation of primary care facilities through the LIFT programme. The hon. Gentleman raised concerns about the LIFT scheme, but it is progressing well. We expect financial close in the next three months or so. It is true to say that some GPs prefer to retain their old premises, but I gather that the majority of GPs are backing the improved services that LIFT centres will deliver. We will see real improvements for patients. I can assure the hon. Gentleman that there is no intention of closing existing acute services untilthe LIFT schemes are operational. The plans for some 13 new health and social care centres will attract investment of some &pound;80 million to the area over the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/5">When talking about changes where services have traditionally been offered in acute hospitals, it is important that we consider the benefits that can be secured through such investment in the community. Across the whole of England, there is a shift from district general hospitals down to community services. That is better for people because the services are closer to home and it leaves the acute hospitals to do what absolutely needs to be done in a hospital setting.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/6">As the hon. Gentleman said, the pattern of future service provision in Rochdale and the wider area has been the subject of much public discussion over the past 18 months, as part of two reviews of health services across Greater Manchester. He mentioned the &quot;Healthy Futures&quot; review that looked at changes to acute hospital services across north-east Manchester. There was good public engagement in that consultation&mdash;about 4,000 formal responses were received.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/7">In September, the joint committee of PCTs decided that three of the hospitals covered by the review&mdash;Fairfield general hospital, North Manchester general hospital and the Royal Oldham hospital&mdash;would provide acute medicine and accident and emergency services. It also decided that Rochdale infirmary would be developed as a local hospital that would provide a range of services including dental, mental health and social services.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/8">I want to touch briefly on dental services because the situation in Rochdale is an example of why it is important to devolve money to local level. Previously, if a dentist left the NHS, there was no money left locally to replace those services. Under the new system, at least there is money locally to provide some of the services that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. That has been happening in Rochdale. There is still some way to go, but at least we are able to retain money locally, so that services can be recommissioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.135.0/9">The hon. Gentleman talked about mental health services. We have developed new community mental health services, and we have been anxious to ensure that those services do not suffer disproportionately if there are financial constraints or problems. I am glad for his support for mental health services. It is important that they continue to be delivered effectively, because that is the way to ensure that people have access to them not only quickly, but, crucially, in their own communities, so that we can reduce hospital admissions as much as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.139.1/1">I am delighted to have secured this debate on the important issue of therapeutic support services for children who have suffered abuse. My personal interest stems from my role as a parliamentary ambassador for the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, my work as an MP in Dewsbury, and my being someone who has supported ChildLine for many years.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/2">It is a fact that many children who have been abused are not receiving therapeutic services and that such services will help them to overcome the effects of abuse. That situation surely cannot continue, because it devastates children's lives and damages their life chances.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/3">Last year, I tabled an early-day motion supporting the NSPCC's campaign to encourage children to speak out about sexual abuse. It recognised that many abused children do not receive the support that they need to deal with the serious and lasting damage caused by abuse and it called for access to therapeutic services. It was only tabled in May of the last Session, and in just two months it received 247 signatures from MPs of all parties. Despite the late tabling, it was the 23rd most signed early-day motion out of 3,158. That clearly demonstrates the importance attached to this issue by Members of Parliament from all political parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/4">Before I focus on the problem, I want to acknowledge this Government's outstanding record. They have rightly made it a priority to improve educational standards for all and to reduce social exclusion, antisocial behaviour and the number of young offenders. I know that my concerns about offences against children are shared, and that Ministers at the Department for Education and Skills, which has primary responsibility for the safeguarding of children, have done a huge amount of work on prevention. A great deal of work has been done between the Department of Health, the DFES and the Home Office on the subject, including the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006. This Government have done more than any previous Government to attempt to prevent abuse and safeguard children from it, so I commend them.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/5">Where abuse occurs, our objective must be clear: to have a society in which all abused children are provided with the support and care they need to enable them to come to terms with their experiences and to rebuild their childhoods and lives. While I fully acknowledge the work that the Government have done through the victims of violence and abuse prevention programme and the development of sexual assault referral centres for children in London and Manchester, many children still do not receive the help they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/6">I should outline the scale of the problem in this country. The NSPCC's study of the prevalence of child maltreatment found that 16 per cent. of children had experienced some form of sexual abuse, a quarter of children had experienced one or more forms of physical violence during childhood and 6 per cent. of children had experienced frequent and severe emotional maltreatment during childhood. Today, there are more than 30,000 children on child protection registers because they are at risk of abuse, and, on average, nearly 700 children are added to those registers in the UK each week.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/7">While some children are at risk from strangers, it is often those closest to them, be that a carer, relative or family friend, who pose a significant threat. Some 1 per cent. of children experienced abuse by a parent or carer, 3 per cent. were abused by another relative during childhood and 11 per cent. were abused by people known but unrelated to them. Those statistics are shocking, but they do not give the full picture. Three quarters of sexually abused children did not tell anyone about the abuse at the time, 27 per cent. told someone later, and about a third still had not told anyone about their experiences by early adulthood.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/8">It is difficult to gauge the numbers of children and young people who currently receive therapeutic services to help them overcome abuse. Different forms of abuse co-exist&mdash;all forms of abuse involve emotional abuse, while sexual abuse often involves physical abuse, and so on. One detailed study in 2001 on the provision of therapeutic services for sexually abused children estimated that 90 per cent. of children who had experienced sexual abuse had received no substantial support.</p>
	<p pid="b.139.1/9">Research into the effects of child abuse shows serious and lasting harm to those affected. For them, the horror of abuse does not stop when the abuse stops&mdash;it continues into adulthood, often seriously impairing their life chances. According to a recent study by Hammersley and Read, two thirds of people with schizophrenia have been physically or sexually abused as children.</p>

	<p pid="b.143.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this Adjournment debate on an issue that should be of supreme importance to every Member of the House and every person in our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/2">The sexual abuse of children is not new in our generation, but perhaps it is more spoken about and more open than ever before. The more it is spoken about and the more open it is, the more society begins to realise the devastating consequences for children and young people who go through the experience. The reality of the impact on the child or young person should be outrageous enough for us to believe that we need to act. However, we should remember that the impact is often lasting for the child or young person's future life. We should also remember that those children and young people often become parents, and that that damaging experience as a child can affect their experience of parenting and bringing up their own families. That is not the only horrendous impact on children and young people. There is also an impact inter-generationally, and on our community and society in a variety of ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/3">As my hon. Friend has said, there is strong evidence to suggest that if we can intervene quickly and early and ensure that such children and young people have access to appropriate professional and therapeutic services, the economic and financial gains are indisputable. Failure to do that will lead not only to many more members of society being incredibly damaged, but to a knock-on effect on the social fabric and economic success of our country. Early intervention, and understanding the importance and power of the issue is incredibly important.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/4">We must still ensure that in the context of any debate about the sexual abuse of children we must first do everything in our power to use all the resources at our disposal to minimise for every child the risk of being sexually abused. We still have responsibilities to ensure that the social and health care system works properly in an integrated way to safeguard children to maximum effect. We all know of the horrendous cases that are highlighted in the media, and we also know that 99 per cent. of the function that social workers fulfil leads to the protection of many children at risk. In debates such as this, we should pay tribute to the professionals on the front line who battle every day to support some of our most vulnerable children. No Member of this House, however hard we work, can totally understand the emotional experience of being a professional social worker in child care, perhaps with a case load of 20, 30 or more children and young people who are at risk of being or have been abused.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/5">The system has grotesquely let down children in some circumstances, and those circumstances have been brought to the attention of this House and our society over the years. The everyday heroes who protect children in a most remarkable way are rarely given credit in such debates. We must consider the progress that has been made in recent times. Having reflected on that progress, we must consider how we can do even better in the future. I shall spend a couple of minutes articulating some of the positive action that has been taken to try to improve the situation for children who have been sexually abused.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/6">The Department of Health, together with the Mental Health Foundation, has funded a study into psychotherapy for girls aged six to 14 who have been sexually abused. It will not come as any surprise to my hon. Friend or to other Members that the study found high rates of depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. For those children psychotherapy was an effective treatment, and in those circumstances it had lasting benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/7">In my days as Minister with responsibility for young people, which seem like a long time ago, I spent a lot of time during 2001-02 just talking to young people. One experience that shocked me were conversations with young girls, who frequently told me that self-harm was a major issue among themselves and their friends. We, as a society, have not even begun to highlight or to focus on that issue or on what is happening in the real world. However, I do not want to be misquoted: I am not saying that self-harm is always related to sexual abuse, because that would be entirely misleading and inappropriate. There is, none the less, evidence that some self-harm is directly related to children and young people who are being sexually abused. I wanted to use the debate to flag up the issue of self-harm among youngsters, and to say that throughout the Government, we have a responsibility to take it seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/8">I shall move on to other developments. In November 2006, our Department and the Department for Education and Skills published a report that considered the progress made in promoting the mental health and psychological well-being of children and young people. It highlighted that although CAMHS has made enormous strides in recent years in helping more children and families, and in doing so more promptly, there is still a need for substantial improvements to services.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/9">Information from the CAMHS mapping exercise for 2005 shows that in the last three years the number of CAMHS staff has increased by more than 40 per cent., and that the number of cases seen also increased by more than 40 per cent. During the same period, recorded annual expenditure on CAMHS increased from &pound;283 million to more than &pound;500 million. I remain committed to ensuring that we continue that progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/10">We will report very soon not only on the target that we set for the development of CAMHS services throughout the country, but on how I intend to maintain the pressure in the system, particularly in the health service, to ensure that once the target period is over we keep our eye on the ball to maintain investment and to focus on the importance of CAMHS services. It simply will not be enough to say, &quot;Here is the target and here is our report on how we have done against it.&quot; The prioritisation of CAMHS services in the national health service is equally important.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/11">We work closely with the Department for Education and Skills on those issues. We also work with other organisations. For example, with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence we are working on guidance on the identification and recognition of all forms of child abuse. Guidelines are expected in late 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/12">We are working with the Home Office, the DFES, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children and other voluntary sector organisations, providing services for sexually abused children through the joint Department of Health and National Institute for Mental Health in England victims of violence and abuse prevention programme. The objective is to equip professionals and services to identify and respond to the needs of children and adolescents who have been sexually abused, raped or sexually assaulted, or of victims of sexual exploitation through prostitution, pornography and trafficking. I look forward to seeing the national service guidelines that the programme will publish later this year on therapeutic and preventive interventions with sexually abused and exploited children.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/13">With the Home Office, the Department of Health has been supporting the establishment of sexual assault referral centres, a joint service for victims of rape and sexual assault provided locally by health and police services and the voluntary sector. St. Mary's hospital in Manchester and The Havens in London, as my hon. Friend has said, have piloted children's services, and they are being evaluated.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/14">We are also working with the Home Office on behalf of young people who sexually abuse, a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1546" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid-Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>. Many were victims of abuse in their childhoods. We have recently published two research reports: one provides evidence that interventions can be effective in preventing new or continued abuse; the other studies links between sexually abusive behaviour and emerging severe personality disorder traits in childhood. That makes it all the more important to provide early and effective interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.143.0/15">To support that work, a national strategy is nearing completion, and with it we will publish guidelines on therapeutic and preventive interventions. That directly responds to a point that the hon. Lady&mdash;to her credit&mdash;has raised time and again in this House. The hon. Lady is the Member for Mid-Dorset and&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="b.146.0/1">North Poole. Sorry about that, Mr. Marshall. It is not often that I credit a Liberal Democrat Member with anything in this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Dewsbury knows that I have met the NSPCC formally to discuss the issues before us. I also want to pay tribute to his role more generally as an ambassador for the NSPCC in this House. He does a tremendous job in ensuring that the voice of children is heard loudly.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/3">Reflecting on last week's report about our international standing on children and young people's well-being, I was concerned about the way in which it was presented, because it did not make any reference whatever to the Government's every child matters programme, children's centres, Sure Start, universal nursery provision, massively expanded child care or the beginning of work on emotional and social behaviour in primary schools. None of that work will feed through for a generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/4">This Government are often accused of going in for short-term initiatives and for headlines, but there are no short-term political benefits in investing in such early years prevention. No other Government in the history of this country have done as much as this Government to create an architecture in which such early intervention is offered to families during the earliest years, when the greatest difference is made.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/5">Although I am not complacent about that international study, on which we must reflect, we must balance the coverage of the issue before us. None of the findings has reflected on the new approach to early intervention and to early years provision that this Government have created for the first time in the history of this country. It was sadly lacking from the debate that rightly took place about the way in which we should react to the fact that our children and young people are regarded as not being as well and as happy as we would all want them to be.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/6">Currently, a child who is sexually abused does not automatically need access to mental health services, and universal health services may be adequate for addressing some needs of those children and young people. However, we have agreed that later this year there will be a scoping event to bring together all people with an interest in the provision of services for sexually abused children. That will take place in direct response to my meeting with the NSPCC and to my conversation with Mary Marsh, who does a wonderful job.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/7">We must reflect on whether the policy is right. Should we as a country say that a child who is sexually abused ought to have automatic priority access to child and adolescent mental health services? That is not the current position, but the NSPCC has a strong case when it argues that it ought to be the presumption for children in such circumstances. My hon. Friend has raised an important issue, and I promise him that the Government and I take it exceptionally seriously. I expect to see some real progress in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.146.0/9" class="italic">Adjourned accordingly at Five o'clock.</p>
