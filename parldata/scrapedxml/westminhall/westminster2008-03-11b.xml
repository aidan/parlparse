<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-11b.27.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1406" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="27"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080311/halltext/80311h0005.htm#08031194000483">
	<p pid="b.27.0/1">The hon. Lady is correct; where things have been done right, that should be acknowledged. On the floods, the Audit Commission considered the financing of local government in relation to floods and emergencies, and described the situation as incoherent, overlapping and very poor&mdash;that is not an exact quote, but I think it was the conclusion that was reached. To put those figures in context, the insurance companies has spent in excess of &pound;3 billion, on which they are forced to pay VAT. The Exchequer has therefore received hundreds of millions of pounds as a direct result of the flooding. The sums it has put back do not adequately compensate councils, such the East Riding of Yorkshire, for the damage that has been sustained, not least to the highways. The sum will emerge over the next couple of years, but we should put it in context. I completely agree with the hon. Lady; justice should be done and recognition should be given where it is deserved.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/2">Nobody is saying that the region should have parity with London, which is a major international city and finance centre with specific needs, but what is the justification for Yorkshire doing so badly compared with other regions? A number of recent reports have set out in detail the economic rewards that the region would gain if more money were invested in transport infrastructure. A report from the think-tank Centre for Cities suggests that if the necessary investment was made in its public transport infrastructure and a park-and-ride scheme, the local economy in and around Leeds would benefit to the tune of &pound;68 million a year. The report concluded that improvements to the trans-Pennine rail link and to the M1 and M62 would benefit the cities of Manchester and Leeds to the tune of &pound;225 million a year. The Northern Way report, &quot;North-South Connections&quot;, published in August 2007, states that investment in north-south and east-west rail links would benefit the economy by up to &pound;10 billion. The Institute for Public Policy Research states in its report that</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/3" class="indent">&quot;two of the northern regions&mdash;the North East and Yorkshire and the Humber&mdash;appear to lose out significantly from the current distribution of public investment in transport: the Department for Transport should review its future funding allocations to make sure that these regions get a fair share of funding&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/4">whatever that funding is. That goes to the heart of what hon. Members from all parties and I want to say to the Government today: we accept that increased investment has been made, but we would like an explanation of the rationale involved and a fair share of the investment made nationally, according to a criteria that we, as Members of Parliament, can understand.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/5">I would also like to raise the issue of the Humber bridge and its tolls. The Minister will know that the original quote for building the Humber bridge&mdash;we all know why it was built at the time of a by-election in 1966&mdash;was &pound;28 million. As a result of Government procurement and management&mdash;or mismanagement&mdash;that figure trebled while the bridge was being built. Over the years, in the hands of Governments of all parties, the debt has been left to sit on Government books, although I pay credit to the Government for writing down some of that debt in the Treasury's books. The debt in public accounts is now &pound;300 million more than the original quote of &pound;28 million to build the bridge, as it is &pound;333 million. It is my constituents and the constituents of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1814" name="Angela Smith">the hon. Member for Sheffield, Hillsborough (Ms Smith)</phrase> who are paying for that, as they pay the highest toll in the country to cross the bridge. The tolls also have an economic impact on the region. I would like to inform the Minister, if she does not already know, that the local authorities will produce a report later this year that will consider the economic impact of the Humber bridge tolls. I hope that I have readied her for receipt of the report later in the year. Removing the tolls could have a positive economic impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.27.0/6">I have come to the end of my remarks within the 20 minute margin. The Minister has influenced community hospital policy to the betterment of my constituents, so I hope that she can influence Government and that, particularly as the Minister for Yorkshire and the Humber, she can concentrate on representing Yorkshire in government rather than the other way round. I trust that, with her talents and arts of persuasion, she will be able to do precisely that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2008-03-11b.56.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1915" speakername="Peter Bone" colnum="56"  time="013:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200708/cmhansrd/cm080311/halltext/80311h0009.htm#08031194000522">
	<p pid="b.56.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Bercow. It is a great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/2">I congratulate my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1536" name="Patrick McLoughlin">the Member for West Derbyshire (Mr. McLoughlin)</phrase> on securing from Mr. Speaker an extraordinarily important debate for people have to use the railway line through the east midlands. I also welcome the Minister. I always find it difficult to criticise such an excellent, competent Minister, whom the Government always seem to put up to defend the indefensible. As always, I hope that Jim will fix it. I am grateful that we have a little more time than was originally expected, which enables me to make these few comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/3">Midland Mainline, the previous franchise holder, was popular in my area. It was a good train operator that often won the train operator of the year award, the staff were friendly and I had no complaints from my constituents about the service. Lo and behold, it lost the franchise and along came East Midlands Trains. The managing director of that company, Mr. Tim Shoveller, kindly met me at the House of Commons. I am pleased to report that, despite what my constituents think, he does not carry a little fork and does not have two horns sticking out of his head. However, that is the feeling in the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/4">We have had a downgraded service since East Midlands Trains took over the train service; there is no question about that. The frequency of the trains has been reduced and seat reservations for season ticket holders&mdash;the most important customers of the railway, who pay thousands of pounds out of their income each year to travel from Wellingborough to London&mdash;have been withdrawn. People are paying thousands of pounds a year, but they cannot get a seat and they cannot be guaranteed a seat from Wellingborough to London. That has caused the most enormous uproar. Of course, the trains were already overcrowded.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/5">So the trains are overcrowded, the number of trains has been cut and people cannot get their seat reservation. My constituents, and those of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1661" name="Philip Hollobone">the Member for Kettering (Mr. Hollobone)</phrase>, are extremely annoyed about what has happened. I should like to blame East Midlands Trains and say that it had nothing to do with the Government, but unfortunately that is not so. The Government say that they will solve overcapacity and undercapacity by having lots more carriages&mdash;perhaps 1,300 or 1,500&mdash;but how many will East Midlands Trains get? It will get three more. So that will not solve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/6">I talked to the managing director of East Midlands Trains and asked, &quot;Why are you doing all these things? When you cut the service, why did you increase the cost of the fares by more than twice the rate of inflation? Did you do it to save money?&quot; I then said, &quot;What about the tea and coffee?&quot; The nice thing about Midland Mainline was that it gave people a free cup of tea or coffee. East Midlands Trains took that away, saying, &quot;Ah, that costs &pound;1 million a year, Mr. Bone.&quot; I said, &quot;So what? You charge enough for your fares: you've just bumped them up enormously.&quot; I was told, &quot;It is all down to a problem that we have. It's the Government.&quot; I asked, &quot;How can it be the Government? You run the service. The Government tell me that it is nothing to do with them and that you run it.&quot; &quot;Ah&quot;, the managing director said, &quot;it is because we have to pay the Government a premium for the service.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/7">I was told that my constituents who travel by rail are subsidising other people travelling by rail around the country. I thought that that was nonsense and could not possibly be true, so I asked the Secretary of State for Transport a parliamentary question. The reply I received says:</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Stagecoach Midland Rail Limited&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/9">that is, East Midlands Trains&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/10" class="indent">&quot;will pay a premium of &pound;133 million (net present value)&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/11">which will be a great deal more in actual cash terms,</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/12" class="indent">&quot;over the life of the franchise.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2008-03-04.2262"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 March 2008; Vol. 472, c. 2262W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/13">The cuts are deliberately the Government's fault. I hope that the Minister will be able to sort that out and improve the service from Wellingborough to London.</p>
