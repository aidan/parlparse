	<p pid="a.6.0/1">I think that I am correct in saying that the hon. Gentleman referred to the incomes of the most prosperous in society having increased more slowly than those at the bottom. That does not tie up with the Government's own action plan on social exclusion, which is very candid and says that:</p>
	<p pid="a.6.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Those on the very lowest incomes have seen the lowest rates of income growth. The very bottom 5 per cent. of incomes have increased by around 1 per cent. per year in real terms between 1996-97 and 2004-05, compared with annual increases of between 2 and 3 per cent. for the rest of the population.&quot;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.6.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" speakername="Alan Milburn" colnum="6"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0001.htm#07062658000226">
	<p pid="a.6.3/1">I am aware of the latest figures, and I am also aware of the position over the past decade. Income has risen across the deciles, particularly for the bottom 20 per cent. All the measures that have been put in place, such as the minimum wage and tax credits, have made a real difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/2">It is not just on income that a difference has been made. People sometimes say&mdash;I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is tempted to say it on occasions&mdash;&quot;Well, we might have seen a lot of money going to the public services, but what difference has it made?&quot; Well, take education. The primary schools in the most disadvantaged areas of the country have improved almost twice as fast as those in the most affluent areas. City academies, to which I know the hon. Gentleman is a convert&mdash;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Perhaps <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> is not, as he is grunting again. Their results are improving at four times the national rate despite their having twice the number of kids on free school meals. The number of state school entrants to the top universities has increased by more than a third since 1997.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/3">Perhaps most critically of all, at least for the long term, the Government have done something that no previous Government have done: invested heavily in child care and early years development, learning lessons from the Scandinavian countries, which have managed to use universal child care as a weapon to both tackle inequality and speed up social mobility. On each of those fronts, the progress of recent years has laid the foundation for increased social mobility in future years. Indeed, I noted with interest a publication yesterday by the Sutton Trust arguing that although social mobility remains too low compared with other countries, its decline over many decades has finally bottomed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/4">Here I must be candid. The ossification of British society, which set in over many decades, will take more than one decade to unfreeze. It is true that the glass ceiling has been raised; it is equally true that we have not yet broken through it. Breaking the relationship between class origin and class destination is a battle for the long term and requires a holistic approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/5">I was taken by the comments of the winner of the Nobel prize for economics, Amartya Sen, who rightly said that families could suffer not only economic but cultural, social, housing and educational disadvantage. That points us to the policy agenda that is needed: one that moves beyond the focus of the traditional welfare state on correcting the outcomes of market-driven inequalities such as low wages and family poverty retrospectively, and towards an approach that proactively reduces inequality and advances mobility by tackling the roots of the problems, not just dealing with their symptoms.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/6">It is assumed by some, even in the House, that individual advance can come only through the state getting off the back of the individual citizen or local community. For others in the House a bigger role for the state is the answer. In fact, a mobile society requires two things: an active state and active citizens. Only the state can equalise opportunities throughout life and empower its citizens. Equally, only individual citizens can seize those opportunities and realise their aspirations to progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/7">Tackling inequality and speeding up social mobility have pervaded much of what Government Departments have done in the past decade, whether reforming benefits or building houses. I commend the new focus in the social exclusion action plan on families who suffer multiple deprivation and struggle to get a foothold on the ladder into mainstream society. Family policy in general, and those families in particular, are rightly a priority. With a new Prime Minister and a new Administration just around the corner, there is an opportunity to give the social mobility agenda renewed momentum and new prominence as the core purpose for the whole of Government. There is a strong case for consulting widely and then publishing a White Paper, an action plan on social mobility to parallel our action plan on social exclusion, to set out how the Government intend to get Britain moving socially in the next 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/8">I shall suggest what some of the key elements of such an holistic approach might be. The first is an economic policy that places renewed emphasis on high skills, not low wages, as the best route to full employment in every region and nation of Britain. The Government's record on jobs is second to none but, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has rightly acknowledged, economic inactivity rates remain far too high. The ethnic minority employment rate gap, although closing, remains at 15 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/9">Of course, some people are unable to work&mdash;those with a severe disability, for example. But in an economy with job vacancies and skills shortages, and when we are importing labour from abroad to deal with those problems, policy makers should not be shy of focusing on those in some of our communities who remain work-shy. We need both more carrots and more sticks to deal with that problem: a rising minimum wage, greater conditionality in the benefit system and a new accent on lifelong learning&mdash;all will have a part to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/10">Lifelong learning is key. In the past ten years educational standards have risen and the number of adults without any qualifications has fallen, but my constituency is not alone in having far too many people who still lack any qualification. According to a recent report by Dr. Tony Chapman of Teesside university, results in local schools have risen sharply in recent years, but more than 20 per cent. of adults in Darlington still do not have any qualifications. Unsurprisingly, Darlington's core economic problem is no longer high unemployment, which has fallen by 50 per cent. since 1997 as new jobs, businesses and business parks have sprung up all over the town. The problem is low wages, linked to the quality of some of the jobs on offer. That, according to Dr. Chapman, limits social mobility.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/11">That is not just a priority to address locally, although the ever enterprising Darlington partnership is working with the local council, colleges, schools and business to deal with it. It must be the core national economic priority. The generation of the late 1950s, of which I am part, were the beneficiaries of a mobility in society that came about because of a change in the economy: the advent of a more service-based economy and the greater professionalisation of jobs, which created what the academics call &quot;more room at the top.&quot; Likewise, today's generation can potentially benefit from an even more fundamental change towards a more skilled, less unskilled economy that will once again create new room at the top. Realising that potential means recognising that while economic stability is fundamental, knowledge holds the key to Britain's future both economically and socially.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/12">Secondly, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1982" name="John Barrett">the hon. Gentleman the Member for Edinburgh, West (John Barrett)</phrase> said a moment ago, a knowledge economy means that education will become ever more significant in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.6.3/13">Despite the good progress of recent years, if we are honest, the attainment gap remains far too wide. A child who is not on free school meals is twice as likely to get five good GCSEs than a child who is. Just over one third of black Afro-Caribbean boys get five good GCSEs when the national average is two thirds, which some believe is because, in some way, intelligence is unevenly distributed in our society. I have never believed that or that ability is unevenly distributed in society. I have always believed that it is opportunity and, in the end, power that is unevenly distributed. I applaud the Government's efforts to break the cycle of educational disadvantage and welcome city academies and trust schools, personalised learning for better discipline, a focus on early-years development, and the new focus on the so-called softer social skills, all of which will make a difference. However, I also believe that we need to do more to ensure that good schools are just as accessible to poorer parents as to those who are better off. The truth is that the wealthier someone is; the more choice they get. We can see that happening in our education system. Selection by academic ability may have largely gone, with the exception of a few grammar schools and the independent schools, to which my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire referred. However, selection by social position still lingers in our school system.</p>

	<p pid="a.9.1/1">My hon. Friend is right in the sense that people who have a private education&mdash;in his country we rather bizarrely call it a public education, which confuses people from abroad&mdash;have certain advantages. My point is that, by in large, for the 93 per cent. of children who go to state school, selection has disappeared. That is a good thing. However, the truth is that there is a different and more covert form of selection because if someone is wealthy, they can opt out of the system or buy extra tuition. Alternatively, people can use an indirect market mechanism, such as buying a home near a good school. I am not saying that those are bad things. My point is that if choice is available to some, it should be available to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/2">If affluence still buys attainment in our school system, that inevitably restricts mobility. For some, the answer lies in more academic selection and a return to grammar schools, but there is precious little evidence that the selection of pupils by schools does anything to close the attainment gap. The evidence from countries as diverse as Denmark, Sweden and the United States points in a different direction: it does not help if schools select pupils; it is parents being able to choose schools that raises standards generally and helps disadvantaged children particularly. That is why I believe that parents with children in badly performing schools, which are invariably in the poorest areas, should be given a new right to choose an alternative state school. I propose that such parents should be able to choose what I have called an education credit, which would be worth perhaps 150 per cent. of the cost of educating the child in their current school. That would give a positive incentive to the alternative school&mdash;the better one&mdash;to the take the child and expand the intake numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.9.1/3">I know that whenever such proposals are floated, there are sometimes legitimate concerns and objections, but it is simply not right that we should tolerate so many disadvantaged children still being let down by the schools system. Correcting that injustice means shifting the balance of power to put more choice in the hands of those parents that the system currently disempowers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.10.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" speakername="Alan Milburn" colnum="10"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0002.htm#07062658000230">
	<p pid="a.10.1/1">There is sometimes a poverty of aspiration, but we must try to understand what that is and how it has arisen. I think that it has arisen because of a sense of disempowerment in the system. The truth is, if someone is poor, they do not have much power. If someone lives in a poor community, they feel that the world is against them and actually it often is. The school and police system does not seem to work for such people; they bang on the door and are not heard and we must address that. I am not saying that education standards, systems of inspection or rooting out bad teachers does not have a part to play. I believe that it does. Getting the organisational autonomy of the school right has a huge part to play, which is why, like my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire, I welcome the city academies and trust schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/2">In the end, we must find a way to change the accountability of the system and to give more power to parents who feel that they have no power in the system. Conversely, if someone is better off, they feel that they do have some power because they can exercise some leverage and control in their lives. That is a good thing, not a bad thing. Power should not be taken away from people, but should be given to more people, which is why, in my view, my proposal has merit as an addition to and not a substitute for all the other things that are being done to tackle precisely the issue to which my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford, North referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/3">My third point is that if we think that it is only wealth that is unevenly distributed in society, social mobility will not advance. That is not the case; it is also a matter of power. If Britain is to get moving again socially, people need to be able to get not just a job, training or child care, but to enjoy greater control and have a bigger say in how they run their lives. Of course, beating crime, creating jobs and regenerating estates can all help, but in my experience the cloud of despondency that hangs over some of the poorest communities will only ever be dispelled if we allow individual citizens and local communities to share more directly and evenly in how those communities are run. I am pleased that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has properly recognised that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/4">That is why I argue for a new principle at the heart of our governance, for which David Marquand and others have also argued. The principle is one of subsidiarity, where power is located at the lowest possible level consistent with the wider public good. If it is possible for people to exercise power individually&mdash;people can do so by choosing a hospital or school that is right for them&mdash;that is where power should be located. When it is not possible for people to exercise power individually&mdash;for example most of us would have some difficulty in choosing our own police officer&mdash;power should be located at the next possible level, which is in the local community. Where services are failing, communities should have the legal right to have them replaced; where communities can run their own services&mdash;whether children's centres, housing estates and local parks&mdash;they should be helped to do so. The community should be given a bigger say over other services, most notably local police and health services, by making them subject to direct election at the ballot box.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/5">The thing that I learned most during my time in government was that government can do much, but there are limits. Doing things to people does not really work; it is doing things with them that is the key&mdash;whether that is improving health, fighting crime or regenerating communities. We must move from a top-down to a bottom-up approach towards governance and give citizens and communities far more of a stake in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/6">That brings me to the final area of policy that I believe can make the biggest contribution to social mobility&mdash;giving individuals and families a stake in the future by establishing Britain as a democratic, asset-owning democracy. There is compelling evidence that financial asset-holding improves individual and social outcomes over and above factors such as educational attainment. Certainly, the evidence from the national child development study of a cohort of children born in 1958&mdash;incidentally, that seems to have been a good year for surveys&mdash;demonstrates a positive link between asset-holding at the age of 23 and welfare outcomes later in life. Those with assets tended to spend less time unemployed and enjoy better health. There is similar evidence from the United States where, for example, home owners are more active in local politics and neighbourhood organisations than non-home owners.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/7">Ownership works. Larry Summers once famously observed that no one ever washed a rental car. He was right. It is ownership that encourages people to act responsibly and behave independently. Spreading asset ownership is crucial, therefore, to tackling inequality and speeding social mobility. The most substantial inequity in a modern society such as our own is no longer between income groups, but between those who have a pension, and own shares or a house and those who rely purely on benefits and wages. That is why I favour employee share ownership, which I want us to do much more to encourage.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/8">That is also why I want us to do much more to encourage home ownership, where, as the Chancellor said to the Labour conference on Sunday, there is a need for urgent action. Changes in the housing market threaten to make inequality wider and further impede social mobility. We can see that in London where a child of home-owning parents stands to inherit an asset worth an average of &pound;330,000. A class mate whose family rents stands to inherit nothing. The housing market, therefore, threatens to impede social mobility, rather than enhance it. Of course, in recent decades, home ownership has grown sharply and the Government have ambitious plans to expand it further. However, escalating house prices mean that getting on to the housing ladder is becoming more difficult, which is not an issue for London and the south-east only; it is an issue in virtually every constituency in every part of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/9">The Government are right, therefore, to address the issue of housing supply&mdash;we need to build more housing and social housing. That is a priority. However, as two recent reports by the Department of Communities and Local Government suggest, given a choice, most people would prefer to buy, not rent. Well over 1.5 million social tenants still aspire to home ownership and although it is welcome that 80,000 households have been helped to do so through Government shared ownership schemes, again much more needs to be done. With fewer people able to afford to buy outright, more first-time buyers and young families are dependent on parents for financial help and with just five per cent. of tenants given the opportunity to buy through the Government's &quot;Social HomeBuy&quot; scheme, further reforms are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/10">The Government and the new Prime Minister, of course, will want to consider what reforms are necessary, but these are my suggestions: first, remove the minimum share a tenant is expected to take in their home from 25 per cent. to something far more affordable, such as five per cent. in order to get them on the first rung of the housing ladder. Secondly, we should ensure that every social tenant&mdash;not just some&mdash;has a right to own a share in their own property. Thirdly, we should ensure that the geographical distribution of resources under Government low-cost home ownership programmes is targeted properly to the regions with the lowest owner-occupier levels, including London and my own region, the north-east, which, incidentally, needs its fair share.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/11">Fourthly, we must develop new ways of helping people on to the housing ladder. In addition to shared equity schemes, which the Government are doing a lot about, we should at least explore community land trusts, mutual housing and developer-led co-housing schemes, which have shown remarkable success in other parts of the world. Fifthly, we should work with mortgage lenders to promote more flexible forms of borrowing, which in the United States, at least, have helped millions more from low and middle-income families into home ownership. In a country as wealthy as our own&mdash;we are now the fourth richest on the planet&mdash;making ours a genuinely fair shares society is a realisable ambition, because we have a high and growing proportion of people owning homes and shares, and so owning a real stake in the future of our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.10.1/12">Those are some of the steps that we need to take towards a genuinely socially mobile Britain. They are all about levelling-up, not levelling-down and not just beating poverty, but unleashing aspiration, and they all require, not less of a role for the state, as some mistakenly believe is what the modern world demands, but a different sort of state&mdash;one that empowers rather than controls. In my view, the changes that this Government have made in the last decade have laid the foundations for a Britain in which prosperity and opportunity are shared widely. However, unlocking our country so that it is open to aspiration and effort requires a new drive to change fundamentally the distribution of power in our society. I believe that we have made good progress in the last 10 years; I hope that we can make even more in the next 10.</p>

	<p pid="a.13.0/1">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr. Illsley, once again. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase> on securing a debate on this very important subject. Indeed, in the breadth of his speech, which in the time available I cannot hope to match, and in the range of issues on which he touched, he has shown how social mobility and the need to address it touch on almost every aspect of social policy and how we as politicians, Members of Parliament and, from the Minister's point of view, as a Government, can focus our efforts on tackling this hugely important problem. He is to be congratulated.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/2">Although the Opposition do not necessarily agree with all the prescriptions that the right hon. Gentleman offered&mdash;I suspect that there are those on all Benches that do not agree with all of them&mdash;in opening up the breadth and range of issues, he has performed a very important service. I congratulate him also on his work on ensuring that these issues are brought to wider attention through the media. Those of us who wake up early enough in the morning were pleased to hear him talking on the &quot;Today&quot; programme this morning. That also is important in bringing these issues to much wider attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman said that he cannot imagine a child from a background such as his own achieving the same high office that he achieved as a member of the Cabinet. That is a staggeringly sad comment on where we have come to. If social mobility was progressing, he should be able to foresee, in 10, 15 or 20 year's time, a Cabinet full of people from backgrounds similar to his own.</p>

	<p pid="a.20.0/1">I am very taken by the hon. Gentleman's remarks about the sad inevitability with which children who are born into poverty will stay in poverty. Does he agree, however, that the eradication of child poverty is one of the vital stepping stones on the way towards a more socially mobile society and breaking the cycle of disadvantage and inevitability? Will he clarify his party's position on that? I noted with interest that, in a debate in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-06">6 March</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1389" name="Maria Miller">the hon. Member for Basingstoke (Mrs. Miller)</phrase>, who is the shadow Minister with responsibility for family welfare, said that the Conservative party viewed the realisation of the child poverty target as an &quot;aspiration&quot; rather than a firm commitment. If the hon. Gentleman and his party are as serious as they say they are about eradicating child poverty, will they now commit themselves to what the Government are already committed to?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.20.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="20"  time="010:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0003.htm#07062658000242">
	<p pid="a.20.1/1">My party has made its position absolutely clear. The chairman of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1549" name="Oliver Letwin">our policy review, the right hon. Member for West Dorset (Mr. Letwin)</phrase>, has said in terms that we are committed to the goal of abolishing child poverty, as defined in the Government's way. However, we want to extend that definition and to look at aspects of social exclusion that are not covered, such as poverty at the 40 per cent. level. The right hon. Gentleman is right to suggest that these issues are multifaceted, and poverty solutions are a question not just of financial transfers, but of getting under the skin of the problems, whether by helping with the early years or bringing in effective voluntary organisations, which have a fantastic record on helping to cure some of the problems that put people into poverty. Financial poverty is often as much a symptom of other aspects of social exclusion as a cause&mdash;it works both ways. If I am critical of the Government, it is because they are inclined to think of poverty exclusively in financial terms&mdash;at least when it comes to the target&mdash;and we need to take a more multifaceted view.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/2">I am conscious of the fact that I need to leave the Minister time to respond, but I want first to echo some of the remarks that have been made about the importance of work incentives. In my experience, no one chooses to be poor. People want to help themselves and they are as keen to help themselves progress as they are to help their families progress. However, when 1.7 million people are facing withdrawal rates of between 60 and 70 per cent.&mdash;the figure has gone up from 760,000 since 1997 and will increase again as a result of last year's Budget&mdash;we are not providing the necessary incentives.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/3">What do we need to do? I suggest that four principles should be part of an approach to curing and reversing the decline in social mobility. First, we must help to equip people with the ability to help themselves. Let us not tie people up in the benefits system and withdrawal rates, with disincentives to work and prosper. Let us get rid of some of the complexity of benefits, which are a great disincentive to people trying out different ways of getting back into the labour market. For example, people might fear that their housing benefit will be withdrawn, and the fuss of reapplying for it makes looking for work not worth while.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/4">Let us recognise that money is not the only dimension of poverty and that people who become trapped in poverty, particularly severe poverty, face multiple aspects of social deprivation, which need sensitive handling and which are not all susceptible to the cure of financial transfers.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/5">Let us look not just to the state, but to local communities, in the way that the right hon. Gentleman suggested. Let us apply the subsidiarity principle and bring in local charities and voluntary groups, which often have a personalised approach that it is difficult for the state to recognise. I was disturbed to read that the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1545" name="Edward Miliband">the hon. Member for Doncaster, North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>, who has responsibility for the third sector, had given an assurance to Dave Prentis, the general secretary of Unison, that voluntary organisations would be limited to the role of supporting the state and would not be able to substitute for it. In some cases, it is appropriate for voluntary organisations to substitute in the delivery of a service if they are better placed to do so. It constrains our ability to tackle social exclusion if we artificially constrain the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/6">Finally, I entirely endorse what the right hon. Gentleman said about assets. It must be part of our agenda to allow people to build up a buffer of savings and financial assets to protect them through the ups and downs that we all face in our lives. They must also be able to build up assets that are substantial enough to allow them to own their own homes and to be prosperous not only in work, but in retirement. We need to address that.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.1/7">I hope that progressive politics will be a matter of consensus between the parties over the weeks ahead. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, being progressive is not just about having aspirations, and the right hon. Gentleman made some very practical suggestions in that regard, to which I hope that the Minister will able to respond positively. More importantly, I hope that the new Prime Minister will be able to respond positively, so perhaps the right hon. Member for Darlington should sit by his phone tomorrow to see whether the Prime Minister is willing to take up his suggestions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.21.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1815" speakername="Paddy Tipping" speakeroffice="The Deputy Leader of the House of Commons"  colnum="21"  time="010:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0004.htm#07062658000243">
	<p pid="a.21.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase> on his robust speech, which was designed to provoke and to bring about change and action. I have had the benefit of reading the speeches that he has been making for a couple of years now, including the Deborah Leon memorial lecture of November 2003 and last month's 2020 vision for British Government lecture at the university of Durham, and I should say how impressed I was with his account of Government policy failure in Benwell in west Newcastle. There is a lot to be learned from having stable, long-term policies. There was a lot of substance in my right hon. Friend's speech. He has never been accused of spin, but I note that the &quot;Today&quot; programme is running a series of features on social mobility this week, and I am sure that it is coincidental that only yesterday the Sutton Trust produced its report on social immobility in schools, and the failure of schools, which has been discussed, to tackle the greatest disadvantage. His speech had substance, was timely and topical, and was designed to encourage wider debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/2">I confess that I am here in a jobbing role today. My colleagues in Government with responsibility for the matters in question have shown their own mobility. I apologise for that, but it gives me an opportunity&mdash;not to talk about the detail of policy, but to pick up some of the wider issues. I want to say from the outset that I am a child of the same times as my right hon. Friend. I, too, come from a family with strengths and weaknesses. We lived on a council estate. I was the first person in my family to get a degree and the first to have a professional career; it has gone downhill since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/3">My right hon. Friend was right to stress the post-war achievements of the Labour Government&mdash;universal health provision, full employment, the welfare state and full-time education until the age of 15. That period broke down the social class system, there was greater consumer choice and there were opportunities for people to go further. As he said, the children of the '70s have suffered. One suggestion to come out of the recent report was that that decline has now finished: that we have levelled up and could go forward. Of course, the Government have things to be proud of, such as the fact that 600,000 children have been taken out of poverty, and 1 million pensioner households have been taken out of relative poverty. More people than ever are in work. We have already discussed the point about the incomes of the 20 per cent. of people on the lowest income rising faster than those in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1884" name="Greg Clark">the top 20 per cent. The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase> was right to counsel that studying the lowest percentage group reveals problems; that is why the social exclusion task force has been commissioned to study the problem and make proposals for change. We need to be honest; meeting our child poverty targets will not be easy. Taking people out of energy poverty when energy prices are going up is quite challenging. I am struck by Government's willingness these days to acknowledge the problem, and not to try to spin it away, but to present new proposals to deal with the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/4">I want to focus on four aspects of the matter raised by my right hon. Friend. The first is the importance of employment in tackling social mobility. Unemployment in May 1997 was 1.6 million and today it is 890,000&mdash;a 45 per cent. reduction. In Darlington, unemployment has been reduced by 52 per cent. In my constituency of Sherwood it has halved. In Tunbridge Wells, it is down by 56 per cent. However, it is important, as has been stressed in the debate, to focus on groups of people who are presently unemployed. We have talked about the needs of black and Asian people. We need to consider the kind of work that they are undertaking, its value and the pay that they receive. We also need to pay attention, as has been said, to the people who are not in work, and the number on incapacity benefit. We must show real determination to lift 1 million people from incapacity benefit and back into work. We need to work on the pathfinder model. It is expensive, but in the long term, if we are successful, savings can be made down the line. I want to reinforce the old Beveridge tradition, which has been a strand in the debate: work for those who can, security for those who cannot.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/5">My right hon. Friend also talked about the big skills agenda. We live in a global world. As the Leitch report says, unless we skill and reskill, we shall be economically disadvantaged. I find it astonishing that there is a variable pattern in the creation of new businesses across the country. In Wokingham, there are four times more new business start-ups than in Worksop in the Nottinghamshire coalfield. One of the things that we must do is encourage entrepreneurial behaviour, whether in business or in the wider social setting&mdash;a point already made by my right hon. Friend. We must persuade ordinary working-class people to have wider perspectives and higher aspirations.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/6">To come to the second issue that my right hon. Friend raised, we have all talked about the value of early years education. All three and four-year-olds who want a nursery place have one. The Sure Start scheme is a flagship project, and there will be a children's centre in every community. As well as providing universal services Sure Start needs to ensure that those who are most disadvantaged will benefit from those services. That will take subtlety and skill. We can take things further with nurse family partnerships and the incredible years programme. We need to focus on children and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/7">Thirdly, we need to make sure that people really have the assets that my right hon. Friend has talked about. I know that there are problems with child trust funds, or baby bonds, as they are called, but they are a vehicle&mdash;an example of investing in young people&mdash;that will provide long-term solutions. It is also important to provide decent housing for all. It cannot be right that young entrants are dependent on help from their parents to acquire property. We need to build more houses. We need to be clear, as the hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells knows, about where we should build those houses; and we need to build the right kind of houses, which will meet people's needs. They need to be smaller, more sustainable houses, near urban centres, not big, ranch-style houses in the countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/8">Fourthly, we need to transfer power. I am struck, as I go round the country, by the fact that people know the problems in their community, and often know the solutions, too. We should listen to those people and trust them. That requires a radical devolution of resources and decision-making. Like my right hon. Friend, I have closely studied what the Chancellor, the next Prime Minister, is saying about those issues. It must be right that people in Darlington can provide different services from those provided in, say, Devizes; and that those in Nottingham can provide different ones from those in Newcastle. We must trust people, consider grass roots experience, identify and develop good practice, and give public services back to local people. Public services will survive only if they are owned by local people. That is a big challenge and we should take it forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.21.0/9">There are tests for the Conservative Opposition in what I have said. There has been consensus in the debate, but there are tests, too. The hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells needs to commit himself to full employment, flexible policies for families, universal child care and its costs, and education for all rather than selection for a few in grammar schools&mdash;looking to the future, not the past. The debate has provided a platform for further discussion of the issue of an action plan on social mobility. I cannot promise it, but at least it is on the agenda. This discussion is about not just policies and priorities, but politics. People from the coalfield communities that I represent have always aspired to better for their children and grandchildren. It is a universal sentiment. We must be ambitious and aspirational. Politics, for all parties, will survive only if we are in a position to promise for the future, not look to the past, and to present policies for the many, not the few.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.29.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" speakername="Andrew Tyrie" colnum="29"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0005.htm#07062658000254">
	<p pid="a.29.2/1">The Minister is welcome to intervene on that. In addition to that, there is an enormous amount of anecdotal evidence that UK airports have been used for rendition, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1971" name="Jo Swinson">the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase> said. The Council of Europe report provided some of the extensive circumstantial evidence on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/2">It is hardly surprising that we have such little written information to go on, and that the Minister has so little straw with which to make bricks. In a written statement, the former Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, made it clear that what little we know has come from officials' personal recollections and that scarcely any documentation has been retained. In my view, that is wholly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/3">Worse still, the Government have still not put in place a mechanism for ensuring that renditions do not take place in future. Nor have they reassured us that proper records will be kept. On the contrary, we are supposed to rely on assurances that the US Administration will make a request if they want to fly someone through the UK, and we are expected to leave it at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/4">The truth&mdash;it will out, as it does in most democracies&mdash;is that the Government have almost certainly turned a blind eye to rendition. They have been determined not to allow a cigarette paper to come between them and their US ally, but Ministers are under no illusion that that is causing deep embarrassment. That was made clear in a leaked memo a little while ago, which suggested that whenever the subject is discussed the Minister concerned should do his best to move the discussion on to wider issues of UK participation in the war against terror. I do not have the leaked memo to hand, but if he wants to challenge me on it, I shall give him a quotation from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/5">The UK's policy has quietly hardened, as illustrated by the tone of some written answers. The Minister will probably tell us today that those assurances will be demanded vigorously, but we cannot rely on assurances from the US Government; we need much more. With a group of leading public lawyers, including Nicholas Blake QC, Andrew Lydiard QC and Professor James Crawford, dean of the Cambridge university law school, and with the help of a number of pressure groups, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Liberty, as well as help from the New York university law school, we have put together a proposal to provide the public with something more reliable to give them confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/6">That proposal has been set out in documentation published by the all-party group. In summary, it says that this country must demand the basic information concerning any rendition: the destination, the legal regime that will apply when the person has been transferred, the legal safeguards that are available in that state, and evidence that the detainee was provided with an opportunity to challenge his or her transfer on the basis of his or her reasonable fear of being tortured or suffering ill treatment. It should also be a legal requirement that those requests, and the information obtained are recorded and that those records are retained. We should not have to rely on officials' anecdotal evidence from years back.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/7">With the help of lawyers, I have examined carefully how such a measure could be brought into effect and I have been advised that it could be done by a relatively simple amendment of the Air Navigation Order 2005. Primary legislation would not be required, and I strongly urge the Minister to examine that proposal carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/8">I was heartened that the Minister told me in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-07">7 June</phrase>, which I received by fax yesterday&mdash;I am grateful to him for giving me a copy of it without the day written on it this morning on his return from Washington&mdash;in response to my request in May for a Government response to my proposals. But I was depressed to note that the Minister said in his letter that he is</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/9" class="indent">&quot;yet to be persuaded that legislation would add real value...over and above the understandings which already exist&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/10">He must grasp the fact that those understandings will not satisfy the public, and the reason is clear. First, there is a heap of circumstantial evidence about far more renditions than the four that the Government have been able to identify with the help of absent-minded officials. Secondly, so much material has been put before us during the past few years that public confidence has been corroded. There have been misused intelligence reports, dodgy dossiers, the suggestion that our troops could be attacked by Saddam Hussein within 45 minutes, and the Prime Minister's suggestion in the House that Saddam Hussein was within a year of obtaining a nuclear weapon. All that has eroded public trust, which is now at a low ebb. Assurances will simply not be enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/11">My proposal is scarcely radical, and I fear that some hon. Members on my left may suggest that it is wholly inadequate, but at least it would make it clear that reasonable steps should be taken by public authorities to establish whether a rendition is taking place, and to collect the facts about it. What is the danger to the Government of pushing through such a modest statutory instrument? I hope that such a change, or something like it, will have the support of my Front-Bench colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/12">I have a number of specific questions about UK involvement. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell me specifically whether it is now UK Government policy to oppose extraordinary rendition. Do they believe that it is morally wrong, as they now believe that Guant&aacute;namo Bay is wrong? What assessment have they made of its overall effectiveness as an anti-terrorist tool? Of course, I understand that the details of such an assessment cannot be put in the public domain, but surely some of the general conclusions should be made available in a democracy. Do the Government agree with Richard Dearlove's comments that were quoted in a recent programme and a recent journal that rendition has damaged the ability of the UK and the US to recruit high-quality spies? What is the UK's policy on the CIA's programme of so-called high-value prisoner transfers?</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/13">Do the Government believe that when a CIA chartered plane comes to the UK, it falls in the category of state aircraft for the purpose of permission, or in the category of civilian aircraft? What steps have the Government taken to check the allegations made in two of those programmes and in a book that UK intelligence personnel travelled in a number of planes that were being used for rendition?</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/14">A number of the Minister's colleagues seem to be as concerned as I am, and some have told me so privately. From time to time, the veil is lifted and they say so publicly. The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1472" name="Harriet Harman">the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase>, has demanded a radical change in the rules&mdash;more radical than I have proposed. She has highlighted a loophole in international regulations and demanded that it be closed by renegotiation of the so-called Chicago convention, which ensures that signatories tell one another if hazardous substances or important people are being flown in or out. Unfortunately, that convention does not cover prisoners at the moment. She said that we needed to</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/15" class="indent">&quot;be absolutely certain that we don't have a situation where we are complicit in torture because our airspace is being used or planes are landing in our country and then taking off again.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/16">I agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/17">Other Members want to get into the debate, and rather than go into further detail with more questions, I shall ensure that the Minister has enough time to answer thoroughly. I may have further questions for him if he permits me to ask them during his response.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/18">I shall draw a few general conclusions. In pressing this campaign, I have been motivated by five arguments, each of which is enough to require that the west's rendition policy should be challenged. First, there is the basic ethical point that to subject people to torture or to cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment is always morally wrong. Secondly, and this point has already been made in interventions, any information obtained or confessions signed in such circumstances are likely to be highly unreliable.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/19">Thirdly, the evidence obtained can probably never be used to secure convictions. The maltreatment of so many detainees at Guant&aacute;namo Bay has turned the issue into a legal albatross for the Americans, making it difficult for them to secure convictions of detainees even when the evidence is strong. The Americans cannot bring those people before any court that the international community would recognise as being fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/20">Fourthly, torturing people, and particularly the knowledge that we do so in many of the communities in which the terrorists may hide, makes counter-terrorism much harder. That is the point that Richard Dearlove made when he said that it made recruitment and the gathering of information much more difficult. I am confident that our intelligence services are against extraordinary rendition. They know that it makes us less not more safe, and it makes their job more dangerous, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/21">Fifthly, and just as importantly, the countries that practice or condone rendition undermine the very values that we in the west seek to export. Rendition inflames the very communities whose support we most need to combat terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/22">For all those reasons, I hope that the Minister will make a start by speaking out strongly against rendition, and by working vigorously to persuade the Americans to change policy. The &quot;hug them close&quot; approach that the Government have pursued has left Britain without any foreign policy at all on those issues. The Minister looks shocked, but I assure him that that is what the vast majority of the British public think. However, every time I ask a Minister to dissent from that policy, even a little, they persistently fail to do so. The Prime Minister&mdash;I admit he is Prime Minister for only one more day&mdash;failed to do so at the Dispatch Box late last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/23">As with the US Administration, we have grown accustomed to hearing apparently firm statements that Britain is not involved, that we have searched our files and found nothing and the like, but so far we have not had that core condemnation from the Government to match their belated opposition to what has happened at Guant&aacute;namo Bay. Even ignoring the wider impact of the issue, or the immorality of it, a policy of torture will always be counter-productive. It makes us less secure, which is why Israel and the Israeli army abandoned its use. The French learned that lesson in Algeria, and the British learned it very early on in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/24">At the outset I said that if I had time at the end of my speech, I would put rendition in a wider context, which I shall now do briefly.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/25">Extraordinary rendition is part of a wider, failing US foreign policy. By setting aside international law and compromising the standards that all western democracies aspire to, the US has let us all down in the west. It is part of their radical unilateralist departure from post-war multilateralism, sitting alongside regime change and pre-emptive action. The plain fact is that all those policies have failed and are now seen to have failed. Extraordinary rendition has failed.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/26">One cannot torture and expect democracy to grow at the same time; one cannot sing the praises of western open societies while kidnapping people from the very communities and faiths that one wants to convince; and one cannot win hearts and minds with the illegal use of force.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/27">With luck, the dangerous Bush-Blair experiment is coming to an end. Ironically, the debate in Washington&mdash;the Minister has just returned from Washington&mdash;is well ahead of us. While we hear tentative talk about moving on from the Bush-Blair doctrines in London, we witness its death throes across the Atlantic, and we witness also a superpower's Administration paralysed by failure and attacked on all sides, particularly from within the ranks of the Republican party.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.2/28">A new Prime Minister has a chance for a fresh start. The Government can do their bit to deflect Americans from that policy by dissenting from it vigorously and publicly. The Government can start today by committing themselves to at least consider putting some proposals on the statute book to bring this disgusting practice to an end.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.37.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" speakername="Tony Baldry" colnum="37"  time="011:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0006.htm#07062665000290">
	<p pid="a.37.0/1">One of the poets of the first world war, when asked what he was fighting for, picked up a chunk of English earth. It graphically described what he believed. I think that if one were to ask British soldiers in Iraq or Afghanistan what they were fighting for, they would not do quite the same thing, but they would say that they thought they were fighting for freedom, liberty, the rule of law and democracy&mdash;for concepts important to them. If one reflects on those concepts and then on the reality of Guant&aacute;namo, one sees that it is the antithesis of everything that we in this House collectively believe in.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/2">I voted against the war in Iraq simply as a lawyer. I believed it to be contrary to international law, not having the necessary UN approval. It is no joy to those of us who felt that way that that lack of legal authority has made the coalition's situation throughout the conflict in Iraq very much more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/3">Guant&aacute;namo was deliberately set up to be outside the legal structures. Only yesterday, an article in the <i>International Herald Tribune</i> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/4" class="indent">&quot;Guant&aacute;namo was chosen for the prison camp in the first place because, while it is an American military installation, it is not on American soil and thus not as subject to American law as are prisons within the United States...Administration hard-liners have opposed housing the prisoners in the United States, at least in part because they would presumably have legal rights and thus be able to challenge the conditions of their confinement and interrogations.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/5">Everyone in this House must start from the premise that deliberately setting up an extra-legal jurisdiction, to exclude individuals from the rights of law and the basic concept of habeas corpus, destroys everything in which this country has believed since Magna Carta and beyond. If a major ally pursues those policies, its approach is fundamentally flawed&mdash;and, what is more, totally counter-productive. If the United Kingdom and the United States seek to say, &quot;We believe in democracy and have the moral high ground,&quot; how on earth will Guant&aacute;namo play out in the refugee camps of Gaza, the streets of Peshawar or the back alleys of Kandahar? It is all completely counter-productive, and I think that we all agree on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/6">Given that background of actions by the United States, the Minister has to accept that it is not a huge leap to infer reasonably, from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">the evidence of the hon. Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase>&mdash;eye-witness evidence from UK citizens who have been rendered&mdash;that such practices have been going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/7">I want to draw the attention of the House to two recent incidents; the first has not been raised until now. A couple of weeks ago, the <i>Daily Mail</i> and <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> reported that a US CASA 212 plane landed at RAF Mildenhall on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-02">Saturday 2 June</phrase>. The flight took off from Camp Peary, which is reputed to be a CIA training facility. It was last seen in Malta, clearly close to the middle east. I understand that the plane registration number was one that the European Parliament and the Council of Europe had identified as being used to render prisoners. When the flight landed at Mildenhall, it was surrounded by US military. The Minister has to accept that each and every time such incidents occur, the very strong suspicion that US flights are rendering prisoners through UK airspace is further reinforced.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/8">There are also the interesting observations of the new deputy leader and chairman of the Labour party, the former Minister at the Department of Justice; I am not sure exactly when the transition will take place. Those of us who have been in government know that one of the difficulties is reconciling lines to take. Understandably, that is a particular issue for the Foreign Office because one has to clear, around Whitehall, the position that one is taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/9">We know that the Minister whom I mentioned, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1472" name="Harriet Harman">the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase>, is a decent person, and I am sure that that is why she has been elected deputy leader and chairman of the Labour party. Presumably, she will become Deputy Prime Minister, but she was recently Minister at the Ministry of Justice. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> said, very recently, in that capacity, she asked for what was perceived to be a loophole in the convention on international civil aviation, known as the Chicago convention, to be closed. That loophole means that although the UK Government have to be formally notified if flights contain hazardous material or VIPs, they do not have to be notified about those that contain prisoners. To me, what she did looked like the Ministry of Justice trying to reconcile lines to take&mdash;why, otherwise, would the Minister have raised the issue at all?</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/10">It strikes me that the Minister was seeking to say to other Government Departments, &quot;Look, the suspicion must be that the Foreign Office says that it knows nothing about anyone being rendered through UK airspace because the US Government do not have to tell us, so we officially do not know. Actually, we do know and there is heavy suspicion that it happens, so we should reconcile the situation by making it obligatory for us to be told and removing the loophole from the convention.&quot; That was a clear signal that something is amiss&mdash;otherwise, why would the issue be raised at all?</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/11">I thought it pretty feeble of the Association of Chief Police Officers simply to look at media reports. Given that reports have been done by the Council of Europe, the European Parliament and others, it must be in the Government's best interests to co-operate fully with the Intelligence and Security Committee so that we put the issue to bed once and for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/12">The bottom line is this: clearly, rendition has been established to remove people from a civilised legal jurisdiction and take them to places where things that others would rather we did not know about&mdash;and would be unacceptable if they occurred here or in the United States&mdash;can happen. At the beginning of the 21st century, that is morally wrong and extremely short-sighted. I suspect that it puts our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in jeopardy. If we are not treating other human beings with respect, some may believe that when our soldiers are captured, they do not have to treat our men and women with respect. The situation is wrong, short-sighted and counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/13">The Minister is very forthright. I hope that he will condemn the practice of extraordinary rendition with the clarity and fervour with which the Prime Minister, the Foreign Office and now Ministers collectively have been condemning Guant&aacute;namo Bay.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.39.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1870" speakername="Richard Younger-Ross" colnum="39"  time="011:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0006.htm#07062665000291">
	<p pid="a.39.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase> on bringing this issue to the House and on all the hard work that he has done on it as chairman of the all-party group on extraordinary rendition.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/2">We are debating an important and serious issue today. I shall come to what the hon. Gentleman said in a minute, but first I turn to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1445" name="Sarah Teather">my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, East (Sarah Teather)</phrase>. She outlined two cases for which there is documented evidence of British citizens and others being rendered with the complicity and help of British intelligence services. Her evidence alone brings me to one of the two promises that I want the Minister to give today. That is that there must be, should be and has to be a full and proper inquiry into the allegations.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/3">As has been said, we need to go further than previous inquiries, which considered only newspaper evidence. We need an inquiry that will not only take evidence from people such as those whom my hon. Friend mentioned, but go to the places from which they were rendered and conduct a proper investigation into what they allege happened to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/4">Only when that has been done, and we have firm evidence, can those allegations be proved false or correct and will <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1382" name="Tony Baldry">the point just raised by the hon. Member for Banbury (Tony Baldry)</phrase> be dealt with. It is a serious point. Why should other countries or groups respect international law when they can clearly claim that we&mdash;Great Britain and America&mdash;are not respecting it? Why should they not kidnap and hold people, as they currently do, if they believe that we are doing the same? It is one rule for one, and a different one for others. That is a justification that they use, and, unless we can put it to rest, it will be hard for us to argue that they are wrong and to negotiate with them on the basis that they are morally and legally wrong. In an inquiry, we would be able to say, &quot;Yes, we have committed an error and we will correct it and ensure that it does not happen again.&quot; However, whatever course we take, I hope that the Minister will take up that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/5">The hon. Member for Chichester listed a number of cases that need to be answered. The evidence that he gave today and that he has found from his own inquiry both reinforce the need for a full and proper inquiry. I shall not address all his remarks, but he made some very good points on definition. I notice from the papers that we have been given that the definition of real torture is used, and is used even by the Minister. The foreign affairs spokesman for the Conservative party, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the right hon. Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>, tabled a written parliamentary question that said:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/6" class="indent">&quot;To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what her Department's response is to the allegations concerning the UK in the November 2006 report of the Temporary Committee on the alleged use of European countries by the CIA for the transportation and illegal detention of prisoners.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/7">In his response the Minister used words that cause concern. He said</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/8" class="indent">&quot;We have found no evidence of detainees being rendered through the UK or the Overseas Territories since 1997 where there were substantial grounds to believe that there was a real risk of torture.&quot;<i>&mdash;</i>[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-28">28 February 2007</phrase>; Vol. 457, c. 1386W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/9">However, the Minister's departmental superiors have already accepted that there were cases of application for rendition, and as I have not seen the evidence, I would be interested to know where those people were rendered and whether their rendition to that destination might have led to a risk of torture. If the Minister cannot answer that point now, perhaps he could write to us later.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/10">It is extraordinary that the EU has claimed that there were 1,250 CIA flights through Europe. We know of a number of flights involving <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1885" name="Vincent Cable">the UK. My hon. Friend the Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable)</phrase> tabled a written parliamentary question to the Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1996" name="Des Browne">the right hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Des Browne)</phrase> that asked on what dates</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/11" class="indent">&quot;since <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase> the aircraft with the registration HZ-124 has landed at RAF Brize Norton; on what basis this aircraft is allowed to use RAF Brize Norton; and what fees have been paid to his Department.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/12">In his reply, the Secretary of State answered:</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Since <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-01">1 July 2006</phrase>, aircraft HZ 124 has landed 14 times at RAF Brize Norton.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May 2007</phrase>; Vol. 460, c. 1052W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/14">We would all like to know what that aircraft was doing and why it landed 14 times. I accept that there is a lot of smoke, but we do not necessarily have the proof of a fire. Generally, however, where there is smoke there is fire.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/15">The CIA is not going to tell us that they are undertaking extraordinary rendition. Common sense says that, if one is breaking international law, one does not run up a flag and say, &quot;Right chaps, we are breaking international law.&quot; Likewise, if we are complicit in helping the US to break international law, we are not going to say so. It is quite possible that those in the UK who might be complicit have not even told their superiors or advised Ministers. That comes back to the issue of justice and the need for an inquiry to consider the evidence and to determine the purpose of the flights into and out of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/16">The point made in relation to the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham about recognition of loopholes is significant. In all the evidence that has been presented to various Committees, the Ministers and Secretaries of State have always categorically denied that anything else needed to be done and that everything was watertight. We were told that there was no rendition and that, apart from the three cases about which we were informed, there could be none. The reason given was that the Americans are nice people and would therefore tell us if the situation was otherwise. I am not convinced.</p>
	<p pid="a.39.0/17">I shall conclude so that the Minister has plenty of time to deal with the two promises that I mentioned: the promise to have an inquiry and secondly whether he will say categorically for the record that extraordinary rendition is wrong, that he believes that to be case, and that the Government will do all in their power to end it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.42.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1515" speakername="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown" colnum="42"  time="012:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0007.htm#07062665000299">
	<p pid="a.42.6/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her intervention. I have a big section in my speech on that, but due to the time I do not think I am going to reach it. I entirely agree with her that the matter needs to be examined.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/2">Accusations and testimony of extraordinary rendition flights leading to the torture of suspects have led to a critical erosion of our moral authority. In standing up for the rule of law, we must be careful not to employ methods that undermine it. To do so would set a poor example to those who look to the western world for leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/3">There is a need to find a better way to address the problem that the detention centres were designed to solve, and we must guard against possible long-term miscarriages of justice. As others have said, the Abu Ghraib abuses were a truly shameful episode and showed that departures from our normal standards of human dignity can cost lives. If such a culture has been allowed to develop, it must be tackled at a senior level.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/4">The hon. Member for Teignbridge referred to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1782" name="William Hague">the answer given to my right hon. Friend the Member for Richmond, Yorks (Mr. Hague)</phrase>. It is worth repeating that in 2006 the then Foreign Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1423" name="Jack Straw">the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw)</phrase>, gave my right hon. Friend the assurance that</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/5" class="indent">&quot;the US would not render a detainee through UK territory or airspace (including Overseas Territories) without our permission.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-20">20 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 441, c. 38WS.]</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/6">That was a fundamental assurance. The present Minister also stated that the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/7" class="indent">&quot;would not facilitate the transfer of an individual from or through the UK to another State where there were grounds to believe that the person would face a real risk of torture.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-20">20 December 2005</phrase>; Vol. 440, c. 2840W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/8">Those were pretty substantial assurances. However, I am keen to be reassured by the Minister. Will he give me an absolute assurance that the British Government totally reject extraordinary rendition? He gave such a clear assurance on Guant&aacute;namo Bay, and a frank assurance on rendition would go a long way towards putting the issue to bed.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/9">I have one or two other questions. Will the Minister assure us that he has no information of British territories or airspace actively or passively being used for extraordinary rendition? Have any arrangements been made to enable the refuelling at military airfields of civilian aircraft with passengers destined for extraordinary rendition? The essence of the finding of reports by Amnesty International on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-04">4 April</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-14">14 July 2006</phrase> was that civil aircraft on charter to the CIA, with people on board selected for transfer by the CIA, were permitted to land and refuel at our civil and military airfields, possibly for the purpose of extraordinary rendition. Can the Minister give us any information about that?</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/10">In an agreed transcript of evidence given to the Joint Committee on Human Rights on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>, it was stated that the Foreign Secretary had made it plain that there was not</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/11" class="indent">&quot;any evidence to show that there are people on board those planes which do land here who are being transferred for the purposes of extraordinary rendition&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/12">If a Defence Minister was able to give such an assurance, will the Minister repeat it today?</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/13">Why was clearance given to planes to land at military airfields in the UK? It is accepted that the Department for Transport instructed the Civil Aviation Authority to give clearance for aircraft identified as being on charter to the CIA to land at civil and military airfields in the UK. Did the Foreign and Commonwealth Office instruct the DFT and, if not, at whose behest were the instructions given? Why were they given without the Government having full knowledge of the purpose of the arrangements involved? Why was not any attempt made over the years to discover the purpose of the 185 flights in question? We shall continue to hold the Government to the assurances that the then Foreign Secretary gave in 2006.</p>
	<p pid="a.42.6/14">We must work not to undermine the foundations of international law and the rules that exist to protect human rights, and we must ensure that, wherever possible, it is the power of our example, not the power of our armed forces, that imposes those rules. The rules of international law and human rights matter fundamentally, and the perception that they may be bent, whether selectively, deliberately or as a consequence of inadequate attention to the risks attendant on our actions, damages our moral authority and international standing. By undermining our achievements and complicating the task ahead it may, ironically and tragically, make us less rather than more safe.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.52.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1775" speakername="Vera Baird" colnum="52"  time="012:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0009.htm#07062665000325">
	<p pid="a.52.1/1">Well, I really do not know. That is a matter for them and not an issue on which the Ministry of Justice is actively engaged. But it was a very interesting question.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/2">My hon. Friend raised more specific concerns about the medicinal claims, supplements and suppliers of food supplements. That is the thrust of it, although there is a question also about the impact of the Channel Islands' VAT-free status on the UK food and medicinal products industry. I am sorry if he thinks that we have changed our minds. We have more full legal advice and, having seen Treasury solicitors' communications, are satisfied that these EU directives apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/3">Discussion continues between this Government and those of the Channel Islands, but I am told that we have been reassured through those discussions that Guernsey, in particular, which might not have been quite so receptive to our conversations, is committed to matching international standards in these products and to ensuring that they apply in Guernsey. Of course there is an internal issue that knocks on to us and which is highly relevant to its own good governance and people. There has been substantial recent dialogue between the Guernsey Government and UK officials to seek agreement on what the UK can expect to see in Guernsey's legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/4">My hon. Friend referred to legislation on the quality of those products. The UK is negotiating to ensure that this legislation meets obligations to its own people and ours. Officials in my Department continue to talk to Guernsey representatives to ensure that our concerns are understood properly. I think that they can be relied upon to do that with considerable forcefulness. And there are grounds for optimism. Guernsey's Parliament has approved the preparation of legislation to regulate the manufacture, supply, export, labelling and prescribing of medicines with the express twin aims of ensuring that the requirements of the MHRA are met and of safeguarding the reputation of the islands. That must be a very important tool in the whole issue. Legislation has been drafted and has gone out to consultation which closed recently. Guernsey's authorities are currently considering the results of that consultation process and remain committed to ensuring that all legitimate concerns are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/5">To put it colloquially, clearly the Ministry of Justice is working with UK policy makers to persuade the Crown dependencies that not only is the export of unregulated products in the UK a problem for us, but is bad news for them as well, because their reputation and relationship with us, upon which much weight was laid at the time of the treaty of Accession, as I have said already, remain hugely important to them. Of course, if they fail to meet international standards for regulation, supervision and governance, they stand to lose a huge amount of that reputation and good will.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/6">Obviously, there is justification for ensuring that Crown dependencies are subject to the sort of constraints applied in the UK, and the Ministry of Justice is hoping to move the Crown dependency Governments to an acceptable position although also we need to have regard to the indigenous industries of those dependencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/7">The Food Standards Agency and the Health Food Manufacturers Association&mdash;the UK industry lobby&mdash;of which my hon. Friend has spoken, have recently met to talk about the two issues of quality and competitiveness, and the impact on the UK market. My officials were party to those discussions. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend some reassurance about my Department's determination to ensure that good quality and good standards are dealt with by legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/8">Low-value VAT-free imports from the Channel Islands, whether they are health food supplements or CDs and DVDs&mdash;that is the other big issue, but my hon. Friend is concerned about health food supplements&mdash;do have or are capable of having negative effects on the UK economy, and the issue is kept under close scrutiny by the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.1/9">The current position is that all goods posted to the UK from outside the EU are normally subject to UK VAT, but for consignments under &pound;18 in value, no VAT is charged. That applies to consignments from the Channel Islands because they are outside the EU. It is goods valued under &pound;18 that cause a certain amount of difficulty. Although the goods are given a benefit in competing with indigenous UK goods, it is a perfectly legitimate position at law that those exports are not subject to VAT. The Governments of the Channel Islands are very aware of UK concerns about competition and, in particular, the medicinal products about which my hon. Friend is worried but, again, we have to strike a balance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.55.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="55"  time="012:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0009.htm#07062665000328">
	<p pid="a.55.1/1">I am delighted that the Minister is in his place and that we are starting this very important debate early. May I put the issue in context? It is one of the hottest local issues in my constituency. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June</phrase>, Christchurch borough council, which has recently been voted the most improved district council in the country&mdash;I am delighted that the leader of that council is coming along to follow the debate today&mdash;passed a resolution in the following terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/2" class="indent">&quot;This Council is appalled at the proposal to close the Jobcentre Plus Christchurch office as contained in the Jobcentre Plus District Manager's letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-17">17 May 2007</phrase>. This Council objects most strongly to the proposals which would lead to the loss of a vital local service causing unnecessary distress and inconvenience to some of the Borough's most vulnerable and needy residents especially those who would have to travel to the Bournemouth Jobcentre Plus office.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">Thursday 21 June</phrase>, there was a public meeting at the Grange school in Christchurch, which is in the heart of the most deprived area of the Christchurch constituency and one of the most deprived wards of any borough in the whole of south-west England. I think that it is fair to say that many customers of the Jobcentre plus office come from that area. At the meeting, which was very well attended, there was a unanimous vote of all those present, other than members of the civil service, in support of that resolution. As a further indication of how strongly the issue is running in the local community, a petition that will be presented to Parliament before the end of the consultation period has already gathered more than 4,000 signatures. This is a big local issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/4">I am somewhat perplexed about the Minister's role in the proposal to close the Jobcentre Plus office. He wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May</phrase>, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Since the original Service Delivery Plan was developed we have seen significant reductions in our running costs budgets in relation to both salaries and non-salary funding. This is linked to reductions in staff numbers and a pressure on the size of our estate and the continued low levels of customers in the catchment area.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/6">The area manager, who came to the public meeting last Thursday, said that his department had to shed 30,000 jobs in the three years to March 2008. The Minister wrote that letter as though the reductions in running costs budgets were not his responsibility, but if he is not responsible for the requirement, who is? Is it the Chancellor of the Exchequer, perhaps? Is the Minister not also responsible, not for the administration of those reductions but for ensuring that the implementation of any budget cuts is rational, fair and puts the customer or client first?</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/7">The Minister's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May</phrase> further states:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/8" class="indent">&quot;These combined pressures on resources&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/9">it does not say, of course, that they are self-inflicted&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/10" class="indent">&quot;and relatively low numbers of customers lead us to believe that closure of this site is a reasonable way forward&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/11">Yet, I am not even sure whether the Minister knows how many customers there are. Following his letter, I tabled a series of questions for answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase>. In one, I asked</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/12" class="indent">&quot;how many people obtained advice on benefits from the Christchurch office of Jobcentre Plus in each of the last six months&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="">14 July 2007</phrase>; Vol. 461, c. 1292W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase>&mdash;three weeks late&mdash;Mel Groves, the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus, told me that information about customer usage &quot;is not recorded&quot;. Then, however, I was told that customers who visited the office would be asked to complete a questionnaire as part of the consultation so that usage could be analysed. Surely, that survey should have been done before the Minister accepted the proposal to close the jobcentre for consultation. How could he assert in his letter to me that the number of customers was relatively low when he did not even know the number? Surely, the business case for closure must have been submitted to the Minister once it had been approved by the Jobcentre Plus board. That was certainly the information that I was given, so why does the Minister refuse to disclose the details? Is it because that would reveal that the basic information needed to justify the closure is not available?</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/14">The issue of numbers was much discussed at the public meeting. The area manager said that there were 1,440 sickness and disability benefit claimants, but that is 15 per cent. less than the 1,720 referred to in Mel Groves's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase>, which was annexed to the Minister's written answer of the same date. That is a 15 per cent. reduction in one week. Which of those figures is correct? How do we know? Does the Minister also realise that only pre-booked customers are being given questionnaires and that those who use the jobpoints, telephones or interview rooms do not receive them?</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/15">Last October, the jobcentre manager did an exercise, which showed that there were</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/16" class="indent">&quot;over 1,200 visits by customers to the Christchurch office to use the jobpoints or the free telephones&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-14">14 December 2006</phrase>; Vol. 454, c. 1338W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/17">The Minister shared that information with me in a written answer late last year, but it appears not to have been updated. Is it in the business plan for closure? What is proposed for the users of jobpoints and free telephone services in the event of closure? At last Thursday's public meeting, the area manager could say only that he would be interested in proposals to relocate those services locally. Surely, specific proposals along those lines, together with the costs of implementation, should form part of the business plan. If the Government are serious about maintaining that service, and it cannot be maintained in the office because the office is closed, why have they not engaged in discussions and reached conclusions on a hypothetical basis? Part of any normal business planning arrangement would be to ask how one would replicate the essential elements of a local service that was to be closed down so that local people could access them.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/18">What about the valuable work of some of the other specialist services at the jobcentre? The jobcentre employs seven full-time and three or four part-time staff. We are told that there are too many staff in the service, and the number of staff at the managerial level could be reduced if that was the Minister's decision. However, there is no evidence that the staff at Christchurch are under-employed, although if there was evidence to that effect, the numbers could be reduced accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/19">One member of staff who certainly could not be removed, however, is the disability employment adviser. That officer&mdash;I hope that the Minister will pay heed to this&mdash;not only gets people who are out of work into work, but works closely with local employers to ensure that disabled people who are already in work stay in work. Let me give one example. The local B&amp;Q store has a policy of referring disabled employees to the disability employment adviser if there is a problem at work. B&amp;Q does that to ensure that it can continue to employ those disabled people, so the adviser plays an important role. Is the Minister saying that those people should have to go all the way down to Bournemouth to have contact with a disability employment adviser? The arrangement with B&amp;Q shows the close way in which the local office works with local employers.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/20">What about the work of Connexions&mdash;the organisation whose name is not spelled correctly, but which adds to the advice that is available to young people? That organisation comes to the jobcentre every Thursday and arranges things in such a way that it can interview young people about job prospects at the same time as they are being interviewed about benefits. That takes place in one of the interview rooms, but how will it be replicated if the jobcentre is closed?</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/21">A whole host of other activities take place in the jobcentre, although I am not sure whether the Minister is aware of them. If he is, what alternative proposals have been made in the event of closure? I assume that he would want to be satisfied that the activities that I have outlined had been drawn to his attention and were part of the business case for closure before he was prepared to accept it.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/22">Another issue, which was raised by the former mayor, who is disabled and a former user of the jobcentre's services, was whether a social cost-benefit analysis had been done on the proposals. Those present also asked whether an environmental cost-benefit analysis had been done. There is much talk about the need to reduce travel, but does the Minister have before him in the business plan any indication of the extra travel that customers and staff would need to undertake? At the meeting, it was said that certain categories of customer would be able to have their travel costs paid, but that does not alter the fact that there would be additional travel as a result of the closure, which would have environmental consequences, or that many people who use the jobcentre would not have their travel costs paid when they went to an alternative location. In essence, therefore, my question is whether the Minister has been given a full picture of what happens in the jobcentre and what will happen in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/23">In his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-15">15 May</phrase>, the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/24" class="indent">&quot;I particularly want to assure you that this arrangement i.e. closure, will enable us to provide a better service to your constituents than we have been able to provide up until now.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/25">You will understand, Mr. Martlew, that that raised an eyebrow or two on the part of myself and everybody else to whom I spoke. How can closing the jobcentre improve the service for my constituents?</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/26">At the public meeting, I asked Mr. Tim Taylor-Blake, the area manager, whether he agreed with the Minister's statement, and he said, &quot;It is not my job to agree or disagree&quot;&mdash;there speaks a robust, obviously ambitious and, I hope, ultimately very successful civil servant. It is not his job to agree or disagree with the Minister, but neither is it the Minister's job to hide behind officialdom when confronted by questions from a Member of Parliament who is asking him to justify his assertion that closing the jobcentre in Christchurch will improve the service for constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/27">The only service improvements that Mr. Taylor-Blake could claim were a better level of support and advice and a quicker service. It is fair to say that the audience treated both those claims with derisive laughter, based on incredulity. The proposed Christchurch office closure is the only full-time office closure proposed in Dorset. Although the argument for a fuller service could be applied to the closure of part-time offices staffed by secondees, that is manifestly not the case in Christchurch. What has happened, I suspect, is that a circular letter has been sent out, which applied to part-time offices, but manifestly not to the full-time Christchurch office.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/28">As the Minister knows, I have been pressing him to justify his assertion that we will have a better service. In a written answer published yesterday, it would be fair to say that he again ducked the question, referring to the acting chief executive of Jobcentre Plus. That lady speaks only of increasing numbers of customers accessing services by telephone or internet, but she does not address the significant minority who do not and cannot cope with a remote bureaucracy accessible only by electronic means. That group is by definition composed of the most vulnerable members of society. Its members want and need face-to-face contact with real people, not faceless bureaucrats in some remote location. The people in the Jobcentre Plus service to whom I have spoken welcome that face-to-face contact, and feel that it was for that that they came into the service in the first place. They do not want to be on the end of a telephone with a system that uses computer prompts allowing no flexibility or individual discretion.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/29">How can a better service be provided to the group of people that I have described by closing the jobcentre? Mel Groves has spoken of the critical need to secure the most effective and equitable use of resources. What better cause for the equitable use of resources could there be than helping vulnerable people in face-to-face interviews, close to home? It is a matter of regret that in recent weeks home visiting by staff from the Christchurch jobcentre office has been curtailed. I have been told that home visiting will be possible in the future, but one must remain sceptical about such promises when the existing home visiting service is being reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/30">It is to the credit of the Minister and his Department that the staff at the Christchurch office are so highly regarded by their customers. They have won departmental awards for just that. The area manager includes in the case that he makes the fact that not many people in Christchurch are out of work in the long term. That is true, but I regard that low number as testimony of the quality of the advice and help that people get from the Jobcentre Plus staff. The advice that they get is tailored to individual circumstances and enables them to get into work and stay in work. That is a justification not for closing the office and reducing the service, but for keeping the office open. I fear that the criteria that the Department is using for deciding which offices to close may be based on the idea that the larger the number of long-term unemployed an area has, the stronger the reason is for keeping its office open; the Department should be considering the success rate of the office in getting out-of-work people back into work. Christchurch Jobcentre Plus has a proud record in that respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/31">Christchurch borough council has taken a keen interest in the issue, as I have said. I have always thought that there might be a case for localising all benefit and welfare advice under the aegis of the local authority, which already deals with council tax and housing benefit. That might, indeed, offer a way forward, providing a better service for vulnerable people while preserving accessibility and increasing accountability. In the absence of such a radical alternative, the proposed closure will undoubtedly lead to significant disruption to customers and will damage the interests of some of the most vulnerable members of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/32">In conclusion, I recently had occasion to reread what Her Majesty said in the Gracious Speech on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November 2006</phrase>. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/33" class="indent">&quot;My Government will continue its investment in, and reforms of, the public services in order to improve further their effectiveness and to help the most vulnerable members of society.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.1/34">I look forward to hearing the Minister respond to the debate and explain how he considers the closure of Christchurch Jobcentre Plus to be consistent with Her Majesty's most gracious words.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2007-06-26a.59.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2010" speakername="Jim Murphy" speakeroffice="The Minister for Employment and Welfare Reform"  colnum="59"  time="013:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmhansrd/cm070626/halltext/70626h0010.htm#07062665000329">
	<p pid="a.59.0/1">Thank you, Mr. Martlew, for giving us the opportunity to start the debate earlier than scheduled. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1502" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr. Chope)</phrase> on securing this debate on what, as he has shown, is an important local issue, in which he takes a keen interest. I also welcome the opportunity not only to talk about the Christchurch office but to express my appreciation, and that of the whole Government, of the work that Jobcentre Plus does in the south-west and throughout Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/2">As the hon. Gentleman knows, Jobcentre Plus was launched just over four years ago. The roll-out of the national network of offices and modern services commenced in 2002, and with only 10 more offices to go it is virtually complete. As of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June 2007</phrase>, a total of 855 new offices have been opened around the country, enabling Jobcentre Plus to play a key role in delivering our modern welfare system. The initial local service delivery plans for the roll-out in Dorset and Somerset were agreed after consultation in early 2003. Most of the modernised offices in the district were set up in 2004, and they included the one in Christchurch.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/3">The launch of Jobcentre Plus is rightly acclaimed as the most far-reaching organisational reform of welfare in past decades. Gone are the days when the only way of obtaining job vacancy information was physically to go to a jobcentre and browse a bewildering array of vacancy cards on display stands. Comprehensive information is now available on the internet. The award-winning Jobcentre Plus website regularly records the highest number of visits for any Government website, with many thousands of user visits each week. We are using modern technology to make many services accessible from the comfort of people's homes, or from public premises such as local libraries. Similarly, our touch-screen job points are increasingly being installed in convenient locations, as well as our offices, making more than 400,000 vacancies readily accessible.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/4">In the south-west region, unemployment has, as the hon. Gentleman knows, gone down by more than 35,000 in the past decade, and there are more than 130,000 more people in work. Meanwhile, the jobseeker's allowance claimant count is down 9 per cent. on the year. In Dorset and Somerset district in the period June 2005 to June 2006, the unemployment rate was 3.8 per cent. and the employment rate was 77 per cent. The jobseeker's allowance claimant count was 7,775, which was down 15 per cent. on the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/5">I want now to discuss the situation in Christchurch. As Jobcentre Plus has significantly improved its services, through advances in telephony and e-enabled services, it has ensured that its resources are put in place so as to support the most disadvantaged, with special focus on the local authority wards that are the most deprived, and which have poor labour markets. Therefore, in March, Jobcentre Plus developed a case for revising the 2003 service delivery plan. The revised plans have led to the consultation on the possible closure of Christchurch jobcentre.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/6">In proposing the closure of an office, Jobcentre Plus takes into account the following criteria: first, the volume of business transacted in the office that it is proposed to close; secondly, how the full range of customer services will be provided following closure; thirdly, the impact on customers, in such matters as travel, journey times and the cost of travel to another office; fourthly, how employers will be affected; fifthly, how staff will be affected; and lastly, costs and potential savings. All those criteria are considered carefully during the consultation period, which in this case began, as the hon. Gentleman knows, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-21">21 May</phrase>, and will end on <phrase class="date" code="">2 July</phrase>. The consultation includes the local Members of Parliament in all cases, local advice and welfare groups, employers, staff, trade unions and many other community groups, to which the hon. Gentleman rightly paid tribute. I take a personal interest in ensuring that a minimum of six weeks is allowed for local communities and stakeholders to make formal responses to such proposals. Meaningful consultation is vital in gathering all the information to help me to consider all the relevant facts before making my decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/7">We shall take into account all the views expressed in relation to the criteria that I listed. However, it is necessary today to consider those criteria in turn to show why Jobcentre Plus has entered into the consultation on proposed closure. First, as to volume of business, Christchurch jobcentre is one of our smaller offices, and now has only 14 staff. In the period July 2005 to June 2006 the relevant unemployment rate was only 2 per cent., with an employment rate of 77 per cent. Both of those rates were better than the national average. The jobseeker's allowance claimant count in May 2007 was only 256, which was down more than 20 per cent. on the year. The new deal figures show that no 18 to 24-year-old customers were on the programme after 12 months and that only 15 customers aged 25 or above and only five customers aged over 50 were on the programme after 18 months. Those are historically low levels, and those factors, especially the levels of high employment and low unemployment, raise questions about the operational viability of the jobcentre, given the intention to focus resources where they add most value in Dorset and Somerset.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/8">The second consideration is how the delivery of services would be affected by closure. The Christchurch office is not structurally friendly for public access, especially for customers who have disabilities, as services are sited on the first floor of the building, which is accessed via a lift. In addition, the social fund cannot be delivered through that office.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/9">The third consideration is customer travel. The hon. Gentleman reasonably asked about contingency plans and alternative arrangements. I tell him, and others through him, that I shall not consider specific alternative transport arrangements until we have taken a decision on closure. I do not think that he would welcome me talking about the alternative arrangements that will be put in place, given that we have not yet taken a decision. He well knows that Bournemouth is served by regular bus services from Christchurch, and I am told that customers can purchase a day-tripper bus ticket for &pound;3. Services could also be made available to customers at Winton and Ringwood jobcentres if that would better suit their personal needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/10">Fourthly, in respect of the impact on employers, Bournemouth, where most local employers are located, also offers an improved range of services. Employer activity at Christchurch jobcentre is very low: in the past five months, only four employers have used the office for interviews on just eight days.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/11">Fifthly, Jobcentre Plus will be able to redeploy any and all Christchurch staff to the new Bournemouth office if there is a decision to close the Christchurch office at the end of the consultation. The hon. Gentleman rightly paid tribute to the staff in the Christchurch office&mdash;as do I to the staff in all our offices across the network&mdash;and to the work of disability employment advisers. When it came to deciding whether to invest in the new deal and disability employment advisers, I voted to invest money in such services. I have voted for every penny piece of new investment into Jobcentre Plus in the past decade, but that has not been a universally consensual approach. There was a bitter, party political divide on whether having disability employment advisers was the right way to progress, but I am glad that the hon. Gentleman now welcomes the investment that he and his party so strongly opposed 10 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/12">Lastly, if we were to go ahead with any proposed closure, the likely impact on costs and savings would be an important consideration. It would be wrong to identify any specific savings or costs, because if we were to go ahead with a closure, the subsequent contingency plans and the nature of any community-based service would lead to additional costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.0/13">Those are the six major issues that we will consider at the end of the consultation process, before Ministers take a decision. The hon. Gentleman has raised his concerns and those of his constituents and of stakeholders, and they will be addressed when we consider those criteria.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.0/1">I thank the right hon. Lady for initiating this debate and for her comments. I also thank her for her eye-witness account of the illegal activities of the Israeli defence forces and others in demolishing houses along the route of the wall, the barrier or fence, where it incorporates Palestinian land illegally. I agree entirely with the right hon. Lady that that not only breaks international law but generates huge resentment, not just in Palestine but throughout the region. We have constantly urged the Israelis not to do that, and it is ironic that lawyers in Israel have given Palestinians their redress only about the route of the wall. Sometimes that route has been altered as a consequence of legal action that Palestinians have taken, especially in and around Jerusalem.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/2">The right hon. Lady's point about generating sympathy for Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda is prescient, and we ignore such warnings at our peril. I take her message about the Jordan valley needing the attention of the Department for International Development. I, too, was shocked when I saw the extent to which so much of the Palestinian economy on the west bank has collapsed. I shall come to Gaza in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/3">This is one of those times in history when, from an appalling tragedy of Palestinians killing Palestinians in Gaza, one hopes that the Israelis and everyone else will take a real step forward, remove the barriers on the west bank, and allow people to trade properly. The right hon. Lady referred to a crop of aubergines that were rotting in the field, and we have heard such stories so many times.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.0/4">I understand, as I am sure can everyone, why Israel has built barriers, and I know why it has built the wall. On my last visit but one, I went to see some old lefties&mdash;I do not know how to describe them&mdash;in a kibbutz up on the old Jerusalem road. Very reluctantly, they told me that life had become easier since the barrier was built because they were not worried about their kids going out, as suicide bombers were finding it much harder to come in from Nablus and other towns. I tried to argue then, and I argue now, that they will find ways of getting in and killing innocent citizens, because resentment will continue to build up unless the core issue is tackled.</p>
