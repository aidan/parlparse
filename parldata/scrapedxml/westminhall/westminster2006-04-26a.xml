	<p pid="a.255.3/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the fundamental issues relating to the Government's support for the maritime industry, the rights and responsibilities of employers in the industry and the employment rights of those who work in it.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.3/2">The Government have a proud record in many areas. We have a strong record on employment. Indeed, we have created 2.4 million new jobs since we came to power in 1997. We also have a proud record on equality issues, particularly on race relations, and one of our flagship policies was the creation of the national minimum wage legislation. However, much of my speech will focus on a forgotten group of workers who have not benefited from many of those positive Government initiatives&mdash;some of our seafarers.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.3/3">When the Labour party came into office in 1997, we recognised the crisis facing the UK maritime industry and UK seafarers. We also knew of the shipping industry's importance to Britain's economy, our dependence as an island nation on sea transport, the sustainable environmental benefits of sea transport and, not least, the industry's importance to national security. Shortly after the Labour party came to power, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister set out the Government's plan to boost the shipping industry. A shipping working group was set up and tasked with considering the key issues of enabling maximum economic benefit to be obtained from the shipping industry, reversing the decline of the UK merchant shipping fleet, increasing the employment and training of seafarers, and encouraging shipowners and the wider maritime industry to devote more resources to the maritime fleet.</p>
	<p pid="a.255.3/4">The group made 33 recommendations&mdash;I shall not go through them all&mdash;and the major headings give a flavour of the debate at that time. They included funding training, facilitating training, improving the employment environment, regulating to improve British seafarers' prospects, safeguarding the employment rights of British seafarers, improving the fiscal environment, opening up new opportunities for UK shipping and the operation of the UK register for shipping.</p>

	<p pid="a.255.4/1">My hon. Friend is right to list the many improvements that have been made in the pay and conditions of millions of British workers. The tonnage tax regime was indeed a brave attempt to improve employment and training in the maritime industry, but does she agree that the next and final step towards making it work would be to ensure that there were legal obligations and that employment and training were not just optional extras for UK-registered fleet owners?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.256.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" speakername="Katy Clark" colnum="256"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h01.htm#60426h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.256.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, and I hope to make the same point during my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">Many of the shipping working group's recommendations were taken up, and many of the policies that the Government adopted have been successful for the shipping industry. The group made a wide range of recommendations and, as is usual, the Government accepted some, but not others. The group's work led the Government to lay out their strategy in December 1998 in a policy document called &quot;British shipping: Charting a new course&quot;. The document outlined a range of policy initiatives to address the decline in the numbers of UK ships and seafarers. The centrepiece was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the policy to which my hon. Friend the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> referred&mdash;the introduction of a tonnage tax, which all parts of the industry agreed should be the way forward. The tonnage tax provides significant support to the shipping industry and is worth about &pound;40 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">I shall focus on three main aspects of Government policy towards the maritime industry: the tonnage tax and the industry's failure to deliver voluntarily on training and employment; the section 9 exemption in the Race Relations Act 1976, which makes it legal to employ foreign national seafarers on inferior wages and conditions; and the failure to apply the national minimum wage regulations to foreign seafarers in UK territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/4">The first issue is the tonnage tax and the industry's failure to deliver on training and employment&mdash;and of course we must put it in context. As I said, the Government are to be congratulated on responding to the fall in the number of UK seafarers by outlining the measures contained in their policy document &quot;British shipping: Charting a new course&quot;. One of the key objectives that the Government set themselves was to increase the training and employment of UK seafarers, and they said that the tonnage tax was the most important of the measures to deliver on that objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/5">The tonnage tax represents a significant concession to the shipping industry. Rather than paying the normal form of tax on their profits, companies that enter the tonnage tax regime pay a notional tax levy according to the size of the company fleet. However, applying the criteria that the Government set themselves for judging the success of the tonnage tax regime&mdash;the increased training and employment of UK seafarers&mdash;makes it clear that there has been little benefit in terms of the training and employment of ratings, although there has been limited success in relation to cadets. I believe that the policy's failure, particularly in relation to ratings, has resulted from the scheme's voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/6">The UK is an island nation and is heavily dependent on ships for its trade, but the number of our seafarers has declined dramatically in the past few years. UK seafaring ratings numbers have fallen from 30,000 in 1980 to just over 9,000 today. Since its introduction in 2000, the tonnage tax has not stopped the decline in training or employment, particularly for UK seafaring ratings. In fact, employment opportunities continue to decline, and the levels of training for new entrant UK ratings positions is falling. Although it is difficult to get figures, my understanding is that only 50 British ratings trainees came into the industry in 2004&ndash;05, and it is predicted that there will be fewer this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/7">Despite all the good intentions, the tonnage tax exemption cannot be a seen as a success for ratings. Although shipping companies must train cadets, there is no legal requirement to employ officers or ratings; indeed, there is no obligation even to train UK ratings&mdash;companies must simply consider UK ratings' training and employment options. Unfortunately, therefore, the majority of vessels that enter the UK register employ no UK seafaring ratings.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/8">The tonnage tax concession to the industry was worth more than &pound;61 million between its introduction in 2000 and the end of the financial year 2003&ndash;04. The latest figures from the Inland Revenue show that the cost to the taxpayer in each of the past two financial years was about &pound;40 million. The concession has clearly been successful in bringing more ships on to the UK register, although there is no obligation to register in the UK to qualify for the concession. However, the concession has not delivered increased employment for UK seafarers. It is therefore important that the Government follow through on their commitment to increase the employment of UK seafarers. We now have even fewer UK ratings than in 2000, when the concession was first introduced. I note that the Chamber of Shipping gave a commitment to increase the training of seafarers, both officers and ratings, by 25 per cent. year on year prior to the introduction of the tonnage tax in 1999. That would have doubled the number of ratings in training, but the number has declined from about 2,000 in 1999, when the tonnage tax was introduced, to about 50 more recently. The concern is that those figures will continue to fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/9">The Minister will be aware that late in 2004 the Department for Transport and the Inland Revenue published the results of their review of the tonnage tax. At the time the Government decided to delay the implementation of the link between the tonnage concession and the employment of UK seafarers. Instead, the previous Minister with responsibility for shipping referred the employment issues of the tonnage tax to a working party&mdash;the Department for Transport's shipping task force.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/10">The Transport Committee also considered the matter. It welcomed the Government's decision to include the consideration of proposals for a training commitment for ratings in the expanded terms of reference of the shipping task force working party. The Committee also said that there was a pressing need for information about what companies in the tonnage tax regime were doing to honour their commitment to ratings. Without that, the Committee stated, it would be difficult to disagree with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, the ratings' trade union, which contended that the present voluntary commitments amounted to nothing by way of an industry commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/11">Not surprisingly, the shipping task force working group was not able to reach an agreement about an employment link for UK seafarers, as the Chamber of Shipping refused to agree to any commitments on training or employment of UK ratings. Instead, the working party made a series of recommendations, including an increase of funding for training, a crew relief costs scheme and an extension to the seafarers' earnings deductions tax concessions.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/12">As yet, no details have been made available by the Chamber of Shipping or the Department for Transport on how shipping companies are honouring their commitment to consider the training and employment of ratings. I am aware that the Department for Transport has produced a short summary that gives some indication of the number of companies employing UK seafarers, but it gives no specific company training or employment figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/13">Before agreeing to the tonnage tax, an independent inquiry into the tax was commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The report, by Lord Alexander of Weedon, recommended the adoption of the tonnage tax regime. He said of the regime:</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Its extra cost to the industry of about &pound;4.5 million a year after five years is small when compared against the financial and other advantages of the tonnage tax.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/15">Given that the commitment to ratings was less than the trade union was seeking, he asked the industry to consider exploring with the Department for Transport ways to ensure the prospect of further commitments and advancement on those matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/16">The reality is that that work has never been done; given the obvious failings of the current position, which is voluntary, I sincerely hope that one outcome of today's debate will be that the issues are reconsidered and a formal link is adopted. I know that the Government are aware of the problem, and that the Minister promised a decision on training and employment being linked to the tonnage tax soon. I urge him to put compulsory measures in place to ensure that the original trade-off, about which the Government were very clear, and the original commitments, which were very much what the country and the shipping industry need, which were very clear&mdash;they are what the country and the shipping industry need&mdash;are made a reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/17">The second issue that I wish to raise is discrimination against seafarers under the Race Relations Act 1976. The Minister will be aware that historically exemptions relating to seafarers have always been found in race relations legislation. Indeed, when in Opposition, my right hon. Friend who is now the Deputy Prime Minister said that those exemptions were a national disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/18">Although the Government have amended that legislation, it is still perfectly lawful to discriminate against seafarers on the ground of their nationality. The effect is that companies are able to bring in foreign national workers at lower rates of pay and with worse conditions, so undercutting the existing work force and leading to job losses and reductions in the number of new British recruits.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/19">The Government took action by amending the 1976 Act. The sections amended related to the treatment of seafarers recruited abroad to work on UK ships, and the amendments made it lawful to discriminate on grounds of nationality rather than race, colour or ethnic origin, which had been the position until then. For the exemptions to apply, seafarers have to reside and be recruited abroad. The crux of the matter is that race relations legislation specifically allows seafarers recruited abroad to be treated differently from UK seafarers even though they may be employed and living on board UK workplaces for lengthy periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/20">Seafarers of many nationalities work in the United Kingdom and on UK-flagged ships. In some situations, UK seafarers work beside foreign nationals&mdash;on the same ships and in the same departments&mdash;but because of UK employment law, the British workers earn more and have better terms and conditions than their foreign counterparts. The Minister will be aware that representations have been made to the Government over a considerable time. Despite that, however, the discrimination continues and the employment of existing UK seafarers remains increasingly precarious.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/21">In 2004, the European Commission stated that European Union seafarers should be paid according to the home rate of the flag of the ship that they sail on regardless of their place of residence. That means that Spanish, Polish or any other EU nationals should not be discriminated against compared to resident UK seafarers employed on UK-flagged ships. However, I understand that EU nationals are still being paid a lower rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/22">Shortly after the European Commission made its position clear, the Department for Transport said that, on receipt of legal advice, it would conduct a review of sections 8 and 9 of the Race Relations Act 1976. However, no more proposals have been made. The Minister may be aware that RMT, the union that represents maritime workers, has submitted complaints to the European Commission arguing that section 9 of the 1976 Act is in breach of the European treaty provision on non-discrimination and the free movement of goods. Complaints have also been lodged with a range of other organisations, including the International Labour Organisation and the international committee on economic, social and cultural rights, and complaints have been launched with regard to the European social charter.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/23">I understand that the trade union is also considering taking formal action in the High Court to stop discrimination against foreign national seafarers, whether or not they are from the European Union. I urge the Minister to consider the matter again and to bring forward legislation to outlaw discrimination against UK seafarers once and for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/24">At the moment, shipowners continue to enjoy an exemption from the provisions of the 1976 Act. That allows them to pay exploitative rates of pay to foreign national seafarers recruited abroad. In many situations, the national minimum wage does not apply to UK seafarers on board UK ships while they are in UK waters, as the legislation applies only when ships are in port or in UK internal waters. That lack of regulation and social protection for seafarers has meant their continual replacement by low-cost foreign national seafarers.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/25">Perhaps the most high-profile recent example of problems of this nature was the Irish Ferries dispute last year, which was not, of course, a British dispute. It led to high-profile industrial action and got media attention, but such issues often do not end up in the national press. On that occasion, Irish Ferries offered its work force the option of voluntary redundancies or a cut in pay and conditions of up to 50 per cent., and there was an industrial dispute, which, hon. Members may recall, was settled only after the work force had a sit-in on the ferries. In most situations that have affected British workers, things have been far quieter. When British workers are forced to compete with low-paid foreign nationals, they often realise that the writing is on the wall and accept job losses and redundancies because of the legal position in which they are put.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/26">It is not acceptable for existing work forces to be continually replaced with cheap labour brought in from outside because British employment law does not ensure that there is a level playing field. I have a constituency interest in this matter because my constituency includes island communities, to which a number of ferries operate. Ferries are very much affected by the legislation. In recent years, there has been a creeping situation in which foreign workers are brought in on lower rates of pay and worse conditions. As a result, the existing British work force has been losing out, and new British workers are not being recruited. New foreign recruits tend to be employed on lower terms and conditions because they do not have that employment law protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/27">In my constituency, the situation is particularly relevant because Caledonian MacBrayne, which operates many of the services to the island communities and thus provides a lifeline, and which is effectively a publicly-owned company, is being put into a tendering position. While that process is clearly very much a devolved matter within the remit of the Scottish Executive, I am very aware, as a Scottish Member of Parliament, that the Executive can operate only within the legal restrictions put in place by this place. Current employment law puts many of the workers who provide these services at risk. The tendering process may lead to Caledonian MacBrayne continuing to provide the service, and the process itself might not lead to the displacement of the existing work force and the employment of low-cost foreign national seafarers, but the law does not prevent the use of cheap labour to undercut the terms and conditions of the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/28">That significant development in Scotland is yet another reason why we need to reconsider this area of law and ensure that we introduce employment law to protect the rights of existing work forces on ferries and future recruits.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.260.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1960" speakername="Alan Reid" colnum="260"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h01.htm#60426h01_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.260.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on securing the debate and on the way in which she is presenting her case. As I, too, have islands in my constituency, I share her concern about CalMac. The Government could help by accepting the recommendation of the shipping working group that employers' national insurance contributions for the shipping industry should be alleviated. The Government's rejection of that recommendation has forced CalMac to transfer all its employees to a company based outwith the UK. Does the hon. Lady agree that that could lead to a worsening of conditions, and that the Government should accept the recommendation?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.260.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" speakername="Katy Clark" colnum="260"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h01.htm#60426h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.260.1/1">I shall not comment specifically on the issue of national insurance contributions. I am aware of that development, and I think it unfortunate that the legal framework within which Caledonian MacBrayne is forced to operate is leading to it having to use devices of that nature simply to try to secure its continued existence. That company has provided lifeline services to island communities for generations. Those of us who live in areas that are served by such ferries, or who have been there on holiday, are aware of the affection in which that company is held in Scotland and its island communities. If something is not broken, we should not try to fix it, so it is unfortunate that those services are at risk because of the nature of European Union regulations and employment legislation. Therefore, I agree with the sentiments of the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/2">The third issue that I shall raise today is the national minimum wage and how it applies to seafarers. In addition to the exemption under the Race Relations Act, shipowners have managed to gain a favourable interpretation of national minimum wage legislation&mdash;a flagship Labour policy that was implemented by this Labour Government. The Department of Trade and Industry has interpreted the legislation in such a way that foreign national seafarers' entitlement to the national minimum wage applies only on UK registered ships when they are in port or in internal UK waters, as opposed to UK territorial waters. If that interpretation is correct, there is an urgent need to amend the legislation so that coverage is properly extended to all who work within UK territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/3">There are also concerns about the inadequate provisions for enforcing the legislation on board British ships. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is the only body that can logically carry out that commitment. Unfortunately, it is not required to do so, and the task is carried out by the DTI, which does not necessarily have the requisite specialist knowledge to deal with the complexities of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/4">The UK has jurisdiction over UK territorial waters which extend for 12 miles. I am aware that the Minister has said that the legislation is not as he would like it to be. I would be grateful if he would use this opportunity to issue a guidance note or introduce a statutory order to ensure that the UK minimum wage applies to UK ships in UK territorial waters, because under the current legislative framework British workers are being put in a vulnerable position.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/5">These loopholes in the law need to be filled. The Government are very much one who promote equality for all; action has to be taken to ensure that all workers employed in the UK have the full protection of the Race Relations Act and national minimum wage legislation. The minimum wage legislation is one of the most important policies introduced by Labour since it came to power, as millions of people have benefited from it. In Opposition, we heard time and again what damage it would cause the British industry, but many of those comments were scaremongering. Similarly, many of the arguments now being advanced as to why we cannot apply the national minimum wage to seafarers and foreign national seafarers do not hold water and will not stand the test of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/6">Our manifesto last year made it clear that tax credits and minimum wage legislation were a way of ensuring that work paid for everybody. We also made it clear that we would implement Low Pay Commission recommendations for everybody. We have a proud record on such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/7">I think that this is a time to recognise that we have done a huge amount of good work for the maritime industry. Many of the Government's policies on shipping have been a great success. However, we have perhaps not been successful in ensuring that British people continue to work the ships that operate out of our country. Today, I would ask the Minister to assure us that he will continue to review the Race Relations Act and will work with all parties involved in the process to ensure that the appalling discrimination against foreign national seafarers is stopped once and for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/8">We rightly sing the praises of the national minimum wage, which will be a lasting tribute to the Government. However, I do not believe that minimum wage legislation was ever intended to exclude some of the most vulnerable in our society: migrant seafarers. Will the Minister reconsider that issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/9">Finally, Labour has a good record of using tax incentives to work with business and boost employment. I have already spoken about the huge strides that Labour has made in that area since we came to power. In my constituency, we have seen an increase of more than 25 per cent. in levels of employment. That story is repeated throughout the country. However, when the policy was put in place, the trade-off was that concessions would be provided to the shipping industry in exchange for the employment and training. We are often told by business that it is not possible to get something for nothing, yet the tonnage tax regime seems to be a situation where, when it comes to jobs, there has been no return for UK seafaring ratings. I ask the Minister to reconsider those issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.262.1/1">First, I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on the thorough way in which she introduced the debate. When preparing for the debate, I wondered who the Minister would be, and which Department would be represented. The last time that I participated in a debate on the maritime industry, the Minister was from the Department of Trade and Industry. Having heard the hon. Lady's speech, I understand why the Minister is from the Department for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/2">I declare a non-pecuniary interest as an honorary vice-president of the Society of Maritime Industries. My constituency, Fareham, has a strong interest in the maritime sector, particularly the leisure sector. The River Hamble forms the boundary of my constituency and is well known for being an area for the leisure industry. For example, Moody's Boatyard, which was once a yacht builder, is now principally into yacht sales. We have a marina builder, Walcon Marine. The Westminster Dredging Company not only keeps our sea lanes free, but uses the results of its dredging to supply the aggregates industry. Warsash maritime college trains many of the people who we see on our merchant ships&mdash;not only UK-flagged ships, but ships flagged across the world. There is a strong international element to the student base. In south-east Hampshire, the maritime sector is dominated by VT Group. I will return to VT Group, formerly Vosper Thornycroft, later.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/3">I want to reflect for a moment on the comment that I made at the beginning of my speech about who might speak for the Government on this occasion. A number of Departments have a strong interest in the maritime industry. It is sometimes difficult for those working in that successful sector to identify the lead voice.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/4">The DTI has a marine unit, which has been effective in trying to improve dialogue, particularly on issues such as the defence industrial strategy. Of course, the DTI is going through a process of increased regionalisation, which might lead to a dilution of its support for the maritime industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/5">The Ministry of Defence is the principal customer for UK shipbuilding. Its defence industrial strategy has a strong strand of the marine industrial strategy running alongside it. The DFT takes the lead in many issues that affect the maritime industry, but when we consider the research and development framework that has been discussed by the EU, should the DFT or the DTI speak on such issues?</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/6">It is important that the Government consider how they support the maritime industry and whether that should be through a single Minister or improved co-ordination. Either approach has advantages. The maritime industry is looking for a stronger, clearer lead on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.0/1">I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman was at the end of his list, but I would like him to incorporate the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which has a distinct and significant interest in the recycling and breaking of ships at the end of their lives. The improved environmental legislation that gets rid of single-hull ships will inevitably lead to more breaking. It must not happen on south Asian beaches where environmental standards are low.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. In the alphabet soup of ministerial responsibilities, DEFRA plays an important role. It has launched consultation on the draft Marine Bill, which is perhaps not as broad as its title would suggest. A range of people are interested.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/2">The breaking-up of ships has environmental consequences. There was a debate in the previous Parliament when one such ship was going to be broken up in Hartlepool, when Peter Mandelson was the Member of Parliament. There was some debate about whether that should happen here or overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/3">I want to go back to the maritime industrial strategy, the importance of shipbuilding and the MOD as the industry's principal customer. VT Group is based in Portsmouth, with a modern dockyard facility that has recently opened in a transfer of facilities from Woolston. Alongside that is the maintenance system co-owned by VT Group and BAE Systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/4">As a constituency MP considering issues about the future of VT Group and the repair and maintenance facility in the dockyard, I have always been conscious of the uneven nature of the work load, which can lead to feast or famine. For example, there might be an order for a number of warships and VT Group will have to gear up for that, as it will have to for the carrier vessel future, or CVF. There will also be times when VT Group will have to lay off employees because of a dip in the work load from the MOD. At the moment, VT Group is fortunate as not only does it have work on the Type 45 destroyer, but it has secured a successful export contract for ships. That should maintain the work load until the CVF comes on stream, when the group will need to recruit more staff to cope with that bulge in the work load.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/5">The question arises of what will happen after CVF. What plans do the MOD have to ensure that work goes into UK dockyards, and how does that match our defence needs? If we are to have a viable warship building industry in the UK, we need some certainty about future work loads to ensure that the principal warship builders have some knowledge of what capacity will be required. That requires a closer working relationship between the industry and the MOD, which raises the question of value for money for taxpayers. How will we ensure that we have some competition for warship and shipbuilding while ensuring that the industry has some certainty? The MOD is going down the route of through-life maintenance contracts, so it is interested when procuring warships not only in the initial build costs but in how much it will cost to maintain those warships. That requires some transfer risk to the shipbuilding businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.1/6">When considering such partnering arrangements, which VT Group is committed to, we should manage to balance the respective interests of the taxpayer and the warship building industry to produce a satisfactory outcome that ensures stability of employment and maintenance of capacity along with a good deal for the taxpayer. Those are some of the important issues that affect my constituency. I appreciate that this is outside the scope of the Minister's responsibilities, but I hope that his opposite numbers in the MOD will read these remarks and think about how best to accommodate the conflicting pressures on the warship industry in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.264.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on obtaining the debate. She made a very good case. She spoke of the proud record of the Government, but she also made a powerful case for the need further to improve the prospects of seafarers. I come from Plymouth, another proud naval constituency, and I well remember marching up and down Fore street in Saltash with the district National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers officer, Baz Gregory, when I stood&mdash;I was unsuccessful at the time&mdash;as a candidate in South-East Cornwall in the 1990s. At that time, people were fearful as to whether there was a future for UK seafarers at all. It is a mark of where we have got to today that we are standing up and fighting for the right conditions for those seafarers.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/2">In addition to declaring my interest in that I come from a seafaring constituency, I declare a non-pecuniary interest as a vice-president of the Society of Maritime Industries. The United Kingdom, and in particular London, is a world centre for maritime activities, and to maintain that position we need to find ways to value seafarers. That is important in its own right but also because we need to recognise the strong links between offshore work and the experience that people gain as seafarers, and the significant gaps in the important onshore work and the need to recruit people there. If we do not start valuing people when they are young and go to sea and gain that experience, it becomes much more difficult to look forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/3">Following on from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase>, I declare not exactly an interest but an experience with the Defence Committee. I reiterate what he said about the need to try to get these things right for the future of British shipbuilding. A huge programme of shipbuilding, the biggest for two generations, was laid out as part of the defence industrial strategy last December. That will be followed through with the marine industrial strategy. I do not know whether my hon. Friend the Minister can comment on what part he and his Department might play in seeing that through. Important skills issues relating not only to the onshore infrastructure, which supports the maritime industry, but to the shipbuilding industry need to be addressed. As I understand it, the marine industrial strategy is setting out to address how best we can sustain critical industrial skills and technologies that we need for the future, while delivering improved performance quality and competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/4">I said that I came from a well known naval constituency. The region has a terrifically long coastline&mdash;one third of the coastline of England. It is no surprise that the marine and maritime sectors have been identified as priorities in respect of economic development by our regional development agency. We have growth in that sector, mainly deriving from leisure, marine and defence-related activities and important centres at Falmouth, Plymouth and Poole. I want to consider the need to get the wider maritime industry on board in valuing not only seafarers, but the work that many seafarers go on to do after their seafaring career, which my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/5">I draw to the Minister's attention the work of Marine South West, which has emerged from the work of the regional development agency, and the network of skills centres that it is developing as a potential model and way forward. The skills centres are based on the three communities that I mentioned. They are also supported by IT networks. A great deal of work has been done with the marine and maritime industry to identify the top 10 skills list for onshore jobs. The skills include those relating to business management, IT, electronic engineering, mechanical engineering, welding and fabrication, painting and finishing, composites, carpentry and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/6">That work is aimed at ensuring that there is a bridge to enable people in the general marine and maritime industries to find careers and a way forward. That is important to the case that my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran laid out, because if those skills gaps exist, it is exceedingly important that we find ways to assist seafarers. Often when they are younger, their skills are developed and they are valued and rewarded for the work that they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/7">I am sure that the Minister appreciates that the marine and maritime industries are high technology-based and that their continued success is based on the application of enterprise and innovation. In January, I was able to secure the Upper Waiting Room for an exhibition on just how high-tech those industries have become. I found the figures quite staggering: for Plymouth alone, we are talking about &pound;1 billion for the marine, maritime and broader marine science sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.264.0/8">We need to develop programmes across the piece to inspire young people to pursue careers in that rewarding and vital sector. We need to develop employer-led training and skills centres such as those exemplified by Marine South West. I look forward to the Minister's response to the important points that my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran raised. I hope that the Minister will also acknowledge the points that I have made about the way in which the south-west is leading the way on some of these matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.266.0/1">The normal crew assembles for debates on this subject over the years. However, I must apologise because one of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">our crew is missing: my hon. Friend the Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase> is on parliamentary business abroad. I declare an interest as the chair of the RMT parliamentary group and I refer to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing the debate and on her superb and definitive description of the industry as it stands and the issues facing us. I shall be brief because other hon. Members want to speak. I shall focus on the Race Relations Act 1976 and the minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/3">There is an element of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu because we were in Westminster Hall three years ago having the same debate and things do not seem to have moved on. In 2003, the Home Office made it clear that it did not believe that the shipping industry should be excluded from race relations legislation. It then started the consultation about how to bring the shipping industry within that legislation. We went through that debate and the Government decided that they would introduce amendments to the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/4">I was cheered and enthused that at long last the Government were addressing this sector of British life, which had been excluded from the basic laws of civilised society as we know it. Then, the Government created the bizarre situation in which discrimination on the basis of ethnicity was outlawed, but discrimination could continue on the ground of nationality. Employers could pay one worker less than another simply because of the country from which they came. That is outrageous in any civilised society.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/5">We went on with the debate, however, and I think that it was in this Room that the statutory instrument was considered. I attended the Committee considering it. I was not a member of the Committee, but I exercised my right to speak. One thing that convinced hon. Members to support the amendment allowing discrimination on the ground of nationality to continue was the Minister's statement, both in that Committee and in the Adjournment debate, that hon. Members need have no fear because the minimum wage would apply to anyone serving on a British ship in UK waters. I did not go away happy, but I thought that at least we had secured some commitment from the Government. Within months, we discovered that &quot;territorial waters&quot; was not the definition, but &quot;internal waters&quot;. I sail on the Norfolk broads; I have an old, battered wooden boat and I am not a very good sailor. When I sail, people get off the water if they see me coming. If I employed someone on that boat in Norfolk waters, they would get the minimum wage. If I sailed outside Great Yarmouth harbour, I doubt that they would because we would have gone outside internal waters. No one knew what internal waters meant. I had never heard the definition before, and we had to scurry for lawyers to get that definition and to find out where the idea had come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/6">People are still being discriminated against in the industry because they are not achieving the minimum wage, and it is happening on ferry service after ferry service: Larne to Troon and Cairnryan, Mostyn to Dublin, Rosslare to Cherbourg, Fleetwood to Dublin and Belfast and Liverpool to Dublin. British seafarers are being replaced by Spanish, Filipinos and others who are paid less and work in poorer conditions. That is exploitation by any standard. No one is arguing for those people to lose their jobs, but if they have jobs they should be paid the same rate as anyone else. Why should one person be paid less than and work in different conditions from others when they are doing the same job within our own territorial waters? That is a scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/7">The situation is the same on the Hull to Zeebrugge route run by P&amp;O North Sea Ferries, which uses British, Portuguese and Filipino workers, with the Filipinos being exploited the most. Companies are allowed to pay disgraceful wages. Ramsay Shipping, which trades between the UK and Ireland and the UK and Scandinavia, is paying Filipino seafarers &pound;456 a month. Union Transport&mdash;there is an ironic name if ever there was one&mdash;is paying east European seafarers &pound;856 a month. It trades between the Isle of Man and Britain, and the Isle of Man and Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/8">We have raised this matter time and time again. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers issued a press release 18 months ago regarding a company called Lapthorn, which is paying people below the minimum wage. Our information at the moment is that that continues to be the practice. Workers are being exploited within sight of the British coast as a result of our failure to plug the gap in race relations legislation. I believe that this is a disgrace, for a Labour Government in particular, and for a civilised society.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/9">As my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran said, the European Union has introduced directives that ensure that the Government must comply so that EU workers, at least, receive the same treatment as UK seafarers. My hon. Friend the Minister gave us a commitment in February 2005 that amendments to the legislation would be brought forward, but by the end of 2005 we had not seen any. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that we get Government action speedily. Three years on from the previous Adjournment debate on the issue and two years on from the statutory instrument Committee we are still in a situation where workers are being exploited, and where employers are exploiting a loophole in the law. It is a moral responsibility on this Government to act, and act now.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.0/1">I, too, add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">my congratulations to my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I welcome the opportunity to talk about recent disputes with Irish Ferries at the end of 2005, which my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/2">The dispute is now over, but it raises important questions regarding UK shipping and the future of UK and Irish ferries. The Irish Ferries dispute was one of the most serious industrial disputes in Ireland's history and it was sparked by the proposed replacement of 543 Irish seafarers by eastern European seafarers on rates of pay well below those of the minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/3">Irish Ferries run ships between Britain and Ireland and the company sought to dismiss its existing Irish sailors and replace them with workers from Latvia and Estonia on lower rates of pay and longer hours. Irish Ferries adopted crude tactics by smuggling private security guards on board the ships to make sure that the handover to the new cheaper crew went smoothly. That further inflamed the dispute with a stand-off developing on the Isle of Irishmore ship in Pembroke and the Ulysses in Holyhead.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/4">On both those ships seafarers occupied the vessels in protest and refused to leave the berth with a new crew unfamiliar with the operation of the ship. The port authorities also refused to grant the International Transport Workers Federation inspectors access to the ships' crews to check on their welfare, which was in breach of International Labour Organisation convention 147. In December last year, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions co-ordinated a day of action with workers across Ireland stopping work in support of the existing Irish Ferries seafarers. The dispute resulted in the cancellation of Ireland's social partnership negotiations, although regrettably the European shipowners organisation could not bring itself to condemn the actions of Irish Ferries despite concerns being raised in the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/5">In the 21st century the people of Ireland could not comprehend how it was possible for shipowners forcibly to dismiss Irish seafarers and replace them with seafarers from eastern Europe on rates of pay equivalent to half the Irish minimum wage, when at the time the minimum wage was only &pound;5.20 per hour. Unfortunately, in the shipping industry it seems that a different set of rules apply. The Irish Government condemned the actions of Irish Ferries, but stated that the transfer of the flag from Ireland to Cyprus meant that they were powerless to act. The Cyprus flag is one of the countries that have been deemed by the International Transport Workers Federation to be a flag of convenience. Flags of convenience are often utilised by shipping companies as safety and working conditions are not enforced effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/6">In the end, the settlement brokered through the Irish courts resulted in the replacement of significant numbers of Irish seafarers with cheaper labour from Eastern Europe. Thanks to the heroic actions of a group of seafarers the rates of pay were not below the minimum wage but the company has none the less succeeded in lowering standards in the Irish sea sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/7">Standards around the UK coast have declined in the past few years, but there are still shipping companies who employ UK seafarers, both as ratings and officers. For example one of Irish Ferries principal competitors, the Swedish company Stena Line, operates ferry services around the UK, including in the Irish sea, and employs seafaring officers and crew on UK rates of pay. In addition, UK seafarers are employed by P&amp;O Irish Sea Ferries although the company also employs other nationalities. Norse Irish also employs UK and other foreign national sailors.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/8">Irish Ferries threatened to start a race to the very bottom and its actions endangered the future of British and Irish seafarers in the ferry sector. The ferry sector is now one of the few remaining areas of employment for UK seafaring ratings. During the dispute, the RMT wrote to the Minister responsible for shipping, asking him to convene early discussions with Irish Government counterparts to implement measures to tackle awful practices in the shipping industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/9">Acceptable social standards have to be enforced on all ships trading between UK and Irish ports, irrespective of the flag of the vessel. The UK Government have previously gone on record as supporting the EU directive. This directive sought to ensure that the pay and conditions of seafarers on regular passenger and ferry services trading between the UK and other parts of the European Union were in line with seafarers of the member state with the closest connection to the ferry or passenger service. It was not possible to get the support of all member states to pass this legislation, but given the increasing frequency of the displacement of UK and Irish seafarers, similar legislation will undoubtedly be debated again. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Minister can advise me that the Government still support the principles and measures as outlined in this directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/10">We must take action to safeguard the standards of the UK flag and we must also work with other EU member states to ensure that acceptable social standards are enforced on all ships trading around the UK. I hope that the Minister will agree to engage constructively with members of the RMT parliamentary group, so that we can work towards an acceptable solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.0/1">I add <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">my congratulations to the hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing the debate, because it is an important subject. I welcome her to the select band of people who take an interest in shipping matters from a constituency point of view. I have taken an interest in them from an early stage of my parliamentary career, and I welcome her to the club.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/2">The hon. Lady presented her arguments in a measured but forceful manner. The only part of her analysis with which I could take issue was her fondness for Caledonian MacBrayne. At some other time and place, we can discuss the impact of Caledonian MacBrayne, and David MacBrayne before it, on the development of highlands and islands communities. I fear that if we were to do so today, Mr. Gale, you would rightly rule us out of order.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/3">It is tempting to speak of the shipping industry, but in truth there are a number of different industries. One remarkable feature of the shipping industry is its global nature. The simple commercial reality is that if we do not operate a commercial regime that allows or encourages people to flag, operate and trade here, plenty of other countries will. It means that when the Government construct something such as the tonnage tax, which I have supported not uncritically, they must perform a delicate balancing act. I do not think that they have got the balance right, but I recognise the need for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/4">It is a different situation from that outlined by the hon. Lady, regarding the operation of section 9 of the Race Relations Act 1976, and in particular the exemption of inshore waters from the application of the minimum wage. I can see no excuse for that. It is bizarre and perverse that somebody who drives a bus or a train on dry land is treated differently from somebody who works on a ferry or any other inshore shipping vessel. I cannot understand the logic of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> was right about the distinction between discrimination on the basis of nationality as opposed to ethnicity. That distinction would not be tolerated in any other sphere of industry or commerce, and I do not understand why it is tolerated in shipping. My experience is that many things are tolerated in shipping simply because they do not take place on land. In relation to shipping safety standards and practice, if many ships on the high seas were lorries on the road, traffic commissioners would take them off immediately, and next day the story would be on the front page of every tabloid.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/6">I want to pay tribute to some of the organisations that work in shipping. In particular, the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers and the Chamber of Shipping are very good at keeping Members of Parliament informed, and at providing thorough and frequent briefings. As one would expect, they often approach a subject from different angles, but I find the input from both organisations immensely helpful. I shall raise a few points that they have mentioned in their briefings. The first is on the tonnage tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/7">The Chamber of Shipping rightly points out that in just over five years, the commercial shipping fleet that is owned and managed in the UK has more than doubled in carrying capacity. The UK flag fleet has more than quadrupled. The chamber makes the point, which I had not heard, that shipping earns &pound;1.2 million an hour for the UK economy. We must understand that whatever romantic notions there may be, we are dealing with a big business.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/8">The chamber also makes one interesting claim that I shall pursue with it and NUMAST in the fullness of time. Its research carried out jointly with NUMAST shows that the total number of junior officers recruited will increase by 19 per cent. over the next three years and continue to increase over the next decade. I hope that they are right, but I am not sure that even an increase of that sort would meet the targets that have been outlined. Further, nothing is said about the position of ratings.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/9">The two organisations also say something more telling: there has been a 9 per cent. decrease in the number of UK deck and engine officers since 1997, and the total number of UK officers is expected to continue to decline in the short term. They say that some of the reasons for that relate to demographics.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/10">What is the appropriate way to administer the tonnage tax? It has been around for several years, and it has proved its worth by bringing shipping under the British flag. However, being under the British flag proves to be of limited value unless it brings with it the application of certain basic standards of labour and safety. The Government must do more. The case has been made, and it is clear that the industry will not apply those standards voluntarily. The Minister must say that the need for a link has been accepted. If he or his Treasury colleagues were prepared to do that, it would move the debate on to the nature of the link, which is where the substantial negotiations remain to take to place.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/11">It is difficult to divorce shipping interests from those of ports. The Government are shortly to commence a consultation on their port strategy. Declaring a constituency interest, I issue to the Government a plea that when they consult they have particular regard to the changing nature of containerised shipping throughout the world. The market model shows that there is an increasing number of big container ships, which to my mind and to the minds of many in the shipping industry means that we are moving towards large container ports&mdash;hubs from which smaller ships take the containers on to smaller ports. That is inevitable, and we need at least one such hub in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.0/12">I have a constituency interest in that, and so does the hon. Lady, because Hunterston in her constituency has the infrastructure to accommodate such a hub, and it is building up that area of the business. In my case, the natural deep-water port of Scapa Flow is available for development, and there is a great deal of support in Orkney for taking that forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that there is a strong environmental case for placing ports not only in the south of England, but in other parts of the country? There is a particular need in the north of England and in Scotland for freight not to enter the country through Rotterdam or the south of England, and for it to do so in a way that minimises the road transport of freight.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.1/1">The hon. Lady is right. The environmental arguments for putting more freight on to the sea are compelling. With the south of England's substantial amount of freight transport, it is probably the worst place for freight to enter. If UK plc does not get its act together soon, other places will cheerfully take that business, as they have done with other aspects of shipping. I suspect that it will be lost to ports such as Rotterdam, which will mean that the points of entry will be the south coast ports, which will bring no environmental benefit. The opportunities for commercial employment and environmental improvement that would result from placing hubs in constituencies such as mine and the hon. Lady's would be lost.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.2/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing the debate and on a well informed and impassioned speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/2">The red ensign now flies over 3 per cent. of the world's merchant shipping, a far cry from the days when we had 40 per cent. of the ships prowling the globe, and when the merchant navy's sister service, the Royal Navy, could maintain a two-power standard. Nevertheless, the merchant fleet is as important as ever to our economy. It has again overtaken aviation to become our third largest export earner, with a turnover of more than &pound;10 billion. More than 95 per cent. of our trade comes from the sea, 67 million people travelled to and from our shores by boat, and Britain has Europe's largest ports industry and the world's most significant maritime hub, with an annual turnover of &pound;37 billion. We must also remember all the ancillary operations, from insurance to marine law, in which Britain is a world leader.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/3">We have had a well informed debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1582" name="Mark Hoban">My hon. Friend the Member for Fareham (Mr. Hoban)</phrase> discussed naval shipbuilding. I shall not follow him down that route and go beyond my brief, but, sadly, it appears that many of the problems that existed 20 years ago when I was a management consultant to several shipbuilders continue to exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.271.2/4">We no longer face a serious military threat of being cut off by sea from major supplies of crude oil and materials, but in times of crisis there is still an important defence need, as my hon. Friend reminded us, to transport troops and arms to war zones. During the Falklands war, dozens of vessels were requisitioned for service in the south Atlantic. Merchant sailors faced death and injury on behalf of their nation and were rightly rewarded for their gallantry. Looking across a range of such issues, we can see why the decline in the merchant navy in the past 30 years is so serious for British trade.</p>

	<p pid="a.272.0/1">Did the hon. Gentleman read the article in the <i>NUMAST Telegraph </i>last year or the year before which made the valid point that we would not be able to raise the Falklands taskforce again in an emergency?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.272.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" speakername="Julian Brazier" colnum="272"  time="010:40:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h01.htm#60426h01_spnew17">
	<p pid="a.272.1/1">The hon. Gentleman anticipates my next point. Today, we would be incapable of fighting an operation such as the Falklands war, at least with the support of British merchant ships. In 1982, 985 ships of more than 500 gross tonnes were owned and registered in the UK. Today, the figure is 260. Worse still, the number of British merchant sailors has fallen by three quarters over that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/2">The two Gulf wars have shown that, in such situations, the Government can hire merchant ships from other shipping registers and foreign owners. However, while we might be able to afford to hire ships, the availability of trained and loyal sailors might prove more difficult. Admiral Sir Nicholas Hunt stated at an all-party House of Commons Defence Committee sitting:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/3" class="indent">&quot;The crucial weakness is that even if we can get the ships, we have to have the seafarers . . . The kernel of the problem is . . . I am a bit doubtful if you could get the men who were properly qualified.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/4">As the Defence Committee said many years ago, there are some things that money cannot buy, and that is certainly true in the case of pride, bravery and courage.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/5">I have some sympathy with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the points made by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> about seafarers, specifically in UK territorial waters. As it is a complicated matter and one on which my party is conducting a large policy process, I cannot give an Opposition view on it, apart from saying that I heard his points and have some sympathy with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/6">I salute the Government's efforts, through the introduction of the tonnage tax, to rebuild our merchant marine sector after many generations of decline, and their efforts to ensure a stable and competitive environment for the industry. The hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran referred several times to &quot;Charting a New Course&quot;. Some, but not all, of its recommendations have been adopted, and it would be interesting to hear from the Minister what the timetable is for delivery on the remaining recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/7">UK-owned has shipping increased its tonnage by 137 per cent. since 2000, and the tonnage of the fleet flying the red ensign has increased by 325 per cent. during the same period. There are nearly 600 new officer cadets each year, one third more than before the tonnage tax was introduced. I am indebted to the General Council of British Shipping and NUMAST for that briefing. However, while that improvement is welcome, it does not go nearly far enough. Even with the increase in cadets being trained, and even with 90 per cent. of those cadets finding jobs in the UK fleet, as the joint study by the Chamber of Shipping and NUMAST showed, the sad fact is that the number of new officers each year is barely half the number needed merely to stand still, largely because the age profile of existing officers is so far to the right. At current trends, the number of UK officers will fall by almost half in the next 15 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/8">As the hon. Lady said, the position with ratings is much worse. Unless the trend is reversed speedily, there is a severe danger of the sector going back into decline. International Financial Services, London has warned that the vast contributions made by British shipping and associated maritime services to the Exchequer could be in jeopardy.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/9">I paid tribute to the Government's efforts on the tonnage tax, but their record on the ports sector has been most disappointing. Severe delays in decisions about port development are a threat not just to the shipping industry but, arguably, to the wider economy. The Dibden bay farrago&mdash;seven years of arguing, &pound;45 million into the pockets of lawyers, and at the end of it only a firm &quot;No&quot;&mdash;seriously undermined confidence in the whole system. That confidence can be restored only by Government action to ensure that timely decisions are made about the development of ports, which brings me to an obvious question: when will the strategy that we have heard so much about be published? We need to take a wider look at how the transport strategy&mdash;road, rail and so on&mdash;will serve the infrastructure of existing and planned port developments. To take one example at random, Crossrail, which is going through the House with the support of all parties, and rightly so, as currently planned would mess up the freight links to Felixstowe.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/10">On a more detailed point, may I tease the Minister once again about the Harbours Bill? The industry and my party want that small and sensible measure, and the Government have said that they want it. Will he have a word with his right hon. Friend the Leader of the House and get us a Second Reading debate of an hour or two, which is a reasonable requirement for any Bill? There have been plenty of slots when it could have been fitted in.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/11">The maritime sector in this country has been unwell for decades and is in a fragile state. There is a modest recovery at present, but we must be careful not to make the industry reconsider its position in this country. The Chamber of Shipping stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/12" class="indent">&quot;The industry is perhaps the most global and most easily relocated of all industries. Any disturbance of the current successful climate in the UK will put the recovery at serious risk.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/13">We must consider either a clearer employment link to the tonnage tax, or other employment-related measures. The unions and the Transport Committee have called for the former, and the General Council of British Shipping has some ideas on the latter. As so much of our maritime future lies in being able to resuscitate the skills sector of the industry, it is important that we consider every possibility and take whatever decision needs to be taken soon.</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/14">In summary, I hope that the Minister will give the timetable for delivery of the remaining recommendations in &quot;Charting a New Course&quot;. I hope that we will hear something about publication of the shipping taskforce's report, to which the hon. Lady referred, on possible links between employment and the tonnage tax, and I should like to know when the ports policy will be published. Finally, can we have a commitment on that small measure that has been around for a long time, the Harbours Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.272.1/15">I am pleased to have had an opportunity to speak in the debate on this great industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.0/1">I, too, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing this debate and on joining the small, select band of MPs who take maritime issues seriously. I wish that that band was much larger, and that we had these debates more often. Since I have been in my post, I can recollect offhand only one occasion on which I was asked a question on maritime matters at first order questions. That really is not good enough; the House should take more interest in such an important industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/2">Several hon. Members have described the importance of the industry, which has earnings of more than &pound;10 billion a year, and export earnings of &pound;7 billion a year. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> said, it has overtaken aviation to become the third largest export earner for our country's economy. It is a very important industry, and it has strategic importance, too: 95 per cent. of goods that come into and out of the country are still carried by sea. It is a vital industry. Nor is it restricted to the sea; the industry extends into land&mdash;into the financial and insurance sectors, and into the ports. Ports can be a tool for regeneration for our communities and are themselves a key part of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/3">A small part of the east Kent mafia is here today. Its members include the hon. Member for Canterbury and I, as well as you, Mr. Gale. We know that the biggest employer in Kent is not Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, as everybody usually says, but the port of Dover, if one takes on board both direct and indirect employment. In addition, there are ports at Sheppey; there are the Medway ports; and there are smaller ports at Ramsgate, Broadstairs, and Margate, which is in your constituency, Mr. Gale. There is also the leisure boating industry and the under-12m fishing fleet around Kent. In fact, in counties such as Kent, maritime issues are the most important part of the economy. Essentially, the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran put to me were how we maintain that, and build on it to encourage further employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/4">My hon. Friend has painted a slightly pessimistic picture of employment in the industry. It is not as I would like it to be, and there are not enough UK seafarers working yet, but the situation is improving. There were 896 UK officers employed on tonnage tax boats when the tonnage tax started in 2000&ndash;01, and there are now 2,888. The number of ratings has increased from 449 to 1,460. One could argue that that is because far more boats have come under the tonnage tax over that period. However, although between 1997 and 2001 the number of UK active seafarers fell from 30,000 to 25,000, that fall has been reversed; by 2004 there were 29,000 UK active seafarers, and 26,500 of those are at sea, so the situation is not quite as bleak as my hon. Friend describes it.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/5">As was put fairly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, the dilemma that I face is that of striking a balance. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1607" name="Linda Riordan">The hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan)</phrase> described what is, in a sense, an Irish problem. She talked about the situation as regards Irish Ferries and about what happened when Irish Ferries flagged out. Under those circumstances, a new crew could be brought on board who would work for much less than Irish citizens would. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers wrote to me, asking me to intervene, and the Irish Shipping Minister had many conversations with me during that crisis; he was a frequent telephone caller to my office, asking for advice and support. That crisis highlighted what happens when regulations that shipowners do not like are put in place. Shipping is an international business and, at the stroke of a pen, people can move their ships under another flag and take on a new set of lesser restrictions, so there is a balancing act to perform.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/6">I have heard and understand the arguments advanced by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Officers and the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers. We have not yet made our decisions on the output of the shipping taskforce; those announcements will have to wait until after purdah, but it will not be long before we announce what we will go for. I ask colleagues on both sides of the Chamber for a little sympathy for the fact that I have a narrow line to walk between wanting to do something that will stimulate employment and bring UK seafarers on to boats, and wanting to bring ships under the red ensign. Let us not forget that people do not have to be under the red ensign to benefit from tonnage tax; likewise, people under the red ensign do not have to be within the tonnage tax regime. I want ships to be under the red ensign, and I want UK seafarers on them. I have to try to find a way to maximise that potential, but without driving shipowners to take their ships away from the red ensign and the tonnage tax, and to put them instead under other flags, and flags of convenience.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/7">I remind the House that there are many flags of convenience, and that there are also numerous variants on the tonnage tax now. We may have invented it, but other countries came along afterwards and thought, &quot;That was a jolly good wheeze that the Brits came up with; we'll do the same thing.&quot; Shipowners have choices, and we have to find a way of navigating through those choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/8">At the end of the day, one thing that will help us to bring UK seafarers back to the sea is the training regime that we offer. That point was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>. Our seafarers will never be as cheap as other countries' seafarers, so they have to be better&mdash;better trained, better qualified, and providing better value for money. We have to find a way of doing that. Could the training regime that we put in place and the money that we provide for training be tools that we use to encourage shipowners to stay under the red ensign, to stay with tonnage tax, and to use UK seafarers, to offset any extra costs of employing UK seafarers that they might incur? Hon. Members will have to wait until our announcements to find out, but that certainly is one thing that we will have to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">My hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, who made a powerful case about the Race Relations Act 1976, will also have to wait. I do not recollect making a commitment to sort the matter out by the end of 2005; I made a commitment to him to bring the Act within EU law.</p>

	<p pid="a.276.1/1">I remain committed to bringing the 1976 Act within EU law; it is the date by which my hon. Friend thinks that I promised to do it that I am slightly in doubt about. That is an issue that we need to continue to work on.</p>
	<p pid="a.276.1/2">I shall deal with one or two other points raised. We cannot start the ports policy review until the last of the outstanding planning decisions that we have a mind to approve&mdash;that on London Gateway&mdash;is taken. That is because until we know whether we are granting that planning permission or not, we do not know what our existing port capacity is. How can we come up with a strategy for the country unless we know what our existing port capacity is, and is projected to be? Also, legal constraints would come into play if we started the ports policy review while there was a high-profile, outstanding planning issue to be decided. I hope that that matter will be dealt with very shortly; then we can move on and start the ports policy review, which, as the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said, is vital, and which it is important that we get on with. Unfortunately, the Scottish Parliament has made a universal declaration of independence on the ports policy review and will conduct its own parallel review of its ports strategy, so to what extent the strategy for England and Wales&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.277.3/1">I suspect that, like me and most other citizens of this country, the Minister receives his fair share of dubious mail shots, which are a national problem. Rogue businesses buy or rent addresses that sound legitimate or prestigious and use them as part of a scam. They have the mail redirected to them or collect it personally. People who send money to those addresses probably do not realise that they are merely a front&mdash;in many cases, a shoe box-sized locker or a pigeon hole in a very small office.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/2">Calculating the numbers of accommodation address providers or the companies using them is difficult, as they rapidly come and go. They exist to some degree in most local authority areas, but there is no way of keeping track of them. Although a minority of accommodation address providers make reasonable inquiries of their customers, far too many are happy to accept cash payments and take mobile phone numbers as the only contact detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/3">I appreciate that tackling the abuse of accommodation addresses is not a panacea for dealing with mail scams, many of which originate abroad. However, experience shows that many of the victims are initially identified by fraudsters operating through scams in the UK. Once that happens, they tend to be targeted by all and sundry. A perfect and tragic example in my constituency was that of an older person who had lost a total of &pound;25,000 on mailing scams. He suffers from dementia. Carers alerted west Yorkshire trading standards officers, who found eight plastic carrier bags full of further mail requesting money for dubious lotteries and competitions and various other scams. According to figures I was given recently, the West Yorkshire Trading Standards Service has received more than 200 complaints in the past year, but it is believed that that is the tip of the iceberg.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/4">I should make it clear that the majority of mailing houses that provide accommodation addresses operate within the law. Sadly, however, some less reputable businesses use those facilities to set up dubious home-working scams, operate prize draws and lotteries, offer mail order goods that never arrive and generally rip off the public. We know from many media stories how wide the problem is.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/5">Unfortunately, the people who provide the accommodation addresses all too often operate on a &quot;no questions asked&quot; basis and keep insufficient or no records on those who use the addresses. Thus, those users are virtually anonymous. All too often, the investigating police and trading standards officers, such as those in my area of west Yorkshire, visit the accommodation addresses only to find that there are no proper details on the individuals who use them.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/6">There is a voluntary code of conduct, but many accommodation address providers do not adhere to it; I shall come to that issue shortly. West Yorkshire trading standards officers have told me how frustrating it is to go to such providers and ask them to stop providing facilities for obvious and palpable scams, only for the operators to shrug their shoulders and say, &quot;Well, we are not breaking any laws.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/7">Enforcement action needs to go hand in hand with the public awareness and education that will help people not to be victims in the first place. Many of us operate under the simple rule that if something looks too good to be true, it probably is.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/8">I could cite many examples to demonstrate the sort of scams that use accommodation addresses; I am sure that, given his position, my hon. Friend the Minister is aware of even more. One example that particularly struck me was the company Select Publications, not because of the size of individual losses but because of the scale of its operation. The company was registered with Companies House, using a mailing address in Westminster as its registered office. When it was finally brought to the courts, the two people running it were found guilty of deception and sentenced to three and a half years' and two years' imprisonment respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/9">As a result of the company's efforts to cover its tracks, the investigation required a huge amount of work by police and trading standards officers. They were not helped by the fact that the accommodation address providers had kept no records that allowed them to trace the individuals; that is one reason why I have cited this example. It took two years to get the defendants to court, and it is thought that they ripped off about 16,000 consumers.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/10">The company used multiple addresses around the UK, including one on the Edgware road, to disguise its location. It advertised in local newspapers, on jobs websites and in <i>Exchange and Mart</i>, offering home-working opportunities stuffing envelopes. It also offered a home-working advice line, an undeclared premium-rate phone line, that cost people about &pound;20 for a 10-minute call. To obtain the jobs stuffing envelopes, the victims, as I shall call them, had to pay a &pound;35 administration fee and often received nothing in return.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/11">Those who got envelopes never received any pay&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;and were subsequently bombarded with mail shots from further businesses, all owned by the principals of the original company, Select, who used different addresses to disguise that fact and start the process all over again.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/12">Another company registered with Companies House used an accommodation address in Islington as its registered office. In the run-up to Christmas, the company placed adverts for cut-price goods, including TVs, Playstations and Gameboys, in three national newspapers, to exploit the festive season and the wish of parents to gratify the demands of their young ones. The company took upwards of &pound;150,000 in debit and credit card receipts before the directors fled their homes, no doubt having ruined the Christmases of many people.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/13">The directors had also registered another company at a separate address after setting up a website that offered the same goods, but failed to deliver any. The investigation uncovered hundreds of consumers who had paid by debit card; on average, they had lost &pound;200 each. Again, when trading standards officers approached the accommodation address providers, they were given no information about the individuals concerned. That made the investigation difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/14">I could go on and on. Another company carried out removals on behalf of customers and sold the householders' furniture and other valuable items. Again, it used a mailing address as a front so that customers were unable to trace it. An accommodation address was also used as a front for a bogus bank that inveigled two American banks into clearing two cheques for several hundred thousand dollars each. The examples go on and on.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/15">Prestigious accommodation addresses are often used to enhance the image of a company that operates by mail. For example, companies purporting to sell medically related goods may use a Harley street address that turns out to be nothing more than an accommodation address used by hundreds of different businesses. One such company supplied pills for prostate problems, having made a string of unsubstantiated claims about their ability to cure all sorts of ailments. Another trader used a Regent street address to sell fake Viagra pills, which were ineffective and potentially dangerous. Again, that trader was very difficult to trace.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/16">An investment scam using a Bond street address&mdash;I am citing scams that have used prestigious addresses&mdash;conned investors out of &pound;6 million. The company, which was actually based in Spain, claimed that it would buy art works on behalf of investors and promised high returns each year. The idea was that the money would be used to purchase art works that would be rented to businesses for display&mdash;of course, there were no business customers and no art works. The Department of Trade and Industry, the Minister's Department, eventually petitioned for it to be wound up.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/17">Another company charged people up to &pound;4,000 to relocate abroad and find work there. That company is one of a series fronted by the same person, who tends to operate from smart London addresses such as Pall Mall&mdash;again, they are just accommodation addresses.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/18">The scale of the problem was demonstrated by a project carried out by trading standards officers in Islington, Hackney, Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Tower Hamlets. Across the six boroughs, 27 operators out of many hundreds were approached, and 24 agreed to answer questions. Even with a relatively small sample, the number of businesses registered with those operators was nearly 6,500. Less than half of those responding asked their customers for any proof of identity, or kept details of the mail that they sent on, and only five obtained signatures for that mail.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/19">The main concern that the survey highlighted was that large numbers of businesses were registered at the addresses and few operators checked the identity of their customers. Clearly, the lack of information being kept by the operators makes tracing the perpetrators of criminal businesses very difficult; in most cases, it was impossible. That is the crux of the problem. Often by the time that investigations have rolled into action, the fraudulent trader has simply disappeared into the ether.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/20">Given the scale and range of scams that use accommodation addresses, and the number of mailing houses providing the service, what is the current legal position? I am sure that the Minister will want to cover that in his reply. It seems that there is little to protect the consumer. Statutory control of accommodation addresses used to be included in the Official Secrets Act 1920, section 5 of which required each operator of such an address to register with the police and to keep a book with the name and address of every person who requested mail to be forwarded on, the type of mail forwarded, the postmark and, if an item was delivered personally, a signature. It must be said that in practice few police forces actively enforced that legislation, and it was outdated and ineffective. Nevertheless, it was on the statute book until the Postal Services Act 2000 removed that control.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/21">While trading standards officers have powers to require information from an operator, including the production of records where there is prima facie evidence of an offence, that does not address the issues that I have tried to describe. The information obtained cannot, under the Enterprise Act 2002, be used for consumers to pursue a claim against a fraudulent business. As I have stressed throughout my contribution, there is no requirement to keep records. As a result, the information is insufficient or non-existent. There is no requirement whatsoever to carry out checks on the information recorded, so in cases of fraud, when the information is examined, it is invariably inaccurate, bogus or almost non-existent.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/22">In the absence of a registration scheme with teeth, tracing the activities of accommodation address users may be extremely difficult for the authorities&mdash;trading standards and the police&mdash;and impossible for consumers. I am sure that the Minister will say that voluntary regulation has been tried, but I hope that he will accept that it has severe limitations.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/23">Some trading standards departments have promoted the so-called MAIL&mdash;mailing, accommodation, internet and locations&mdash;fair trade scheme, which is completely free of charge for traders, who join it under the aegis of trading standards. It is designed to ensure a co-operative relationship between trading standards and its members. It has the sort of voluntary approach that the Government often encourage. Unfortunately, it does not work very effectively. For example, in the borough of Westminster, which has 200 operators and is perhaps the prime example in the country in this area, only 30 operators were prepared to join the scheme. An attempt by the Trading Standards Institute to roll it out nationally has not proved successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/24">In west Yorkshire, my own area, it is difficult to calculate the number of operators, but we know that only two have been prepared to join the voluntary scheme. It comes as no surprise that those who are prepared to join it tend to be those who provide the least source of worry and who operate a reasonable and effective system.</p>
	<p pid="a.277.3/25">As I hope I have conveyed, there is a problem for which there is no magic solution. Tackling the abuse of accommodation addresses in itself is not a panacea, but much more could be done. I have already made the Minister aware of my concerns, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.0/1">This morning, we have been treated to a perfect example of what an MP's job is. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1770" name="Paul Truswell">My hon. Friend the Member for Pudsey (Mr. Truswell)</phrase> has taken on board his constituents' concerns and seen that the problem is not an isolated one. It is not something that just one, two or a few people are affected by, but is symptomatic of something much bigger and wider, not only in his own area but potentially throughout the country. He has brought those concerns to Parliament to try to ensure that the wider problem is addressed through legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/2">My hon. Friend has properly brought the issue to my attention in an Adjournment debate. It is, of course, open to me to do what Ministers usually do in such debates: to read out prepared speeches for 15 minutes and give all sorts of reasons why it might be difficult to do the sort of things that are asked of us. It is probably much better that the Minister should say, &quot;I have listened carefully to what my hon. Friend said, and I give him an assurance that we shall now investigate the matter further. We will try to take what action we can to improve things.&quot; That will be the bulk and tenor of my remarks, because my hon. Friend has performed an admirable job in identifying the problem and bringing it to public attention. It is now a matter for Government to examine it carefully and to try to take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.0/3">I shall try to respond to some of the points that my hon. Friend raised. I was grateful to him for the measured way in which he presented them. I thought he could have been a bit more dramatic, in that he could have named some of the dreadful rogue traders and companies that perpetuate such scams.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">One of the reasons why it is difficult to give names is because some of my examples are still the subject of investigations, so clearly it would be unwise to do so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.281.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="281"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h02.htm#60426h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.281.2/1">I appreciate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/2">My hon. Friend was very measured; he realised that the issue does not have a simplistic solution. Registration in itself might not resolve all the problems. He also alluded to the Enterprise Act 2002. I will try to address that issue in my remarks, along with other ways in which we might tackle the wider problem of such scams.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/3">As my hon. Friend said I might do, I shall set out some of the background to the repeal of section 5 of the Official Secrets Act 1920, which was contained in the Postal Services Act 2000. As he said, a key aspect of the 2000 Act was to create the framework for the introduction of competition within the liberalisation of the UK postal services sector. That was significant in enabling the UK to keep pace with the overall EU movement towards a liberalised postal market. It was also considered that increased competition would bring benefits to UK postal consumers as it would bring them greater choice and keener prices, improve the quality of service, and provide for increased efficiency within Royal Mail as it responded to the pressures of such competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/4">When implementing any new legislation it is always a requirement to examine provisions in existing legislation to find whether they may conflict with the framework envisaged by the new legislation, and then to take action to repeal or amend as appropriate. During that exercise, one such item of legislation that was identified as being a possible candidate for review was section 5 of the 1920 Act. As my hon. Friend also suggested, it was considered that its requirements, if enforced, would place unnecessary burdens on postal operators in that competitive, liberalised UK marketplace. As the provision was Home Office legislation, my Department consulted the Home Office on the potential repeal of this section. The Home Office confirmed that it was a redundant provision that it no longer required for its purposes, that the police authorities had not been actively enforcing it, and that it would place unnecessary burdens on postal operators and the police force within the newly envisaged framework. The Home Office therefore suggested that it was content for the repeal to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/5">It should also be noted that the intended purpose of such a provision contained in the official secrets legislation of 1920 would not have been the regulation of accommodation address services in respect of trading standards and consumer protection issues. Official secrets legislation of that nature was mainly instigated by the requirements of British intelligence agencies, especially at that period when there existed significant national security concerns regarding acts of terrorism and acts to infiltrate and undermine the Government. The purpose of that provision in that context was likely to be to give the police authorities a means to intercept or track mail in order to root out suspected spies or individuals engaged in activities against the interests of national security. Its intended applicability to issues other than that is doubtful. That is further supported by the fact that it dates from a period when there was only one United Kingdom postal operator, and it is doubtful whether there were many businesses providing what is now considered to be an accommodation address service.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/6">Having said that, my Department is sympathetic to the concerns that have been raised about increasing transparency and accountability in respect of businesses and individuals who may be involved in criminal or fraudulent activities to the detriment of consumers, and who may operate some of their correspondence dealings via an accommodation address service, where such services may not hold or make available to the authorities adequate client details.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/7">My officials have advised me that they have not yet been presented with sufficient robust evidence to support those concerns or to suggest that the problem is so widespread that it merits a national solution. However, my hon. Friend has provided a good amount of evidence, and I ask him to come to see me, perhaps with trading standards officers from his area&mdash;and officers from other areas, if they have been in contact with them&mdash;so that we can establish together exactly what is the calibre of the evidence and make a good case to the Department. Officials should have a sound body of evidence to work on in order to address this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/8">I turn briefly to the Government's approach to consumer protection and scams in general. We remain committed to improving Britain's consumer regime&mdash;a regime that protects and empowers consumers, and that is as fair to business as it is to consumers. I am aware of my hon. Friend's keen interest in consumer protection and policy issues, and although I may cover some areas of which he is already aware, I would like to highlight some of the work that the Government already undertake regarding protection for consumers against scams and frauds.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/9">The Government set out how they would achieve their aim of improving the UK consumer regime in their consumer strategy, &quot;A Fair Deal For All&mdash;Extending Competitive Markets: Empowered Consumers, Successful Business&quot; that was published last year. The strategy recognised that enforcement needs to be more effective at stopping the rogues&mdash;those who deliberately set out to defraud consumers, often targeting the most vulnerable, as my hon. Friend has highlighted in some of the dreadful examples that he has given.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/10">The Government have provided funding to trading standards services to pilot their specialist &quot;scambuster&quot; team initiative; &pound;1.79 million is being made available over two years. Those dedicated teams will work across local authority boundaries, focusing on the hardest to tackle scams that are normally beyond the capacity of an individual local authority to deal with. The firm intention is that they will crack down on the genuine crooks. A further &pound;1.2 million has been made available over two years for trading standards services to set up an intelligence network to help underpin the effectiveness of &quot;scambuster&quot; teams and local trading standards departments. That network will play a part in ensuring that the real rogue traders find it much more difficult to hide and continue their dishonest activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/11">My hon. Friend spoke about the Enterprise Act 2002, and I want to make him aware of Government proposals to amend it to make it easier for consumers to get the kind of information that he referred to from trading standards departments so that they can pursue civil cases. Part 9 of the Act relates to the disclosure of certain types of consumer and competition information. Currently under the Act, public authorities such as trading standards departments are unable to disclose information to individual consumers or businesses for the purpose of civil proceedings. That is to protect sensitive competitive and commercial information, and, as such, it is perfectly proper. However, the Government are currently moving to amend the Act to make it easier for consumers to obtain such information from public authorities in order to pursue civil cases, while protecting sensitive competition information. For example, consumers will find it easier to obtain such information in situations where they are the victim of a scam and wish to reclaim money they have lost, wish to seek redress for personal injury arising from a dangerous of defective product, or seek to obtain information such as a trader's name so that they may serve court papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/12">Part 9 of the 2002 Act will be amended in the Company Law Reform Bill that is currently passing through the other place. That will be an enabling provision and the definition of the civil proceedings for which disclosure can be made and the types of information will be enacted through secondary legislation, which at present is planned for some time next year. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend an idea of what the Government are doing to improve the regime by which individuals can seek redress and act to prevent fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/13">The EU directive on unfair commercial practices will also help in combating scams. That directive encompasses significant new enforcement provisions that will help trading standards officers and other enforcers take more effective action against scams. Annex I contains specific provisions prohibiting scams where no prize is awarded at all, where false impression is given that those who participate are likely to get a prize, or which require the consumer to incur a cost. The directive also prohibits misleading actions or omissions, which will outlaw many scams, and, as a final catch-all, it introduces an overarching duty on businesses not to treat consumers unfairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/14">I do not want to give my hon. Friend the impression that nothing is being done in this area. It is an important area, and much is being done, both at national level through the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Company Law Reform Bill, and at European level. We are trying to address these dreadful practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/15">I congratulate my hon. Friend on this debate; it is an exemplary piece of parliamentary activity. I give him a commitment that if he brings that evidence to me and my officials, we will take it forward through my Department, and do our very best, in conjunction with other Departments with an interest in this area, to ensure that these scams are eradicated once and for all.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.1/1">This important debate about the crisis facing health provision in Wiltshire is being held against the background of the Secretary of State's visit to the conference that is being held by the Royal College of Nursing. She is trying to explain to those present why she declared on Sunday that we have never had it so good&mdash;or words to that effect&mdash;that the health service is safe in her hands and that this is the best year ever in its history. I simply say one thing to her and to the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" name="Caroline Flint">the hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, who is answering the debate. Although the Minister looked very fetching in her tracksuit bottoms in a photo opportunity yesterday, we need more than photo opportunities and spin from the Secretary of State. She and the Minister need only come down to Wiltshire to find out about the reality of the health service on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.1/2">Incidentally, in that context, I was amazed the other day to hear that the Secretary of State has visited a grand total of 11 national health service institutions in her two years in the post, so it is hardly surprising that she knows precious little about what is happening on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="a.285.2/1">Did my hon. Friend also hear that the shadow Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1476" name="Andrew Lansley">my hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr. Lansley)</phrase>, has visited 60 NHS hospitals in that time?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.285.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="285"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.285.3/1">My hon. Friend is right. My hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire is assiduous in his attention to detail and in visiting institutions, but I am afraid that the Secretary of State is not, and she will have to spend more time on such visits.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/2">The Secretary of State might like to start that process by coming down to Wiltshire, where I will show her a national health service that is not the best that it has ever been, but which is in meltdown. I use that expression with care, because I do not wish to alarm the ill, the infirm or the elderly, but health provision across the board in Wiltshire is in terminal decline, and it is important that we have this debate to bring that to the Government's attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/3">The debate has come about because of the consultation paper issued by the Kennet and North Wiltshire primary care trust on the way forward. It discusses how to bridge the trust's &pound;18 million-a-year deficit and the &pound;28 million inherited debt that the Government are also forcing it to pay off. I should say straight away that every facet of the consultation paper is unacceptable. It offers three options, but all three are wholly unacceptable, and I shall return to that in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.285.3/4">First, however, we should examine the consultation itself. If one is holding a consultation with the public, it should surely be possible for them to come back and propose a different option from those laid down in advance by the PCT. It should surely be possible for them to come back and say, &quot;We want our community hospitals to be preserved as a whole.&quot; We have seven such hospitals in Wiltshire, and it must surely be possible for the public to come back and say, &quot;We want all seven.&quot; At best, the consultation paper&mdash;I am referring to option three, for which I hope people will vote&mdash;will save two of those seven hospitals, but close five. Option one, which the Government and the PCT prefer, in effect closes all seven.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.0/1">My hon. Friend hopes that everybody will vote for option three, but would it not be better if everybody wrote in and said that all three options were unacceptable because they closed hospitals? In my constituency, for example, they will close Devizes community hospital.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.286.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="286"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.286.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is of course right, and I shall make precisely the same point. We should ignore the tatty paper that the PCT has produced, which offers three equally unacceptable options. Indeed, I shall ask the public to ignore it and to write in to say that we want none of those options. None the less, of the three, number three is the best.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.1/2">Let me return, however, to the consultation process itself. Mr. Nicholas Gilliard, the PCT's deputy head, and, more recently, Carol Clarke, its chief executive, have had a number of private conversations on the issue. They have made it plain to the editor of the local newspaper and at a meeting with groups of friends of the local hospitals that the PCT is determined that we should go for option one. Indeed, Carol Clarke said that she was the Margaret Thatcher of the national health service locally, so the lady is not for turning. She is determined that we will go for option one and that the PCT will close its community hospitals across the county.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.3/1">I will give way in one moment. Irrespective of what one thinks of the substance of the consultation paper, the fact is that full-time employees, or servants of the state, stood up one week after the consultation was issued to say that their strong preference&mdash;as Carol Clarke said, the lady is not for turning&mdash;is for the worst option, or the meltdown option, and for all our community hospitals to close. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">The hon.

	<p pid="a.286.5/1">I would of course view it as a very strong compliment, although I am not sure that it would necessarily be viewed as much of one in the halls of new Labour, in which that lady presumably seeks to work. The fact, however, is that she is determined to go for the worst option and to close the hospitals, irrespective of what the public might say in response to the consultation. That is what is so disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase> said, I shall be asking the public in North Wiltshire to write in in their thousands and tens of thousands. I intend to deliver perhaps 100,000 letters, or at least signatures on petitions, to the Government and the PCT. Those people will not be asking for any one of the PCT's wholly unacceptable options, but telling the Government, &quot;We want our community hospitals to be preserved as they are.&quot; If the consultation is genuine, and the Government are indeed determined to listen to our constituents, that option would presumably be available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/3">I will shortly have the honour of presenting a petition to the House of Commons. It will contain at least 30,000, and possibly 50,000, signatures, and I suspect that a significant number of others will write in to add their names to it. My suspicion, however, is that the so-called consultation is a sham and that no consultation is going on. The Government, or their puppet the PCT, have decided to cut, cut, cut our community hospitals and, in effect, to close all seven.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/4">Incidentally, before someone turns round and says, &quot;Don't worry. Chippenham's safe&quot;, let me say that under option one Chippenham community hospital will be left with only 20 stroke beds, and any vague resemblance to a hospital will be long gone. What is happening to Chippenham community hospital is what has happened to Malmesbury community hospital over the past two or three years&mdash;death by a thousand cuts, with the removal of one service after another. That is entirely unacceptable. Our area is predominantly rural, and 2,500 patients a year use our community hospitals. It is entirely unacceptable that those hospitals should be closed and, according to the consultation paper, replaced by what looks like souped-up GP surgeries. We want our community hospitals and we are determined to keep them.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/5">In that context, I was very much encouraged by the consultation paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, which the Government produced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, and by what the Secretary of State said in it:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/6" class="indent">&quot;we are clear that community facilities should not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures that are not related to the viability of the community facility itself.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/7">Conservative Members welcomed that statement. There was also a statement to the House of Commons, in which the Secretary of State said that the community hospitals were to be saved, which Conservative Members also very much welcomed. Even then, however, we pressed her a little and, by chance, I happen to have the <i>Hansard </i>extract here. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/8" class="indent">&quot;I am ensuring that primary care trusts that are considering the closure of community facilities, and particularly community hospitals, review those in the light of the clear strategy that we have spelled out in the White Paper to ensure that they have the facilities that will be needed as more services are moved out of acute hospitals into the community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/9">Even then, I was not entirely certain that I could believe what I was hearing. I thought, &quot;This is great news. The Secretary of State is on my side. We've won this battle. We're going to save our community hospitals.&quot; I therefore leapt to my feet to press her. I asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/10" class="indent">&quot;Will the Secretary of State give some attention to a case in point, my constituency, where community hospitals, particularly Malmesbury, as well as those that serve <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>&mdash;Bradford-on-Avon, Warminster, Westbury, Melksham and Trowbridge&mdash;are under threat? Listening to the Secretary of State's statement, I believe that she is beginning to say that we ought to think again about closing those community hospitals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/11">That was a clear question. I asked whether she meant that she wanted to save those community hospitals. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/12" class="indent">&quot;Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire . . . need to decide whether specific proposals relating to cottage or community hospitals are indeed the answer, or whether those settings represent future paths that need to be extended rather than diminished or closed.&quot;&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January 2006</phrase>; Vol. 442, c. 33&ndash;34.]</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/13">I challenge the Minister to say whether she stands by what the Secretary of State said as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, when she explicitly said that she believed that community hospitals were the way to deliver in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire&mdash;she named the area, and answered my specific questions&mdash;or does she stand by any of the three inadequate options offered in the consultation produced by the primary care trust last week? She cannot have it both ways. Either we keep the community hospitals open, which seems to be what the Secretary of State was suggesting, or we allow them to close, which appears to be what the PCT is now asking for.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/14">The crisis in the health service in Wiltshire is not limited to the closure of the community hospitals, although that is its pinnacle. The crisis spreads across almost every aspect of delivery in the area. Only last week, the Royal United hospital in Bath announced that the dreadful shortage of money meant that would have to sack 300 people and close up to 60 beds. The Great Western hospital in Swindon is inadequate for the numbers going there; there are huge waiting lists for a variety of procedures. Indeed, a constituent of mine, a retired fireman, used his redundancy money to pay for his wife's operation. It was a perfectly routine women's operation but it had to be done privately. That is a disgrace. That is not how we want our national health service to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/15">I was interested to note that, in its press notice about the bed closures, the Royal United hospital said that we should not worry and that everything would be all right because it could rely on the community facilities around Wiltshire to cope with the pressure. Little did it know that the PCT would simultaneously be going out of its way to cut and then close the very community facilities upon which the Royal United was relying.</p>

	<p pid="a.288.0/1">I share the hon. Gentleman's passion for the NHS. However, he will recall that, in the previous Parliament, the House had to vote for a penny on national insurance, which raised about &pound;8 billion for the health service. I assume that he voted against. If he had had his way, what would be the state of the health service in Wiltshire now?</p>

	<p pid="a.288.1/1">I am encouraged to hear that the Liberal Democrats are sticking by their one and only policy, namely a penny on this or a penny on that. It used to be a penny on income tax; it is now a penny on national insurance. They say, &quot;Whatever your problems, when we form a Liberal Democrat Government, we will solve them.&quot;</p>

	<p pid="a.288.2/1">In light of that intervention, will my hon. Friend reflect on the fact that, although spending on the health service has doubled over the past nine years, health provision in Wiltshire has diminished? What does he think a penny on the national health service would achieve?</p>

	<p pid="a.289.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes an extremely good point. Any housewife knows that it is not how much one spends but how one spends it.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/2">The figures for spending in Wiltshire are extremely interesting, and I am glad that my right hon. and learned Friend raised the matter. In reply to a recent written question, we were given the spending figures per head for Wiltshire compared to the rest of the nation. In 2004&ndash;05, the Government spent &pound;917 per head in Kennet and North Wiltshire. I shall choose a few areas pretty much at random from that answer. I start with Sedgefield, the Prime Minister's constituency, where spending was &pound;1,236 per head. In Derwentside, Durham and Easington, constituencies in the north of England represented by Ministers, spending was &pound;1,200 or more per head.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/3">Why should people represented by Labour Ministers have one third more spent on them than we do in Wiltshire? That is why we have such debts. That is why we have a so-called overspend. It is not overspending&mdash;it is underfunding. All we seek in Wiltshire is the delivery of a first-class health service free at the point of delivery. The Government have forced our PCTs to misspend their money in myriad ways and are preventing that from happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/4">The crisis in the national health service does not affect only hospitals. We can see all sorts of other symptoms, such as the prescription postcode lottery. For example, a lady constituent of the hon. Member for North Swindon recently lost her battle in the High Court to get Herceptin to treat her breast cancer, although I think that she is to appeal. One of my constituents, a person by the name of Gray, by coincidence, is going through the same battle.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.2/1">I am delighted to hear it, but the fact that someone should have to go the High Court to extract from the Government the drugs that she needs to save her life seems to be indicative of the problem. There is a terrible postcode lottery in a variety of prescription factors.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.2/2">National health service dentistry in my constituency is virtually non-existent. I recently won a small battle with the Department of Health over a technical detail that allowed an NHS dentist in Chippenham to preserve his livelihood&mdash;I shall not delay the House with it&mdash;but people in North Wiltshire are extremely lucky to find a proper national health service dentist, and more dentists are pulling out of the NHS as a result of the new contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.2/3">The ambulance service recently came up with more new Labour reorganisation. The Government love it. When something goes wrong, they do not put it right&mdash;they reorganise it. When I was first elected to my constituency about 10 years ago, I visited the Wiltshire health authority. I was told that it was terribly out of date, that it was a county organisation, and that we were going to have the latest thing&mdash;the primary care group. Large quantities of money were spent on creating primary care groups&mdash;IT costs, redundancies, management consultancy costs and so on. They then changed to primary care trusts, with more IT and consultancy costs and more redundancies. They then amalgamated two of the trusts&mdash;those in my constituency and in the constituency of my right hon. and learned Friend. Now they are bringing the PCTs back together into one big unit, which looks for all the world exactly like the old Wiltshire health authority. I have one question. Should we allow Bath at one end, and Swindon at the other, to become part of our PCT?</p>

	<p pid="a.290.0/1">I hope to speak a little more on that subject later. On another point of information, I remind the hon. Gentleman that we had a Conservative Government 10 years ago, so the idea that health service reorganisation is a function of what he called new Labour is wrong as a point of fact.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.290.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="290"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew16">
	<p pid="a.290.1/1">It is not a point of fact. I became a Member of Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-01">1 May 1997</phrase>. The hon. Gentleman will recall that the Conservative Government sadly lost power on that day. The reorganisation to which I refer occurred after I attended the Wiltshire health authority as the Member of Parliament under the new Labour Government. The hon. Gentleman is not quite accurate about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.1/2">All those reorganisations cost a fortune. So what happened recently when we had a problem with the ambulance service? The Government did not put it right or sort it out. They decided to move the deckchairs on the Titanic of the ambulance service and amalgamate the Wiltshire ambulance service with the Avon and Gloucestershire services. What did we find then? One of the chairmen of the constituent parts of the new ambulance service resigned because he believed that the inherited debt of the new ambulance trust would be such that it could not deliver a decent ambulance service to the people of Wiltshire. There we have it: an amalgamation, a management change and the inability to deliver a safe ambulance service.</p>

	<p pid="a.290.2/1">I heard of that resignation. It was subsequently claimed that the person who resigned applied for the post of chairman of the new service but was turned down. What does the hon. Gentleman think of that?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.290.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="290"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew18">
	<p pid="a.290.3/1">I am not at all certain about the internal politics, but the fact is that he was chairman of one of the three trusts. He may have had a personal motive for resigning, but he nevertheless produced the figures to demonstrate that the new ambulance trust would have a huge deficit. If the hon. Gentleman is claiming that the amalgamation is a good thing and that his constituents would be well served by the new ambulance trust, he will fall by his words when we discover that it is not working. That was an extremely helpful remark. The Liberal Democrats are apparently in favour of the amalgamation and they will fall on the failure of the trust in months to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.290.3/2">It is always the way: whenever there is a problem, the Government do not mend it, they reorganise it. We have seen huge amounts of management reorganisation over the years. That is where it has gone wrong. I pay tribute to the Government for spending more and more money on the health service, but the service has got worse and worse. I try not to use hyperbole and I do not exaggerate, but it seems to me that in Wiltshire the frail, the elderly and the sick are not getting the kind of health service that Beveridge foresaw for them. That sort of health service no longer exists in North Wiltshire. I believe that we are seeing the terminal decline of the health service. I do not believe that in 10 years' time we will have anything that even vaguely resembles a national health service in Wiltshire. I believe that this uncaring, despised and hated Labour Government are to blame for that failure. <i>[Interruption.] </i>It is not funny, Minister. Do not laugh about it.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.0/1">I start by congratulating my constituency neighb<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">our, the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase>, on securing this debate on a subject that is of great importance to all our constituents. He deserves our thanks for giving us the opportunity to talk about it. I am particularly glad to have caught your eye, Mr. Gale, as when I looked at the massed ranks of Conservative MPs from Wiltshire opposite&mdash;I am pleased to see one Liberal Democrat present&mdash;I thought that there would probably be a need for some balance and perspective.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/2">The hon. Member for North Wiltshire did not always succeed in his self-imposed task of avoiding hyperbole. Of course, the NHS can do better&mdash;it always can&mdash;but it is important to recall the extraordinary progress of the past eight years or so, as I shall do in relation to my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/3">I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will clarify a number of points on national issues. I hope that she will find time to pay tribute to the extraordinary work carried out by everybody who works in the health service, such as ancillary staff, nurses, doctors, and admin and clerical staff, all of whom deserve our thanks. I hope that everyone in the Chamber will join me in congratulating them on the extraordinary work that they do on behalf of all our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/4">I am also sure that the Minister will find time to talk about financing the health service. I note that for all the hon. Gentleman's elaborate critique of the current state of the national health service, he was short of constructive alternatives. I hope that some of his colleagues will come forward with practical proposals on how they would do things differently and better. I also hope that they will pay particular attention to the fact that as a party they are committed to a so-called third fiscal rule, which means that, axiomatically, they would spend less on public services than the Government. I shall be interested to hear how Conservative Members propose to improve the health service with such fiscal constraints.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/5">I want to talk a little about my experiences of the health service in my constituency. I want to make it clear that this is my personal view, and I have not been put up to it by the Whips. I stress that my experience of dealing with the Minister's Department on behalf of my constituents has not always been happy. There is a certain carelessness from time to time, not from the Minister, but from some of her colleagues. I shall long remember the reply to a letter that I wrote on behalf of a constituent who was in severe and acute back pain and wanted to know why the services of her chiropractor could not be provided on the NHS. Two months later, I got a reply from the Minister in question&mdash;not the Minister who is present&mdash;which went on for three pages extolling the extraordinary progress and investments that the Government have made and about changes to the provision of chiropody on the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/6">I have spoken in the House before about the disgracefully bureaucratic and sclerotic response of the Minister's Department to an imaginative and innovative proposal to give choice to the users of dementia services and their carers. I am disappointed that the Department did not respond more constructively to an initiative from front-line professionals in Swindon and the surrounding area, which was focused on delivering what the Prime Minister says that he wants.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/7">Having said that, we should look back at how the NHS was in 1997 and consider the progress that has been made. Only the blinkered and the partisan could talk about this subject for nearly 20 minutes without mentioning the dramatic improvements. All the talk about meltdown is ridiculous when one considers the situation nine years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/8">I remember two middle-aged couples coming to see me in my surgery in successive weeks in 1998. They were desperate because they had been told that the husbands would have to wait more than six months for angiograms. They were under great stress because they did not know whether the husbands would need severe heart operations or what the prognoses would be. They had to wait six months because the resources simply were not available. That simply does not happen any more. The average waiting time for an angiogram in the Great Western hospital is three months, and many people are seen far more quickly than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/9">In 1997&mdash;I am sure that all hon. Members will remember this&mdash;the acute hospital serving Wiltshire was the crumbling Princess Margaret hospital in Swindon. There was a &pound;30 million backlog of repairs and no indication from the Conservative Government of where the money to pay for those repairs was to come from. There was only the most idle, footling discussion about replacing the hospital. We now have the brand new Great Western hospital, which is doing a splendid job. Of course, it is not perfect and there is room for improvement, but the comparison with the old Princess Margaret hospital is dramatic. I repeat that only the blinkered and the partisan would deny that.</p>
	<p pid="a.291.0/10">The old hospital had waiting lists that stretched for months, and sometimes years. Waiting lists of in-patients grew by 40 per cent. in the last two years of the Conservative Government, and patients were being bussed to hospitals as far away as Birmingham and Southampton.</p>

	<p pid="a.292.0/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman does not want to be unfair. He says that the new hospital in Swindon is the work of the Labour Government. However, I do not think that he was a Member before 1997, because I represented a large part of his constituency then. Before that election, I recall being consulted on where the new hospital should go, by a Conservative Government who were determined to build one. Indeed, the site on which it was to be built was identified at that time. I am sure that he would like to pay tribute in that regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. and learned Gentleman, but I chose my words carefully. I said that there had been a lot of idle discussion from the Conservative Government: no practical plans were in place. I respect his longevity in the House and his great experience, and I pay tribute to his diligence as a constituency MP&mdash;I inherited many of his constituents, so I know that he was a very good constituency MP&mdash;but if he looks back at the record, he will see that no practical plans were in place. They were driven through by the Labour Government and were only possible because of their approach from the beginning to the financing of the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.2/1">The hon. Gentleman has already made his views on Baroness Thatcher clear, but she has very little relevance to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/2">The experience of my constituents in relation to the provision of hospitals under the last Conservative Government was not just that there were no plans in place to replace the Princess Margaret hospital. My hon. Friend the Minister and Opposition Members will remember that for many years Wiltshire and Swindon had a wonderful hospital in the Princess Alexandra RAF hospital in Wroughton, at which roughly one in 10 of my constituents were born. It provided a crucial resource in helping with hospital care in Swindon, and its closure added a 6 per cent. burden overnight to the services that the Princess Margaret hospital had to provide for my constituents in North Swindon.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/3">When the Princess Alexandra hospital closed, as part of a defence review, the Conservative Government gave no concern to health care needs in that area. We can talk about closures and reorganisations, but at least when this Government reorganise health services, it is with the intention of improving health care, although Opposition Members may disagree with us on whether that intention will be realised. The Conservative Government closed a hospital in Swindon for reasons that were nothing to do with health care. The closure was to get them out of a fiscal hole that they had dug by conducting a savage defence review.</p>

	<p pid="a.293.3/1">The hon. Gentleman has been very complimentary about me, and he will want to be fair about this. I strongly opposed the closure of the Princess Alexandra hospital, which was also in my constituency, as I thought it was the wrong decision. The idea was to give the facility to the hospital in Gosport, which is now also under threat. Everything that I said then is coming true.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.3/2">Will the hon. Gentleman remind me whether at that time&mdash;before 1997&mdash;his party supported PFI as a way of building new hospitals?</p>

	<p pid="a.294.0/1">I am aware that the right hon. and learned Gentleman opposed the closure of the hospital; I think that locally, everybody did. My point was about the approach taken by his Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/2">This Government support PFI, and as a result we have been able to build a lot of new hospitals. My basic point about financing the health service is that the Government are committed to provide more funding than the Conservatives would be. The onus is on the Conservatives. Rather than whinging and complaining about what the Government are doing to improve the health service, if they have a better set of proposals they should let us hear them. We should not just have the critique, but let us hear what they are going to do, how they will manage it and how they will fund it.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/3">It is not only the hospital service that is improving, and it is improving, whatever Conservative Members might say. We also have an innovative new range of GP services, and I want to talk about one example from my constituency, the Taw Hill surgery. It is an admirable surgery run by a dynamic collection of GPs who constantly look for ways to improve the service that they deliver to their patients. It is interesting what they have been able to introduce because of the funding provided by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/4">The surgery offers retinal screening for diabetics, which identifies problems and allows for early treatment of the condition, saving many people's eyesight. A carpal tunnel and hernia service has been introduced. That used to be done under general anaesthetic in hospital, but it is now done under local anaesthetic and locally. There is an antenatal 3D ultrasound facility. Laser skin treatments were previously carried out 40 miles away in hospital and are now carried out at the surgery. Those four important services are now offered locally, and that is only possible because of the investment from the Government, which enables innovative, adventurous and forward-looking GPs, like those at the Taw Hill surgery, to deliver better services for their patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/5">All that should be welcomed by Conservative Members. Instead of carping and criticising, we ought to celebrate the progress that we have made. Of course, let us look for improvement, but let us not paint a one-sided, whinging picture of what has happened in Wiltshire. Most objective observers agree that the situation is far better than it was. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will say that further improvements are needed, as that is what the Government are determined to deliver.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.294.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="294"  time="015:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.294.1/1">I start from a slightly different perspective. Perhaps I should have a text: &quot;veniuntque abeuntque pueri, sed semper maneo&quot;, or &quot;the boys come and go, but I always stay the same&quot;. I am perhaps the longest-serving Member for Wiltshire. I first attended Salisbury hospital in 1952 to have my tonsils out when it was a Nissen hut camp outside the city, on the hill. I have long-held and pretty fond memories of the health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/2">I should also declare that I am going to be extremely nice about the health service in South Wiltshire, as I shall shortly be testing it myself. I have an operation booked with the excellent national health service to look after my problem. I shall be throwing away my walking stick and leaping around Westminster shortly. Having said that, I am going to take a slightly different approach to the problems. The crisis that we face in Wiltshire is caused by the crisis management of debt and projected debt and by the unclear boundaries between health service provision and social service provision. That, as far as the south of the county is concerned, is the biggest problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/3">It is also an issue of accountability. Over the past six months or so, we have seen the closure of the Amblescroft unit for elderly, mentally ill people, the Greencroft centre as a day centre for disturbed people with a wide range of problems, as well as the community nursing plan service and the hospital alternatives team. We have seen the closure of the Shelwork factory run by Action for Blind People and the Shaw Trust centre for people who are visually impaired and disabled. We have seen a lot of such closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/4">At the heart of that has been the great distress caused to the people and families involved. A lot of lessons have been learned. When I have raised such issues, I have received nothing but courtesy from Ministers. When I raised the closure of Amblescroft and the Greencroft centre at oral questions on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>, the Secretary of State immediately said that she would look at the specific cases. She did, she got back to me and I received a charming letter from the Minister who is with us today, in which she also pursued those points. It all came back to the problems of accountability. The Secretary of State and the Minister both rightly said that a lot of money was being spent and that decision making on individual projects and expenditure must be matters for local decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/5">There is a problem. County councillors faced with picking up the bill, as the national health service will not pay for what it previously paid for, are liable to surcharge. They cannot just go on running up debt ad nauseam. They have not only the electors breathing down their back, but the district auditor. That is a problem for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/6">The primary care trust, the acute trust and the mental health trust all have executive and non-executive directors. They have to take responsibility as they are remunerated&mdash;not very generously, but they are remunerated&mdash;but they are blushing violets. It has been with the greatest difficulty that I have persuaded people to realise that a lot of people in the community are appointed by the NHS Appointments Commission to look after the interests of local people. Nobody knows who they are and when things go wrong they keep their heads down. That is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/7">I have tried to encourage the non-executive directors of our local health trusts in Salisbury and South Wiltshire to put their heads above the parapet and to explain what is going on. I challenged one of them, who I know very well, and said, &quot;You know what is going on. Surely you can come out and say that when Amblescroft closes no one will be out on the street, because you will have to pick up the pieces.&quot; The reply was &quot;Oh no, we have been told not to say anything, because that would indicate liability. We have been instructed to say nothing to anybody.&quot; That is a shame, as it inhibits accountability. It is wrong, and it should not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/8">When we consider what has been going wrong in Salisbury, we should remember that a tremendous amount has been going right in South Wiltshire. The health service is in good heart. We have moved on from the Nissen hut era, I am delighted to say. We have been through a number of different sites and have seen rationalisation and massive delay. The one thing that has characterised the health service in South Wiltshire has been change after change. It has normally been a question of administrative change and financial procedures. Often, clinical procedures and policies for the treatment of people have changed. Occasionally, as in the crisis of the past few months, we have seen the chief executive of our primary care trust&mdash;an excellent public servant&mdash;trying to persuade us that the problem is solved because they have found a new and clinically better way to treat people that, surprise surprise, will cost less in the long run.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/9">That does not help the people who write to their Members of Parliament in terms such as this:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/10" class="indent">&quot;I am aware that you have been involved in trying to resolve the issues of care funding . . . My mother was resident&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/11">at Amblescroft</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/12" class="indent">&quot;until she unfortunately died . . . She was one of the twelve people earmarked as requiring just 'social care' and as such would potentially have received no direct funding for her nursing care if she had been moved to a nursing home as was being proposed. When I point out that she was epileptic, doubly incontinent, bed ridden, had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and enlarged blood vessels in her brain making her liable to a stroke, was prone to infections and I was asked if they should put 'do not resuscitate' on her notes as she was so frail, you will be able to see that she had requirements for nursing care not social care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/13">That illustrates my problem with the boundaries between health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/14">Another note from a constituent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March</phrase> reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/15" class="indent">&quot;I am so frightened, the Greencroft centre has been my haven for a number of years, it has worked alongside my medication in keeping me as stable as possible. I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, Clinical Depression and Epilepsy. I also have eating problems and self harm as a coping mechanism to deal with extreme trauma! Since the devastating news that the Greencroft centre is closing, my illness has become worse. I get shaky and panicky, wondering how on earth I will cope after the 30th of April. I live alone and I am so scared.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/16">It is at the edges that it really feels bad when things go wrong. It is not the robust clinical directors, who can run our magnificent hospital and make the best possible use of every penny that the taxpayer provides under whatever Government, who suffer. It is the people who are not going for straightforward surgery who suffer. It is the people who have problems with their mind who suffer. Perhaps they have mental health problems. Sometimes they are not in that category. However, it is always the people at the edges who suffer. That is why we must be particularly careful. I believe that there is a future, and we must ensure that it comes to pass when we get through the current crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/17">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on raising this issue. He has put it in passionate terms as it affects his constituency. My constituency is not seeing the closure of cottage hospitals. We have none; we have no cottage hospital-type facility. I wish we did. It has been suggested that the Amblescroft unit, which has closed, would make an ideal community unit as a sort of halfway house. We should not be seeing the closure of the hospital alternative scheme and the community nursing, and that is without consultation with the GPs, incidentally.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/18">There is a tremendous future, but it is no good pretending that everything is fine or that money alone will solve the problem. The issue is all about the sort of management that we want to see. Of course, that must be extremely efficient, but not to the point of harsh delivery and harsh, sudden decisions that have huge consequences for a small number of vulnerable people in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/19">The health service in South Wiltshire is strong. It has always been good and will get better because of the people who work in it. They include consultants who are attracted by the quality of life and therefore do not wish to move on to further their careers in London teaching hospitals or even Southampton. They want to stay where they are to serve the people of South Wiltshire. That is why the number of consultants in Salisbury has doubled in the 23 years for which I have been the Member of Parliament. It is why the morale among all the people in the heath service, whether clinicians, porters, cleaners or administrators, is so high.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/20">The one thing that dashes everyone's hopes is management by crisis, which we have been seeing recently. I hope that before too long we will be through that phase and back on track towards ever better health services for the people of Wiltshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.297.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on securing the debate and on the powerful way in which he made <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">his case. The hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase>, whom I am glad to see is back in his place, asked us to praise those who work in the health service, and I do so unstintingly. The midwives, nurses and doctors do an enormously important and very hard task, and on many occasions they are asked to do much more than any of us would be prepared to do in the hours that are given to them. However, I want to say this to the hon. Gentleman, and it comes not from Conservative politicians, but from the doctors, nurses and midwives in my constituency, who are up in arms about what they see as the undermining of local health services. They are the dedicated ones who are saying to me, &quot;Please stand up in Parliament and speak for our health services, because they are in danger of being destroyed.&quot; I hope that he will respect their views.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/2">It was not Conservative politicians who booed and heckled the Secretary of State for Health the other day when she went to meet Unison. It was those who work in the health service who did that, because they are desperate. They suddenly see so much of what they believe in and of what they have worked for being undermined and destroyed. I say this to the hon. Gentleman in all seriousness. I shall not make a very party political speech. I listened carefully to the Secretary of State the other day when she said that this was the best year for the health service ever. I listened carefully when the Prime Minister said that we are, through our reforms, going to create a health service that will provide for people what they want, not what they are given. I start from that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/3">The patients in my constituency, my electors, want their two community hospitals, their two minor injuries units and their maternity service, but that is not what they are offered. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire rightly spoke about the so-called consultation document. I say &quot;so-called&quot; because I have been in politics long enough to know what something is about when it sets out options with a preferred option&mdash;it is a little bit of cosmetics to cover a decision that has already been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.297.0/4">The first option, which is set out in the document as the most favourable because it saves the most money, leaves no community hospitals in my constituency. Savernake and Devizes would close. It leaves no minor injuries units in my constituency; both of those would close as well. It gets rid of the maternity unit in Devizes. It offers &quot;consideration of&quot;&mdash;not even a promise&mdash;a primary care centre. That is the new idea of glorified GPs' surgeries. There would be only one&mdash;for 100,000 people in the Kennet area. The hon. Member for North Swindon tries to tell me that I should go around saying that my health service has improved. I would like to see him try to make that argument in those circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.0/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman will forgive me if I ask for clarification. I am not sure who he is blaming for this state of affairs. He segued elegantly from blaming the Government to blaming the PCT for a local decision. With all due respect, he cannot have it both ways. Either he believes in localism, in which case a local organisation&mdash;the PCT in this case&mdash;is taking local decisions for local people, which he may disagree with, or he thinks that the national Government should intervene, in which case he is at odds with his party's much vaunted adherence to localism. I am sure that he will say that it is both, but can he clarify which is his position?</p>

	<p pid="a.298.1/1">I am happy to do that in the course of my remarks because I am not someone who makes a criticism without trying to suggest a solution. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will want to wait and listen to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/2">Devizes hospital closes under all three of the options offered, so the people of Devizes are given three options, none of which suits them&mdash;none of which, in the Prime Minister's words, provides them with what they want. That is why I am advising them to ignore the consultation options and to write in to say that they want their community hospital retained. When I was elected in 1992, we were promised a new one. From then on, under the Conservative Government and the Labour Government, we were told that we would get one, but then suddenly, out of the blue, the hospital is to go. The people of Devizes feel betrayed not only by the local PCT, but by this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/3">I refer to what is happening as vandalism. As my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire said, the Government talk about their belief in community hospitals, but proceed to stand back while community hospitals are closed. The reason for their closure is not that they are not needed. It is the reason that stands behind the whole of the consultation document: they have run out of money. That is the truth. This is not about better health care or reforming the health service. It is about how we deal with a deficit&mdash;a deficit that should never have arisen. The Government have poured money into the national health service&mdash;they have doubled the money over nine years&mdash;but my constituency has seen less and less provision during that time. That is a real question that the Government have to answer. I shall come on to how I think they can.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/4">All I can say to the hon. Member for North Swindon is that to talk about the best year for the health service ever is, in my constituency, a cruel jibe. It is a cruel jibe to the people who look to the health service to care for them, and to the people who work in the health service. I attended a meeting the other day in Devizes about the potential closure of the hospital there. The people who were most vocal were the people who run the hospital, the people who run the maternity unit, the doctors themselves. Those people are saying, &quot;This is not what we believed the Labour Government meant when they said that they were going to save the national health service in 24 hours.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/5">The simple truth is that we have been underfunded. I shall explain how I can make that claim and I hope that the Minister listens. I went to see one of her predecessors five or six years ago about the maternity unit and the hospital in Devizes and I talked about underfunding then. We have been underfunded in three ways. First, we are required to pay for the deficit caused by a misjudgment in 1992 in the Royal United hospital in Bath relating to its IT systems. That historic debt has grown and grown and now all PCTs are being asked to bear their share of it. That is nothing to do with us or our health provision, but we are being penalised for it. That is one reason that the debt has accumulated over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/6">I told the Minister's predecessor years ago, &quot;Write that off. Give the new PCT that you have invented a chance to succeed and at least we will see whether the reform you are putting forward is going to work.&quot; Unfortunately, my plea fell on deaf ears, but I make it again because that change would have a significant effect on the way in which the reformed PCT could move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/7">The second reason&mdash;the Minister must know about this&mdash;is that we never received our full eligibility for capitation. Year after year, we have fallen short of it, and I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">my hon. Friend the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase> will make that point in his speech. We have been underfunded. No one makes any quarrel about that. We have not had the money that we deserved.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.1/8">Thirdly, we have been underfunded because proper account has never been taken of the problems of being in a rural area. Why do I say that? Last year, as the Minister knows&mdash;I am sure that she will make a big thing of this&mdash;that problem was recognised. We got a 3 per cent. increase in recognition of what is called rurality. That in itself recognised that we were underfunded in the years before, when rurality was not recognised. During those years&mdash;I have to admit that some of them were under our Government&mdash;that underfunding became cumulative, our debt got bigger and bigger, and now we are being penalised for that. Will the Minister examine that underfunding? There is no point telling my PCT in its current or reformed state that it has to meet the deficit. Unless the fundamentals are dealt with, we will be back here in four years' time facing more cuts. The system cannot work because the basis on which it is funded is not realistic.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.0/1">I rise to support the right hon. and learned Gentleman on that point. I am grateful to him for outlining the reasons for underfunding in such analytical detail. May I add to his plea on the issue of the funding of deficits by PCTs that did not accumulate those deficits? Swindon PCT is extremely well run and in balance, but it is being asked to fund deficits for PCTs that have not been so well run. I agree with my hon. Friend: this problem must be sorted out because it creates enormous ill feeling. I am happy to rise in support of that point.</p>

	<p pid="a.300.1/1">The hon. Gentleman referred to me as his hon. Friend and I take that as a genuine compliment. He and I have known each other for a long time and we try to work together on various issues. However, I say this in all seriousness. When the Prime Minister says in Parliament, as he did fairly recently, that he knows that people in his constituency believe that the health service has improved, I do not deny it. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire pointed out, funding there is one third higher per head than ours. I suspect that, if we got that level of funding, we would not be facing such problems and my constituents might also be saying that the health service has improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/2">The point is that we are not getting the funding that we should and as a result, we are facing total medical vandalism. My constituents will end up with one primary care centre. Their hospitals, minor injuries unit and maternity unit will have gone. How can anyone argue that that is not a health service in decline, on a local basis?</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/3">I make the plea again. If we are to argue that the health service is about providing service for all equally, and that it should be free at the point of delivery and free at the point of need, it is wrong to have a situation where the Prime Minister's constituency gets more than mine without any justification as to why his constituents need more medical care than mine. Someone told me the other day that it is to do with urban deprivation, but I can tell hon. Members that there is rural deprivation too. It may not be quite so obvious, but it exists and my constituents have as much right to care as others in the country do.</p>
	<p pid="a.300.1/4">We are considering what is essentially a reform based on the need to cut expenditure in our area. That is totally wrong. It is short-sighted and in time we will find that the health service has been cut to such an extent that it cannot be revived. I hope that the Government will reconsider the matter. I hate to use historical analogies, but listening to the Secretary of State say that the health service has had the best year ever, and listening to the Prime Minister say that everyone knows that it has improved, reminds me of nothing more than the wonderful music Nero played on his fiddle as Rome burned.</p>

I want to address important issues about health care in Wiltshire, but I have to say that I find it gut-wrenching to hear the Conservative party talk about the NHS in the terms we have heard this afternoon, when they opposed &pound;8 billion of the money that is currently being spent. When I intervened on the hon. Gentleman on that point, he said, &quot;The Liberal Democrats say spend some more money&quot;. But he proceeded to say, &quot;We only get &pound;900 or so per head in Wiltshire. If only we got what they got in Sedgefield, it would all be fine.&quot; He appears to be looking in two different directions at once.

	<p pid="a.301.1/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman says that it clearly does. When I asked the hon. Member for North Wiltshire why he voted against the &pound;8 billion that is currently spent, he gave no answer because he obviously does not have one.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.2/1">I have two perfectly sensible answers. Item one: it is not about how much one spends, but the way one spends it. Item two: there is one cake, and we are talking about the way in which the cake is carved up. From the figures I cited earlier on, it appears that the cake has been carved up substantially in favour of Labour-represented areas such as Sedgefield.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.3/1">There we go. We get two inconsistent points of view. The hon. Gentleman said that it is about not how much one spends, but the way one spends it. Why could the &pound;900 per head in Wiltshire not be spent more effectively?</p>

	<p pid="a.301.5/1">The hon. Gentleman says it is both. He cannot hold these two positions simultaneously. What is needed is more money, but apparently it is right to oppose a tenth of current NHS spending, which is more than was raised by the penny on national insurance that he also opposed. Imagine the cuts to Wiltshire health services without that extra tenth of spending. That is what he voted for, and that is extraordinary.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.7/1">To be fair, the hon. Member for North Wiltshire mentioned one clear waste of money, which has been the process of going from health authorities to primary care groups to primary care trusts to the reinvention of health authorities, which is pretty much the same as the number you first thought of. That process has cost a lot of money. No one could dispute that. That money would have been better spent on front-line patient care.</p>
	<p pid="a.301.7/2">Clearly, there has been waste, but I take <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">the general point of the hon. Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase>. We hear the comments made, but there are practically no suggestions. There is no suggestion of an overall increase in NHS funding in comparison with present levels as far as I can see. There is a suggestion that Wiltshire and other areas get more and the north of England gets less, but I remind Conservative Members who have spoken that the Conservative Government presided over a system&mdash;as all Governments do&mdash;where the more prosperous bits of the country get less per head on average, and the less prosperous bits get more. I do not accept the idea that a Conservative Government would do anything different because they did not when they had a chance to do so. I hope that the electorates of Wiltshire and beyond have long memories because 18 years passed by and those issues were not addressed.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.0/1">The hon. Gentleman says rich areas should get less and poor areas more. Does he realise that a survey on rural deprivation in Wiltshire was carried out by a well known local Liberal about six years ago precisely in order to show that the concept that a rural area such as Wiltshire was richer than other areas was wrong? Is the hon. Gentleman going to deny that and chuck it in the basket because it does not suit his case?</p>

	<p pid="a.302.1/1">So why did the Conservatives not address that point during 18 years in office? The people in Wiltshire are no doubt told that if they vote Conservative they will get more money for health care in Wiltshire, but I do not suppose Conservative candidates in the north-east of England, who obviously have no hope of getting elected, go around saying, &quot;We will take money off you&quot;. That is very mysterious.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/2">I have some common ground with o<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" name="Robert Key">ther hon. Members. The hon. Member for Salisbury (Robert Key)</phrase> made a measured and thoughtful contribution, which raised some serious points, in the midst of a lot of good things happening in the NHS. Like others, I have huge admiration for the work of those in the front line of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.302.1/3">The hon. Gentleman rightly said that there are real problems related to the health and social care boundary. That is a major problem and I hope that any reorganisation of PCTs will not undermine successful joint working between social services and health. It is less of an issue in Wiltshire, where the merging of PCTs at least increases the chance of coterminosity between social services authorities and health authorities, but that is not the case in my area, where the Government will undermine the existing links and break them. He made that important point, and I think one other.</p>

	<p pid="a.302.4/1">I am most grateful to the hon. Gentleman for giving way, but I think that in fact, he has plenty of time. I forgot to mention one problem that we have had recently with the primary care trust. It has withdrawn from joint ventures with the county council. Wiltshire county council is already bearing between &pound;3 million and &pound;6 million, and it looks like it will get worse. It means that either the council tax will have to go up, which it presumably cannot do because of capping, or valuable services for the most vulnerable in our society will be cut. That is the reality.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.303.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="303"  time="015:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew46">
	<p pid="a.303.0/1">I do not have any problem with that point, because in my judgment those budgets should all be pooled. The idea that we try to draw arbitrary dividing lines, with the resultant shifts in budget, is absurd. It is a long-standing problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/2">The hon. Member for Salisbury alluded to the pace of reform. He was right to do so, and his point needs expanding. The front-line staff in Wiltshire face initiative after initiative and change after change, and they get almost no notice. For example, they receive payment by results and per procedure, but they do not get told how much it will be until they are into the financial year in which they have to act.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/3">The hon. Gentleman also rightly talked about reacting to financial crises, rather than having a measured, long-term reform process. We are almost six years into a 10-year NHS plan. Had the Government set out a 10-year vision at the start and then steadily reformed in a manner that was announced in advance, so that the trust could respond to the new incentive structures and make measured, long-term plans, we might have got much further. Instead, there is a sudden change in the financial rules and a requirement to sort out decades of deficits and problems in weeks. It is gross mismanagement, and it comes from the top.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/4">That situation is interesting. The hon. Member for North Swindon referred to his local primary care trust being in balance and that being synonymous with being well managed. He complained that the trust was bailing out others in deficit, and that they, by definition, according to him, were not well managed. It is not like that. There are all sorts of reasons why some trusts are in deficit and others are not. I am sure that the quality of management varies, but there is a weak correlation between deficit and poor management.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.0/5">Almost all trust costs are determined centrally. The GP contract, consultants contract, &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; and the tariff are all set centrally. The trusts are given centrally determined costs, they are then given centrally imposed targets, and when the numbers do not add up, they are told that they do not manage efficiently or effectively.</p>

	<p pid="a.303.2/1">The logic of my argument is that more effective financial health service management by the Government would have prevented the deficits arising in the first place. Much financial imbalance and dislocation in the health service is caused by having to deal with sequential and constant reform. It has wasted huge amounts of money, and the responsibility for it lies with central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.303.2/2">What do we do about that, and how are the people of Wiltshire going to see improved health services? One thing that they will not do is benefit from fake, sham consultation.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.1/1">I had better not, because I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/2">The British public have been consulted about health as never before&mdash;and ignored as never before. As the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes said, a consultation that does not even provide the option of keeping the community hospital open, is no consultation at all. Along with other Members present, I am a patron of the Community Hospitals Acting Nationally Together group. It has highlighted effectively the Government's rhetoric that community hospitals are right, and the reality that hospitals are shutting throughout Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and elsewhere. There is a disjunction between what the Government say they believe in and what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/3">The Secretary of State says &quot;More community facilities and more hospitals&quot;, and the Labour party manifesto says &quot;More community hospitals&quot;. But in reality, up to all Wiltshire's community hospitals are closing. Will the Minister clarify the connection between the two? The Secretary of State says it, so why is she not making it happen? What is she doing to deliver that promise? The reality for the people of Wiltshire is quite the contrary, and I agree that the consultations are a sham.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/4">My final observation is about national and local decision making. The people of Wiltshire should frame the health services for Wiltshire. There must be national standards and a national context, but, as far as possible, decision making should be local. It should be local and democratically accountable, not, as the hon. Member for Salisbury said, performed by non-executive directors who have been told to keep their heads down, and whom nobody elected and nobody can get rid of. That is where I differ from the Government, who claim to devolve, but keep the power in the centre and set so much of the local framework that there is little local discretion. It is also where I differ from Conservative Members, whom I do not think want elected, democratic accountability in the national health service. Again, when given the opportunity to introduce it, they did not.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/5">If local decisions are taken about the national health service, as they should be, elected, not appointed, people should oversee them. I am not clear whether that is the Conservative party's position, and I hope that their spokesman will clarify it.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.2/1">We have had a lively debate, and it has been good to hear so many right hon. and hon. Friends, mainly, and other hon. Members contribute to the debate. Money lies at the heart of this matter, as with everything, but it is about not simply the total of money spent on the health service in Wiltshire, but how that money has been spent. It is a cause for regret that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> spent most of his time laying into the previous Conservative Administration, without offering anything positive&mdash;a Liberal Democrat vision, if you like&mdash;for health care in Wiltshire. No doubt, it will be noted by those in the county who might be foolish enough to consider supporting the Liberal Democrats.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/2">At the heart of the funding allocation for our county, as elsewhere, lies the resource allocation: the weighted capitation formula. It is an 87-page document that I do not recommend to anybody. From the formula, it is clear that for a number of reasons, Wiltshire gets a relatively raw deal, chiefly because of its cost drivers, which are not adequately reflected in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the formula. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> read out some of the comparisons in funding that Wiltshire can expect, and what applies elsewhere. It is clear that we lie far down the funding league table. Of course, money matters; it would be foolish to suggest otherwise. However, the issue is also about how that money is spent, and that is chiefly what the Conservative debate has been about this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.305.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman clarify the basis of his point? He seems to be making several different points all in one. Is he talking about what he considers to be the relative unfairness of Wiltshire's funding, the absolute sums involved, the way in which whatever money is allocated is actually spent, or all of the above? Will he remind the House of the increase in NHS funding that Wiltshire has received since 1997?</p>

	<p pid="a.305.1/1">The answer is all of the above. Of course it is, and I thought I made that clear. The hon. Gentleman will also remember that the Opposition went into the previous election pledging to match the Government's spending on the national health service&mdash;a point that the Liberal Democrats might like to bear in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/2">It is important to remember that the issue is about not simply spending money. That is a lazy way to approach the issue. If we were to approach it in that way, as the Liberal Democrats do, we would not move on at all. The question is about how we spend the money. In Wiltshire, it is not clear whether the money has been and is being spent in a way that will maximise the effect for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/3">We have talked about the primary care trust. My views that it has contributed to the sorry pass in which we find ourselves are best left outside the Chamber. It would be unfair simply to lay into the primary care trust. Ministers need to own the issue, not least because of their stated commitment in the White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot;, which appears to be completely at odds with what is happening on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/4">The Minister must know that the preferred option of the Kennet and North Wiltshire primary care trust is to close all community hospitals, with one particular exception. That is the reality. How on earth does it marry with the intentions laid down in that White Paper, which is just weeks old? It simply will not do. I shared the delight of my right hon. and hon. Friends when I read that document. It is rare for a member of the official Opposition to be delighted in such a way, but I genuinely was when I came to paragraph 6.42, which laid out clearly and categorically&mdash;no ifs, no buts, no margin for error&mdash;the Government's support for community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/5">Such support accords with the views of the vast majority of my constituents. Frankly, I do not need a sham consultation exercise to know what people in my constituency want in respect of local health care. Surely none of us does who keeps an ear to the ground in our constituencies. I am sure that that goes for all Members here this afternoon. We know what people want, they tell us all the time, and it is not just the usual suspects but also those so-called hard-to-reach groups that the Minister says she is so keen to listen to. I presume that it is for those people that she has held hugely expensive consultation exercises across the country. We listen to those groups just as much as we listen to anybody else, and they say that they want the model of health care that is, in fact, supported by that document, yet the primary care trust&mdash;the Minister's vicars on earth in Wiltshire&mdash;are doing something completely different. Ministers surely must understand that that is not acceptable, yet so far I have not seen any measures by Ministers to curtail what is happening on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/6">I hope that the Minister, who has listened carefully and attentively to what has been said this afternoon, will go to her officials and ask them, through the strategic health authority, to try to work out exactly what the PCT is doing in Wiltshire and to try o to accord it more realistically with her Government's policy in the White Paper. I sincerely ask her to do that, and, if she does, I shall be the first publicly to shower her with laurels in Wiltshire. I am sure that her party would benefit, not that it would do her much good.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that, if the Government were to tell the PCTs to do something different, they would have to deal with the areas of underfunding that I discussed?

	<p pid="a.306.1/1">I entirely agree with my right hon. and learned Friend, and I share his disquiet at the behaviour of some non-executive directors, who I believe should represent the views of local people. Too often, I find that they have been taken into the organisational big tent and will not speak up on behalf of people, and that is a worry. If they have a value at all, it is precisely in articulating the concerns of local people. They may have a view, of course, and they may feel driven by logic in a particular direction. Nevertheless, their function surely is to articulate the concerns of local people. However, often, we find that that is not happening, and that is a great pity. I take his point entirely.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/2">I suppose that I feel for the PCT and its officials, as they are trying to balance the books, and that cannot be easy. It is our function to shout and scream when we see a problem that involves money. I hope that the Minister will listen to my right hon. and learned Friend's comments, particularly in respect of the write-off, which is only fair. It took me, the MP for Westbury, quite a long time to work out exactly how the deficit had arisen and how on earth had we come to that point. I have no doubt that, without the deficit, the options document would not have been necessary. As hon. Friends have said, it is clear that it was driven not by a desire to improve health care in Wiltshire but by the need to sort out the deficit, which is largely historically driven.</p>

Gentleman did not exactly address <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">the question of the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase>, but I would be grateful if he did so. The right hon. and learned Gentleman is making a case that Wiltshire is underfunded. I would be grateful for clarification as to whether Conservative Members are arguing for even greater investment in the national health service overall, so that Wiltshire can get its due share and be able to deal with the financial issues, or whether they are arguing for a reallocation of some of the existing pot to Wiltshire, and, if so, from which part of the country they are seeking that reallocation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.307.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" speakername="Andrew Murrison" colnum="307"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew57">
	<p pid="a.307.0/1">It is clear from the fact that so many health trusts in Wiltshire are in deficit that it is not simply because of bad management. It would be a bizarre statistical quirk were there to be so many trusts in Wiltshire that were in deficit for that reason. Trusts try to benchmark their provision of services against other trusts, so I am driven to conclude that there is a problem with the resource allocation weighted capitation formula. I hope that we can look at that to ensure that the cost drivers in Wiltshire are adequately reflected. Given that it is so low in the league table of spending, I believe that it gets less than its fair share. I would say as a constituency MP but also as a shadow spokesman that the formula does not adequately reflect some of the cost drivers. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/2">I would like to turn to how we can make the best use of our resources. Shutting down community hospitals simply will not work. If the case mix is right, community hospitals are, in fact, cost effective. I have made that case repeatedly in the Minister's presence, and I rather hoped that Ministers might look into it. The data are available, and it is simply not sufficient to say that money will be saved by closing down community hospitals, as the costs are passed on somewhere else. They are passed on to acute hospital trusts, yet the cost of treating someone in a community hospital is probably one third the cost of treating them in hospitals such as the Royal United, the Salisbury District or the Great Western.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/3">Costs are also passed on to social services, and we are seeing that big time in Wiltshire. My right hon. and hon. Friends have received a letter from Councillor Jane Scott, the leader of Wiltshire county council, in which she makes the point that the PCT, which has a turnaround director in place and the district auditor breathing down its neck, is passing costs on to social services. One may say that that is well and good, that the PCT is putting its books in order, but the truth of the matter is that the cost to the public purse of treating and managing people in need is not being affected one jot. It is simply an accounting exercise in passing costs elsewhere, in many cases to bodies that are more expensive for treating a condition or set of conditions, in the case of the elderly and the long-term sick. Everybody loses: the public purse does not benefit, patients do not benefit and, my word, carers do not benefit at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/4">One of the problems with passing costs on to social services&mdash;putting people at the door of social services&mdash;is that carers bear much of the burden. That burden is uncosted. As far as the state is concerned, it is a free good. We are all guilty, all too often, of ignoring that, but a great deal of what is happening in Wiltshire at present will, unfortunately, result in carers picking up much of the tab.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/5">One or two hon. Members mentioned so-called super-surgeries. They appear quite often in the consultation document to which we have referred. It is interesting that when one gets on the phone to speak to those at the PCT who are responsible for the document and asks them precisely what they mean by super-surgeries or primary care centres, they are not too sure. At the end of the day, what it boils down to is a large general practitioner surgery. We are not clear about precisely what services will be offered on the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/6">I have been accused of being sentimental about bricks and mortar when discussing community hospitals. What is more sentimental&mdash;what represents more of a preoccupation with bricks and mortar&mdash;than someone saying that they will set up a primary care centre without saying what will be done in the building? The consultation document states that screening services will be carried out, which is very nice, but, scratching a bit further, the precise form of screening is obscure. We understand that there will be GP-run dermatology clinics, but GPs are perfectly capable of running clinics from their existing premises. We understand that optometrist-run assessments will continue locally for patients with cataracts. As it happens, Westbury community hospital, which is scheduled for closure, has an extremely well received cataract service that recently treated Christopher Booker, who talked about his experiences positively in the press recently.</p>

	<p pid="a.308.3/1">I would be delighted to visit, and I thank the hon. Gentleman for the invitation. It is amazing what living in a Labour marginal seat can do for someone, if I may put it that way. I am not aware of any such premises in my part of the world. I would have to ask him precisely how the super-surgery&mdash;I assume that that is what it is&mdash;to which he refers deals with the core of primary care, which is the care of the chronically sick and the elderly.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.3/2">Time does not permit me to wax lyrical about primary care, how it should be and what damage the Government are doing to it, but the heart of primary care is having to deal with the long-term sick and the elderly. I am afraid that it is those groups who stand to suffer greatly from the amalgamation of GPs' surgeries into so-called super-surgeries that will reduce choice and make access much worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.308.3/3">I am afraid that mental health in my constituency is heading south, both literally and metaphorically. We are losing Charterhouse, which has 26 in-patient beds for the elderly mentally infirm. My constituency is losing all four of its community hospitals. We are losing 60 beds at the Royal United hospital. The common thread in all those closures is the effect on the elderly, the mentally infirm and the most vulnerable. In what way is this the best year ever for my constituents, for Wiltshire and for the NHS?</p>

	<p pid="a.309.0/1">I would like to say that I have less than 10 minutes to speak, so I probably will not be able to take interventions, and I might have to write to people on a number of the issues raised. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on securing the debate. Clearly, the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties are represented here today by champions for their local communities, and that is right and proper.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/2">If I could make a point about the comment made by the hon. Gentleman on my activity yesterday, it is fair enough for me as Minister with responsibility for public health&mdash;that is my main role&mdash;to preface my contribution by mentioning something that has not been discussed much today. I want to talk about why it is so important that, at the heart of the discussion on what hospitals provide and what more could be provided in the community, there should be debate about whether we are prepared to challenge the traditional ways in which our health services have been provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/3">There has been an emphasis on treatment, which has improved enormously over the past 10 to 20 years in terms of drugs, technology and so forth. The area that has not been given attention is the role that we can all play in public health to prevent long-term conditions that have to do with how people live their lives. More could be done on that. That is a challenge for all of us, because&mdash;many hon. Members raised this point&mdash;that is about how we can best meet people's needs, get ahead of the curve, and ensure that there are facilities closer to where people live, particularly those in communities that, because of health inequalities, are not accessing services. How can we change their futures? By considering that, we could get better health outcomes, but we also have to challenge the thinking on where finances are directed. We have to think about how we can turn around our thoughts about the health service to prevent and to manage long-term conditions. Importantly, we should also think about shifting some funding from the acute to the primary sector in working on prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/4">Something like just 2 per cent. of NHS spend, which we know is at historically high levels, is currently defined as being on the prevention side. The challenge for all of us is to think outside the box about how those services are provided. I have no problem with what I am doing in promoting public health, because that is at the heart of changing the way that we think about health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/5">Performance across Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire has improved. The Secretary of State, backed by the Prime Minister, was trying to put in context the fact that, in a number of areas, certainly when I became a Member of Parliament in 1997, uppermost in people's minds were waiting times, the amount of time that people spent waiting in accident and emergency, cancer and heart disease, and poor service. That was eight, nine or 10 years ago. In all those areas, there has been improvement. In the constituencies of hon. Members present today, there were two patients waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment this February. That is compared with more than 11,000 people waiting more than nine months in March 1997. As of December 2005, there were 12 patients waiting 13 weeks for out-patient treatment with a consultant, compared with nearly 14,000 patients in May 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/6">In December 2005, 99.2 per cent. of people with urgent suspected cancer referrals from GPs were seen by specialists within two weeks of referral. Also in December 2005, 98.8 per cent. of patients were seen, diagnosed and treated within four hours of arrival at accident and emergency. I believe strongly that some of that is to do with extra resources. However, I also pay tribute, as other hon. Members have done, to staff, not only for their hard work, but for their willingness to look at their traditional working practices and think about how they can deal with them differently. That is about not just the acute sector and hospitals, but primary care. For example, we all know that there are significant numbers of people who go through accident and emergency whose needs could be dealt with elsewhere in the community.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.2/1">I entirely agree with the Minister's comments about health care workers, but a very senior member of the cataract team at Westbury community hospital, who has been instrumental in the way that the Minister describes, came to see me recently, and she was distraught at the way in which the service is being shut down.</p>

	<p pid="a.310.3/1">I hear what the hon. Gentleman says, but I cannot respond to that straight away, although I am happy to look into it. I will try to get on with my response to comments made by other hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.3/2">A point was made by the hon. Member for North Wiltshire about the consultation process. I understand that there was lengthy public engagement prior to the consultation. That complied with the requirement to consult the public that is set out in section 11 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001. The oversight and scrutiny committee was consulted, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.3/3">As for what is next, and the options on the table, the OSC can apply for independent review if it believes the consultation process to have been flawed, or it can apply for judicial review. That is also an option for local people. I have had a look at the document, but I am not here to sign up to any particular option. Some hon. Members have left parts of the consultation document out of their contributions. Those parts include considering having new neighbourhood teams to cover all community areas, and providing 24-hour access and new primary care centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" name="Michael Wills">My hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Mr. Wills)</phrase> made a point about the opportunity to provide services currently provided in hospitals in super-health centres that include GP practices. I have seen that for myself. I have been to practices where there is not only a GP practice and hospital-based services, but pharmacies and opticians, and they are connected to a network. Therefore, there is a lot in the document that addresses the need for community-based services and the way in which they can be fit for the future. Of course, community hospitals have a role in that. The Secretary of State did say that they had a role, but she said that they had to justify it and say how they would meet future needs and provide a range of services, and that is right.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.3/5">My hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon talked about progress in his area. I would just like to acknowledge <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1866" name="Anne Snelgrove">my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Anne Snelgrove)</phrase>, who is here this afternoon. Her local primary care trust's finances are in balance. I am not saying that the problem is always poor management; some poor managers have left, leaving others to pick up the pieces. However, there are questions to be asked about why PCTs in some areas can balance their budgets, consider how they are operating and improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.3/6">There is a distinct lack of understanding about health inequalities and the needs of communities on the part of those on the Conservative Benches. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Well, I am afraid that there is. There has been no acknowledgement that there are certain needs that have to be met in terms of health outcomes. I am sure that there are health inequalities in their areas, and I hope that, if services are organised, the needs of those communities can be met.</p>

	King Edward VII Hospital
</major-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.312.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" speakername="Andrew Tyrie" colnum="312"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h04.htm#60426h04_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.312.1/1">I am glad to have secured the debate. It is a tragedy that King Edward VII hospital in Midhurst should have been forced to close; it was a unique, independent, non-profit making charitable foundation. Most independent hospitals like it were victims of Nye Bevan's nationalisation programme in the 1940s. This hospital was one of the few that got away. Its structure should have enabled it to have become a template for how a foundation hospital operates today.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/2">It was genuinely independent and provided very high standards of care at a reasonable cost&mdash;mostly at tariff rates for NHS patients. Since nationalisation in 1948, at least a third of the hospital's patients were from the NHS, and they were always treated in exactly the same way as private patients. At the time of its closure, nearly two thirds of the hospital's patients were NHS patients. A former Labour Minister described it to me as a template for foundation hospitals, and it is very sad to see it go. The first big loser of the closure has been the NHS itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/3">Anyone who knew King Edward VII hospital knows that it was a fantastic place. There was a strong and caring team ethic, which is always present in good institutions and always missing in bad ones. I knew personally a good number of the people who worked there&mdash;the second big losers of the closure&mdash;and felt keenly for them when they lost their jobs. They were highly skilled and dedicated professionals, and some of them will not easily find alternative work in a local health care economy in which NHS services are contracting as we speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/4">The third big losers are my constituents and the thousands of people from miles around who have used, or might have used, the hospital's excellent facilities. I first secured a Westminster Hall debate on the hospital three years ago, when it was initially threatened with closure. Fourteen MPs from the region came to my support, and I am grateful to see a number of them here today. The closure is not a local, but a regional, issue. Be under no illusion: this closure of capacity will not be fully replaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/5">My constituents have lost a lot. The hospital provided very high levels of oncology treatment. It provided radiotherapy treatment with an advanced linear accelerator for 250 cancer patients a year; major cardiac surgery for 300 cases a year; interventional cardiology for a further 900 cases a year; orthopaedic surgery for 1,500 cases a year; major bariatric surgery for 150 cases a year; eye surgery for 200 cases a year; and it treated 14,000 outpatient cases a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/6">A former Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase>, once said:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/7" class="indent">&quot;What you have within the National Health Service is . . . a system that frankly is not so much short of cash now.. but a . . . system that is short of capacity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/8">A great chunk of capacity has just been closed. I wish the right hon. Gentleman was still right, because now we have a problem of both cash and capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/9">I should like to make three further points. First, I want briefly to discuss why the hospital closed, although there is not much point in lingering for too long on that, given that the milk has been spilt. Secondly, I should like to ask the Minister about the performance of Capio Healthcare UK, the health care provider that withdrew from the deal. Thirdly, I should like to place the hospital's closure in the context of what is going on in the regional health care economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/10">Why did the hospital have to close? There were many reasons, and I shall not rehearse them all, especially as many of them were set out in the January 2003 debate that I mentioned. The immediate cause of closure was the decision a few weeks ago of Capio, a large Swedish health care provider, to walk away from a deal in which it had agreed in principle to construct a new hospital on the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/11">The argument that terms could not be agreed with the developer, used publicly by Capio's management to explain their decision, has been flatly contradicted by everybody involved with the hospital&mdash;the trustees, the senior management, the provisional liquidator and the developer himself. The fact that Capio was not prepared to be frank, and relied instead on a bogus explanation, is important in one respect, of which the Minister should be aware: at the moment, the NHS is doing extensive business with Capio, and its cavalier attitude to frequently made oral and written commitments needs to be borne in mind in future dealings.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/12">That would not be so concerning were it not for widespread allegations that the level of care provided by Capio, under contract to the NHS, may not be adequate. I am not making that allegation; I am not in a position to judge it. However, I strongly advise the Minister to ask the Department to consider the issue and to reassure herself, because Capio has recently been the subject of a number of media investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/13">With that in mind, I have four questions for the Minister. First, what assurances can she give that, given the closure of King Edward VII hospital, Capio will be able fully to perform the spine chain contract with the NHS known as GC4&mdash;the Minister will know what I am talking about&mdash;to supply the so-called Southampton gap? As she will know, that contract has four years to run and King Edward VII was, until a few weeks ago, doing roughly half the work implied by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/14">Secondly, will the Minister undertake a study to provide reassurance that health outcome levels, for those treated as part of the Southampton gap spine chain contract, are at or above the levels for the NHS as a whole? Thirdly, what is the level of repeat surgery for the contracts performed by Capio and for the Southampton gap spine chain contract, and what is the most appropriate general equivalent NHS benchmark? Finally, will the Minister publish the level of repeat surgery, compared with a regional and national benchmark, for that part of the GC4 contract not supplied by King Edward VII hospital?</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/15">Those questions are detailed, and I do not expect the Minister to have the answers at her fingertips. She has a difficult job. If she gives me a clear pledge that she will consider my questions carefully, personally assure herself that there is no cause for concern and publish the detailed material for which I have asked, I will be happy. I should be grateful if she came back to me in writing. As she knows, I have already tabled a number of parliamentary questions on related issues. I also think that she should ask the Healthcare Commission to examine Capio's performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/16">I want to leave the Minister with plenty of time to respond, and a number of colleagues have mentioned that they would like to say a few words.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.1/1">Thank you, Mr. Gale. They certainly have my permission.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/2">On the effect of the closure on the regional health care economy, the plain and simple truth is that the standard of care in my constituency and the general area around it will fall and waiting times will rise. I have received a number of letters from doctors and a large number from patients telling me that exactly that is happening right now.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/3">The closure comes at a time of unprecedented stress in the regional health care economy. The NHS is closing capacity at a significant rate while demand is rising sharply. Budgets are being cut sharply to deal with the burgeoning deficit both at my local hospital of St. Richard's in Chichester and throughout the Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority, which has a deficit of &pound;140 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/4">Now is not the time to rehearse all the arguments about the absurd accounting that leads to the so-called deficit numbers, to which I just referred; nor is it the time to elaborate on the fact that cash is being drained away from my constituency as a consequence of ludicrous shortcomings in the weighting applied to the capitation formula.</p>
	<p pid="a.314.1/5">The NHS is currently subject to cuts in services in many ways in my constituency, not only as a consequence of the two points that I just mentioned. As a result of the cuts, hundreds of letters were sent from St. Richard's hospital, even before the closure of the King Edward VII hospital, telling patients that they would have to wait longer for treatment. We are talking about sick, elderly people, who are often in pain, being told to wait.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.2/1">I pay tribute to the assiduous, long-standing campaign that my hon. Friend has led in his constituency for this jewel in the crown of the local health economy, and to the enormous amount of work he has done on the local health economy. I visited the hospital, which some of my constituents use. Does he think that, at a time when we are losing capacity hand over fist, the loss to the local health economy of such an institution is a tragedy? The majority of its patients since the war have been NHS patients. The work has been done at an economic rate and the hospital is exceedingly popular with local people. The only implication of its closure must be longer waiting times and longer distances to travel to less popular hospitals for all of our constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.314.3/1">My hon. Friend is right. That is exactly what is going on right now. It is an appalling tragedy. We are not talking about just any hospital, but about one that was part of the local community and was held in enormous esteem in the medical community, way beyond the local or even the regional health care economy, as was shown in the response when it first got into difficulties. That happened when the local health care economy withdrew a number of contracts, some would say deliberately and with the intention of trying to get it to close, because it was the sort of institution that the NHS found did not fit into its plans for the trend towards super-hospitals. We seem to be driving towards them inexorably against the wishes of our constituents in so many areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that there was a tendency in the early part of the Labour party's Administration to look down on the private sector, but that more recently they have been more favourable towards provision from that sector? It is not only among the medical establishment that the hospital was well regarded, but among users and patients, including those from my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.315.1/1">That is right. The rhetoric that we have heard from the Government and a succession of Ministers is that we should want to develop exactly this type of institution: one that takes the best from the private sector and enables those skills to be translated into the public sector, with an organic and healthy relationship between the two. I made that point at the beginning of my remarks. That is why a former Minister&mdash;I did not ask permission to quote him, so I shall not name him&mdash;told me that this is exactly the sort of hospital that should serve as a template for what foundation hospital status means.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/2">I have just described the appalling cuts in capacity that have been taking place in health care in my area. My constituents will put up with a lot, but their credulity is stretched when they turn on the television and hear the Secretary of State for Health saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/3" class="indent">&quot;the NHS has just had its best year ever&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/4">Such statements do not do the NHS, patients or politicians any good.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/5">The closure of the hospital is only one symptom of a burgeoning health care crisis that is developing throughout the region, and dealing with it will not be easy. The Government have spent a huge amount of money without working out how to make it work productively. I warned that that would happen shortly after the Chancellor abandoned &quot;Miss Prudence&quot; and hitched up with Mr. Wanless, in 1999&ndash;2000. The Chancellor made a colossal mistake, announcing massive increases in health spending, having scarcely thought through how that the money could be translated into productivity gains. We are now reaping the consequences. A lot of taxpayers' money has been wasted.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/6">The resulting problems are borne most heavily by my constituents and those in constituencies like mine. We must now find a way of making the books balance after huge sums have been spent needlessly. What is required now is the cash that has been, at least partly, wasted.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/7">To his enormous credit, a previous Secretary of State&mdash;the right hon. Member for Darlington&mdash;listened carefully to the representations made by a number of us on the capacity constraints in the area three years ago. He showed more than just sympathy and understanding. I later reliably found out that he quietly took action. He did something to assuage those capacity constraints. I hope that the Minister can persuade her Secretary of State to follow in his footsteps.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/8">I want to end by itemising in outline what such action will mean. It will mean restoring common sense to NHS accounting by abandoning the absurdity of the so-called RAB&mdash;resource accounting and budgeting&mdash;which double-counts a deficit, and moving towards the accounting practice that we would find were the institution in the private sector. It will also mean that the early introduction of payment by results has been indefinitely delayed. Why has that happened? It is because Labour knows that for every winner from the introduction of full PBR&mdash;the full tariff rate&mdash;there will be a loser. Where will the loser be? It will be a hospital or trust that is currently in surplus but is relatively inefficient, and those are often in Labour areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/9">The action to which I was referring would entail a fundamental review of the capitation formula, which is a scandal if ever there was one. The formula is now hopelessly inadequate for the task of adjusting for health need across the country. It would also entail a genuine devolution of control to cost centres at the local level in a manner that rewards success and penalises failure. We currently have a system that has rewarded failure and is penalising success.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/10">St. Richard's hospital has been identified by all the relevant independent studies as one of the most efficient hospitals in the country. It also provides very high levels of care. Yet it is in the process of being forced to contract. No other organisation in the world would tell a hospital that had been identified as one of the three best in the country by the Dr. Foster hospital guide immediately to start contracting services. In any ordinary, rational organisation, a successful institution is rewarded for success by being given more work, which St. Richard's is well capable of doing and wants to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.315.1/11">There is a serious incentive failure and misalignment at the heart of the NHS&mdash;a managerial failure that runs straight to the Department. Its basis is not local effort and initiative; it is not failure at the local level. We are talking about a failure centrally, which, above all, must be addressed by the Minister and the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.0/1">I am afraid that I was not informed that other hon. Members wanted to speak. I am unsure whether that would be helpful, as this is a short debate and I have not been able to consider some of the issues arising in their areas. However, I shall try to deal with most of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1498" name="Andrew Tyrie">the points made by the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr. Tyrie)</phrase>, whom I congratulate on securing the debate. He raised concerns, particularly to do with Capio, that I hope to write to him about in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.0/2">I understand that the matter is of great concern to the hon. Gentleman and his constituents. The King Edward VII hospital was established in 1906, and it is much loved in the local community. I will check in <i>Hansard</i> what the hon. Gentleman said, but I hope I did not hear him correctly, because he seemed to suggest that Nye Bevan, the architect of our national health service, had somehow got the development of it wrong. I think his comment was that the hospital was saved from the thrust of what Nye Bevan was trying to achieve in developing the health service.</p>

	<p pid="a.317.0/1">Does the Minister think that the remaining independent hospitals in the country should be closed down?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.317.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1543" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="317"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h04.htm#60426h04_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.317.1/1">I am not suggesting that. I was just making the point that the hon. Gentleman seemed to take the opportunity to attack the basis on which the Labour party, and particularly Nye Bevan, established the national health service. There is no doubt that in establishing the NHS, Nye Bevan had to deal with a number of competing interests. He had to deal with the existence of a variety of buildings that had been established as different sorts of organisations&mdash;as private hospitals, charitable hospitals and so forth&mdash;as well as with the way in which health professionals worked at that time. I am sure my party colleagues would agree that he had to make some compromises in doing what we think was the right thing to do&mdash;establishing the national health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/2">Having said that, I should add that the national health service has long supported the King Edward VII hospital. I understand from colleagues working in health locally that some 30 per cent. of funding for that independent hospital came from the NHS. I think it is fair to say that the NHS supported the hospital in a number of ways in terms of the services it provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/3">Prior to 2002, the hospital had encountered serious financial difficulties. Following the breakdown of negotiations with a large American health care provider, Hospital Corporation of America&mdash;HCA&mdash;the hospital went into provisional liquidation in December 2002. The NHS did not turn its back on the hospital. In January 2003, it announced that it would provide a further &pound;900,000 of taxpayers' money to enable the hospital to remain fully operational while the liquidator negotiated with a prospective purchaser, Lincoln Holdings plc, and its partner, Capio Healthcare UK, on a deal to develop a new hospital facility. However, as the hon. Gentleman knows, Capio and Lincoln Holdings were unable to agree a deal to develop a new facility and, unfortunately, that led to the closure of the King Edward VII hospital, which was announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-09">9 March 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/4">The hon. Gentleman asked detailed questions about Capio, and I will look into them and write to him. All I shall say at this stage is that the Department has had no direct involvement in the deal. That was not a matter for the NHS. However, given how things were progressing, we were surprised to hear that it had fallen through. I understand that Capio has been in conversation with the hon. Gentleman, and a letter detailing why the deal has not gone ahead was sent to him by the chief executive of Capio Healthcare UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/5">However, I hope the hon. Gentleman will join me in congratulating the local NHS on the way in which it has responded to the difficulties presented by the closure of the hospital. It has demonstrated not only the resilience of the NHS, but its flexibility. In difficult circumstances for both staff and patients, it has shown that it has the ability to co-ordinate a response that ensures, as far as possible, continuity of patient care. For instance, Western Sussex primary care trust has ensured continuity of care for patients needing palliative care, and it has used the situation as an opportunity to address modernising its palliative care service by providing it in patients' homes. I understand that there is an innovative consultant locally, Peter Hargreaves, who is working with both the PCT and Macmillan Cancer Relief to look into how to develop hospice-at-home care.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/6">I also understand that the Royal West Sussex NHS Trust has been able to provide treatment to patients who were previously receiving, or expecting to receive, treatment at the Kind Edward VII hospital. The Surrey and Sussex strategic health authority has worked with the local NHS to co-ordinate arrangements to secure treatment for all patients affected by the unexpected closure of this independent sector provider. Patients transferred from the King Edward VII hospital to other NHS providers are all scheduled to be treated within national standards, and I understand that there have been no problems in identifying NHS capacity to treat patients affected by the closure.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/7">The local NHS has also been able to offer employment to a number of staff to fill critical clinical vacancies, and others have joined the nursing bank. I understand that a number of the doctors at the Kind Edward VII hospital already worked in other parts of the NHS elsewhere in the area, and that has helped. Also, 25 members of staff have joined the Royal West Sussex NHS Trust bank. As well as offering them employment opportunities and keeping their skills in the local community, that has supported the trust's strategy, which is linked to its financial situation, to reduce its spending on agency staff and use its own bank instead. We are taking action to deal with the Royal West Sussex NHS Trust deficit, and a turnaround team is working with the trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.317.1/8">Patients without appointments are being contacted to advise them where their treatment will take place. The Surrey and Sussex SHA has advised officials that it is confident that all patients will be treated within the national waiting time standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.318.1/1">I will look into that and get back to the hon. Gentleman with more detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/2">All the independent sector treatment centre patients are expected to be treated at the Capio New Hall hospital facility, and Capio has confirmed that it expects to be able to undertake the full case mix there. As I said, Surrey and Sussex SHA has advised us that the joint human resources team from Western Sussex PCT and the Royal West Sussex NHS Trust is working to help staff find vacancies. I also understand that the consultant and community specialist palliative care team has been transferred to the PCT to ensure that those specialist skills and that service is not lost to NHS patients in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/3">The hon. Gentleman raised some issues on clinical governance. I will deal with some of them now, and write to him on others. Providers are obliged through their Healthcare Commission registration to have clear, workable clinical governance frameworks in place, and they have a contractual responsibility to ensure that those frameworks reflect good clinical practice. Independent sector treatment centres are subject to rigorous contractual obligations called performance indicators, which stipulate the quality and cost of contracted procedures, and performance is monitored throughout the course of the provider's contract.</p>
	<p pid="a.318.1/4">The hon. Gentleman raised concerns, which I am sure his party colleagues who are present share, about funding in the Surrey and Sussex SHA and the Hampshire and Isle of Wight strategic health authority areas, and the funding stream for the King Edward VII hospital. It must be noted that the SHAs are responsible for delivering overall financial balance for their local health communities. However, the NHS as a whole is in receipt of record resources because of this Government's policy of funding the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="a.319.0/1">Does the Minister recognise that a disproportionate number of the deficits around the country are in West Sussex? The hospital served my constituents as well, and was much loved by them. Public confidence in the NHS locally has been seriously undermined by what is happening. Does the Minister accept that when the SHA consults on its plans to deal with those deficits, it is essential that the public are fully involved in that consultation and understand what is really being proposed for local NHS services, where the deficits are so serious?</p>

	<p pid="a.319.1/1">There is a very good question to ask about why in some parts of the country people are experiencing deficits despite record investment, and others are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.319.1/2">Finally, I have been provided with information that will be helpful. The Royal West Sussex NHS Trust will be paid the full tariff for the extra work it has offered to undertake resulting from the closure of the King Edward VII hospital. That is a good example of how the NHS, even when dealing with an independent hospital, is doing the business.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.1/1">May I express my gratitude for the opportunity to raise this important matter, and my pleasure that you are in the Chair, Mr. Gale? The last time that I appeared before you was when you chaired the Committee on the infamous Higher Education Bill, when we debated tuition fees. I am grateful for your kindness then.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/2">I start by paying tribute to my colleagues on Leeds city council. Over the years, I and others have had long discussions and arguments about how to tackle inner-city problems such as poverty, deprivation, bad housing, indifferent education, high levels of crime and vandalism, and consistently unacceptable unemployment levels. It has been argued that such problems cannot be solved, as attempts to do so have been made for decades. I was a councillor for 20 years and was involved in inner-city programmes and the like that were aimed at ending poverty. They never had that effect, but ended up simply doing things on the margin.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/3">Leeds city council has accepted the argument that those individual programmes should be superseded by a major regeneration scheme with the objective of ending the two-speed economy and two-speed standard of living in Leeds, where there is high unemployment in the inner city and prosperity in the rest of the city. In a previous Adjournment debate, I talked about many of the sad facts of life in my constituency. Suffice it to say that three of my four wards are in the Department's list of the most deprived wards in the country, so it is accepted that there is a real problem in the inner city and my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/4">I pay tribute to Councillor Keith Wakefield, who was the leader of the Labour group and who ran the council at the time. He started the process of procuring a private sector partner. I was worried when he lost control of the council and the Conservatives took over, but was later delighted and relieved to find that the local Conservative leader Andrew Carter and his colleague Councillor Les Carter, who handles neighbourhoods and housing, approached the matter with real sympathy and enthusiasm. However, the problem continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/5">Regeneration takes two major forms, the first of which&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will know this from what is happening in east London&mdash;is gentrification. It is like the Scottish land clearances in past centuries. Local people are taken off the land, various bits are assembled, and work takes place with a developer to use it more profitably, regardless of the social effect on the people. That is property regeneration. It has its place because sometimes it is done a little more sensitively than I have suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/6">The other kind of regeneration is when we accept it in its fullest sense, as the physical regeneration of an area, as well as the regeneration of people. It is about making changes and ensuring that the objective is that local people share in the prosperity thrown up by development and business.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/7">I have raised the subject because we are at an early stage in the regeneration process. Final discussions are going on with the private contractor, but I fear&mdash;for reasons that are not dogmatic, but understandable and straightforward&mdash;that the property-only type of regeneration might be winning over the property-and-people type of regeneration. The private partnership will throw up a considerable amount of money&mdash;I am not approaching the Minister with a begging bowl, as usually happens in debates on regeneration and inner cities&mdash;and it is estimated that the city council will get in the region of &pound;120 million as its share of the profits from the regeneration. That is a pessimistic assessment because that money on its own would not be sufficient to fulfil the objectives, which are accepted by most people in Leeds. In fact, it would be a great temptation, because &pound;120 million would allow the council to refurbish instead of change. It could be used on various parts of the social infrastructure&mdash;perhaps a new school, a library or community centre. We have had such temptations over the past 20 or 30 years, but refurbishing merely blunts poverty; it does not end it.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/8">The argument that I hope the Minister will take to the Department is that a real partnership could be established between the Department and the Government, the other social partners and the local authority. If all the money was pooled with the local authority's current spending and the profits, and then spent differently, there would be every chance that people's ambitions would be met and that we would see an end to poverty and deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/9">We could change people's lives. As it is, a few hundred houses in one ward were recently demolished. The tenants were given the choice of other council or social housing. If a scheme had been in place that had Government backing, the real alternative when knocking down those houses would have been to get a developer to build houses for sale and then give people the choice of continuing in a council house or going into home ownership for the first time. However, they were not given the choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/10">As the scheme rolls on, I fear that that is what will increasingly happen. We will see clearances and new houses built, but they will be priced out of the reach of local people. As a result, they will continue to live in social housing&mdash;pressure will continue to be placed on social housing&mdash;instead of having their entire lives changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/11">That might seem to be an exaggeration, but I shall explain two of the problems. The first is housing. The other day, Councillor Les Carter, who is in charge of housing, expressed the worry that even if he accepted my argument, he could not deal with the back-to-back properties that are to be found in great numbers in inner-city Leeds. Those were built not during the previous century, but in the century before, and were meant for working people who served in clothing factories and the like. Sadly, they are still being used to raise families. They have been refurbished time and again, but they should have disappeared. Trendy architects like to put great exteriors on them, but they have no gardens and are on crowded and dangerous streets. They are certainly not the place to bring up a family in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/12">How do we deal with that problem? Should we demolish them? How do we move people, and how do we give them a choice of properties? The large council estates in Leeds were built in the 1920s. They were very welcome then, because they replaced slum homes in the city centre. The estates were seen as a great improvement&mdash;and they were&mdash;but they are now 70 years old. Knowing the aspirations of today's young people, it is not where they see their future. For them, it is not progress, but we have so much of that type of housing. With so much social housing, my constituency is unbalanced in terms of housing tenure. That is very good electorally, of course, but it is not so good for the individuals concerned. When that feeds through to schools, police time and social services, we have a troubled area, with all the services competing for resources, and education is a particular concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/13">My point is the way in which we approach the problem. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is exceedingly generous with money when we want to refurbish council houses. That is an expensive job, as they have been up for more than 60 years. But if we want to use some of the money to persuade people to have an equity share in their own house&mdash;it may be half of what the Minister is planning to spend on refurbishing council houses&mdash;we are told that the money is in a box for decent homes and is not available for another use.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/14">I hope that the Minister can understand the argument. I would love to see the Department sit down with Leeds city council, pool the money and ask whether its objective is to keep all the social housing in my patch or to give people the opportunity to move out. People are sitting on equity in their council homes, even if they have not purchased them. The scheme that we have worked on to allow them to take that equity and make a private house affordable seems a wonderful way forward. However, it needs the help of the Department and for it to be flexible about how the money is spent. That seems almost impossible. However, I want discussions on that to start.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/15">The Government can build all the houses we need and want on the land that is cleared. They can say that they are available to everybody in East Leeds, but pricewise they will not be. I have dealt with one aspect of prices, but it is no use a couple going into a house unless they are working and have the income to keep it. That just leads to tears. The cycles of deprivation that have gone on for 30 or 40 years mean that there are still constantly high levels of unemployment in my constituency. The Government are needed. There is no sign of their involvement in the council's scheme, and I am not criticising the council for that. The council needs the Government as a partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/16">We need a targeted system to help people to get skills and jobs so that they can take up the opportunities, which will be available. It will be bad for morale and will make some people angry if they see people moving into the new houses when they cannot. If we are about property and people, we should want to bring the colleges, the learning and skills council, Yorkshire Forward and each of the social partners together to devise programmes that get people appropriate skills and help them to find jobs in the booming economy. If we cannot do so in Leeds, I am not sure that we can do it anywhere else, but if we do not do so in Leeds, that will bring questions to the Minister and me.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/17">There is a need for partnership and proper involvement, and there is a desperate need for co-ordination. Other Departments are involved: the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Skills. The Government need to participate as an active partner. The co-ordinating Department must have the confidence and the ability to liaise with other Departments. One Department will not solve the problem; we need many Departments to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/18">We need partnership and co-ordination, but above all we need money. I am talking not about fresh money, but about the money we already have. That money should be freely given to be pooled, by agreement, for all the social partners and the residents to go into the areas that best trigger the move towards our objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/19">Sometimes Departments come to the table and say, &quot;We are all in favour of participating and we'll put our money in, but we'll decide what it is spent on. As long as it is spent on something that relates to our budget and our Department, we're happy.&quot; A real partnership, real joined-up thinking and working to meet objectives mean putting the money on the table, seeing what the budget is and seeing which areas, if the money is spent on them, will move us towards the objectives sooner. That would be a proper partnership and a real move towards meeting the objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/20">Some political input is desperately needed. There are problems. Leeds city council has to be convinced that the Government are willing to have a partnership, to share an ambition and even to raise ambitions for the council. That requires some political involvement. It would be useful to involve the three MPs whose constituencies are in <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1570" name="Colin Burgon">the regeneration area&mdash;my hon. Friend the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" name="Hilary Benn">my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Hilary Benn)</phrase> and myself. We should be involved and consulted. Will the Minister request a meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning so that we can agree objectives and start a dialogue that gets us moving towards the objectives?</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/21">For 30 years, I have seen council money and Government money spent on inner-city poverty. Despite all the national statistics, my area remains desolate. Spending money on individual initiatives, individual schemes, community centres&mdash;this, that and the other&mdash;merely dulls poverty; it does not abolish it. If we are putting money in, I hope that the Minister and the Department have the same ambition and vision as I do. We have been putting the money in for 30 years. As Hillary Clinton says, people are mad if they continue to put money in, do the same thing and expect different results. After 30 years, we are continuing to put money in the same areas, apparently for the same objectives, and we are surprised that nothing has happened. We have to do things differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/22">I hope that, in the brief time available, I have given some ideas on how to do things differently, but I would welcome some enthusiasm from the Department for a partnership to end inner-city poverty in Leeds.</p>

	<p pid="a.323.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on initiating the debate. I shall return at the end of my contribution to his three principal points, which were about flexibility, joined-up partnership arrangements and a meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning. At that point, I shall outline what we have been trying to do, the partnerships that exist and what they are trying to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/2">The Government recognise the description given by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East: the area includes a number of communities that continue to face problems of deep-rooted deprivation and disadvantage, despite significant neighbourhood renewal investment over a number of years. I note that he paid tribute to the past Labour leader of the council and to the present Conservative Councillors Carter and Carter&mdash;that sounds like the title of a Michael Caine movie. I am sure that they appreciate his expertise and support in trying to achieve their shared objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/3">The Government are determined to help to tackle the problems of our most disadvantaged communities. In 2005, we announced a further &pound;1.3 billion package of assistance to help local authorities and their partners to narrow the performance gap between those areas and the rest of England by addressing the six neighbourhood renewal themes of crime and antisocial behaviour, education, housing, liveability, health inequalities and worklessness. Those are the exact issues that my hon. Friend said plague parts of his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/4">The funding package comprises a &pound;1.05 billion neighbourhood renewal fund, spread over two years, and a &pound;265 million safer and stronger communities fund. From the national funding package for England, Leeds city council district will receive &pound;27 million neighbourhood renewal funding in 2006&ndash;07 and nearly &pound;15 million in 2007&ndash;08; &pound;4,798,800 neighbourhood element funding between 2006 and 2010 to support the development of neighbourhood management in areas that contain some of the highest levels of deprivation; &pound;2.1 million cleaner, safer, greener communities funding to deliver physical improvements to local public spaces; and &pound;319,000 for community empowerment network funding for 2006&ndash;07 to support the strategic role of the voluntary community sector as a key partner in the local strategic partnership. A significant proportion of the funding will be applied by the local strategic partnership, Leeds Initiative, to support regeneration in the East Leeds area, and it should prove valuable in levering in other resources to the area, including European funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/5">I am aware that considerable investment is planned for the development of an East Leeds link road to provide a strategic 4.5 km dual carriageway link, incorporating a high occupancy vehicle and heavy goods vehicle lane, between the Leeds inner ring road and the M1. That new road will create direct access from the M1 to the Aire valley employment area&mdash;a 400 hectare regeneration site of potential development land to the south-east of Leeds, which is already home to 400 businesses and 15,000 jobs. The construction of the East Leeds link road will enable a further 180 hectares of land to be developed creating up to 29,000 jobs</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/6">My hon. Friend will be aware that the Government's &quot;Homes For All&quot; five-year strategy set out the potential of mixed communities to transform persistently deprived areas of the UK. Quality and well designed housing, offering a mix of housing types and tenures attractive to a wider range of households, is critical to developing the long-term sustainability of communities. I note in particular my hon. Friend's comments about some of the oldest properties not being suitable for refurbishment, and the Deputy Prime Minister is regularly criticised by some who have not examined the pathfinder policy, for example. The only way forward is to demolish certain properties, but that is not at the expense of refurbishing appropriate ones. The Department has adopted a flexible approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/7">As my hon. Friend knows, East Leeds is currently characterised by a predominance of social housing, as he described, which is mainly composed of council stock. The area is seen as unattractive to new households, despite relatively low house prices in the private sector compared with other areas of Leeds. Leeds city council established the east and south-east Leeds regeneration scheme to deliver a better housing mix. That initiative involves a ground-breaking public-private sector partnership aiming to transform East Leeds over the next 15 to 20 years, without additional public sector resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/8">The council's use of its land assets will generate more than &pound;1 billion private sector leverage, delivering around 5,000 new homes. If successful, Leeds city council will consider rolling out their mixed communities initiative to other parts of the city. EASEL will create mixed-tenure neighbourhoods that are attractive to a wider range of households and ensure that proposals for each site are tailored to their market characteristics so that the long-term prospects of the area will be realised through market-led renewal. It will also include improvements to the design, fabric and management of the neighbourhood environment;promote the use of sensitive local lettings policies, which enable social landlords to create a better mix in communities, helping to address intense concentrations of deprivation; promote effective housing and neighbourhood management approaches to tackle deprivation; and link changes with action to reduce worklessness, poor educational performance and skills, crime and poor health.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/9">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has designated three areas as demonstration projects to test and share best practice in delivering the mixed communities policy. In Leeds, phase 1 of the EASEL initiative&mdash;for the Gipton area&mdash;has been designated as one of these demonstration projects, and work on clearing sites in Gipton for new homes is almost complete. The support of the people of Leeds, specifically the tenants and residents of East Leeds, is critical to the success of EASEL, something that my hon. Friend emphasised in his excellent contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/10">Leeds Initiative, Leeds city council and the East Leeds District Partnership are delivering ongoing consultation on the future of East Leeds, for example through the East Leeds District Partnership strategy and through the area action plan for East Leeds as part of the local development framework. That consultation has to date revealed broad support for the EASEL initiative, including phase 1 in Gipton. The LDF consultation is specifically seeking the views of East Leeds residents on options for the future of the area. The East Leeds District Partnership and Leeds East Homes arm's length management organisation have strong tenant and resident involvement at board level.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/11">The area's retention of its existing communities is vital to the success of EASEL. Again, that point was central to my hon. Friend's contribution. Those communities have formed the fabric and history of the area over generations. Work to establish the future housing needs and aspirations of the community is under way. For example, consultation in Gipton identified high levels of ownership aspiration among council tenants. Housing market research for Gipton and Seacroft is also planned, as is a wider housing market assessment of the East Leeds area. That work will inform future plans and strategies, so that future housing mix policies deliver the long-term aspirations of existing communities in East Leeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/12">In terms of the more immediate needs of tenants and residents in clearance areas, Leeds East Homes ALMO has put in place a dedicated support team that is visiting tenants and residents to support them in choosing their immediate housing options. A range of options for tenants and residents is now in place to enable them to remain in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/13">A recent review of Leeds city council's allocations policy has strengthened support for council tenants in clearance areas. Under the Leeds choice-based letting scheme, they are now placed in the highest priority banding, giving them equal preference to others in greatest housing need. Direct lettings policies are in place, and ALMOs will also have the option of ring-fencing some properties for clearance households. Work with registered social landlords has also resulted in some tenants taking up opportunities to move to RSL rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/14">The ability of existing communities to remain in the area is of course dependent on affordable housing provision&mdash;rented and for sale&mdash;and appropriate packages to ensure that those wishing to purchase a home can do so. Local planning policies require that 15 per cent. of new housing in the EASEL area is affordable. That policy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/15">In EASEL terms, there is an early example of that policy in the phase 1 Gipton area. Leeds city council has agreed a local home-buy low-cost home ownership scheme in Gipton, so that residents who have had their homes cleared and cannot afford to buy one of the new homes in the area can purchase up to 50 per cent. of a new property, with the council owning the remaining percentage under shared equity. The scheme is funded from land sale receipts, and it guarantees affordable housing for future generations. That kind of policy will be built upon to deliver affordable housing as future phases of EASEL are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/16">I am pleased that Leeds city council is working closely with the ODPM and key regional partners such as Yorkshire Forward and English Partnerships to bring together housing and renewal strategies that make a lasting impact on the communities of East Leeds. My hon. Friend requested a meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning to discuss those matters and flexibility. As a result of previous discussions with him, I have spoken to my hon. Friend and she is more than happy to facilitate the meeting as requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/17">Local area agreements are very much about what my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East describes as important in a partnership: co-ordination, and real partnership between Departments, those involved regionally, the local authority, and local tenants and residents, to ensure that we have the flexibility and prioritisation that local areas need.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/18">I acknowledge the strong lead that my hon. Friend takes in promoting community regeneration. I applaud his determination to continue to improve the East Leeds area for all people who live and work there.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/19" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/20" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
