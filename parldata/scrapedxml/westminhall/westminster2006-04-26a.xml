<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.256.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" speakername="Katy Clark" colnum="256"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h01.htm#60426h01_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.256.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, and I hope to make the same point during my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/2">Many of the shipping working group's recommendations were taken up, and many of the policies that the Government adopted have been successful for the shipping industry. The group made a wide range of recommendations and, as is usual, the Government accepted some, but not others. The group's work led the Government to lay out their strategy in December 1998 in a policy document called &quot;British shipping: Charting a new course&quot;. The document outlined a range of policy initiatives to address the decline in the numbers of UK ships and seafarers. The centrepiece was the policy to which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1677" name="David Taylor">the Member for North-West Leicestershire (David Taylor)</phrase> referred&mdash;the introduction of a tonnage tax, which all parts of the industry agreed should be the way forward. The tonnage tax provides significant support to the shipping industry and is worth about &pound;40 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/3">I shall focus on three main aspects of Government policy towards the maritime industry: the tonnage tax and the industry's failure to deliver voluntarily on training and employment; the section 9 exemption in the Race Relations Act 1976, which makes it legal to employ foreign national seafarers on inferior wages and conditions; and the failure to apply the national minimum wage regulations to foreign seafarers in UK territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/4">The first issue is the tonnage tax and the industry's failure to deliver on training and employment&mdash;and of course we must put it in context. As I said, the Government are to be congratulated on responding to the fall in the number of UK seafarers by outlining the measures contained in their policy document &quot;British shipping: Charting a new course&quot;. One of the key objectives that the Government set themselves was to increase the training and employment of UK seafarers, and they said that the tonnage tax was the most important of the measures to deliver on that objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/5">The tonnage tax represents a significant concession to the shipping industry. Rather than paying the normal form of tax on their profits, companies that enter the tonnage tax regime pay a notional tax levy according to the size of the company fleet. However, applying the criteria that the Government set themselves for judging the success of the tonnage tax regime&mdash;the increased training and employment of UK seafarers&mdash;makes it clear that there has been little benefit in terms of the training and employment of ratings, although there has been limited success in relation to cadets. I believe that the policy's failure, particularly in relation to ratings, has resulted from the scheme's voluntary basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/6">The UK is an island nation and is heavily dependent on ships for its trade, but the number of our seafarers has declined dramatically in the past few years. UK seafaring ratings numbers have fallen from 30,000 in 1980 to just over 9,000 today. Since its introduction in 2000, the tonnage tax has not stopped the decline in training or employment, particularly for UK seafaring ratings. In fact, employment opportunities continue to decline, and the levels of training for new entrant UK ratings positions is falling. Although it is difficult to get figures, my understanding is that only 50 British ratings trainees came into the industry in 2004&ndash;05, and it is predicted that there will be fewer this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/7">Despite all the good intentions, the tonnage tax exemption cannot be a seen as a success for ratings. Although shipping companies must train cadets, there is no legal requirement to employ officers or ratings; indeed, there is no obligation even to train UK ratings&mdash;companies must simply consider UK ratings' training and employment options. Unfortunately, therefore, the majority of vessels that enter the UK register employ no UK seafaring ratings.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/8">The tonnage tax concession to the industry was worth more than &pound;61 million between its introduction in 2000 and the end of the financial year 2003&ndash;04. The latest figures from the Inland Revenue show that the cost to the taxpayer in each of the past two financial years was about &pound;40 million. The concession has clearly been successful in bringing more ships on to the UK register, although there is no obligation to register in the UK to qualify for the concession. However, the concession has not delivered increased employment for UK seafarers. It is therefore important that the Government follow through on their commitment to increase the employment of UK seafarers. We now have even fewer UK ratings than in 2000, when the concession was first introduced. I note that the Chamber of Shipping gave a commitment to increase the training of seafarers, both officers and ratings, by 25 per cent. year on year prior to the introduction of the tonnage tax in 1999. That would have doubled the number of ratings in training, but the number has declined from about 2,000 in 1999, when the tonnage tax was introduced, to about 50 more recently. The concern is that those figures will continue to fall.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/9">The Minister will be aware that late in 2004 the Department for Transport and the Inland Revenue published the results of their review of the tonnage tax. At the time the Government decided to delay the implementation of the link between the tonnage concession and the employment of UK seafarers. Instead, the previous Minister with responsibility for shipping referred the employment issues of the tonnage tax to a working party&mdash;the Department for Transport's shipping task force.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/10">The Transport Committee also considered the matter. It welcomed the Government's decision to include the consideration of proposals for a training commitment for ratings in the expanded terms of reference of the shipping task force working party. The Committee also said that there was a pressing need for information about what companies in the tonnage tax regime were doing to honour their commitment to ratings. Without that, the Committee stated, it would be difficult to disagree with the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers, the ratings' trade union, which contended that the present voluntary commitments amounted to nothing by way of an industry commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/11">Not surprisingly, the shipping task force working group was not able to reach an agreement about an employment link for UK seafarers, as the Chamber of Shipping refused to agree to any commitments on training or employment of UK ratings. Instead, the working party made a series of recommendations, including an increase of funding for training, a crew relief costs scheme and an extension to the seafarers' earnings deductions tax concessions.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/12">As yet, no details have been made available by the Chamber of Shipping or the Department for Transport on how shipping companies are honouring their commitment to consider the training and employment of ratings. I am aware that the Department for Transport has produced a short summary that gives some indication of the number of companies employing UK seafarers, but it gives no specific company training or employment figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/13">Before agreeing to the tonnage tax, an independent inquiry into the tax was commissioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The report, by Lord Alexander of Weedon, recommended the adoption of the tonnage tax regime. He said of the regime:</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Its extra cost to the industry of about &pound;4.5 million a year after five years is small when compared against the financial and other advantages of the tonnage tax.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/15">Given that the commitment to ratings was less than the trade union was seeking, he asked the industry to consider exploring with the Department for Transport ways to ensure the prospect of further commitments and advancement on those matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/16">The reality is that that work has never been done; given the obvious failings of the current position, which is voluntary, I sincerely hope that one outcome of today's debate will be that the issues are reconsidered and a formal link is adopted. I know that the Government are aware of the problem, and that the Minister promised a decision on training and employment being linked to the tonnage tax soon. I urge him to put compulsory measures in place to ensure that the original trade-off, about which the Government were very clear, and the original commitments, which were very much what the country and the shipping industry need, which were very clear&mdash;they are what the country and the shipping industry need&mdash;are made a reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/17">The second issue that I wish to raise is discrimination against seafarers under the Race Relations Act 1976. The Minister will be aware that historically exemptions relating to seafarers have always been found in race relations legislation. Indeed, when in Opposition, my right hon. Friend who is now the Deputy Prime Minister said that those exemptions were a national disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/18">Although the Government have amended that legislation, it is still perfectly lawful to discriminate against seafarers on the ground of their nationality. The effect is that companies are able to bring in foreign national workers at lower rates of pay and with worse conditions, so undercutting the existing work force and leading to job losses and reductions in the number of new British recruits.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/19">The Government took action by amending the 1976 Act. The sections amended related to the treatment of seafarers recruited abroad to work on UK ships, and the amendments made it lawful to discriminate on grounds of nationality rather than race, colour or ethnic origin, which had been the position until then. For the exemptions to apply, seafarers have to reside and be recruited abroad. The crux of the matter is that race relations legislation specifically allows seafarers recruited abroad to be treated differently from UK seafarers even though they may be employed and living on board UK workplaces for lengthy periods.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/20">Seafarers of many nationalities work in the United Kingdom and on UK-flagged ships. In some situations, UK seafarers work beside foreign nationals&mdash;on the same ships and in the same departments&mdash;but because of UK employment law, the British workers earn more and have better terms and conditions than their foreign counterparts. The Minister will be aware that representations have been made to the Government over a considerable time. Despite that, however, the discrimination continues and the employment of existing UK seafarers remains increasingly precarious.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/21">In 2004, the European Commission stated that European Union seafarers should be paid according to the home rate of the flag of the ship that they sail on regardless of their place of residence. That means that Spanish, Polish or any other EU nationals should not be discriminated against compared to resident UK seafarers employed on UK-flagged ships. However, I understand that EU nationals are still being paid a lower rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/22">Shortly after the European Commission made its position clear, the Department for Transport said that, on receipt of legal advice, it would conduct a review of sections 8 and 9 of the Race Relations Act 1976. However, no more proposals have been made. The Minister may be aware that RMT, the union that represents maritime workers, has submitted complaints to the European Commission arguing that section 9 of the 1976 Act is in breach of the European treaty provision on non-discrimination and the free movement of goods. Complaints have also been lodged with a range of other organisations, including the International Labour Organisation and the international committee on economic, social and cultural rights, and complaints have been launched with regard to the European social charter.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/23">I understand that the trade union is also considering taking formal action in the High Court to stop discrimination against foreign national seafarers, whether or not they are from the European Union. I urge the Minister to consider the matter again and to bring forward legislation to outlaw discrimination against UK seafarers once and for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/24">At the moment, shipowners continue to enjoy an exemption from the provisions of the 1976 Act. That allows them to pay exploitative rates of pay to foreign national seafarers recruited abroad. In many situations, the national minimum wage does not apply to UK seafarers on board UK ships while they are in UK waters, as the legislation applies only when ships are in port or in UK internal waters. That lack of regulation and social protection for seafarers has meant their continual replacement by low-cost foreign national seafarers.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/25">Perhaps the most high-profile recent example of problems of this nature was the Irish Ferries dispute last year, which was not, of course, a British dispute. It led to high-profile industrial action and got media attention, but such issues often do not end up in the national press. On that occasion, Irish Ferries offered its work force the option of voluntary redundancies or a cut in pay and conditions of up to 50 per cent., and there was an industrial dispute, which, hon. Members may recall, was settled only after the work force had a sit-in on the ferries. In most situations that have affected British workers, things have been far quieter. When British workers are forced to compete with low-paid foreign nationals, they often realise that the writing is on the wall and accept job losses and redundancies because of the legal position in which they are put.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/26">It is not acceptable for existing work forces to be continually replaced with cheap labour brought in from outside because British employment law does not ensure that there is a level playing field. I have a constituency interest in this matter because my constituency includes island communities, to which a number of ferries operate. Ferries are very much affected by the legislation. In recent years, there has been a creeping situation in which foreign workers are brought in on lower rates of pay and worse conditions. As a result, the existing British work force has been losing out, and new British workers are not being recruited. New foreign recruits tend to be employed on lower terms and conditions because they do not have that employment law protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/27">In my constituency, the situation is particularly relevant because Caledonian MacBrayne, which operates many of the services to the island communities and thus provides a lifeline, and which is effectively a publicly-owned company, is being put into a tendering position. While that process is clearly very much a devolved matter within the remit of the Scottish Executive, I am very aware, as a Scottish Member of Parliament, that the Executive can operate only within the legal restrictions put in place by this place. Current employment law puts many of the workers who provide these services at risk. The tendering process may lead to Caledonian MacBrayne continuing to provide the service, and the process itself might not lead to the displacement of the existing work force and the employment of low-cost foreign national seafarers, but the law does not prevent the use of cheap labour to undercut the terms and conditions of the work force.</p>
	<p pid="a.256.0/28">That significant development in Scotland is yet another reason why we need to reconsider this area of law and ensure that we introduce employment law to protect the rights of existing work forces on ferries and future recruits.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.260.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" speakername="Katy Clark" colnum="260"  time="009:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h01.htm#60426h01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.260.1/1">I shall not comment specifically on the issue of national insurance contributions. I am aware of that development, and I think it unfortunate that the legal framework within which Caledonian MacBrayne is forced to operate is leading to it having to use devices of that nature simply to try to secure its continued existence. That company has provided lifeline services to island communities for generations. Those of us who live in areas that are served by such ferries, or who have been there on holiday, are aware of the affection in which that company is held in Scotland and its island communities. If something is not broken, we should not try to fix it, so it is unfortunate that those services are at risk because of the nature of European Union regulations and employment legislation. Therefore, I agree with the sentiments of the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/2">The third issue that I shall raise today is the national minimum wage and how it applies to seafarers. In addition to the exemption under the Race Relations Act, shipowners have managed to gain a favourable interpretation of national minimum wage legislation&mdash;a flagship Labour policy that was implemented by this Labour Government. The Department of Trade and Industry has interpreted the legislation in such a way that foreign national seafarers' entitlement to the national minimum wage applies only on UK registered ships when they are in port or in internal UK waters, as opposed to UK territorial waters. If that interpretation is correct, there is an urgent need to amend the legislation so that coverage is properly extended to all who work within UK territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/3">There are also concerns about the inadequate provisions for enforcing the legislation on board British ships. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency is the only body that can logically carry out that commitment. Unfortunately, it is not required to do so, and the task is carried out by the DTI, which does not necessarily have the requisite specialist knowledge to deal with the complexities of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/4">The UK has jurisdiction over UK territorial waters which extend for 12 miles. I am aware that the Minister has said that the legislation is not as he would like it to be. I would be grateful if he would use this opportunity to issue a guidance note or introduce a statutory order to ensure that the UK minimum wage applies to UK ships in UK territorial waters, because under the current legislative framework British workers are being put in a vulnerable position.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/5">These loopholes in the law need to be filled. The Government are very much one who promote equality for all; action has to be taken to ensure that all workers employed in the UK have the full protection of the Race Relations Act and national minimum wage legislation. The minimum wage legislation is one of the most important policies introduced by Labour since it came to power, as millions of people have benefited from it. In Opposition, we heard time and again what damage it would cause the British industry, but many of those comments were scaremongering. Similarly, many of the arguments now being advanced as to why we cannot apply the national minimum wage to seafarers and foreign national seafarers do not hold water and will not stand the test of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/6">Our manifesto last year made it clear that tax credits and minimum wage legislation were a way of ensuring that work paid for everybody. We also made it clear that we would implement Low Pay Commission recommendations for everybody. We have a proud record on such issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/7">I think that this is a time to recognise that we have done a huge amount of good work for the maritime industry. Many of the Government's policies on shipping have been a great success. However, we have perhaps not been successful in ensuring that British people continue to work the ships that operate out of our country. Today, I would ask the Minister to assure us that he will continue to review the Race Relations Act and will work with all parties involved in the process to ensure that the appalling discrimination against foreign national seafarers is stopped once and for all.</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/8">We rightly sing the praises of the national minimum wage, which will be a lasting tribute to the Government. However, I do not believe that minimum wage legislation was ever intended to exclude some of the most vulnerable in our society: migrant seafarers. Will the Minister reconsider that issue?</p>
	<p pid="a.260.1/9">Finally, Labour has a good record of using tax incentives to work with business and boost employment. I have already spoken about the huge strides that Labour has made in that area since we came to power. In my constituency, we have seen an increase of more than 25 per cent. in levels of employment. That story is repeated throughout the country. However, when the policy was put in place, the trade-off was that concessions would be provided to the shipping industry in exchange for the employment and training. We are often told by business that it is not possible to get something for nothing, yet the tonnage tax regime seems to be a situation where, when it comes to jobs, there has been no return for UK seafaring ratings. I ask the Minister to reconsider those issues.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.266.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="266"  time="010:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h01.htm#60426h01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.266.0/1">The normal crew assembles for debates on this subject over the years. However, I must apologise because one of our crew is missing: my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1550" name="Gwyn Prosser">the Member for Dover (Gwyn Prosser)</phrase> is on parliamentary business abroad. I declare an interest as the chair of the RMT parliamentary group and I refer to my entry in the Register of Members' Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing the debate and on her superb and definitive description of the industry as it stands and the issues facing us. I shall be brief because other hon. Members want to speak. I shall focus on the Race Relations Act 1976 and the minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/3">There is an element of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu because we were in Westminster Hall three years ago having the same debate and things do not seem to have moved on. In 2003, the Home Office made it clear that it did not believe that the shipping industry should be excluded from race relations legislation. It then started the consultation about how to bring the shipping industry within that legislation. We went through that debate and the Government decided that they would introduce amendments to the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/4">I was cheered and enthused that at long last the Government were addressing this sector of British life, which had been excluded from the basic laws of civilised society as we know it. Then, the Government created the bizarre situation in which discrimination on the basis of ethnicity was outlawed, but discrimination could continue on the ground of nationality. Employers could pay one worker less than another simply because of the country from which they came. That is outrageous in any civilised society.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/5">We went on with the debate, however, and I think that it was in this Room that the statutory instrument was considered. I attended the Committee considering it. I was not a member of the Committee, but I exercised my right to speak. One thing that convinced hon. Members to support the amendment allowing discrimination on the ground of nationality to continue was the Minister's statement, both in that Committee and in the Adjournment debate, that hon. Members need have no fear because the minimum wage would apply to anyone serving on a British ship in UK waters. I did not go away happy, but I thought that at least we had secured some commitment from the Government. Within months, we discovered that &quot;territorial waters&quot; was not the definition, but &quot;internal waters&quot;. I sail on the Norfolk broads; I have an old, battered wooden boat and I am not a very good sailor. When I sail, people get off the water if they see me coming. If I employed someone on that boat in Norfolk waters, they would get the minimum wage. If I sailed outside Great Yarmouth harbour, I doubt that they would because we would have gone outside internal waters. No one knew what internal waters meant. I had never heard the definition before, and we had to scurry for lawyers to get that definition and to find out where the idea had come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/6">People are still being discriminated against in the industry because they are not achieving the minimum wage, and it is happening on ferry service after ferry service: Larne to Troon and Cairnryan, Mostyn to Dublin, Rosslare to Cherbourg, Fleetwood to Dublin and Belfast and Liverpool to Dublin. British seafarers are being replaced by Spanish, Filipinos and others who are paid less and work in poorer conditions. That is exploitation by any standard. No one is arguing for those people to lose their jobs, but if they have jobs they should be paid the same rate as anyone else. Why should one person be paid less than and work in different conditions from others when they are doing the same job within our own territorial waters? That is a scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/7">The situation is the same on the Hull to Zeebrugge route run by P&amp;O North Sea Ferries, which uses British, Portuguese and Filipino workers, with the Filipinos being exploited the most. Companies are allowed to pay disgraceful wages. Ramsay Shipping, which trades between the UK and Ireland and the UK and Scandinavia, is paying Filipino seafarers &pound;456 a month. Union Transport&mdash;there is an ironic name if ever there was one&mdash;is paying east European seafarers &pound;856 a month. It trades between the Isle of Man and Britain, and the Isle of Man and Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/8">We have raised this matter time and time again. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers issued a press release 18 months ago regarding a company called Lapthorn, which is paying people below the minimum wage. Our information at the moment is that that continues to be the practice. Workers are being exploited within sight of the British coast as a result of our failure to plug the gap in race relations legislation. I believe that this is a disgrace, for a Labour Government in particular, and for a civilised society.</p>
	<p pid="a.266.0/9">As my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran said, the European Union has introduced directives that ensure that the Government must comply so that EU workers, at least, receive the same treatment as UK seafarers. My hon. Friend the Minister gave us a commitment in February 2005 that amendments to the legislation would be brought forward, but by the end of 2005 we had not seen any. I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to ensure that we get Government action speedily. Three years on from the previous Adjournment debate on the issue and two years on from the statutory instrument Committee we are still in a situation where workers are being exploited, and where employers are exploiting a loophole in the law. It is a moral responsibility on this Government to act, and act now.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.0/1">I, too, add my congratulations to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing this important debate. I welcome the opportunity to talk about recent disputes with Irish Ferries at the end of 2005, which my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/2">The dispute is now over, but it raises important questions regarding UK shipping and the future of UK and Irish ferries. The Irish Ferries dispute was one of the most serious industrial disputes in Ireland's history and it was sparked by the proposed replacement of 543 Irish seafarers by eastern European seafarers on rates of pay well below those of the minimum wage.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/3">Irish Ferries run ships between Britain and Ireland and the company sought to dismiss its existing Irish sailors and replace them with workers from Latvia and Estonia on lower rates of pay and longer hours. Irish Ferries adopted crude tactics by smuggling private security guards on board the ships to make sure that the handover to the new cheaper crew went smoothly. That further inflamed the dispute with a stand-off developing on the Isle of Irishmore ship in Pembroke and the Ulysses in Holyhead.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/4">On both those ships seafarers occupied the vessels in protest and refused to leave the berth with a new crew unfamiliar with the operation of the ship. The port authorities also refused to grant the International Transport Workers Federation inspectors access to the ships' crews to check on their welfare, which was in breach of International Labour Organisation convention 147. In December last year, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions co-ordinated a day of action with workers across Ireland stopping work in support of the existing Irish Ferries seafarers. The dispute resulted in the cancellation of Ireland's social partnership negotiations, although regrettably the European shipowners organisation could not bring itself to condemn the actions of Irish Ferries despite concerns being raised in the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/5">In the 21st century the people of Ireland could not comprehend how it was possible for shipowners forcibly to dismiss Irish seafarers and replace them with seafarers from eastern Europe on rates of pay equivalent to half the Irish minimum wage, when at the time the minimum wage was only &pound;5.20 per hour. Unfortunately, in the shipping industry it seems that a different set of rules apply. The Irish Government condemned the actions of Irish Ferries, but stated that the transfer of the flag from Ireland to Cyprus meant that they were powerless to act. The Cyprus flag is one of the countries that have been deemed by the International Transport Workers Federation to be a flag of convenience. Flags of convenience are often utilised by shipping companies as safety and working conditions are not enforced effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/6">In the end, the settlement brokered through the Irish courts resulted in the replacement of significant numbers of Irish seafarers with cheaper labour from Eastern Europe. Thanks to the heroic actions of a group of seafarers the rates of pay were not below the minimum wage but the company has none the less succeeded in lowering standards in the Irish sea sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/7">Standards around the UK coast have declined in the past few years, but there are still shipping companies who employ UK seafarers, both as ratings and officers. For example one of Irish Ferries principal competitors, the Swedish company Stena Line, operates ferry services around the UK, including in the Irish sea, and employs seafaring officers and crew on UK rates of pay. In addition, UK seafarers are employed by P&amp;O Irish Sea Ferries although the company also employs other nationalities. Norse Irish also employs UK and other foreign national sailors.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/8">Irish Ferries threatened to start a race to the very bottom and its actions endangered the future of British and Irish seafarers in the ferry sector. The ferry sector is now one of the few remaining areas of employment for UK seafaring ratings. During the dispute, the RMT wrote to the Minister responsible for shipping, asking him to convene early discussions with Irish Government counterparts to implement measures to tackle awful practices in the shipping industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/9">Acceptable social standards have to be enforced on all ships trading between UK and Irish ports, irrespective of the flag of the vessel. The UK Government have previously gone on record as supporting the EU directive. This directive sought to ensure that the pay and conditions of seafarers on regular passenger and ferry services trading between the UK and other parts of the European Union were in line with seafarers of the member state with the closest connection to the ferry or passenger service. It was not possible to get the support of all member states to pass this legislation, but given the increasing frequency of the displacement of UK and Irish seafarers, similar legislation will undoubtedly be debated again. I hope, therefore, that my hon. Friend the Minister can advise me that the Government still support the principles and measures as outlined in this directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/10">We must take action to safeguard the standards of the UK flag and we must also work with other EU member states to ensure that acceptable social standards are enforced on all ships trading around the UK. I hope that the Minister will agree to engage constructively with members of the RMT parliamentary group, so that we can work towards an acceptable solution.</p>

	<p pid="a.274.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1963" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Ms Clark)</phrase> on securing this debate and on joining the small, select band of MPs who take maritime issues seriously. I wish that that band was much larger, and that we had these debates more often. Since I have been in my post, I can recollect offhand only one occasion on which I was asked a question on maritime matters at first order questions. That really is not good enough; the House should take more interest in such an important industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/2">Several hon. Members have described the importance of the industry, which has earnings of more than &pound;10 billion a year, and export earnings of &pound;7 billion a year. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1479" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr. Brazier)</phrase> said, it has overtaken aviation to become the third largest export earner for our country's economy. It is a very important industry, and it has strategic importance, too: 95 per cent. of goods that come into and out of the country are still carried by sea. It is a vital industry. Nor is it restricted to the sea; the industry extends into land&mdash;into the financial and insurance sectors, and into the ports. Ports can be a tool for regeneration for our communities and are themselves a key part of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/3">A small part of the east Kent mafia is here today. Its members include the hon. Member for Canterbury and I, as well as you, Mr. Gale. We know that the biggest employer in Kent is not Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, as everybody usually says, but the port of Dover, if one takes on board both direct and indirect employment. In addition, there are ports at Sheppey; there are the Medway ports; and there are smaller ports at Ramsgate, Broadstairs, and Margate, which is in your constituency, Mr. Gale. There is also the leisure boating industry and the under-12m fishing fleet around Kent. In fact, in counties such as Kent, maritime issues are the most important part of the economy. Essentially, the questions that my hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran put to me were how we maintain that, and build on it to encourage further employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/4">My hon. Friend has painted a slightly pessimistic picture of employment in the industry. It is not as I would like it to be, and there are not enough UK seafarers working yet, but the situation is improving. There were 896 UK officers employed on tonnage tax boats when the tonnage tax started in 2000&ndash;01, and there are now 2,888. The number of ratings has increased from 449 to 1,460. One could argue that that is because far more boats have come under the tonnage tax over that period. However, although between 1997 and 2001 the number of UK active seafarers fell from 30,000 to 25,000, that fall has been reversed; by 2004 there were 29,000 UK active seafarers, and 26,500 of those are at sea, so the situation is not quite as bleak as my hon. Friend describes it.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/5">As was put fairly by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/2006" name="Alistair Carmichael">the hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr. Carmichael)</phrase>, the dilemma that I face is that of striking a balance. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1607" name="Linda Riordan">The hon. Member for Halifax (Mrs. Riordan)</phrase> described what is, in a sense, an Irish problem. She talked about the situation as regards Irish Ferries and about what happened when Irish Ferries flagged out. Under those circumstances, a new crew could be brought on board who would work for much less than Irish citizens would. The National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers wrote to me, asking me to intervene, and the Irish Shipping Minister had many conversations with me during that crisis; he was a frequent telephone caller to my office, asking for advice and support. That crisis highlighted what happens when regulations that shipowners do not like are put in place. Shipping is an international business and, at the stroke of a pen, people can move their ships under another flag and take on a new set of lesser restrictions, so there is a balancing act to perform.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/6">I have heard and understand the arguments advanced by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Officers and the National Union of Marine, Aviation and Shipping Transport Officers. We have not yet made our decisions on the output of the shipping taskforce; those announcements will have to wait until after purdah, but it will not be long before we announce what we will go for. I ask colleagues on both sides of the Chamber for a little sympathy for the fact that I have a narrow line to walk between wanting to do something that will stimulate employment and bring UK seafarers on to boats, and wanting to bring ships under the red ensign. Let us not forget that people do not have to be under the red ensign to benefit from tonnage tax; likewise, people under the red ensign do not have to be within the tonnage tax regime. I want ships to be under the red ensign, and I want UK seafarers on them. I have to try to find a way to maximise that potential, but without driving shipowners to take their ships away from the red ensign and the tonnage tax, and to put them instead under other flags, and flags of convenience.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/7">I remind the House that there are many flags of convenience, and that there are also numerous variants on the tonnage tax now. We may have invented it, but other countries came along afterwards and thought, &quot;That was a jolly good wheeze that the Brits came up with; we'll do the same thing.&quot; Shipowners have choices, and we have to find a way of navigating through those choices.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/8">At the end of the day, one thing that will help us to bring UK seafarers back to the sea is the training regime that we offer. That point was made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1761" name="Linda Gilroy">the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Linda Gilroy)</phrase>. Our seafarers will never be as cheap as other countries' seafarers, so they have to be better&mdash;better trained, better qualified, and providing better value for money. We have to find a way of doing that. Could the training regime that we put in place and the money that we provide for training be tools that we use to encourage shipowners to stay under the red ensign, to stay with tonnage tax, and to use UK seafarers, to offset any extra costs of employing UK seafarers that they might incur? Hon. Members will have to wait until our announcements to find out, but that certainly is one thing that we will have to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.274.0/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1624" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>, who made a powerful case about the Race Relations Act 1976, will also have to wait. I do not recollect making a commitment to sort the matter out by the end of 2005; I made a commitment to him to bring the Act within EU law.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.281.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1446" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="281"  time="011:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h02.htm#60426h02_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.281.2/1">I appreciate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/2">My hon. Friend was very measured; he realised that the issue does not have a simplistic solution. Registration in itself might not resolve all the problems. He also alluded to the Enterprise Act 2002. I will try to address that issue in my remarks, along with other ways in which we might tackle the wider problem of such scams.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/3">As my hon. Friend said I might do, I shall set out some of the background to the repeal of section 5 of the Official Secrets Act 1920, which was contained in the Postal Services Act 2000. As he said, a key aspect of the 2000 Act was to create the framework for the introduction of competition within the liberalisation of the UK postal services sector. That was significant in enabling the UK to keep pace with the overall EU movement towards a liberalised postal market. It was also considered that increased competition would bring benefits to UK postal consumers as it would bring them greater choice and keener prices, improve the quality of service, and provide for increased efficiency within Royal Mail as it responded to the pressures of such competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/4">When implementing any new legislation it is always a requirement to examine provisions in existing legislation to find whether they may conflict with the framework envisaged by the new legislation, and then to take action to repeal or amend as appropriate. During that exercise, one such item of legislation that was identified as being a possible candidate for review was section 5 of the 1920 Act. As my hon. Friend also suggested, it was considered that its requirements, if enforced, would place unnecessary burdens on postal operators in that competitive, liberalised UK marketplace. As the provision was Home Office legislation, my Department consulted the Home Office on the potential repeal of this section. The Home Office confirmed that it was a redundant provision that it no longer required for its purposes, that the police authorities had not been actively enforcing it, and that it would place unnecessary burdens on postal operators and the police force within the newly envisaged framework. The Home Office therefore suggested that it was content for the repeal to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/5">It should also be noted that the intended purpose of such a provision contained in the official secrets legislation of 1920 would not have been the regulation of accommodation address services in respect of trading standards and consumer protection issues. Official secrets legislation of that nature was mainly instigated by the requirements of British intelligence agencies, especially at that period when there existed significant national security concerns regarding acts of terrorism and acts to infiltrate and undermine the Government. The purpose of that provision in that context was likely to be to give the police authorities a means to intercept or track mail in order to root out suspected spies or individuals engaged in activities against the interests of national security. Its intended applicability to issues other than that is doubtful. That is further supported by the fact that it dates from a period when there was only one United Kingdom postal operator, and it is doubtful whether there were many businesses providing what is now considered to be an accommodation address service.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/6">Having said that, my Department is sympathetic to the concerns that have been raised about increasing transparency and accountability in respect of businesses and individuals who may be involved in criminal or fraudulent activities to the detriment of consumers, and who may operate some of their correspondence dealings via an accommodation address service, where such services may not hold or make available to the authorities adequate client details.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/7">My officials have advised me that they have not yet been presented with sufficient robust evidence to support those concerns or to suggest that the problem is so widespread that it merits a national solution. However, my hon. Friend has provided a good amount of evidence, and I ask him to come to see me, perhaps with trading standards officers from his area&mdash;and officers from other areas, if they have been in contact with them&mdash;so that we can establish together exactly what is the calibre of the evidence and make a good case to the Department. Officials should have a sound body of evidence to work on in order to address this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/8">I turn briefly to the Government's approach to consumer protection and scams in general. We remain committed to improving Britain's consumer regime&mdash;a regime that protects and empowers consumers, and that is as fair to business as it is to consumers. I am aware of my hon. Friend's keen interest in consumer protection and policy issues, and although I may cover some areas of which he is already aware, I would like to highlight some of the work that the Government already undertake regarding protection for consumers against scams and frauds.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/9">The Government set out how they would achieve their aim of improving the UK consumer regime in their consumer strategy, &quot;A Fair Deal For All&mdash;Extending Competitive Markets: Empowered Consumers, Successful Business&quot; that was published last year. The strategy recognised that enforcement needs to be more effective at stopping the rogues&mdash;those who deliberately set out to defraud consumers, often targeting the most vulnerable, as my hon. Friend has highlighted in some of the dreadful examples that he has given.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/10">The Government have provided funding to trading standards services to pilot their specialist &quot;scambuster&quot; team initiative; &pound;1.79 million is being made available over two years. Those dedicated teams will work across local authority boundaries, focusing on the hardest to tackle scams that are normally beyond the capacity of an individual local authority to deal with. The firm intention is that they will crack down on the genuine crooks. A further &pound;1.2 million has been made available over two years for trading standards services to set up an intelligence network to help underpin the effectiveness of &quot;scambuster&quot; teams and local trading standards departments. That network will play a part in ensuring that the real rogue traders find it much more difficult to hide and continue their dishonest activities.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/11">My hon. Friend spoke about the Enterprise Act 2002, and I want to make him aware of Government proposals to amend it to make it easier for consumers to get the kind of information that he referred to from trading standards departments so that they can pursue civil cases. Part 9 of the Act relates to the disclosure of certain types of consumer and competition information. Currently under the Act, public authorities such as trading standards departments are unable to disclose information to individual consumers or businesses for the purpose of civil proceedings. That is to protect sensitive competitive and commercial information, and, as such, it is perfectly proper. However, the Government are currently moving to amend the Act to make it easier for consumers to obtain such information from public authorities in order to pursue civil cases, while protecting sensitive competition information. For example, consumers will find it easier to obtain such information in situations where they are the victim of a scam and wish to reclaim money they have lost, wish to seek redress for personal injury arising from a dangerous of defective product, or seek to obtain information such as a trader's name so that they may serve court papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/12">Part 9 of the 2002 Act will be amended in the Company Law Reform Bill that is currently passing through the other place. That will be an enabling provision and the definition of the civil proceedings for which disclosure can be made and the types of information will be enacted through secondary legislation, which at present is planned for some time next year. I hope that that gives my hon. Friend an idea of what the Government are doing to improve the regime by which individuals can seek redress and act to prevent fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/13">The EU directive on unfair commercial practices will also help in combating scams. That directive encompasses significant new enforcement provisions that will help trading standards officers and other enforcers take more effective action against scams. Annex I contains specific provisions prohibiting scams where no prize is awarded at all, where false impression is given that those who participate are likely to get a prize, or which require the consumer to incur a cost. The directive also prohibits misleading actions or omissions, which will outlaw many scams, and, as a final catch-all, it introduces an overarching duty on businesses not to treat consumers unfairly.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/14">I do not want to give my hon. Friend the impression that nothing is being done in this area. It is an important area, and much is being done, both at national level through the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Company Law Reform Bill, and at European level. We are trying to address these dreadful practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.2/15">I congratulate my hon. Friend on this debate; it is an exemplary piece of parliamentary activity. I give him a commitment that if he brings that evidence to me and my officials, we will take it forward through my Department, and do our very best, in conjunction with other Departments with an interest in this area, to ensure that these scams are eradicated once and for all.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.286.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" speakername="James Gray" colnum="286"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.286.5/1">I would of course view it as a very strong compliment, although I am not sure that it would necessarily be viewed as much of one in the halls of new Labour, in which that lady presumably seeks to work. The fact, however, is that she is determined to go for the worst option and to close the hospitals, irrespective of what the public might say in response to the consultation. That is what is so disgraceful.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/2">As my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1537" name="Michael Ancram">the Member for Devizes (Mr. Ancram)</phrase> said, I shall be asking the public in North Wiltshire to write in in their thousands and tens of thousands. I intend to deliver perhaps 100,000 letters, or at least signatures on petitions, to the Government and the PCT. Those people will not be asking for any one of the PCT's wholly unacceptable options, but telling the Government, &quot;We want our community hospitals to be preserved as they are.&quot; If the consultation is genuine, and the Government are indeed determined to listen to our constituents, that option would presumably be available to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/3">I will shortly have the honour of presenting a petition to the House of Commons. It will contain at least 30,000, and possibly 50,000, signatures, and I suspect that a significant number of others will write in to add their names to it. My suspicion, however, is that the so-called consultation is a sham and that no consultation is going on. The Government, or their puppet the PCT, have decided to cut, cut, cut our community hospitals and, in effect, to close all seven.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/4">Incidentally, before someone turns round and says, &quot;Don't worry. Chippenham's safe&quot;, let me say that under option one Chippenham community hospital will be left with only 20 stroke beds, and any vague resemblance to a hospital will be long gone. What is happening to Chippenham community hospital is what has happened to Malmesbury community hospital over the past two or three years&mdash;death by a thousand cuts, with the removal of one service after another. That is entirely unacceptable. Our area is predominantly rural, and 2,500 patients a year use our community hospitals. It is entirely unacceptable that those hospitals should be closed and, according to the consultation paper, replaced by what looks like souped-up GP surgeries. We want our community hospitals and we are determined to keep them.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/5">In that context, I was very much encouraged by the consultation paper &quot;Our health, our care, our say&quot;, which the Government produced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-31">31 January</phrase>, and by what the Secretary of State said in it:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/6" class="indent">&quot;we are clear that community facilities should not be lost in response to short-term budgetary pressures that are not related to the viability of the community facility itself.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/7">Conservative Members welcomed that statement. There was also a statement to the House of Commons, in which the Secretary of State said that the community hospitals were to be saved, which Conservative Members also very much welcomed. Even then, however, we pressed her a little and, by chance, I happen to have the <i>Hansard </i>extract here. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/8" class="indent">&quot;I am ensuring that primary care trusts that are considering the closure of community facilities, and particularly community hospitals, review those in the light of the clear strategy that we have spelled out in the White Paper to ensure that they have the facilities that will be needed as more services are moved out of acute hospitals into the community.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/9">Even then, I was not entirely certain that I could believe what I was hearing. I thought, &quot;This is great news. The Secretary of State is on my side. We've won this battle. We're going to save our community hospitals.&quot; I therefore leapt to my feet to press her. I asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/10" class="indent">&quot;Will the Secretary of State give some attention to a case in point, my constituency, where community hospitals, particularly Malmesbury, as well as those that serve the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1922" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for Westbury (Dr. Murrison)</phrase>&mdash;Bradford-on-Avon, Warminster, Westbury, Melksham and Trowbridge&mdash;are under threat? Listening to the Secretary of State's statement, I believe that she is beginning to say that we ought to think again about closing those community hospitals.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/11">That was a clear question. I asked whether she meant that she wanted to save those community hospitals. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/12" class="indent">&quot;Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire . . . need to decide whether specific proposals relating to cottage or community hospitals are indeed the answer, or whether those settings represent future paths that need to be extended rather than diminished or closed.&quot;&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2006-01-30.33"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 January 2006; Vol. 442, c. 33&ndash;34</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/13">I challenge the Minister to say whether she stands by what the Secretary of State said as recently as <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, when she explicitly said that she believed that community hospitals were the way to deliver in Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire&mdash;she named the area, and answered my specific questions&mdash;or does she stand by any of the three inadequate options offered in the consultation produced by the primary care trust last week? She cannot have it both ways. Either we keep the community hospitals open, which seems to be what the Secretary of State was suggesting, or we allow them to close, which appears to be what the PCT is now asking for.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/14">The crisis in the health service in Wiltshire is not limited to the closure of the community hospitals, although that is its pinnacle. The crisis spreads across almost every aspect of delivery in the area. Only last week, the Royal United hospital in Bath announced that the dreadful shortage of money meant that would have to sack 300 people and close up to 60 beds. The Great Western hospital in Swindon is inadequate for the numbers going there; there are huge waiting lists for a variety of procedures. Indeed, a constituent of mine, a retired fireman, used his redundancy money to pay for his wife's operation. It was a perfectly routine women's operation but it had to be done privately. That is a disgrace. That is not how we want our national health service to be.</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/15">I was interested to note that, in its press notice about the bed closures, the Royal United hospital said that we should not worry and that everything would be all right because it could rely on the community facilities around Wiltshire to cope with the pressure. Little did it know that the PCT would simultaneously be going out of its way to cut and then close the very community facilities upon which the Royal United was relying.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.294.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1865" speakername="Michael Wills" colnum="294"  time="014:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew25">
	<p pid="a.294.0/1">I am aware that the right hon. and learned Gentleman opposed the closure of the hospital; I think that locally, everybody did. My point was about the approach taken by his Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/2">This Government support PFI, and as a result we have been able to build a lot of new hospitals. My basic point about financing the health service is that the Government are committed to provide more funding than the Conservatives would be. The onus is on the Conservatives. Rather than whinging and complaining about what the Government are doing to improve the health service, if they have a better set of proposals they should let us hear them. We should not just have the critique, but let us hear what they are going to do, how they will manage it and how they will fund it.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/3">It is not only the hospital service that is improving, and it is improving, whatever Conservative Members might say. We also have an innovative new range of GP services, and I want to talk about one example from my constituency, the Taw Hill surgery. It is an admirable surgery run by a dynamic collection of GPs who constantly look for ways to improve the service that they deliver to their patients. It is interesting what they have been able to introduce because of the funding provided by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/4">The surgery offers retinal screening for diabetics, which identifies problems and allows for early treatment of the condition, saving many people's eyesight. A carpal tunnel and hernia service has been introduced. That used to be done under general anaesthetic in hospital, but it is now done under local anaesthetic and locally. There is an antenatal 3D ultrasound facility. Laser skin treatments were previously carried out 40 miles away in hospital and are now carried out at the surgery. Those four important services are now offered locally, and that is only possible because of the investment from the Government, which enables innovative, adventurous and forward-looking GPs, like those at the Taw Hill surgery, to deliver better services for their patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.0/5">All that should be welcomed by Conservative Members. Instead of carping and criticising, we ought to celebrate the progress that we have made. Of course, let us look for improvement, but let us not paint a one-sided, whinging picture of what has happened in Wiltshire. Most objective observers agree that the situation is far better than it was. I am sure that my hon. Friend the Minister will say that further improvements are needed, as that is what the Government are determined to deliver.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.294.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1803" speakername="Robert Key" colnum="294"  time="015:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h03.htm#60426h03_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.294.1/1">I start from a slightly different perspective. Perhaps I should have a text: &quot;veniuntque abeuntque pueri, sed semper maneo&quot;, or &quot;the boys come and go, but I always stay the same&quot;. I am perhaps the longest-serving Member for Wiltshire. I first attended Salisbury hospital in 1952 to have my tonsils out when it was a Nissen hut camp outside the city, on the hill. I have long-held and pretty fond memories of the health service.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/2">I should also declare that I am going to be extremely nice about the health service in South Wiltshire, as I shall shortly be testing it myself. I have an operation booked with the excellent national health service to look after my problem. I shall be throwing away my walking stick and leaping around Westminster shortly. Having said that, I am going to take a slightly different approach to the problems. The crisis that we face in Wiltshire is caused by the crisis management of debt and projected debt and by the unclear boundaries between health service provision and social service provision. That, as far as the south of the county is concerned, is the biggest problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/3">It is also an issue of accountability. Over the past six months or so, we have seen the closure of the Amblescroft unit for elderly, mentally ill people, the Greencroft centre as a day centre for disturbed people with a wide range of problems, as well as the community nursing plan service and the hospital alternatives team. We have seen the closure of the Shelwork factory run by Action for Blind People and the Shaw Trust centre for people who are visually impaired and disabled. We have seen a lot of such closures.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/4">At the heart of that has been the great distress caused to the people and families involved. A lot of lessons have been learned. When I have raised such issues, I have received nothing but courtesy from Ministers. When I raised the closure of Amblescroft and the Greencroft centre at oral questions on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>, the Secretary of State immediately said that she would look at the specific cases. She did, she got back to me and I received a charming letter from the Minister who is with us today, in which she also pursued those points. It all came back to the problems of accountability. The Secretary of State and the Minister both rightly said that a lot of money was being spent and that decision making on individual projects and expenditure must be matters for local decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/5">There is a problem. County councillors faced with picking up the bill, as the national health service will not pay for what it previously paid for, are liable to surcharge. They cannot just go on running up debt ad nauseam. They have not only the electors breathing down their back, but the district auditor. That is a problem for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/6">The primary care trust, the acute trust and the mental health trust all have executive and non-executive directors. They have to take responsibility as they are remunerated&mdash;not very generously, but they are remunerated&mdash;but they are blushing violets. It has been with the greatest difficulty that I have persuaded people to realise that a lot of people in the community are appointed by the NHS Appointments Commission to look after the interests of local people. Nobody knows who they are and when things go wrong they keep their heads down. That is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/7">I have tried to encourage the non-executive directors of our local health trusts in Salisbury and South Wiltshire to put their heads above the parapet and to explain what is going on. I challenged one of them, who I know very well, and said, &quot;You know what is going on. Surely you can come out and say that when Amblescroft closes no one will be out on the street, because you will have to pick up the pieces.&quot; The reply was &quot;Oh no, we have been told not to say anything, because that would indicate liability. We have been instructed to say nothing to anybody.&quot; That is a shame, as it inhibits accountability. It is wrong, and it should not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/8">When we consider what has been going wrong in Salisbury, we should remember that a tremendous amount has been going right in South Wiltshire. The health service is in good heart. We have moved on from the Nissen hut era, I am delighted to say. We have been through a number of different sites and have seen rationalisation and massive delay. The one thing that has characterised the health service in South Wiltshire has been change after change. It has normally been a question of administrative change and financial procedures. Often, clinical procedures and policies for the treatment of people have changed. Occasionally, as in the crisis of the past few months, we have seen the chief executive of our primary care trust&mdash;an excellent public servant&mdash;trying to persuade us that the problem is solved because they have found a new and clinically better way to treat people that, surprise surprise, will cost less in the long run.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/9">That does not help the people who write to their Members of Parliament in terms such as this:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/10" class="indent">&quot;I am aware that you have been involved in trying to resolve the issues of care funding . . . My mother was resident&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/11">at Amblescroft</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/12" class="indent">&quot;until she unfortunately died . . . She was one of the twelve people earmarked as requiring just 'social care' and as such would potentially have received no direct funding for her nursing care if she had been moved to a nursing home as was being proposed. When I point out that she was epileptic, doubly incontinent, bed ridden, had high blood pressure, high cholesterol and enlarged blood vessels in her brain making her liable to a stroke, was prone to infections and I was asked if they should put 'do not resuscitate' on her notes as she was so frail, you will be able to see that she had requirements for nursing care not social care.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/13">That illustrates my problem with the boundaries between health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/14">Another note from a constituent on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-17">17 March</phrase> reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/15" class="indent">&quot;I am so frightened, the Greencroft centre has been my haven for a number of years, it has worked alongside my medication in keeping me as stable as possible. I suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder, Clinical Depression and Epilepsy. I also have eating problems and self harm as a coping mechanism to deal with extreme trauma! Since the devastating news that the Greencroft centre is closing, my illness has become worse. I get shaky and panicky, wondering how on earth I will cope after the 30th of April. I live alone and I am so scared.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/16">It is at the edges that it really feels bad when things go wrong. It is not the robust clinical directors, who can run our magnificent hospital and make the best possible use of every penny that the taxpayer provides under whatever Government, who suffer. It is the people who are not going for straightforward surgery who suffer. It is the people who have problems with their mind who suffer. Perhaps they have mental health problems. Sometimes they are not in that category. However, it is always the people at the edges who suffer. That is why we must be particularly careful. I believe that there is a future, and we must ensure that it comes to pass when we get through the current crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/17">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on raising this issue. He has put it in passionate terms as it affects his constituency. My constituency is not seeing the closure of cottage hospitals. We have none; we have no cottage hospital-type facility. I wish we did. It has been suggested that the Amblescroft unit, which has closed, would make an ideal community unit as a sort of halfway house. We should not be seeing the closure of the hospital alternative scheme and the community nursing, and that is without consultation with the GPs, incidentally.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/18">There is a tremendous future, but it is no good pretending that everything is fine or that money alone will solve the problem. The issue is all about the sort of management that we want to see. Of course, that must be extremely efficient, but not to the point of harsh delivery and harsh, sudden decisions that have huge consequences for a small number of vulnerable people in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/19">The health service in South Wiltshire is strong. It has always been good and will get better because of the people who work in it. They include consultants who are attracted by the quality of life and therefore do not wish to move on to further their careers in London teaching hospitals or even Southampton. They want to stay where they are to serve the people of South Wiltshire. That is why the number of consultants in Salisbury has doubled in the 23 years for which I have been the Member of Parliament. It is why the morale among all the people in the heath service, whether clinicians, porters, cleaners or administrators, is so high.</p>
	<p pid="a.294.1/20">The one thing that dashes everyone's hopes is management by crisis, which we have been seeing recently. I hope that before too long we will be through that phase and back on track towards ever better health services for the people of Wiltshire.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.1/1">I had better not, because I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/2">The British public have been consulted about health as never before&mdash;and ignored as never before. As the right hon. and learned Member for Devizes said, a consultation that does not even provide the option of keeping the community hospital open, is no consultation at all. Along with other Members present, I am a patron of the Community Hospitals Acting Nationally Together group. It has highlighted effectively the Government's rhetoric that community hospitals are right, and the reality that hospitals are shutting throughout Wiltshire, Gloucestershire and elsewhere. There is a disjunction between what the Government say they believe in and what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/3">The Secretary of State says &quot;More community facilities and more hospitals&quot;, and the Labour party manifesto says &quot;More community hospitals&quot;. But in reality, up to all Wiltshire's community hospitals are closing. Will the Minister clarify the connection between the two? The Secretary of State says it, so why is she not making it happen? What is she doing to deliver that promise? The reality for the people of Wiltshire is quite the contrary, and I agree that the consultations are a sham.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/4">My final observation is about national and local decision making. The people of Wiltshire should frame the health services for Wiltshire. There must be national standards and a national context, but, as far as possible, decision making should be local. It should be local and democratically accountable, not, as the hon. Member for Salisbury said, performed by non-executive directors who have been told to keep their heads down, and whom nobody elected and nobody can get rid of. That is where I differ from the Government, who claim to devolve, but keep the power in the centre and set so much of the local framework that there is little local discretion. It is also where I differ from Conservative Members, whom I do not think want elected, democratic accountability in the national health service. Again, when given the opportunity to introduce it, they did not.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.1/5">If local decisions are taken about the national health service, as they should be, elected, not appointed, people should oversee them. I am not clear whether that is the Conservative party's position, and I hope that their spokesman will clarify it.</p>

	<p pid="a.304.2/1">We have had a lively debate, and it has been good to hear so many right hon. and hon. Friends, mainly, and other hon. Members contribute to the debate. Money lies at the heart of this matter, as with everything, but it is about not simply the total of money spent on the health service in Wiltshire, but how that money has been spent. It is a cause for regret that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1743" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Northavon (Steve Webb)</phrase> spent most of his time laying into the previous Conservative Administration, without offering anything positive&mdash;a Liberal Democrat vision, if you like&mdash;for health care in Wiltshire. No doubt, it will be noted by those in the county who might be foolish enough to consider supporting the Liberal Democrats.</p>
	<p pid="a.304.2/2">At the heart of the funding allocation for our county, as elsewhere, lies the resource allocation: the weighted capitation formula. It is an 87-page document that I do not recommend to anybody. From the formula, it is clear that for a number of reasons, Wiltshire gets a relatively raw deal, chiefly because of its cost drivers, which are not adequately reflected in the formula. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> read out some of the comparisons in funding that Wiltshire can expect, and what applies elsewhere. It is clear that we lie far down the funding league table. Of course, money matters; it would be foolish to suggest otherwise. However, the issue is also about how that money is spent, and that is chiefly what the Conservative debate has been about this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.305.1/1">The answer is all of the above. Of course it is, and I thought I made that clear. The hon. Gentleman will also remember that the Opposition went into the previous election pledging to match the Government's spending on the national health service&mdash;a point that the Liberal Democrats might like to bear in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/2">It is important to remember that the issue is about not simply spending money. That is a lazy way to approach the issue. If we were to approach it in that way, as the Liberal Democrats do, we would not move on at all. The question is about how we spend the money. In Wiltshire, it is not clear whether the money has been and is being spent in a way that will maximise the effect for patients.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/3">We have talked about the primary care trust. My views that it has contributed to the sorry pass in which we find ourselves are best left outside the Chamber. It would be unfair simply to lay into the primary care trust. Ministers need to own the issue, not least because of their stated commitment in the White Paper, &quot;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&quot;, which appears to be completely at odds with what is happening on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/4">The Minister must know that the preferred option of the Kennet and North Wiltshire primary care trust is to close all community hospitals, with one particular exception. That is the reality. How on earth does it marry with the intentions laid down in that White Paper, which is just weeks old? It simply will not do. I shared the delight of my right hon. and hon. Friends when I read that document. It is rare for a member of the official Opposition to be delighted in such a way, but I genuinely was when I came to paragraph 6.42, which laid out clearly and categorically&mdash;no ifs, no buts, no margin for error&mdash;the Government's support for community hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/5">Such support accords with the views of the vast majority of my constituents. Frankly, I do not need a sham consultation exercise to know what people in my constituency want in respect of local health care. Surely none of us does who keeps an ear to the ground in our constituencies. I am sure that that goes for all Members here this afternoon. We know what people want, they tell us all the time, and it is not just the usual suspects but also those so-called hard-to-reach groups that the Minister says she is so keen to listen to. I presume that it is for those people that she has held hugely expensive consultation exercises across the country. We listen to those groups just as much as we listen to anybody else, and they say that they want the model of health care that is, in fact, supported by that document, yet the primary care trust&mdash;the Minister's vicars on earth in Wiltshire&mdash;are doing something completely different. Ministers surely must understand that that is not acceptable, yet so far I have not seen any measures by Ministers to curtail what is happening on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.305.1/6">I hope that the Minister, who has listened carefully and attentively to what has been said this afternoon, will go to her officials and ask them, through the strategic health authority, to try to work out exactly what the PCT is doing in Wiltshire and to try o to accord it more realistically with her Government's policy in the White Paper. I sincerely ask her to do that, and, if she does, I shall be the first publicly to shower her with laurels in Wiltshire. I am sure that her party would benefit, not that it would do her much good.</p>

	<p pid="a.306.1/1">I entirely agree with my right hon. and learned Friend, and I share his disquiet at the behaviour of some non-executive directors, who I believe should represent the views of local people. Too often, I find that they have been taken into the organisational big tent and will not speak up on behalf of people, and that is a worry. If they have a value at all, it is precisely in articulating the concerns of local people. They may have a view, of course, and they may feel driven by logic in a particular direction. Nevertheless, their function surely is to articulate the concerns of local people. However, often, we find that that is not happening, and that is a great pity. I take his point entirely.</p>
	<p pid="a.306.1/2">I suppose that I feel for the PCT and its officials, as they are trying to balance the books, and that cannot be easy. It is our function to shout and scream when we see a problem that involves money. I hope that the Minister will listen to my right hon. and learned Friend's comments, particularly in respect of the write-off, which is only fair. It took me, the MP for Westbury, quite a long time to work out exactly how the deficit had arisen and how on earth had we come to that point. I have no doubt that, without the deficit, the options document would not have been necessary. As hon. Friends have said, it is clear that it was driven not by a desire to improve health care in Wiltshire but by the need to sort out the deficit, which is largely historically driven.</p>

	<p pid="a.307.0/1">It is clear from the fact that so many health trusts in Wiltshire are in deficit that it is not simply because of bad management. It would be a bizarre statistical quirk were there to be so many trusts in Wiltshire that were in deficit for that reason. Trusts try to benchmark their provision of services against other trusts, so I am driven to conclude that there is a problem with the resource allocation weighted capitation formula. I hope that we can look at that to ensure that the cost drivers in Wiltshire are adequately reflected. Given that it is so low in the league table of spending, I believe that it gets less than its fair share. I would say as a constituency MP but also as a shadow spokesman that the formula does not adequately reflect some of the cost drivers. I hope that that answers the hon. Gentleman's point.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/2">I would like to turn to how we can make the best use of our resources. Shutting down community hospitals simply will not work. If the case mix is right, community hospitals are, in fact, cost effective. I have made that case repeatedly in the Minister's presence, and I rather hoped that Ministers might look into it. The data are available, and it is simply not sufficient to say that money will be saved by closing down community hospitals, as the costs are passed on somewhere else. They are passed on to acute hospital trusts, yet the cost of treating someone in a community hospital is probably one third the cost of treating them in hospitals such as the Royal United, the Salisbury District or the Great Western.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/3">Costs are also passed on to social services, and we are seeing that big time in Wiltshire. My right hon. and hon. Friends have received a letter from Councillor Jane Scott, the leader of Wiltshire county council, in which she makes the point that the PCT, which has a turnaround director in place and the district auditor breathing down its neck, is passing costs on to social services. One may say that that is well and good, that the PCT is putting its books in order, but the truth of the matter is that the cost to the public purse of treating and managing people in need is not being affected one jot. It is simply an accounting exercise in passing costs elsewhere, in many cases to bodies that are more expensive for treating a condition or set of conditions, in the case of the elderly and the long-term sick. Everybody loses: the public purse does not benefit, patients do not benefit and, my word, carers do not benefit at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/4">One of the problems with passing costs on to social services&mdash;putting people at the door of social services&mdash;is that carers bear much of the burden. That burden is uncosted. As far as the state is concerned, it is a free good. We are all guilty, all too often, of ignoring that, but a great deal of what is happening in Wiltshire at present will, unfortunately, result in carers picking up much of the tab.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/5">One or two hon. Members mentioned so-called super-surgeries. They appear quite often in the consultation document to which we have referred. It is interesting that when one gets on the phone to speak to those at the PCT who are responsible for the document and asks them precisely what they mean by super-surgeries or primary care centres, they are not too sure. At the end of the day, what it boils down to is a large general practitioner surgery. We are not clear about precisely what services will be offered on the premises.</p>
	<p pid="a.307.0/6">I have been accused of being sentimental about bricks and mortar when discussing community hospitals. What is more sentimental&mdash;what represents more of a preoccupation with bricks and mortar&mdash;than someone saying that they will set up a primary care centre without saying what will be done in the building? The consultation document states that screening services will be carried out, which is very nice, but, scratching a bit further, the precise form of screening is obscure. We understand that there will be GP-run dermatology clinics, but GPs are perfectly capable of running clinics from their existing premises. We understand that optometrist-run assessments will continue locally for patients with cataracts. As it happens, Westbury community hospital, which is scheduled for closure, has an extremely well received cataract service that recently treated Christopher Booker, who talked about his experiences positively in the press recently.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.0/1">I would like to say that I have less than 10 minutes to speak, so I probably will not be able to take interventions, and I might have to write to people on a number of the issues raised. I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1926" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr. Gray)</phrase> on securing the debate. Clearly, the Conservative, Labour and Liberal Democrat parties are represented here today by champions for their local communities, and that is right and proper.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/2">If I could make a point about the comment made by the hon. Gentleman on my activity yesterday, it is fair enough for me as Minister with responsibility for public health&mdash;that is my main role&mdash;to preface my contribution by mentioning something that has not been discussed much today. I want to talk about why it is so important that, at the heart of the discussion on what hospitals provide and what more could be provided in the community, there should be debate about whether we are prepared to challenge the traditional ways in which our health services have been provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/3">There has been an emphasis on treatment, which has improved enormously over the past 10 to 20 years in terms of drugs, technology and so forth. The area that has not been given attention is the role that we can all play in public health to prevent long-term conditions that have to do with how people live their lives. More could be done on that. That is a challenge for all of us, because&mdash;many hon. Members raised this point&mdash;that is about how we can best meet people's needs, get ahead of the curve, and ensure that there are facilities closer to where people live, particularly those in communities that, because of health inequalities, are not accessing services. How can we change their futures? By considering that, we could get better health outcomes, but we also have to challenge the thinking on where finances are directed. We have to think about how we can turn around our thoughts about the health service to prevent and to manage long-term conditions. Importantly, we should also think about shifting some funding from the acute to the primary sector in working on prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/4">Something like just 2 per cent. of NHS spend, which we know is at historically high levels, is currently defined as being on the prevention side. The challenge for all of us is to think outside the box about how those services are provided. I have no problem with what I am doing in promoting public health, because that is at the heart of changing the way that we think about health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/5">Performance across Avon, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire has improved. The Secretary of State, backed by the Prime Minister, was trying to put in context the fact that, in a number of areas, certainly when I became a Member of Parliament in 1997, uppermost in people's minds were waiting times, the amount of time that people spent waiting in accident and emergency, cancer and heart disease, and poor service. That was eight, nine or 10 years ago. In all those areas, there has been improvement. In the constituencies of hon. Members present today, there were two patients waiting more than six months for in-patient treatment this February. That is compared with more than 11,000 people waiting more than nine months in March 1997. As of December 2005, there were 12 patients waiting 13 weeks for out-patient treatment with a consultant, compared with nearly 14,000 patients in May 1998.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.0/6">In December 2005, 99.2 per cent. of people with urgent suspected cancer referrals from GPs were seen by specialists within two weeks of referral. Also in December 2005, 98.8 per cent. of patients were seen, diagnosed and treated within four hours of arrival at accident and emergency. I believe strongly that some of that is to do with extra resources. However, I also pay tribute, as other hon. Members have done, to staff, not only for their hard work, but for their willingness to look at their traditional working practices and think about how they can deal with them differently. That is about not just the acute sector and hospitals, but primary care. For example, we all know that there are significant numbers of people who go through accident and emergency whose needs could be dealt with elsewhere in the community.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.1/1">I am glad to have secured the debate. It is a tragedy that King Edward VII hospital in Midhurst should have been forced to close; it was a unique, independent, non-profit making charitable foundation. Most independent hospitals like it were victims of Nye Bevan's nationalisation programme in the 1940s. This hospital was one of the few that got away. Its structure should have enabled it to have become a template for how a foundation hospital operates today.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/2">It was genuinely independent and provided very high standards of care at a reasonable cost&mdash;mostly at tariff rates for NHS patients. Since nationalisation in 1948, at least a third of the hospital's patients were from the NHS, and they were always treated in exactly the same way as private patients. At the time of its closure, nearly two thirds of the hospital's patients were NHS patients. A former Labour Minister described it to me as a template for foundation hospitals, and it is very sad to see it go. The first big loser of the closure has been the NHS itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/3">Anyone who knew King Edward VII hospital knows that it was a fantastic place. There was a strong and caring team ethic, which is always present in good institutions and always missing in bad ones. I knew personally a good number of the people who worked there&mdash;the second big losers of the closure&mdash;and felt keenly for them when they lost their jobs. They were highly skilled and dedicated professionals, and some of them will not easily find alternative work in a local health care economy in which NHS services are contracting as we speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/4">The third big losers are my constituents and the thousands of people from miles around who have used, or might have used, the hospital's excellent facilities. I first secured a Westminster Hall debate on the hospital three years ago, when it was initially threatened with closure. Fourteen MPs from the region came to my support, and I am grateful to see a number of them here today. The closure is not a local, but a regional, issue. Be under no illusion: this closure of capacity will not be fully replaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/5">My constituents have lost a lot. The hospital provided very high levels of oncology treatment. It provided radiotherapy treatment with an advanced linear accelerator for 250 cancer patients a year; major cardiac surgery for 300 cases a year; interventional cardiology for a further 900 cases a year; orthopaedic surgery for 1,500 cases a year; major bariatric surgery for 150 cases a year; eye surgery for 200 cases a year; and it treated 14,000 outpatient cases a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/6">A former Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1527" name="Alan Milburn">the right hon. Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn)</phrase>, once said:</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/7" class="indent">&quot;What you have within the National Health Service is . . . a system that frankly is not so much short of cash now.. but a . . . system that is short of capacity.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/8">A great chunk of capacity has just been closed. I wish the right hon. Gentleman was still right, because now we have a problem of both cash and capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/9">I should like to make three further points. First, I want briefly to discuss why the hospital closed, although there is not much point in lingering for too long on that, given that the milk has been spilt. Secondly, I should like to ask the Minister about the performance of Capio Healthcare UK, the health care provider that withdrew from the deal. Thirdly, I should like to place the hospital's closure in the context of what is going on in the regional health care economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/10">Why did the hospital have to close? There were many reasons, and I shall not rehearse them all, especially as many of them were set out in the January 2003 debate that I mentioned. The immediate cause of closure was the decision a few weeks ago of Capio, a large Swedish health care provider, to walk away from a deal in which it had agreed in principle to construct a new hospital on the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/11">The argument that terms could not be agreed with the developer, used publicly by Capio's management to explain their decision, has been flatly contradicted by everybody involved with the hospital&mdash;the trustees, the senior management, the provisional liquidator and the developer himself. The fact that Capio was not prepared to be frank, and relied instead on a bogus explanation, is important in one respect, of which the Minister should be aware: at the moment, the NHS is doing extensive business with Capio, and its cavalier attitude to frequently made oral and written commitments needs to be borne in mind in future dealings.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/12">That would not be so concerning were it not for widespread allegations that the level of care provided by Capio, under contract to the NHS, may not be adequate. I am not making that allegation; I am not in a position to judge it. However, I strongly advise the Minister to ask the Department to consider the issue and to reassure herself, because Capio has recently been the subject of a number of media investigations.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/13">With that in mind, I have four questions for the Minister. First, what assurances can she give that, given the closure of King Edward VII hospital, Capio will be able fully to perform the spine chain contract with the NHS known as GC4&mdash;the Minister will know what I am talking about&mdash;to supply the so-called Southampton gap? As she will know, that contract has four years to run and King Edward VII was, until a few weeks ago, doing roughly half the work implied by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/14">Secondly, will the Minister undertake a study to provide reassurance that health outcome levels, for those treated as part of the Southampton gap spine chain contract, are at or above the levels for the NHS as a whole? Thirdly, what is the level of repeat surgery for the contracts performed by Capio and for the Southampton gap spine chain contract, and what is the most appropriate general equivalent NHS benchmark? Finally, will the Minister publish the level of repeat surgery, compared with a regional and national benchmark, for that part of the GC4 contract not supplied by King Edward VII hospital?</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/15">Those questions are detailed, and I do not expect the Minister to have the answers at her fingertips. She has a difficult job. If she gives me a clear pledge that she will consider my questions carefully, personally assure herself that there is no cause for concern and publish the detailed material for which I have asked, I will be happy. I should be grateful if she came back to me in writing. As she knows, I have already tabled a number of parliamentary questions on related issues. I also think that she should ask the Healthcare Commission to examine Capio's performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.1/16">I want to leave the Minister with plenty of time to respond, and a number of colleagues have mentioned that they would like to say a few words.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.320.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" speakername="George Mudie" colnum="320"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h05.htm#60426h05_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.320.1/1">May I express my gratitude for the opportunity to raise this important matter, and my pleasure that you are in the Chair, Mr. Gale? The last time that I appeared before you was when you chaired the Committee on the infamous Higher Education Bill, when we debated tuition fees. I am grateful for your kindness then.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/2">I start by paying tribute to my colleagues on Leeds city council. Over the years, I and others have had long discussions and arguments about how to tackle inner-city problems such as poverty, deprivation, bad housing, indifferent education, high levels of crime and vandalism, and consistently unacceptable unemployment levels. It has been argued that such problems cannot be solved, as attempts to do so have been made for decades. I was a councillor for 20 years and was involved in inner-city programmes and the like that were aimed at ending poverty. They never had that effect, but ended up simply doing things on the margin.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/3">Leeds city council has accepted the argument that those individual programmes should be superseded by a major regeneration scheme with the objective of ending the two-speed economy and two-speed standard of living in Leeds, where there is high unemployment in the inner city and prosperity in the rest of the city. In a previous Adjournment debate, I talked about many of the sad facts of life in my constituency. Suffice it to say that three of my four wards are in the Department's list of the most deprived wards in the country, so it is accepted that there is a real problem in the inner city and my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/4">I pay tribute to Councillor Keith Wakefield, who was the leader of the Labour group and who ran the council at the time. He started the process of procuring a private sector partner. I was worried when he lost control of the council and the Conservatives took over, but was later delighted and relieved to find that the local Conservative leader Andrew Carter and his colleague Councillor Les Carter, who handles neighbourhoods and housing, approached the matter with real sympathy and enthusiasm. However, the problem continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/5">Regeneration takes two major forms, the first of which&mdash;I am sure that the Minister will know this from what is happening in east London&mdash;is gentrification. It is like the Scottish land clearances in past centuries. Local people are taken off the land, various bits are assembled, and work takes place with a developer to use it more profitably, regardless of the social effect on the people. That is property regeneration. It has its place because sometimes it is done a little more sensitively than I have suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/6">The other kind of regeneration is when we accept it in its fullest sense, as the physical regeneration of an area, as well as the regeneration of people. It is about making changes and ensuring that the objective is that local people share in the prosperity thrown up by development and business.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/7">I have raised the subject because we are at an early stage in the regeneration process. Final discussions are going on with the private contractor, but I fear&mdash;for reasons that are not dogmatic, but understandable and straightforward&mdash;that the property-only type of regeneration might be winning over the property-and-people type of regeneration. The private partnership will throw up a considerable amount of money&mdash;I am not approaching the Minister with a begging bowl, as usually happens in debates on regeneration and inner cities&mdash;and it is estimated that the city council will get in the region of &pound;120 million as its share of the profits from the regeneration. That is a pessimistic assessment because that money on its own would not be sufficient to fulfil the objectives, which are accepted by most people in Leeds. In fact, it would be a great temptation, because &pound;120 million would allow the council to refurbish instead of change. It could be used on various parts of the social infrastructure&mdash;perhaps a new school, a library or community centre. We have had such temptations over the past 20 or 30 years, but refurbishing merely blunts poverty; it does not end it.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/8">The argument that I hope the Minister will take to the Department is that a real partnership could be established between the Department and the Government, the other social partners and the local authority. If all the money was pooled with the local authority's current spending and the profits, and then spent differently, there would be every chance that people's ambitions would be met and that we would see an end to poverty and deprivation.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/9">We could change people's lives. As it is, a few hundred houses in one ward were recently demolished. The tenants were given the choice of other council or social housing. If a scheme had been in place that had Government backing, the real alternative when knocking down those houses would have been to get a developer to build houses for sale and then give people the choice of continuing in a council house or going into home ownership for the first time. However, they were not given the choice.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/10">As the scheme rolls on, I fear that that is what will increasingly happen. We will see clearances and new houses built, but they will be priced out of the reach of local people. As a result, they will continue to live in social housing&mdash;pressure will continue to be placed on social housing&mdash;instead of having their entire lives changed.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/11">That might seem to be an exaggeration, but I shall explain two of the problems. The first is housing. The other day, Councillor Les Carter, who is in charge of housing, expressed the worry that even if he accepted my argument, he could not deal with the back-to-back properties that are to be found in great numbers in inner-city Leeds. Those were built not during the previous century, but in the century before, and were meant for working people who served in clothing factories and the like. Sadly, they are still being used to raise families. They have been refurbished time and again, but they should have disappeared. Trendy architects like to put great exteriors on them, but they have no gardens and are on crowded and dangerous streets. They are certainly not the place to bring up a family in the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/12">How do we deal with that problem? Should we demolish them? How do we move people, and how do we give them a choice of properties? The large council estates in Leeds were built in the 1920s. They were very welcome then, because they replaced slum homes in the city centre. The estates were seen as a great improvement&mdash;and they were&mdash;but they are now 70 years old. Knowing the aspirations of today's young people, it is not where they see their future. For them, it is not progress, but we have so much of that type of housing. With so much social housing, my constituency is unbalanced in terms of housing tenure. That is very good electorally, of course, but it is not so good for the individuals concerned. When that feeds through to schools, police time and social services, we have a troubled area, with all the services competing for resources, and education is a particular concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/13">My point is the way in which we approach the problem. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is exceedingly generous with money when we want to refurbish council houses. That is an expensive job, as they have been up for more than 60 years. But if we want to use some of the money to persuade people to have an equity share in their own house&mdash;it may be half of what the Minister is planning to spend on refurbishing council houses&mdash;we are told that the money is in a box for decent homes and is not available for another use.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/14">I hope that the Minister can understand the argument. I would love to see the Department sit down with Leeds city council, pool the money and ask whether its objective is to keep all the social housing in my patch or to give people the opportunity to move out. People are sitting on equity in their council homes, even if they have not purchased them. The scheme that we have worked on to allow them to take that equity and make a private house affordable seems a wonderful way forward. However, it needs the help of the Department and for it to be flexible about how the money is spent. That seems almost impossible. However, I want discussions on that to start.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/15">The Government can build all the houses we need and want on the land that is cleared. They can say that they are available to everybody in East Leeds, but pricewise they will not be. I have dealt with one aspect of prices, but it is no use a couple going into a house unless they are working and have the income to keep it. That just leads to tears. The cycles of deprivation that have gone on for 30 or 40 years mean that there are still constantly high levels of unemployment in my constituency. The Government are needed. There is no sign of their involvement in the council's scheme, and I am not criticising the council for that. The council needs the Government as a partner.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/16">We need a targeted system to help people to get skills and jobs so that they can take up the opportunities, which will be available. It will be bad for morale and will make some people angry if they see people moving into the new houses when they cannot. If we are about property and people, we should want to bring the colleges, the learning and skills council, Yorkshire Forward and each of the social partners together to devise programmes that get people appropriate skills and help them to find jobs in the booming economy. If we cannot do so in Leeds, I am not sure that we can do it anywhere else, but if we do not do so in Leeds, that will bring questions to the Minister and me.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/17">There is a need for partnership and proper involvement, and there is a desperate need for co-ordination. Other Departments are involved: the Department of Health, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Education and Skills. The Government need to participate as an active partner. The co-ordinating Department must have the confidence and the ability to liaise with other Departments. One Department will not solve the problem; we need many Departments to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/18">We need partnership and co-ordination, but above all we need money. I am talking not about fresh money, but about the money we already have. That money should be freely given to be pooled, by agreement, for all the social partners and the residents to go into the areas that best trigger the move towards our objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/19">Sometimes Departments come to the table and say, &quot;We are all in favour of participating and we'll put our money in, but we'll decide what it is spent on. As long as it is spent on something that relates to our budget and our Department, we're happy.&quot; A real partnership, real joined-up thinking and working to meet objectives mean putting the money on the table, seeing what the budget is and seeing which areas, if the money is spent on them, will move us towards the objectives sooner. That would be a proper partnership and a real move towards meeting the objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/20">Some political input is desperately needed. There are problems. Leeds city council has to be convinced that the Government are willing to have a partnership, to share an ambition and even to raise ambitions for the council. That requires some political involvement. It would be useful to involve the three MPs whose constituencies are in the regeneration area&mdash;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1570" name="Colin Burgon">the Member for Elmet (Colin Burgon)</phrase>, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1669" name="Hilary Benn">the Member for Leeds, Central (Hilary Benn)</phrase> and myself. We should be involved and consulted. Will the Minister request a meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning so that we can agree objectives and start a dialogue that gets us moving towards the objectives?</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/21">For 30 years, I have seen council money and Government money spent on inner-city poverty. Despite all the national statistics, my area remains desolate. Spending money on individual initiatives, individual schemes, community centres&mdash;this, that and the other&mdash;merely dulls poverty; it does not abolish it. If we are putting money in, I hope that the Minister and the Department have the same ambition and vision as I do. We have been putting the money in for 30 years. As Hillary Clinton says, people are mad if they continue to put money in, do the same thing and expect different results. After 30 years, we are continuing to put money in the same areas, apparently for the same objectives, and we are surprised that nothing has happened. We have to do things differently.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/22">I hope that, in the brief time available, I have given some ideas on how to do things differently, but I would welcome some enthusiasm from the Department for a partnership to end inner-city poverty in Leeds.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/westminhall/2006-04-26a.323.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1765" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister"  colnum="323"  time="016:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm060426/halltext/60426h05.htm#60426h05_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.323.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/1670" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds, East (Mr. Mudie)</phrase> on initiating the debate. I shall return at the end of my contribution to his three principal points, which were about flexibility, joined-up partnership arrangements and a meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning. At that point, I shall outline what we have been trying to do, the partnerships that exist and what they are trying to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/2">The Government recognise the description given by my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East: the area includes a number of communities that continue to face problems of deep-rooted deprivation and disadvantage, despite significant neighbourhood renewal investment over a number of years. I note that he paid tribute to the past Labour leader of the council and to the present Conservative Councillors Carter and Carter&mdash;that sounds like the title of a Michael Caine movie. I am sure that they appreciate his expertise and support in trying to achieve their shared objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/3">The Government are determined to help to tackle the problems of our most disadvantaged communities. In 2005, we announced a further &pound;1.3 billion package of assistance to help local authorities and their partners to narrow the performance gap between those areas and the rest of England by addressing the six neighbourhood renewal themes of crime and antisocial behaviour, education, housing, liveability, health inequalities and worklessness. Those are the exact issues that my hon. Friend said plague parts of his constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/4">The funding package comprises a &pound;1.05 billion neighbourhood renewal fund, spread over two years, and a &pound;265 million safer and stronger communities fund. From the national funding package for England, Leeds city council district will receive &pound;27 million neighbourhood renewal funding in 2006&ndash;07 and nearly &pound;15 million in 2007&ndash;08; &pound;4,798,800 neighbourhood element funding between 2006 and 2010 to support the development of neighbourhood management in areas that contain some of the highest levels of deprivation; &pound;2.1 million cleaner, safer, greener communities funding to deliver physical improvements to local public spaces; and &pound;319,000 for community empowerment network funding for 2006&ndash;07 to support the strategic role of the voluntary community sector as a key partner in the local strategic partnership. A significant proportion of the funding will be applied by the local strategic partnership, Leeds Initiative, to support regeneration in the East Leeds area, and it should prove valuable in levering in other resources to the area, including European funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/5">I am aware that considerable investment is planned for the development of an East Leeds link road to provide a strategic 4.5 km dual carriageway link, incorporating a high occupancy vehicle and heavy goods vehicle lane, between the Leeds inner ring road and the M1. That new road will create direct access from the M1 to the Aire valley employment area&mdash;a 400 hectare regeneration site of potential development land to the south-east of Leeds, which is already home to 400 businesses and 15,000 jobs. The construction of the East Leeds link road will enable a further 180 hectares of land to be developed creating up to 29,000 jobs</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/6">My hon. Friend will be aware that the Government's &quot;Homes For All&quot; five-year strategy set out the potential of mixed communities to transform persistently deprived areas of the UK. Quality and well designed housing, offering a mix of housing types and tenures attractive to a wider range of households, is critical to developing the long-term sustainability of communities. I note in particular my hon. Friend's comments about some of the oldest properties not being suitable for refurbishment, and the Deputy Prime Minister is regularly criticised by some who have not examined the pathfinder policy, for example. The only way forward is to demolish certain properties, but that is not at the expense of refurbishing appropriate ones. The Department has adopted a flexible approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/7">As my hon. Friend knows, East Leeds is currently characterised by a predominance of social housing, as he described, which is mainly composed of council stock. The area is seen as unattractive to new households, despite relatively low house prices in the private sector compared with other areas of Leeds. Leeds city council established the east and south-east Leeds regeneration scheme to deliver a better housing mix. That initiative involves a ground-breaking public-private sector partnership aiming to transform East Leeds over the next 15 to 20 years, without additional public sector resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/8">The council's use of its land assets will generate more than &pound;1 billion private sector leverage, delivering around 5,000 new homes. If successful, Leeds city council will consider rolling out their mixed communities initiative to other parts of the city. EASEL will create mixed-tenure neighbourhoods that are attractive to a wider range of households and ensure that proposals for each site are tailored to their market characteristics so that the long-term prospects of the area will be realised through market-led renewal. It will also include improvements to the design, fabric and management of the neighbourhood environment;promote the use of sensitive local lettings policies, which enable social landlords to create a better mix in communities, helping to address intense concentrations of deprivation; promote effective housing and neighbourhood management approaches to tackle deprivation; and link changes with action to reduce worklessness, poor educational performance and skills, crime and poor health.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/9">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has designated three areas as demonstration projects to test and share best practice in delivering the mixed communities policy. In Leeds, phase 1 of the EASEL initiative&mdash;for the Gipton area&mdash;has been designated as one of these demonstration projects, and work on clearing sites in Gipton for new homes is almost complete. The support of the people of Leeds, specifically the tenants and residents of East Leeds, is critical to the success of EASEL, something that my hon. Friend emphasised in his excellent contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/10">Leeds Initiative, Leeds city council and the East Leeds District Partnership are delivering ongoing consultation on the future of East Leeds, for example through the East Leeds District Partnership strategy and through the area action plan for East Leeds as part of the local development framework. That consultation has to date revealed broad support for the EASEL initiative, including phase 1 in Gipton. The LDF consultation is specifically seeking the views of East Leeds residents on options for the future of the area. The East Leeds District Partnership and Leeds East Homes arm's length management organisation have strong tenant and resident involvement at board level.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/11">The area's retention of its existing communities is vital to the success of EASEL. Again, that point was central to my hon. Friend's contribution. Those communities have formed the fabric and history of the area over generations. Work to establish the future housing needs and aspirations of the community is under way. For example, consultation in Gipton identified high levels of ownership aspiration among council tenants. Housing market research for Gipton and Seacroft is also planned, as is a wider housing market assessment of the East Leeds area. That work will inform future plans and strategies, so that future housing mix policies deliver the long-term aspirations of existing communities in East Leeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/12">In terms of the more immediate needs of tenants and residents in clearance areas, Leeds East Homes ALMO has put in place a dedicated support team that is visiting tenants and residents to support them in choosing their immediate housing options. A range of options for tenants and residents is now in place to enable them to remain in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/13">A recent review of Leeds city council's allocations policy has strengthened support for council tenants in clearance areas. Under the Leeds choice-based letting scheme, they are now placed in the highest priority banding, giving them equal preference to others in greatest housing need. Direct lettings policies are in place, and ALMOs will also have the option of ring-fencing some properties for clearance households. Work with registered social landlords has also resulted in some tenants taking up opportunities to move to RSL rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/14">The ability of existing communities to remain in the area is of course dependent on affordable housing provision&mdash;rented and for sale&mdash;and appropriate packages to ensure that those wishing to purchase a home can do so. Local planning policies require that 15 per cent. of new housing in the EASEL area is affordable. That policy will be reviewed on an ongoing basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/15">In EASEL terms, there is an early example of that policy in the phase 1 Gipton area. Leeds city council has agreed a local home-buy low-cost home ownership scheme in Gipton, so that residents who have had their homes cleared and cannot afford to buy one of the new homes in the area can purchase up to 50 per cent. of a new property, with the council owning the remaining percentage under shared equity. The scheme is funded from land sale receipts, and it guarantees affordable housing for future generations. That kind of policy will be built upon to deliver affordable housing as future phases of EASEL are delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/16">I am pleased that Leeds city council is working closely with the ODPM and key regional partners such as Yorkshire Forward and English Partnerships to bring together housing and renewal strategies that make a lasting impact on the communities of East Leeds. My hon. Friend requested a meeting with my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning to discuss those matters and flexibility. As a result of previous discussions with him, I have spoken to my hon. Friend and she is more than happy to facilitate the meeting as requested.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/17">Local area agreements are very much about what my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, East describes as important in a partnership: co-ordination, and real partnership between Departments, those involved regionally, the local authority, and local tenants and residents, to ensure that we have the flexibility and prioritisation that local areas need.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/18">I acknowledge the strong lead that my hon. Friend takes in promoting community regeneration. I applaud his determination to continue to improve the East Leeds area for all people who live and work there.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/19" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.0/20" class="indent">Adjourned accordingly at one minute to Five o'clock.</p>
